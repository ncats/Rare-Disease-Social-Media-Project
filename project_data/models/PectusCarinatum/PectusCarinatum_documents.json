["Does it get worse with age? Has anyone else noticed their untreated PC gets worse and more noticeable with age? I put on some mass and went through a couple years without it being too bad but I am starting to notice it again and feel like it is getting worse. Does the abnormal cartilage continue to grow even when your bones have stopped growing? No that cannot happen, or would be extremely rare at least. Maybe you have lost muscle or fat? \n\nYou can get increasingly back pain as the cartilage stiffens with age though. Yes it can happen, my pectus only really started getting worse after I turned 20 and 3 years later it is still getting worse. Really? Never read anything about it getting worse after one have stopped growing. Interesting. Sadly that is the case with me. And there is nothing I can do about it. Cannot even get surgery before it stops growing They do surgery on growing kids, would not it be great to do it on you while it is still growing? Means it is pliable. The thing is that it would probably continue growing after surgery and then it would have been for nothing. At least that is what some docs said. And I have heard here that people have gotten surgeries twice. I want to avoid that", "Bone or Bone bruise? I try to wear my brace most of the time, however last week i went to a party without my brace and when i got back home i realized that a completely new bone grew in the span of 4 hours. It feels hard like bone and is as big as an airsoft pellet and hurts really bad. When i put my brace on for an extended time and take it off i cannot feel the bone there anymore and i am really confused.", "Getting brace tomorrow I am getting my brace tomorrow, any tips? Wear it", "Can you guys answer me some questions 1st. How would you guys rate the pain/hassle that the brace gave you along the months that you wore it. Did it hurt at the beggining? Was it easy after x months? What month was it the easiest?\n\n2. How can you sleep at night with the brace? Every time I try  i wake up with it loosened, like I subconciously took it out while sleeping. Is there any tricks you guys used to sleep with it? \n\nThanks to everyone who answers these questions", "Does someone who you are blood related to also have PC? Polls are fun\n\n(", "Girls? Hey guys, do girls actually care about pectus carinatum? Like if they would see it, would they freak out and never like me again? Depends on person. Some girls do not like six packs other girls do. Some girls are open minded some are not. The people who let things like that get in the way of connecting with you are not meant to be in your life bro. I have PC &amp; I have a beautiful GF I have been with for 5 years she loves my chest even tho I barely do.. my ex however said Ew the first time she saw it lol. Do not over think it bro, Just always have good energy &amp; that is all that will ever matter. \ud83d\udcaf   I am kind of old (32), but it is never been an issue for me.  I was always self-conscious when younger, I would try to hide it from potential dates.  But I am also pretty conventionally attractive, or at least was (I am married now).  I got a lot of attention form girls who either could not tell I had it or did not care.  It never seemed to deter any girls who I slept with, I have never been turned down (like, I have always had the opportunity to have sex a second time or more if I wanted).  So this is all to say, it does not seem to have been a problem for me in the way that you are worrying about it.\n\nThere may be some girls who have a problem with it, but either I have never tried to hook up with one or...well I guess that is the only possibility.  It might have bothered some girls, but never enough to not have sex with me, and never enough for them to even say anything about it.  I have been in LTRs pretty consistently since I was 20, sexually active since 16.  Many say \"I would not have noticed if you hand't said anything\".  I am never sure I believed that - I think I would call mine a 'moderate' case - but I do believe that girls who I had only had sex with a few times, when it is relatively dark, and they had not seen me often/ever in full light, it is possible they just did not notice.  They might have just been sparing my feelings, though, who knows.\n\nSo, to be fair, I am pretty good looking otherwise.  But you will probably select for girls who do not care much about PC (a lot of girls do not, it is really not as a big a deal as we make it out to be, and girls tend to be a little better at over-looking the physical, imo).  Also, beyond your youth, you will eventually realize you are better off with girls for whom this is not a deal-breaker anyway.  I mean it is sort of a catch-22; you will never find out how caring a girl who cares about PC is, cause they will not date you for long, but my guess is they are far poorer girlfriends than a girl/woman who can look past it.\n\nWork on your personality, improve your body in the ways you can if that is important to you, try not to worry about your PC (impossible I know), and you will find someone great who could not care less.  Please try to believe that.\n\nEDIT:  PS, I know you did not ask about sex.  You might even be \"too young\" to have it.  I am talking mostly about that because as most of us are, I was always self-conscious.  Did not like taking my shirt off in front of girls when i was younger.  So most of them did not see my PC until we had sex or something like it.  Plus, it is probably a good indicator of whether or not a girl is disgusted with your body (if she will have sex with you).  And hey, ultimately, it that what we are after anyway, most of the time? Agree 100%, read my comment if you want to hear a little more of basically the same.  It is almost a \"blessing\", girls will self-select for the ones who are nice, maybe?  I am not going to call girls who are grossed out by PC shallow, everyone has their tastes, but if you cannot look past something which - really in the scheme of possible physical differences - is pretty minor, maybe you are shallow? Thanks alot for that reply! You made my day better brother. I think it does not matter what they think, it is more important for you to feel comfortable with yourself. No. I am a girl with slight PC but growing up it was a lot more noticeable. All of my friends would notice it when we were swimming or something. Anyway one of my friends started dating a guy who was super nervous to take his shirt off around her - when he eventually did, and revealed his own PC - she was like, \"Hey! 'psychobutton' has the same thing!\" \n\nAnyway it may depend on the girl - if they freak out they are not worth your time. But I doubt anyone would have that negative of a reaction! Facts No. At least I havent had any issues with girls and PC.", "At the beach with my pigeon chest! Enjoy life, guys! You can just as much as anyone else!  You have two options:  live your life or limit it by avoiding the beach, walking with a bad posture, wearing baggy clothing, etc.  The first option will result in quite a bit more happiness, and you WILL feel more confident in yourself.  The second option will make you feel like shit, will make you feel insecure and possibly even depressed.\n\nSo it is your choice at the end of the day.  Do you want to be happy with yourself?  Then simply accept yourself the way you are.  Do you want to be miserable?  Then continue rejecting and hating yourself.  It really is that simple.\n\nI recommend living your life, guys.  You will have a much better time and your life will be a lot easier. I enjoy my life, but I am still going to fix it if not with brace then with surgery \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Great post.\n\nI chose the second option from ages 14 - 23. Trying my best to live the first option now. it really does not disturb me at all too Oh trust me i chose the second option, too.  I chose it for 8 years.  I hated myself.  Never went to the beach, never took my shirt off in public, constantly abused myself because i thought i was ugly and worthless and no one would ever like me.\n\nBut you know what?  I woke up one day a few months ago and i thought, why not just accept myself?  I will be so much happier if i do.  And so ever since i HAVE been wearing tighter shirts that DO show my chest protruding out, i HAVE been going to the beach as you can see.  And i have been happy and content with myself!  Everyone here can do the same (if they dont have troublesome physiological problems due to the condition, of course). I would just like to warn you about the surgery, then.  Because there are MANY surgeons who only care about the money they get from the operations, and couldnt care less if your chest is fucked up after you get the surgery.  I honestly dont know much about the nuss, but i highly discourage you from getting the ravitch or even modified ravitch procedure.  Your chest will be pressed down during the procedure and the end result will be a very rigid chest after surgery.  Basically, you will have the chest of an 80 or 90 year old man.  So if you dont want that i would not get the surgery.  For cosmetic reasons it is just not worth it.  Once again, idk about the nuss procedure, but your chest will be quite rigid if you get anything ravitch.  \n\nThe brace, though, is a pretty safe option.  The surgery...not so much.", "Need some answers Hey folks. Im 14 (since may) and i am suffering from severe pectus carinatum. Im considering a brace but hoping im not too late? I dont know when your chest wall becomes too hard to move but the problem is my parents dont really care. They just have the: its nothing or it will go away on its own attitude. I feel pretty depressed since its really bugging me and if they keep not caring it may not be fixable in the future. How long do you think i have before an operation is necessary? Hi,\n\n14 certainly not too old. Bracing will likely be a suitable solution for you at your age. I am currently 24 and am towards the end of my brace treatment which appears to be going very well. It takes a lot of dedication but you can achieve the result you will want, especially at your age. Speak to Sam at London Orthotics in Kingston Thanks man. Living in norway right now but will find a solution 16 currently. Just started recently. Never too late Bracing definitely can still work for you, but the only way to be sure is to find a good doctor that specializes in pc who can evaluate the hardness of your chest.", "Am i too late for a brace? I am just recently turned 14 and have already hit my growth spurt at 13, i am currently around 6\u20192/3. My chest is still flexible but not as flexible as before. Thanks!

You are not late at all good time go for it No I got mine at 16 How long did you have to wear it, and did your chest become like a normal persons chest would after, or were there still noticeable effects?", "Surgery Hi, I am a 19 y/o female who will probably undergo surgery for Pectus Carinatum this year. I was wondering if anyone here has experience with surgery, as I am very scared for the procedure. Also, I am afraid that the scar will be big and very easy to see. I am very happy that I can be helped with my Pectus, but so so so afraid it will turn out bad or not like I expected. Does anybody here know something about the pain level of the surgery and the scar that it will leave?\n\n(English is not my native language btw so sorry if there are any grammar mistakes) I am 22 y/o male and have just undergone the modified ravitch procedure 10 days ago to correct PC.\n\nI was quite envious myself literally all the way until they put me under.\n\nI have a vertical scare, around 5 inches in length, between each pec muscle. Hopefully in time it will lighten and should become barely noticeable.\n\nI was in a lot of pain for the second and third day following the surgery, but that was only because I was throwing up every time I was not given Morphine, so they took me off it and I did not have any pain meds for those two days. It was literally the worst two days to date. After which when they found meds I could keep down I was not and still are not in any pain, just general discomfort.\n\nLet me know if there is anything else you want to ask :) Hey, \nI would love to have a chat and get to know your story, I am a 20 year old female with pc can you email me please at  I have not been able to find anyone that feels the way I do :/ The doctors say they cannot help me so I feel so alone with this  Thanks for responding!\n\nI am the most scared for the epidural (idk if it is the correct word I just google translated it), because the thought of a needle going in between my spine really freaks me out. Did you have to do that?\n\nAlso, I would like to know about the days after the surgery. Did you have to stay in bed at the hospital the whole week without moving, or was it possible after a few days to get out of the bed with help? Did you get a catheter? And how are you feeling now, 2 weeks after the surgery?  I have sent an email!  I did not have an epidural.\n\nJust after the surgery you will not really know what is going on. I know I was not on the ward but you will be in and out of sleep so you will not even notice, or feel anything. For the first day/6 hours you have to lay flat. But it is not a problem since you will be asleep for most of the first day anyway.\n\nI was in hospital for 6 days. I was out of bed on the second day. I did need help getting in and out of bed as it was quite... uncomfortable. I was walking around by the third day, and getting in and out of bed by myself by the fourth/fifth.\n\nI had a wash in the sink on the second or third day. I did need a little help but it is nothing to be embarrassed about. The nurse only helped me clean my upper body. I was able to manage most else.\n\nI was close to needing a catheter, they bought all the stuff to do one on the second day. I refused at first and asked for a little more time to pee naturally. luckily I did after a few attempts :)\n\nI was quite nervous of the thought of depending on others, but it was not as bad as I imagined. Two weeks in and I am feeling OK. I am completely independent and I would not call it pain, just general discomfort at this stage. I still cannot stretch my arms above my head fully, or lift anything heavier then a plate without pain. You are welcome to DM me an email or something and you can ask as many questions as you want. you can msg me if you want to, It is been a year now since. have you had surgery for pc? Hi, did you end up having the surgery? I had PC surgery and it is worse off than before. I would be very careful in your decision. Ask your doctor lots of questions and if you have nay questions for me I would be happy to answer.\n No I have not had the surgery yet. I will probably do it in the summer holiday so I do not get behind with school. This way I also do not have to tell a lot of people that I have to do the surgery, because I am quite ashamed of telling it. \n\nWhat do you mean with that it is worse than before? Did it leave a big scar behind or is it still not like it should be? And when did you have the surgery?", "Abramson (Reverse Nuss) procedure tomorrow! I (20F) will get the Abramson procedure tomorrow after waiting for 3 years! I am excited but also very scared because of the pain I will have. Will probably post updates here if you guys are interested in it. Good luck. Does that include a insertion of a bar? Thank you! And yes, I will have a bar over the chest area for about 3 years.  Ive never tried with a bar, but my college did. It can be painfull. Good advice is to have someone to help you get out of bed in the mornings, when you get home or practice getting out of bed using your legs. I am definitely interested in updates. Good luck! Good luck! You will do great! Thanks for the advice! Until now I am not in a lot of pain, but I think this will come when they reduce the medication. Because I still have an epidural with painmedication in my back I am not allowed to get out of bed. When I am allowed I will get someone to help me. Thanks! \ud83d\ude01 Thank you! I have posted an update \ud83d\ude0a I am so glad it went well and that you are not in a lot of pain!    Yeah it will I come. \n\nI lived by myself in a flat when i got surgery. Kind of scary the first couple of nights because its hard to move around much. And you have to lay on the back and sleep all night. But i went through it and so will you. :-) Hi! Curious how severe your pc was? I am 24 with somewhat mild asymmetrical pc and I have tried bracing and it just does not work or fit in with lifestyle so I am interested in the Abramson surgery.  Where did you get yours? Did your insurance cover it? How long was the process before you get the surgery? Was it mostly for cosmetic reasons to get it done? Sorry lots of questions :) but I am so curious as its rare for us girls to have pc and also to get the surgery! Glad yours went so smoothly!! Hey! :) It is no problem I would love to answer all your questions. It really is rare for girls and you cannot find that much about it online.\n\nI had moderate asymmetrical pc. I got my surgery at UZA in Belgium. I was lucky enough that my insurance covered it, because I live in The Netherlands and I did not expect them to cover a surgery abroad. My original plan was to get the surgery in Amsterdam but I was put on a waiting list for about 3 years there. I decided I did not want to wait any longer and searched for other options, and that is when I found the hospital in Belgium. My first appointment was in September, and I had the surgery in December so it was not really a long process.\n\nIt was purely for cosmetic reasons, I just felt so extremely uncomfortable with my pc. I was super self-conscious about it and it is just so much better now after the surgery. Even though it is not 100% fixed I really feel so much more comfortable now with myself. I would really recommend the surgery, but you do need to have enough time to recover. It took me about 2-3 months before I could work fulltime again so you really have to think about if that is possible for you.\n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to ask! Wow congrats on it all!! That sounds like it all went so smoothly.  How are your scars/ stitches? There are two on either side of your ribs, right? Who did your surgery? After 2-3 months how is your mobility? Are you able to exercise?", "How serious is my PC? Should I get a brace?  Yes but try to workout first and see how it helps you Depends on your age? 18 Yes. From what I have researched, the younger you use the brace the better. \n\nI am 37 now with PC ...never got around to using a brace. I would use it  if I was a young 18 again. Thx \ud83d\ude01 Oh that is refreshing to hear! Btw would you say my PC is mild? And how long do you think I would have to wear it for?\nThank you in advance not a big fan of giving opinions on PC.

You got to show multiple angles", "Is it far too late to begin bracing?  I was first diagnosed when I was 14 and the GP said that there were no treatments to fix my Pectus Carinatum...... other then breaking my sternum to fix it? no other recommendations, referrals to specialist or anything. Fast forward a few years later now I am 19 and it turns out from various google searches and there were treatments especially bracing from that time period.....\n\nIt annoy's me that the options were there but completely disregarded, would there still be a chance for myself to receive PC bracing. I understand that it would of needed to be done around 13 - 16 years of age but I have read some success stories from those 18 - 25 where bracing still worked due to a flexible sternum or something like that? /u/Bazil42069, I have found an error in your post:\n\n &gt; \u201cthat it would~~of~~  needed\u201d\n\nIn your post, you, Bazil42069, meant to use \u201cthat it would~~of~~  needed\u201d instead. \u2018Of\u2019 is not a verb like \u2018have\u2019 is.\n\n ^(This is an automated bot.

You can check out my progress with the brace. I started it when I was 18 years and 2 months old. It all depends if your chest is flexible, I think you can surely fix it to a xertain extent, but maybe even full.\n\nHere is my post: \n\nIt is 5 months into bracing. My treatment ends in February 2021. The progress is very close to what you can see on the picture because my brace gives fast results, but you have to keep wearing it so PC does not come back. Thanks for the response, when you mean \"keep wearing it\", you suggesting its a semi-permanent thing I will have to do for my entire life. Something similar to wearing a teeth retainer to keep your teeth straight (after braces). No, by keep wearing it I meant you have to wear for some months even after the final results are there to make them permanent. That makes more sense now, I appreciate your comments although even though it would make sense to do bracing, the system is not developed in Australia and of such unfortunately I dont qualify for a brace even if my PC is asymmetrical, very mild and no pain. My GP is looking at speaking to a specialist he knows about plastic surgery? / implants which was something I specifically said I did not want. \n\nThey made it seem like the brace was a tool they did not want to do at all cost :| I am using a brace and I am 22 yrs old, Its been 15 days since I start using it That Is great mate, at least you got the support you needed to fix your PC. Unfortunately for me the GP I have seen says bracing would not work for me even though it would... and is probing the idea of pec implants which does not help at all and if so make it look worse.

So happy there is a group for this. I was diagnosed in elementary school and years of being called \u201cuniboob\u201d until I hit puberty got to my head. My parents chose not to brace me and I am too old (and I just do not have time for bracing). I would say I have a mild/moderate case - since I grew my own boobs it is not super noticeable but here and there people still notice that I never have cleavage even though I have boobs (lmfao). I also work out which helped a lot with proportions, but I still always wish I was more comfortable braless and in different bikinis! I have avoided certain tops my whole life because of this and I am sick of being so self conscious about it. \n\nHave any women tried to fix it with breast implants?

Just pull through the rashes, but it could mean you need your brace re adjusted. I started off wearing it slowly then progressively wearing it more and more until I wore it through the night.

But then I had a mentality that this needs to be done because I do not want to look at that stupid bone sticking out of my chest. And I wrote reasons why I need to wear my brace to help push myself and it worked. I have been wearing it for 19 months 24/7 and I am probably going to see my doctor soon and I will probably switch to only wearing it nightly. The results are so worth it! Best of luck goes out to you! Can you expand more on the pain you experienced in the beginning? Was it hurting your skin or your bone? How did you get past this phase? It was more of like an uncomfortable pain that my body did not like when I was sitting or laying down. Then my bone was bruising which is normal but that did not cause any pain. My brace would cause friction and cause it to be a rash that hurt a little. But I started wearing it over a tshirt and it helped so much better with the rash. My side still had that rash again because I needed re adjusting so it is helped the red rash go away on my sides. I just pushed through it with talking it off then putting it on like every hour. Then I started wearing it all day and at night it hurt and felt terrible so I took it off and put it back on in the morning. I would say I started wearing it fully in a week and the uncomfortable feeling went away in about 1 month. Now I am so used to it. I forget that I am even wearing it sometimes. Also I have a pretty high pain tolerance so it depends on what you have. But I did not use anything except for a rash cream and lotion. Just got to tell yourself it will get better it will not always feel this way.", "Will working out help?  I first noticed my chest a few years back. I asked my family doctor he said it is nothing to worry about and that it will go back to normal. Fast forward a few years my chest is worse so I go see chiropractor she tells me there is nothing she can do to fix it basically. A month or two later I get an x-ray and go see a physiotherapist. Turns out I have minor scoliosis and he tells me the same thing that it is unfixable. I start to do my own research and find out about the brace. I showed the chiropractor a link about pc and the brace. She explains that she does not believe the brace would work. \n\nShe says that if I start to work out and build up my muscles that my chest will go back to normal. I just wanted to know if working out would even help me or if a chest brace is better.\n\nHer reasoning for not believing in the brace is because she thinks after the chest goes back to normal from using the brace that it will just protrude out again after because the body relies on the brace for support. Is that true?\n\nThank you for any help Brace will indeed help as long as your under 19 (works best at ages 13-16)  and has great results but I hated my brace and it made me feel awful having something pushing over me at all time so I did resort to working out and trying to bulk which now after doing it seriously for like 4 months is going great and I feel much better. plus my pectus is very similar to yours (one sided) if that helps . surgery is expensive and has a massive painful recovery time and not reccomened by a lot of people here and most pectus doctors. \n\nBulking will cover it by muscle but not fix the bone structure so if you stop working out it will be the same. ask any question you want bro Okay look youre 15 you absolutely NEED to get on a brace program. I would personally look into Pectus Joe (based in the US) or London Orthotics (based in U.K.). The brace is the absolute best option for you hands down. Take it from a 25 (turning 26) year old who has been in your shoes and tried to brace at 21 and it worked but I stopped using it so lost my gains, and now I am going to give it another go. Just a larger point to others reading this, your age does not matter AT ALL in terms of whether the brace will work, it ONLY matters how flexible your chest is. I am 26 but have the flexibility of a 15 year old and will be bracing with the London Orthotics team starting this fall. \n\nDo not let yourself get older and look back and seriously regret not taking action. Yes bulking may help, but the brace is the only thing that will actually CURE your pectus condition. Surgery can too but that is ALWAYS a last option. \n\nDo not listen to the docs who told you the brace will not work cus they do not know shit. It DOES work. Especially at your age. \n\nI strongly strongly encourage you to brace if this is something you seriously want to change. At your young age the chest is still growing so the brace will most likely work! In my experience normal doctors dont really have any knowledge in this field, mainly because pc often comes with no direct health issues, so they often play it down by telling you \u201ejust put on a bit of muscle\u201c but I can tell you from my own expierience that putting on muscles doesnt change the bone structure and can at most make it a bit less noticeable.\nIf it really bothers you then you should go and see a specialist, for example Joe from pectusservices.com, they can measure the flexibility of your chest and tell you if the brace will work. They can also answer all your questions and concerns you might have so its worth giving it a shot.

You can be 30 and have a more flexible chest than a 16 year old and the brace therefore works better on the 30 year old. This is just a fact and it is annoying to see everyone constantly saying \u201coh it only works if you are under 18\u201d or whatever. Again, age is not the factor here it is flexibility of the chest. Period. Well yea that might be true but when you look at numbers most people have flexible chestes at those ages my brother has pectus as well and hes 20 and his chest is rock solid... Also I dont know how so many people here deal with the brace It made me more depressed than before I even knew a brace existed I felt trapped in a cage all day Yeah it is a proxy for flexibility but not a definitive factor itself. Yeah the brace sucks ass I agree. But right now with lockdown and work from home it is perfect for all of us thinking of bracing since we can just stay home and not worry about going outside with it as much Definitely recommend a brace. Building the muscles hides it. But as you got more growth spurts the chest tends to stick out more.

Do not worry about it, a girl once asked me what is wrong with my chest in front of others, I did not know what to say, it was so awkward. I said \"nothing is wrong\", and walked off.\n\nI do not know how old you are, but school kids can be pretty ruthless, they will find anything just to laugh at you, could even be your name or something so mediocre.\n\nI got laughed at school too, I am 31yo now, do not care anymore.

They said It is not bad enough to justify surgery. I have very sharp pain on the bottom right where it flares. when I run and it makes it hard to exercise. I used to run track in high school but now I do not run at all because it is too uncomfortable. Also, it just looks so bad. Since it would be cosmetic, insurance would not cover anything so I cannot afford to get nuss done. Should I see a different specialist?\n Insurance will not cover it for cosmetic reasons, but if it is causing you pain and interfering with your day to day activities, that is another story. I would talk to the specialist about your options. I do not know if you are too old for them to consider bracing you. I follow this subreddit because my son has Pectus Excavatum.  I do not know if it makes you feel any better, but a person who did not know about Pectus probably would not even realize that your chest and ribs had formed any different than anyone else's.

It does not matter what other people think. I always got \u201cit is not that bad\u201d. But it bothers me. If it bothers you try to get a brace or surgery. Your biggest obstacle will probably be your insurance and getting authorizations and referrals. I was never able to cross that hurdle mainly due to lack of information when I was younger. I just got the trulife brace which was around $200 not the best but no other choice. We will see how it goes. Just started this week. Also try contacting specialist they may be able to help you overcome insurance and auth hurdles. But the younger the better for the brace. How old are you now? The other poster is right in that it only matters what you think about it. But, if you want my opinion, I think it is mild-moderate (4 or 5ish). 35 Why does it have to be \"bad\"? 14 I just wanted to say I have pectus excavatum which is the opposite.

I made one for myself and cost me less than 50 uds Is it working? Too early to make conclusions yet, but seems good It is worth it. Only get one from a specialist.

If you are going to work out, of course workout how other people do. Push-pull-leg splits are ideal with a correct diet. I never believed in focusing on something, if you workout , you will notice a difference. Are you skinny? Its worse when you are really thin. After I put on the amount of weight to go from skinny -&gt; normal it became way less visible. I have mild case, but focus on progressing in dips when torso is slightly forward tilted (weighted if possible, these built my pecs way more than other pressing movements)\n\nOther exercises: bb bench press, i dont do abs separetely coz squats and dl's alone destroys my abs for days.

The brace is still an option for you. Being slightly older can mean that the overall treatment is longer, but as long as you are dealing with cartilage treatment should be possible.\n\nWe determine the amount of force required to push in the defect before having the brace constructed, so an evaluation by specialist is definitely worth it. I just wanted to know where I can buy a brace I know there are various options for braces that you can get over the internet, but I do not know how effective they are. In clinic we measure the pressure required to push back the defect, and use that to have a custom brace fitted. I believe the brands we use are called True life and Dynamic Compression System.

My arms and legs grew longer to compensate for my spine. My ribs and my hipbones (which are quite wide) literally touch, while most people have a few inches of midsection that I do not. The effect of pectus and my abnormally short torso is... so strange. Wide hips, no abs and from the side tiny little arms and shoulders next to this forward ribcage.\n\nI am sorry to sound so negative but this has affected me quite a lot over my life and I feel I have missed out on a lot of fun at the beach and etc. I feel others with pectus can probably relate. I also have to wear long baggy shirts to feel comfortable and wish I could wear a lot of clothes that I just cannot pull off.\n\nI guess what I am asking here is - other than looking into surgery which I am doing, do you guys think that hitting the gym hard enough (chest, shoulders, arms, abs and back) would be enough to offset my proportions, or am I kind of just screwed? My best friend is about the same height as me and about 20kg heavier, he has a lot more body fat than me, BUT because he has a nice long torso, a flat sternum and no flared ribs he actually looks 10 times better. He even looks good and strong with a gut. It just feels a bit unfair. Pics ( (I believe it looks a lot worse IRL too) From what I can see you may also have a mild kyphosis. A slight curve on the back. Although I could be wrong. ))Which Is associated with pectus and can be fixed eith excersise or good posture.\n\nThe hips- I have the same thing. I think there is ac actual name for the issue. Nothing bad. But if you want it to look better there are exercises.\n\nAnd ik what it is like. Not taking shirt off. Getting comments. Or st beaches not taking off. If you want surgery you can. But put some research into it first-\n\nBuilding muscle will hide it. It wont cure it. So if you lost muscle it would show again. As you are I would say extremely too late to start bracing. I would say the only route out of you dont want to excersise is surgery. Kyphosis - probably a little bit mildly. I think the rib hip thing is either \"costo-iliac impingement syndrome\" or \"iliocostalis syndrome\" - I do feel them touch if I twist around but no pain as of yet - i just worry for when I eventually age and my spine starts compressing cause there is kind of nowhere for things to go (but we will cross that bridge when we get there).\n\nI do want to exercise my way out of this, I just get a bit discouraged knowing I will have to maintain a higher level of fitness than people with proper growth and am sometimes unsure if it really pays off.

Thank you though. :) By the way would you say curved spine is associated with pectus inherently, or do we have a tendancy to slouch on purpose to hide it? I know for me I definitely slouch a bit on purpose because standing with good posture makes it \"stick out\" lol Ofc we do. My specialist told me the same. We slouch to hide it.

I hang out with my friends less and avoid social gatherings Because of how uncomfortable I feel.

Feel free to ask any questions. Yeah, how long (and painful) is the recovery, and how is the scar? I was lucky in that I was pretty much recovered in about a month. The hardest part by far of the recovery was the first week, but that is to be expected. I was out of the hospital and home 3 days after the surgery. My scar was very small and faded within a year. It is nonexistent now. Really? I heard from other people its a 10 cm scar and the recovery is 6 months. What kind of surgery did you get?

The deformity itself probably can not disappear with any exercise, but that does not mean that you should not exercise. But, you can get a better loung capacity, that is for sure. \n\nMost people with PC do not have any problems that are not cosmetics.

Now for the second part.\n\nAfter speaking with the consultant, 3 months on there wasnt a big difference since I had the brace you high and when I was sleeping it moved up and it didnt push the chest flat. So he told me to move the brace down to focus in the lower part of the lump part. I have seen a great improvement.\n\nI have been slacking. As exercise helps speed up the chest flexibility and getting the chest flatter I have not been doing it as much. They told me to do it everyday which is a struggle.

I have noticed it is improving. It is starting to look flatter.\n\nI was given extra padding (like a foam material) for the brace simply because it did cut my back. I had it tight so I would get really dark and red cuts or just rashes and its very uncomfortable. After getting the extra padding I can barely feel the brace. It feels so good.\n\nNow, as my chest is quite flexible they predict I should have the brace off by spring next year since mine is moderately bad. Which in all honesty isnt bad. It could have been earlier but again I did drop it due to college and yeah I felt uncomfortable wearing it to places. \nI think the chest has gone bit solid but is still very very flexible.\n\nMy advice to people starting bracing is\n\n-take it easy, your chest will get used to it, I was ready to quick but I was very determination and did stay with the program.\n\n-dont tighten too much after you get used to it. It can seriously be uncomfortable.\n\nJust know, get the brace instead of a surgery and get the brace ASAP since you may regret it in later life! Thanks for the update! Are you finding that quarantine is helping you stay motivated due to not having to be around others as much? Yes, and my lessons for the most part are taken online anyways so I have soo much time. That is great. I am about to start mine soon but lowkey scared for the struggle but I know it is just temporary for a permanent change Yeah I was really scared aswell, in going to be honest. It is very uncomfortable. But! You will get used to it. What I did was wear it loose so I can get used to it for 2 weeks.Then I would tighten it and sleep with it. \n\nAdvice.

I was referred to a heart doctor to see if I have it. What country are you from? Remember if you u have a marfanoid body; it is not a diseases. Most people 90% with marfanoid habituate (Who looks like marfan) do not have it I am from Georgia. I saw the doctor too. He was cardiologist and told me that I do not have  marfan, from my  appearance. He told to my parents that it was just my imagination. But I am very skinny and have cainatum and scoliosis. Also, I do not have any heart/aortic disease. Maybe it is just my appearance. If doctor says that it is more likely to be nothing. My little brother is from Georgia as well. I am Armenian. I do not know if you mean Georgia USA or the actual country Georgia. If you do not have anything with the heart, any problems then you are completely fine and probably do not have MFS. You maybe have a Marfanoid habitus. That means you look like one, but do not have it. It is normal.  I am also EXTREMELY skinny. My wrists look like something you easily can brake. I have thinner wrists then woman\u2019s. I am also really underweight, but my dad was as well. I am getting tested because I have some of the symptoms. Just like you. Take care and do not think about it too much. I have had health anxiety for 2 years now.. And if you want to talk I am down! Just text me or something if you feel really bad I mean Georgia actual county, near Armenia. I had low self esteem and   health anxiety  because of my  appearance, earlier. But now I do not care it as much. But sometimes I feel bad and want to talk with somebody (especially with similar condition as mine).  It would be interesting to talk with you :) Your English is pretty good compared to that you are a Georgian. I live In Europe at the moment. How old are you? And yeah I would be happy to talk.

I have spoken to my parents and been to the doctors and now have another appointment- I want to have a brace but at the same time it is going to be very visible through a t shirt aswell and it will be embarrassing if someone touches it and realises I have got a big metal brace on. really want to go out but too insecure of my Pectus which is affecting my social life a lot-any suggestions/advice cus I am feeling pretty depressing thank you :-) you need to figure out what you value more\n\nlook at it like this, no brace, pectus remains unchanged forever, however you do not need to wear a big metal thing.\n\nbrace, temporary visibility when wearing, and you feel a one sided embrassment from people who probably do not even give a fuck!\n\nI am 20 now, never had a brace, overcame any confidence issues I had when I realised that no one really cares, but obviously the conditions intensity varies, mine is not like a block so I was always grateful. Went on the Beach yesterday with my class.

In the past year my pectus has grown so much it is too fucking visible. It only started getting bad after I turned 20, so now I am 22 and a brace is not possible anymore :(\nAnyway I recommend you take the brace, even if you feel insecure with it, in the end it will make the pectus go away. So its totally worth it! Yeah true maybe I am just an over thinker- thank you Can you only get the brace whilst your still growing then? thank you though I will definitely try to get one Yup, I got to stop thinking what others think so much- thank you Yeah up until 18 you can get it. I have been to multiple doctors and they have said it would not do anything for me. I am in the exact same boat dude. I am sixteen and have it on the right side of my chest. I just got my brace but it is very visible through my shirt. I have decided that I am not going to wear it out and only when I am at home and sleeping. I could get over 12 hours a day and I think it will correct it a little. I think we have to realize that people do not care about our chests being pointy, and that it is probably way less noticeable than we think. Yeah true, I have just finished school for a few months so I am probs just going to stay in for a while so no one will see then when school starts back up I will probs just where it in the night 21 here and I totally agree, got a brace wore it for a week thought to myself \u201cam I doing this because I feel bad about my chest or because I am worried about what other people think about my chest\u201d. Put the brace down for good and just let my body be itself, most people do not care enough to notice and the only ones that ever will probably love you enough to not mind at all.

I am just thinking that maybe if I have pectus carinatum my lungs might have grown with it and then if I wear a brace and my pectus is flattened could it constrict my lungs cause they had grown to be bigger to fit the pectus and now they do not have room in my rib cage, also same question for my heart. Also sorry for posting twice so soon I am not trying to be annoying. Wearing my brace right now. You can have it off for like 8 hours a day and it does not really constrict my breathing. Just take it off while you do strenuous activities Brace makes your ribcage a bit wider in exchange to the dimension of your chest that you are squishing down. At least, that is what I noticed on my chest. There should be no problems. Ok thank you. That was a helpful answer.", "19M  Never let your pectus hold you back, swim with your shirt off and live shame free. People will respect you for it. It could always be worse friends.

You have never walked a day in my shoes and have no right to judge my pain based on my appearance. I am not sure if you noticed, but this guy is ripped. His Pectus looked way worse when he was not ripped, that is 100% true. Dude i did not judge, and i did not know u suffer from pain because usually pectus carinatum cause no physical pain Chad I do not know how old you are, but when you are 17-20 your cartilage will begin to fuse together, and this is rather painful when you do chest focused exercise. I recommend everyone who can brace does, I will be seeing the doctor soon to see if I may still wear a brace. I have high hopes as my sternum is till rather flexible.", "Advice on getting a diagnosis? (suffering from incompetent doctors) Can anyone give me advice on how to get a Pectus Carinatum diagnosis. Every doctor I go to says that it is not severe or that I do not have pectus. I have gave some pictures with contrasts, but I can not see how a doctor can not see what is wrong enough to give a diagnosis. All I want is a diagnosis so I can get a brace (preferably) or surgery to fix this, it is very problematic and a blockade to good self esteem for me. Advice? Telehealth, or some other route? I feel like it is ultimately down to they just do not like me, or they want me to suffer because they know of pectus carinatum, but still do not give diagnoses. It is incredibly stupid and cruel to me, does not make sense. All you do is look at it, know it is not normal and make a judgement that includes potential relief for the patient. Our lives could be so much easier and happier if they would go ahead, diagnose, and then give the options for bracing or surgery.\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n( You do not need a diagnosis if you go to a specialist straight away. Ordinary doctors are often too incompetent to do their job and lead you to a specialist. Most of them just say stuff that they absolutely do not know. Do I need to see a thoracic surgeon? Or what kind of specialist? I live in Alabama, maybe in a large city there will be educated specialists but where I live unlikely. Besides COVID I HATE traveling long distances, but it will be worth it. Honestly, idk. I am from Serbia so where doctors know to diagnose you, but there are no treatment options at all, and they never mention that there are in other countries. I literally contacted an American brace maker who visits Europe ocassionaly and met him in Poland. It was risky as hell, but I had to do it like that. Go on Facebook, there are helpful groups and people will surely tell you who to visit. There are many specialist doctors in those groups as well and they know a lot of them who are not there. They will be able to help, especially because you are American. I am going to be honest here, I am only a little worse than you and a brace did not do much for me. The doctors told me that my best bet would be to gain some muscle (I am a woman so it is difficult). And as you gain muscle it will pull the bones and cartilage into a more natural state. Theres lots of men on this sub that have had success with using weight lifting to alter their profile.", "Sometimes when i am streching i can hear the bones in my ribcage pop or shift slightly, sometimes this causes prolonged pain sometimes it does not cause any pain is this normal? I do not believe so. You should get scans to see if you have severe pectus. My chest actually pops from time to time. Nothing serious, at least in my case. i did get a scan, they said it was not too bad If that is the case maybe you should invest in a brace. Unless your bones have matured still in my early teens so i doubt it", "After I have been wearing my brace for a couple of hours it starts to hurt and I struggle to gain a consistent pattern with wearing it due to lack of motivation and the pain that it causes. I have seen results but I need to be wearing it a lot more to get it completely flat. Any tips?  build up to it. if it starts to hurt just take it off and try the next day to wear it for longer. it is going to be painful if you just start going the max amount of time if you do not build up to it I would follow your manufacturer's advice. It was painful initially for my son, and taking it off after hours also caused pain. He is 9 months out of the brace and did a slow weaning process and it has not come back. People used to notice it under shirts and he is a competitive swimmer and wanted to maintain a correct form. Try to remember that it really is not a long time in your life that you will have to wear it and you will likely be glad you got through it. Plus, remember there is only a short window in which your bones are flexible enough to be trained like that.", "Tightening the brace\u2026 Quick question, it sounds silly but I am not sure if it could work. Will tightening the brace more than usual mean I will have to wear it for less time per day? Like if I tighten it a few cm\u2019s more, could I wear it for a few hours less or something\u2026? Usually, the pain and discomfort that comes with overtightening the brace give you a few minute's worths of \"extra\" time. Not worth it. Follow your doctor's recommendations. That is what I thought and then I made a wound on my back because the friction was too much for my skin to handle. Worst mistake I could ever make. I would say stick to whatever is the most you can bare without any pain", "This honestly made me chuckle ", "Brace How long did it take to see any improvements from using a brace? And how long do you typically wear it? I was 18 when I got mine and so I had to have a rough chest massage to soften the cartilage. Because of this, I had to wear the brace 24/7 for the first week. Could not take it off. Went back a week later and got it adjusted. Since then I can take it off for like 30 mins a day.

If so what is the estimated price? And can I order one on my own or do I need a specialist? \n\nIf I cannot, how bad is the surgery? As in how painful, how long to recover and how long does it take for the scar to heal until I can get back to normal? Also if you paid for it how much. Thanks! I am pretty sure it just depends on how flexible it is for a brace to work Is there a way for me to check on my own? What is enough? I think if you can push it down with your hands the brace might work but go doctors they will confirm Yeah try pushing it down on your own. Also you can schedule free online consultations with multiple brace consultants and they will let you know if you are a candidate. You likely are given your age The brace depends on wether or not your chest cartilage has ossified yet which usually happens after puberty and would need to be fitted by a professional, I think mine cost around $250 for the brace itself. The surgery would be significantly more expensive but may be covered by insurance and consists of breaking the cartilage surround the sternum then inserting a metal bar into your chest which is fixed to your ribs and stays in your body for around a year until you go back in for another surgery to get it removed. Having the metal bar in your chest for a year after surgery will definitely inhibit you somewhat and recovery will be significantly long so just weigh your options. I got the brace, used it twice and never picked it up again, did not get the surgery and just have come to terms with my chest. Honestly if you are leaning towards the brace and think it would work PM me and I could probably just ship you my unused one, I think they are universal and only need a few professional adjustments. Do you live in the USA? If not, you can get the brace for free.\n\nThe bracelet does not hurt that much, you just have to get used to it. Depends, but a brace probably still can work. Cannot gurantee though. I started my treatment at 18 years and 2 months old and it worked perfectly. Glad it worked for you.

Another question, I do mma sports meaning I will not be able to have to brace on 24/7, what is the recommended hours I wear the brace The doctor who makes the brace will be better to answer this than me.\n\nThe first month after you start you will want as much as possible. Best is 24 hours.\n\nBut it will be 100% okay to remove the brace for a short period of time during your MMA training if needed. In the beginning the brace will put a lot of pressure in the chest, but after some time it will mostly make sure it will not regress.\n\nBut it is also very good to do exercise with the brace on. Like going to the gym and doing chest and back exercise. Alright thank you man! Very worried the doctor will say no to the brace tho. :/ I do not know where you are from. But it is a very bad doctor if he says no.\n\nIt is 10000% better to wear a brace now, than to go through surgery later.\n\nIf he say no and your family have the money I would look into other (private) choices. It is a good investment in your future and if you were my kid I would work double shift to get you a brace. \n\nJust looking at your chest I can tell bracing is a great option and you will have a very normal looking chest after. Means a lot man! Thank you! My dad has the money in hand in ready, we are prepared for high prices. My dad do not think he will say no but I am just stressing over it lol!

Two supporting my ribs underneath and one pressing down.\n\nAlthough my ribcage seems to have become to rigid and the doctor could not compress it enough.\n\nPain is awful for like 1-2 weeks after surgery. But I would recommend you to get a Ravitch with a surgeon who knows the operation well. It is suppose to be less painful.\n\nIs your deformity severe and or assymetric? It is pretty symmetric just pronounced.. probably 3 to 4 inches from where my sternum should be I think you should go see a doctor.   \n\n\nI think you could get great result with surgery, although 3 - 4 inches in quite severe.   \n\n\nMy PC was only about 30 mm (just over 1 inch).

Are you sure about that? I did not think it caused me any troubles either, but it sure did. PC being only a cosmetic defect is pure BS. There is been some recent studies about it and it is clear it is affecting more than the general conception. Most research been done on PE because PC is not as usual. \n\nIf you have lived with it all live it is your \"normal\" and it is hard to fathom how you \"should\" feel. \n\nI paid both my surgeries out of pocket so I feel your brother.

Dr Mark Stovroff based in Atlanta.. He recommended the ravitch procedure because it only requires one operation.. I also have kyphosis.. only real problems that I know of are occasional shortness of breath and chest pains which are both part of having pc.. went through a stress test and echo with cardiologist and a ct scan prior to surgery.. got all the way to surgery date to find out that my insurance denied my claim.. really fucked me up cause I was excited to put it behind me.. it just sucks man.. having this has completely ruined how I feel about myself.. Also tried the Mayo Clinic but they are out of network and wanted $5,000 for a consult Yeah I think Ravitch would better to because of your age and quite severe protrusion. He seem like a good doctor!  \n\n\nSucks you got denied. Can you not file an appeal or something? Not sure how US-system works since we have public healthcare here. But I also got denied because of \"it is not that bad\". So I paid from pocket.  \n\n\nBut I heard it is much more expensive in the US. In EU it is usually around 30k USD for an operation. I know how it feels. But I am sure you will figure it out somehow! Our healthcare system is jacked.. my wife is currently going through treatment for leukemia and for a one month stay she racked up 1mil in bills.. appreciate the insight and support.. I will figure it out eventually.. may be worth the trip to Europe 1 million USD for 1 month of treatment? Yeah that is fucked up for sure. No way the actual cost was anywhere near that.

I tried loosening it to be bearable but then I think it is too loose because it moves off the actual bump when I lay down or sit down. Is this normal or should I tell my parents Completely normal. Do not loosen it, keep it as right as the doctor said. When you lie down, your body gets flatter due to gravity so the brace feels more loose.

Actually yea I will later", "i was considering getting a brace I am 6'4, 17 and have pectus carinatum on my left side. It sticks about two pencils in width, maybe 3 and although I go gym as of recent, I am still quite skinny and have noticed that although muscle gain will help, it will still be pronounced. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI play basketball quite heavily, a few times a week. I need to play every Friday to keep my mental in check otherwise I go insane with studying and all. If I were to go and grab a brace (live in Australia), would it be possible to keep playing basketball. I know that you have to wear the brace for 24 hours or 23 hours for the first few weeks, but I would want to keep at the 3 days a week at gym type thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny ideas if I can continue with these hobbies whilst using the brace?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks. I would not hesitate, I think after at most 3 months you should be able to get the brace off for a 3 or 4 hours, and the time  when you can get your brace off keeps getting bigger. Do not have any regrets in your life. But doing that would mean I lose a lot of progress in both basketball and the gym, and they are both my motivation to study hard (reward). I mean if you are going to be an NBA player or something like that than idk... It is up to you, maybe there are other bracing treatments. You have disregarded what I have said. Basketball and gym serves as motivation to do well in school and actually study hard. With those gone I will be completely out of it, burn out with study and have nothing to fallback on as a stress reliever. Thank you though, do not mean to come off as a dick. You can 100% take the brace off for hours in a day. Some kids even just wear it to sleep and it still works. Do not overthink it. Oh fair enough, that is really good, thank you heaps! If you think the brace is going to affect your performance in school and basketball/training a lot, i wouldnt go through with the brace treatment.  Do not let some of the people on here make you think it is horrible to live with PC and that you are fucked in life if you dont fix it, you can live happily with PC.  I am doing it myself.  You will be fine. It is not that it will, it does not exaclty bother me. Mates and girlfriend do not care for it, but it is just something I would rather not have. I tend to avoid tank tops and such due to it. I am going gym now, but it will always be defined due to it being on one side and 2-3 pencil width in height. \nJust something I prefer not to have you feel? I mean i was just replying based off of what you said above, which is that you think you will lose a lot of progress with basketball and the gym which will (in your words) decrease your motivation in school.  If that means a lot to you and you think the brace will affect those areas of your life, then the brace probably isnt for you.  But it is your decision at the end of the day.  Do you want to make the sacrifice of wearing the brace?  The younger you are the better the treatment will be and it is definitely possible to achieve the chest you are looking for with the brace.  It sounds like you have got some more thinking to do.\n\nAnd btw, stay away from any surgical procedure not called the Nuss.  The ravitch or modified ravitch ones will leave your chest being rigid, pretty much like an old man, with an old man's lung capacity.  I would advise against it.  I learned that bit of information from Daniel Croitoru at the dartmouth hitchcock hospital. I am thinking of starting it in the 6 week holidays, I will be able to wear it daily for a while too. I definitely would not do surgery for it, definitely no where near bad enough to render surgery an option. \n\nThank you for the chat and all, now to find a doc to talk to about a brace and find where i can grab one.", "Too scared to tell my parents and my doctor that i have PC. I have been reading a lot of reddit posts here and i have seen people tell their parents that they have PC. I told my parents why is my bone sticking out and they told me it is fine!!! your still growing up!! And then the next day they completely forget about it. I am still a teenager but my PC is not as severe as some photos. Now let us talk about the doctors. I do not want to ask no one about this and you guys said that i need to go to the doctor but honestly I am not doing that. I would rather buy the brace online then go there. Who knows what they might say. Maybe they want to do a surgery that costs a lot of money and oh yeah i cannot tell my parents about these stuff because they will say it is normal and do not worry about it. All i want is to buy a brace online. Alright then i will find a way to tell my parents. 17 I do not want to hide it. Good choice. Tell them how much its bothering you. You definately want to tell them. One thing that you do not want is surgery so avoid it at any cost because there is a brace treatment that allows a less agressive approach (this is what you need to tell your parents if a surgery is offered to you). They also need to know how you feel, people do not notice Pectus that often if they do not have it themself, but to us it is a very painful experience. Also, there is a very high possibility that your doxtors dpn't even know to diagnose you, but do not let it ruin your plans, search for people who know. I got my brace in Poland, so if you are interested in details you can DM me.\n\nAlso, very important is that PC usually gets worse with age and growth. \"You are still growing\" is the worst thing a doctor can tell you. I have no idea what to tell my parents. They will just say it is not a big deal. I have to come up with a good conversation but how? You need to explain a few things.\n\n 1. PC is very rare and appears in 1/1500 humans, most doctors do not know anything about it and just push it on side saying it will go away. \n\n2. PC gets worse as you grow and age. \n\n3. It can be fixed pretty easy with a brace, but as you grow, bracing is slowly becoming harder anf harder. You do not have much time since you are 17, it is still a good age for a brace, but you do not want to waste time.\n\n4. PC causes serious mental issues and all you can think about is your chest. Your problem is very real and exists, it is not in your head, it actually exists. Your self picture is very bad and you want to fix it more than anything. It destroys the quality of life. \n\n5. I see that you really want to get rid of it. You will probably need money for the brace so if I was you I would tell my parents that I would return the money. It is definatelly worth it to work for a few months for that. I did it in Serbia where salaries (especially for teenagers and students) are very low, you should be able to do it in Germany (I just assume). It is definately somethimg that is worth it. It is not a useless IPhone or expensive clothes  or soemthing else that teenagers buy. It is for you and your self picture and it will have lifelong results. \n\n6. There are communities like this one that can confirm that a brace is a real way to get rid of it. It is not fake. \n\n7. PC is not a normal thing to have. It is not a birthmark or something else thst is completely normal. It is a real defect that actually can cause some issues like shortness of breath and small lung capacity. More lung capacity = longer and healthier life. \n\n8. You cannot get rid of it by exercising, you can only hide it and it does not always work the way people want to. \n\nI hope this helped. When I opened my soul to my parents I cried like a little bitch. It really was something that bothered me and the money I soent on the brace was the best momey I ever spent in my life. As I said, I got my brace in Poland and it was great. If you are interested in more details je lease DM me. Also, you just need to tell them. There is no other way, you can do it. Alright man thank you very much for the info. I found a way to tell them but i just have to wait for the right moment. Thanks again. Tell me how it went", "Help, I hate this I have had pectus carinatium for years now and I absolutely hate it, I want it gone but I cannot get a brace and working out with diet is not helping. Someone help, how do I get rid of it. It makes me so unhappy and insecure to the paint where I have stopped eating to prevent making myself look worse. 17(m) Why would eating make it look worse? You need to put mass on in the chest area and back to hide it. for this you need to eat and workout out. Not eating will make you slimmer and the pectus more visible. I have tried and built up a lot of muscle in my chest area, still super visible I have got it to the point where you cannot see it with my shirt of unless I am laying down but the only options to get rid of it are surgery or brace Is there a brace I can get online?", "Help please ", "Will you answer questions about your life with PC? I made a brief survey to gather data about Pectus Carinatum. After taking it, it lets you see how you compare to everyone else. Thank you and please share with others after you take it. Here it is guys: (\n\nGathering data is the first step to fixing any problem scientifically and effectively. There is very little data in the medical community about this condition and very little understanding of the serious impact it can have on people's lives. If your going to live the good life with this condition, you have to find the solutions for yourself because there is no one out there yet whose proposed a good solution because most doctors do not care enough. Being different is challenging because you look around you at your friends and family, and most of them DO NOT have this condition. You likely do not have a personal relationship with anyone that has this condition. Because you are alone IRL in this, it is hard to make sense of it. Why me? Why am I different? What IS this? and how can I move on with my life and live in a normal way without being negatively impacted by this condition? We need individuals in our lives who are similar to us to model after. These people help us make sense of ourselves and how we relate to the rest of the world. In the absence of that we find ourselves a bit confused and we seek stories of others with the same condition so we can finally put our own lives into context.\n\nthanks @ deadwalker2000 for being the first to fill it out. Really cool to get a glimpse into other people's lives with PC. I am THIRSTY for it! Smart Thanks I really appreciate this post. It could help many people. I know like 30 People with it Fr? IRL?

Please help! hi guys, so I have had PC since I was around 11 or 12. I asked my parents for years for me to see a doctor to get it fixed which after years they did. By the time I actually managed to get a Brace fitted I Was 17 years old. and over 6 ft. This basically meant my bones were so solid, it had such a small impact it was pointless. I have never forgiven my parent as if it was not for there slowness on getting me to a doctor I could have had the brace when I was much younger and had it fixed. Now im 22 with very bad PC. It is caused depression, anxiety etc. I work out. But unless I end up looking like the rock there really is no way to hide it. Decided I want surgery, does anyone have any idea how much this may cost?? I like In the uk and so obvs the NHS nearly everything is free. But apparently does nt cover this as it is cosmetic. Ridiculous, I know. Any help much appreciated. Thank you! Is it the one side of your chess that is raised ? \n\nI have been looking at surgery options for the ravitch from the UK your right it is not free on the NHS. You can get surgeons that will do it in on the NHS but you have to pay for the operation costs which is a lot cheaper then private. I have been quoted roughly 7k on the NHS and 12-15k privatey. Hey ..still u cn fix it with brace at this age ..i am 28 n using brace it immensly help me out. u/ryanz67 Yes that is right, pretty much just my left side of my chest. Thank you. 7k! that is so crazy! have you had surgery or anything too? It is a crazy amount. I do wish I knew about having it on the NHS before though always thought it was only private. \n\nI am waiting for my referral to have a consultation with a surgeon to see the option and get the final price. \n\nI have tried bracing and still wearing but I have not really noticed any results that programme cost \u00a32.5k. I am 24 though. You must have a a-lot of flexibility if the brace is working for you at the age of 28 It is crazy really, I got told they do not fund it because of it mainly being a cosmetic issue which is true but with the breathing issue and flared ribs and the mental strain I think it should be perhaps. I have struggled to find definite pricing for the surgery. Same! We were just spending so much money continuously for the brace and even after 6-8 months it just was not doing anything for me. Any idea how long recovery may be after surgery? I know the feeling it does annoy me for example why should people get free gastric band surgery when they have put themselves in the situation unlike us but I guess they do not see pectus surgery as an overall health risk to the nhs in the long run. \n\nYeah I was wearing the brace 23hrs a day not really any major results and it is not worth the pain tbh, bracing seems great for the younger age though. The fact you would have to wear the brace for a whole year too just is not worth it.\n\nI will let you know what the cost turns out to be, I have had a quick chat with the surgeon he is basically said he could make everything normal, would be a scar, requires 2 weeks isolation beforehand due to covid. 5 days in hospital and 4 weeks recovery. About 12 weeks until being able to work out in the gym.\n\nI have spoken to others and they have said after a week the pain level fine Yup ... I think you can consider receiving minimally invasive surgery by Professor Mustafa Y\u00fcksel in Turkey,\nHe is well known and very professional, and I think the cost should be less expensive considerably than UK.\nYou can check his Instagram account And see some of his patients photos there:\n\n", "Getting the Ravitch Procedure Hey everyone, \n\nHas anyone here had the ravitch procedure? Im thinking of finally pursuing treatment for my PC and I am probably too old for a brace. I have spent a long time trying to accept it and find mental peace, but honestly I do not think that is ever going to be possible. It just so disruptive in my life. Both in terms of the low esteem and the anxiety that comes with wondering if someone will draw attention to my chest but also in terms for physical discomfort. I am tired of the constant discomfort, like I can never get a  satisfying breath out. I am tired of the poor posture, back pain, and pain my chest itself. To be honest I cannot really imagine ever being truly happy and living with this what is your age? you should try for the reverse nuss. 22, and why? I want to get it too in the near future. Where are you getting it done? I have! Let me know if you have any questions! Overall are you glad you did it? How was the recovery? I had it done about 6 weeks ago pretty pleased with the results so far. Feel free to dm", "Cant tell if I have PC or something else? My 2 rib bones right under my collarbone are sticking out quite a bit, it is visible even when I am wearing a shirt. ", "Is this fixable 17 year old ?  Working out with emphasis on the chest will mask it. A brace will also fix it to some degree since it seems your pc is not as severe as most. You should get a brace asap, the more you push it off, the worse or developed it could get. A brace may not absolutely fix it, but it will look a lot better in your own eyes. Thank you so much for the help man \ud83e\udd1f People probably will not even notice it except for you because we all nitpick at everything about our body. I had my sternum sticking out of my chest and it almost made me commit suicide. Thank God I found out about bracing and now I am almost finished and it completely gone. It stuck out 3 inches 3 inches is 7.62 cm Oh really, so happy for you though it just shows there is always light at the end of the tunnel hopefully abit of muscle will even my pecks out abit and if not I will probs go down the surgery route as I have private healthcare  Frankly I did not even notice! If it bothers you personally, maybe you should keep considering treatment, but if you are only concerned about physique you totally should not even be concerned \ud83d\ude03\n\nEdit: Do keep working out that area and do consider a brace to keep it from having a large impact on you, and consider talking to your physician as well! Thanks so much for the kind words \ud83d\udc4dthink ima go down the fitness route and try to build muscle what do u think? I mean, I think some extra muscle would make pretty much anyone more confident haha", "I just need some second opinions on what to do Hey guys... I just do not know what to do about this anymore, I am 27M and have honestly struggled with PC for my entire adult life so far, basically wearing oversized baggy hoodies and sweaters 365 and being terrified any time any activity required not being able to wear a large sweater... swimming, work uniforms, going out to parties... it is just weird avoiding so many basic things because I do not feel comfortable in a t-shirt around people... I know I should kind of just get over it but it is hard to explain, it makes hugs feel wrong cause i am like stabbing them with my chest bone, it makes me feel so physically weird i do not even sleep without a t-shirt on, it is like a weird physical discomfort knowing a good section of your torso is a weird shape... i do not know if this makes sense\n\nI live in a relatively small country where there is only one person who offers surgery for this so if that is shady I have no options, since I am 27 I have no actual idea if i am way too late for bracing... I can push it in a bit but it does feel somewhat solid. \n\nRealistically is there anything I can actually do at this point before I feel like it is too late? Do I just go to the gym and try and hope that by some miracle getting in good enough shape could somehow be enough to offset it? I just want to wear a t-shirt in public without feeling uncomfortable one day :-( Acceptance. I am 20M, lived with pectus carniatum my entire life, used to be stressed about it before releasing no one really cares about it. Took my t shirt off the other day at the beach in front of my friends and I made a comment about my chest and they barely even acknowledged it and moved on. My girlfriend has really helped me learn to accept it and realise that it is not really a big deal. There is not really much you can do about it other than going to the gym, so just accepting it is the best option in my opinion. I would say some people are able to accept it but some are not and if it is bothering you this much maybe a consultation with a surgeon is warranted.  They can let you know what you might expect and give you an opinion on whether or not bracing is an option.  My son had the surgery 2 years ago.  He has had an issue because he has a connective tissue disorder and has to have another surgery to address that but that is not an issue that happens with a vast majority.  He does say that, even faced with needing another surgery, he is glad he had it done, the difference is amazing (his was extreme).  Maybe a consultation can help make your decision? I guess I am very interested in hearing from people who have had surgery how intense it was and what to expect\u2026 thanks for your response So the \u201cgym and hope for the best and work with whatever you have got\u201d thing? I mean that is the approach I used, I understand not everyone is able to accept it. But in my case, I have never found anyone to really care when I have told them/shown them my chest, a lot of it was just in my head. Finding an accepting partner is a huge boost too.\n\nGood luck mate.", ".

I am going to explain how it was and for any new people, what the process is like.\n\n\nDay 1 right after getting the brace fitted. The process was indeed tough!.\n\nI remember feeling the tightness and felt overwhelmed. It was unbearable! I remember having my first proper panic attack. I nearly fainted lol since I suffer from anxiety. I felt like giving up! But I had to keep going!\nOn day one I had worn it for 3 hours. My chest really didnt like the pressure so i had to keep it on for that amount of time. My specialist told me to not sleep with it yet.\n\nThey also gave me excersises to do to make the chest more flexible. These really help.\n\n2 weeks later: yes it was still quite tight. But I was really getting used to it. I did wear it for 10 hours, I did have a few breaks from the tightness. By this time I was ready to go slightly tighter.\n\nFast forward to 2 months later I can sleep with it. Sure, the first 3 days are hard and I gave up, but it is worth it after a while.\n\nFinally now, after taking my brace off my chest is flat,  it stays flat for hours but then eventually goes back up, I am noticing a real difference in my chest and posture. I am so glad of the progress I am making and I wear it for 24 hours.\n\nSo for new people who want to quit, keep pushing. Once you beat the pain and the thought few weeks. Trust me it gets better!. Congrats!!! I was actually notified from a friend that i should get a brace and I was recently considering it, although say you were sort of fit for instance, would you loose all of the muscle built up in the chest area if you were to undergo this process? Nope. Best to see a specialist they will put your mind at ease", "UK clinics?

Trulife brace purchased online for under 300$\n2. Custom made order at the office for 4000$\n\nWe chose the trulife brace only to find out it was huge on my petite kid. The nurse practitioner suggested we 'engineer' ways to make it fit, like stuffing the gaps with foam, etc.\nThe clinic says they will not let us use any other braces purchased elsewhere other than the 4000$ one from their office.\n\nAre there other options out there? It is good that the truelife brace did not fit him because I have one and they are very uncomfortable and painful from lack of padding and poor design. I would look into getting a tjoe brace. I have heard that they are very comfortable and they work really good. Another clinic in town offers this brace as an option.  \nFor my son's physique, this seems to have a flush fit and hopefully can be work under a t-shirt. I will definitely post any progress we have once we start on it. I highly recommend a T-Joe brace from Pectus Services. If you want good results a custom brace will be needed. Not sure where you live, but we had a custom brace made in Los Angeles area. It worked amazingly well, my son is 9 months out of bracing.

If you feel strongly about it, keep pushing and searching. Maybe even contact a specialist in another country and ask them for help finding a doctor who can help you closer to home? A good physiotherapist may be able to help with some of the pain, though, depending on the exact cause of it. Have you had an x-ray? A lot of doctors fail to see it in women/girls because breasts can mask it of make it look less severe. I know it is frustrating, and most doctors are clueless about it or think it is only a \"cosmetic problem,\" but I totally understand, and you are not alone!\n\nAlso, if any of the pain is caused by bras, I highly recommend checking out /r/aBraThatFits. It might take a little more experimentation than average to find something that is truly comfortable, but I am working on it, and it has already made a big difference. You can also bend underwires to better fit the shape of your chest, if that is relevant to you.\n\nI have decided (at least for now) not to get the surgery (mostly for cost reasons - I live in the US, and our healthcare costs are horrendous), but depending on how flexible your sternum still is, you might still be eligible for bracing?

On the site it lets you order it online which I love the idea of, and it is only around $500 vs $3,000 for  a t-joe. I wish so bad that I could order a T-joe online I feel like you can do T Joe remotely - have you talked to Joe about this option? I am sure he could ship you a brace and you do the check ins remotely Wearing it right now, actually. It is a good brace, way better than any of the standard ones you can get from Amazon. Yeah I actually messaged him personally and he said I have to go to one of the pectus locations because that is how they customize it for you I guess Is it comfortable? I am very tempted. Also if you do not mind me asking, how old are you? I am 18 but my bones are pretty pliable but I am worried that bracing might not work for me as I get older. I really wish I got a brace when I was younger It is as comfortable as a brace can be to be honest. I experimented with the Tru-Life brace on Amazon, it hurt like hell and is not worth it. Stay away from the Tru-Life brace, as it is not actually made for asymmetrical Pectus. \nI would definitely recommend the LA Pectus brace, though. \n\nI am 17, and will be 18 in a few months, so I would say go for it. Definitely do not wait if you are unsure. And I am the same way, I have known about the condition for like 4 years but never really bothered to try to get it fixed until now. Huge regrets.  good luck Shit man. You just gave me some hope. I am going to get the brace. My pectus is also asymmetrical as well, but my chest is reallly bad, like it sticks out maybe 3 inches and is shaped like a triangle. It is almost impossible to hide it, makes me extremely antisocial and anxious. How bad is yours? I am just worried that I might have to wear the brace for like 2 years cause of how bad it is, but if it works it is worth it Go for it bro, you got this. Mine is probably just as bad, and it is super noticeable. But do not worry about it. Focus on wearing the brace and getting it fixed. Do not be nervous or anxious about anything - Fuck what other people think.  DM me if you want to talk about it and let me know how it works Thank you man. I am glad I am not alone in this. I should really stop caring about it but I feel like it is out of my control how it makes me feel, if that makes sense. Wish I could just wear a fucking t shirt without looking like an alien creature lmao. Im going to send the pics in and see what they say. I was actually wearing the tru life Shit as typing this but I took that shit off cause i do not think it is doing anything. I will definitely message you if need be, thanks bro They scan your body and make a brace from how your pectus and body looks. That is why they are so good. \nYou said you are not able to drive but what about travel with train? \n\nI am 19 and just got a brace in Sweden. Had to travel from gothenburg to Stockholm with train. I have appointments with my doctor every 2 months so I have to travel 8 hours total. \n\nAnyways, good luck with fixing your PC. Hey im thinking of getting this brace. How long have you been wearing it and have you seen good results?", "Brace destroying skin I have just started bracing. It is been 1 week and it is tearing my skin worse everyday. Do you think I should stop and let my skin heal or carry on wearing it? a little irritation is okay but do not go so hard. \n\ni would let it heal and then put it on with lower pressure. Thanks. Does skin get use to it then I move up with the pressure? You have to be doing something wrong my brace did not tear my skin can you possibly take a photo of the brace man It tore my skin up a bunch. All I got to say is it is worth it in the end I had this happen to me too in fact still happening. Biggest thing that has helped me: Sudocrem and Baby powder. If you have any open wounds let them dry up and heal first (prob take brace off for this) then start applying sudocrem to help skin heal faster and then once you are ready to brace again put sudocrem on and then baby powder over that and then thin t shirt and then brace. This has literally changed the game for me and I am finally pushing through and my skin is holding up. Trust me I got set back like 3 months because of skin tearing up and it was very frustrating, but this cream and powder has really helped me. Not sure if it works for everyone but I know one other guy who had good success with sudocrem How did you get past the skin tears? Did you brace through it or let it heal or do something else? Yep My advice. Use a cream to reduce friction and put a layer of sponge on top of that. My skin broke on my back when I wore a brace. It was by far the worst part of the treatment. Do not let it completely break like mine did, it takes so much time for it to close and you will be in pain. You can also go easier and loosen the brace a bit. Powder made the pain worse when I had an open wound. I would rather go with Sudocrem only if the wound is opened, but it is up to OP. Yeah I did not put powder on open wound only on skin that is already healed Thanks for the advice  I think I am wearing to tight as I am not even wearing it in the night yet and it is completely messed up my skin.\nHere is what my brace looks like  Thanks for the advice. I was using lotion to try prevent it put it just keeped getting worse. Its broken now so I am going to let it heal then put it on a lower setting When it got rlly bad I lowered the pressure. But I think I used a cream and baby powder to make it better. I just remember it being painful regardless early on. But it definitely got easier as the weeks go on.

I am an 18 yo m, when I was about 13 I went to the doctor about my weirdly shaped chest and he told me I had PC, I used a brace for a year and it really did not work although I did not really use it because I was always so nervous around people and what they would think of me using a brace. I was always skinny and earlier last year I was 15 kg under weight. I am now just 5 kg under weight but I still really do not like my body especially my chest, with ribs poking out and a dent on my left ribs. I still have the brace lying around in my closet and I was wondering if I should give it another try. I thought maybe with this message some of you could maybe motivate me to do it. And also, hi I decided to join reddit and when I found this subreddit I felt happy to maybe tal to other people with the same condition. Either wear the brace, or start working out. Get a  brace, actually wear it, AND work out, eat a lot. I think I will start working out, also eating a lot. Thanks a lot btw I will start using it, I will eat more and do some exercise. I will maybe post after some months to show my progress. Yeah, you got to keep a good diet...Most people with pc are fairly skinny, so just eat a lot and workout as much as you can (abs and pecs are the most important) do this for +- 1 year, and you wont even notice it anymore :) wear the brace if you can but if you are going to do it make sure you are ready to wear it PROPERLY - meaning proper # of hours per day for a serious about of weeks and months and know how and when to wean off it. If you do not know how to regiment it properly it could end up being a big waste of time and effort. Just throwing that out there I will keep that in mind. Thanks Wear the brace. Working out will never hide your pc unless it is very very mild, symmetrical case. People who says otherwise do not know anything. I think I will start wearing the brace tomorrow, with the quarantine going on I think it will help me be focused on wearing it since I have no need t on care about other people\u2019s opinions.

Is it just me or does pectus carinatum give u a small chest? no matter how much i target my chest it never looks right I kind of think it does,im struggling with my bench press,while im getting better at my other lifts. I think it alters where your muscle attaches and that is all. You can still gain the same amount of money as everyone else. Money? muscle* I will give it 2/10, max 3/10 as I maybe do not have the beat idea just from those pictures. If it bothers you, try to get a brace. Work on ypur core and go hard on it.

It does not bother me, I have absolutely no respiratory problems or any problem at all. \n\nThanks!", "My brace is way too uncomfortable and painful to wear to school or more than 2 hours. I am unsure what to do. Should I just deal with it or wait until my next appointment to see what to do?  Well you got to isolate why it is uncomfortable first. Is it because you are tightening too tight? Is it because the brace itself maybe was not made well? Is it because it is just you getting used to it? I will say if it is the third then what you are experiencing is normal and it takes time to break in. You got to be strong if you want the result. But regardless you should speak to your provider about your concerns I agree with everything you said, I am going yhrough the adaptation period, it gets better everyday. It is going to be uncomfortable all the time... you either go through hell wearing the brace or get a very invasive surgery requiring months of recovery... or start building up some muscle! Sorry to be so blunt but it is harsh truth I remember the first day I had the brace I physically could not wear it for more than an hour due to the pain. I know it sucks but it gets better, the pectus itself becomes more flexible and the skin gets used to the pressure This is what people need to hear your best shot to make it unnoticeable is gaining some weight and making your chest big (trough working on out) Oh, the whole first day I had to keep it on haha Not necessarily, after the first few weeks/ month at most I had gotten very used to it", "Very strange, mines above the nipples Anyones similar?

I have had pretty severe PC, and it took about a month of wearing until the pain went away.\n\nOf course in the beginning it is troublesome putting it on and off but after a while you will have your own technique down. My doctor told me he finds it funny how everyone has their own technique of putting it on and off.\n\nWhat helped me to endure the pain in the beginning was to tell myself that either I am going through with this or nothing will change. Wearing it over a piece of clothing also helps, and even increases the pressure ever so slightly. Just make sure that the skin does not get too inflamed. If that happens, you have to stop wearing it all together until the skin is healed.\n\nEverything gets easier after the first few months, and it will pay off. You will see the progress and keep wearing it. I am very happy with the result. Have not worn it for 3 years now and it did not come back.\n\nHope I could help you, and if you need any more advice or help you can PM me. Thanks for this Hey so I am 14 with it and still growing after a year of wearing this would it just come back because I am still growing Use a cream to reduxe friction and a layer of sponge to prevent your skin from breaking. My skin broke and the pain was awful for months. My skin breaking was by far the worst part about bracing.\n\nYou get used to the brace, but please prevent yoir skin breaking, I could not get used to it. It healed thank God and I love the results. It is worth it in the end. I started at 14 too. The brace is really effective when you are still growing, and helps keep the sternum in check.\n\nI would say wear it until you are done growing plus some extra months. By the end you do not have to wear it as much. I wore it usually to sleep and took it off for the day when I was 16-17, then slowly reduced the nights when I wore it and stopped wearing it all together after I turned 17.\n\nKeep track of your growth though, we all grow at different rates.

So, i started the treatment for pectus carinatum, i saw some videos and one thing i saw was that the doctors of the video used a presure thingy to take measures of the t\u00f3rax. And the paper that came with the FMF is saying that all doctors should do that, but in my case my doctors only took measures around my body and didnt use the presure machine so, should i be worried? Pls tell me something.. No def not. My doctor took some random measurements as well but never quite used it bc he ordered a trulife brace anyway on the internet for me, wich dont rlly need specific measurements. We did some fitting but the measurements never really were a big deal in my situation and it is still very effective. So I would say do not worry, just wait for a bit and see what happens. Did your treatment work compleatly fine? I can not say on his trulife brace but for mine and most they are universal so it should not be too much of a issue but my doctor does bend the brace to fit my stockier build so I do not know if that will effect you it all if it feels fine and there is pressure on your peak then you should be good you just got to make sure the brace is centered Thanks!", "Does somebody knows what kind of brace i have, there are a lot of diff kinds, like the t joe brace, what kind is mine?

I am comfortable at this point bc I do not give a fuck anymore. I used to be ashamed back in high school when a girl would feel my protrusion. I have a rather prominent case. It took years of explanations to finally find a specialist that recognized it. I never followed through with the specialist and have kept it to this day. In my last 10 years (yes I have drank endlessly and done a bunch of drugs, and currently take a bunch of antidepressants (I have an inherent anxiety disorder)). But regardless, I learned not to give a fuck in regards to the chest wall deformity. From the darkness I learned how to love myself and forgive my deformities...although I still dwell in the dark realm. Just supremely confident and reluctantly accepting of my unnatural zyphoid calcification. Will post a pic, and suck in my tummy to show the full extent of the protrusion when I am keeping thin hey, i am currently in high school and the brace idea has caught my eye. The only reason stopping me is how i will be made fun of and shit, all the little things is what bothering me. I wish i could have your mindset brother, stay safe \ud83d\ude4c Hey man, if you get the brace and it corrects the protrusion you will not have to worry about it for the rest of your life. That omnipresent feeling of self-consciousness and adapting your behavior to hide a part of your body would go away. It took me a long time to get to the point where I started feeling more comfortable with my chest wall deformity....but to be honest it is still a factor. I occasionally think about getting the surgery bc I am too old and it is too solidified for me to use the brace anymore. I wish I had opted for the brace in early high school if I am being honest. It took me years of abusing drugs and alcohol (not an addict) to get me to the point where I am at now. Not that you could not get to the same place via a different path. You can live with it and eventually develop the confidence to not have it control your life, I am 29 now and as an adult it does not matter anywhere near as much. Obv you need to make a decision for yourself...if you did get the brace you could always lie and say you have Scoliosis or something like that, if it makes you feel better or easier to get by. But regardless you need to develop the confidence to understand it does not truly matter and there are a lot of ppl far worse off. It is overcome-able no matter which choice you make, and I promise you it gets easier as you get older, even if you do not choose the brace Yes man i understand what your saying, will this matter in 5 years in the future if i get the brace? Probably not. Thanks for opening my eyes a little! Haha I appreciate your comment and I imagine other women I have spent time with likely had similar thoughts about it. But for me, at least for a long time, and other people that suffer from it, the experience of ppl paying attention to it and wanting to feel it and requesting that others do just makes you feel deformed and causes deeply uncomfortable feelings. I adjusted my posture during high school and college so it would not be visible through my shirt. Like I said, I am more confident now but it took a psychological toll on me. Credit to you though for seeing it as a feature and not a deformity...or humiliating him or even thing too much about it \ud83d\ude42 Yeah, if I were you I would seriously consider getting the brace if it means it will solve the issue forever (ask the docs), but at the same time you can live with it and there is much less focus on it when you are a little older.

I have definitely seen some improvement with my pectus carinatum from wearing the brace but nothing I seem to do to help improve my posture is working.

CT at 10 months showed nothing alarming. Any tips or advice?  Picture 1: twin on the left - \nPicture 2: twin on the right - \nPicture 3: Today at 19 months old If your child is open to it when they reach the age of 10+ consult a chest wall specialist and consider getting a brace which only has to be worn for 1 year to correct the condition. Even without any treatment your child could live a healthy life, I have lived with PC my whole life and the physical effects of it are minimal compared to the anxiety over appearance. Okay. The surgeon who ordered and spoke with us about the CT results said that he is often seen boys and girls have different feelings about it regarding their appearance. He said that in his experience, a lot more boys are okay with it whereas girls tend to be far more self conscious most of the time. Given that the CT results showed nothing of concern, my primary worry is how it will affect her self esteem as a preteen/teenager. That is interesting because many of the doctors who have treated my Pectus Carinatum have told me that it tends to be much less of an issue for girls and frequently is not even visibly diagnosable in a grown woman because cleavage growth covers the protruding sternum to the point of a normal appearance. One of my past girlfriends also had Pectus Carinatum and she never really struggled with confidence issues in that regard because the condition was next to invisible and is much easier to conceal with clothing in regards to females. That being said as a male with it, confidence in the teenage years was a major struggle. I would wear baggy clothes to hide my chest, avoid swimming because I would have to take off my shirt, would freak out if any of my friends touched me on the chest, that kind of thing. If you have found a knowledgeable physician who has some experience treating PC then stick with them because there are probably less than 100 specialist in the entire US who know much about the condition. It is so exceedingly rare that most doctors you encounter will never have seen the condition and will have either briefly read about it in school or have never heard of it. I have been showed off to med students, had chest specialist google Pectus Carinatum in front of me during an appointment for my chest. Basically there is limited professional help for this very rare condition and most people with it will struggle physically (even if their organs are not in danger, your ribs being shaped this way does hurt and cause discomfort) and psychologically with this condition. There is no easy answer, the way a person feels about it changes with time and age but your daughter can lead a very happy and unhindered life despite this condition I promise. Thank you very much. Where would you suggest looking for a good specialist? You are very welcome, sadly Pectus Carinatum specialist do not exist because it is that is rare. However I would look for a \u201cChest Wall Deformity specialist\u201d because PC falls in the category of chest wall deformities. Okay. I keep trying to find more info but most of it seems to be for excavatum and it is frustrating. It is incredibly frustrating and it is because Pectus Excavatum is classified as \u201ccommon\u201d while Pectus Carinatum is classified as \u201cExtremely Rare\u201d. Not enough people in the world have Pectus Carinatum for the medical community to take much of an interest so this becomes a big problem for anyone struggling with it. I cannot tell you how much faith I have lost in the medical community from living with this condition, not a single one of my doctors has ever helped me with it in the least honestly. I can say that it is extremely hard to live with as a female. I have had severe anxiety because of my pectus and it is impacted so many aspects of my life since I was 12,  I am now 26. From a very young age I was aware that I would never look like other girls and never feel feminine. I am not saying it is not hard for men but it is extremely dismissive to think cleavage will cover it. I have just taken out a loan for $28,000 to have surgery. Because despite therapy I really was not coping with this deformity anymore. The Anesthetist said it was one of the worst cases he would ever seen. Even after a 4 hour surgery its not perfect or normal but I cannot believe the relief I feel when I hug my boyfriend or when I look down at myself now that I have had a lot of the excess cartilage removed. To the parents of the little girl I do not mean to worry you my case was severe. And I would not push surgery on to anyone. My mum decided the options available to us when I was younger were too invasive and decided to wait and I am glad that she did. I am fortunate to have found an excellent surgeon who has a team that he works with every time he treats a pectus patient. He has developed a minimally invasive surgery and hopefully the availability of this and or other methods becomes available to more people in the future.  After years of disappointment I cannot explain how I felt  when we found a doctor and a surgeon who validated what I was experiencing. No offense intended. I have lived with it for 25+ years as well, it is a struggle for everyone who has it. Sorry, I think it is what you said your doctor's had said that upset me because of all the doctor's I have seen through the years who have just dismissed it as a small cosmetic issue. I completely understand, I have had tons of doctors give me the \u201ccosmetic issues\u201d line which can be crushing to hear because it is definitely more than that. Congratulations on your successful surgery! What said about being able to hug your partner without feeling awkward or just look down at your chest and feel okay about it is a big goal of mine and I look up to you for having the courage to get the surgery. Thank you. I am still recovering but I am so glad I was able to get it done. Especially now that I have experienced  the impact this surgery can have it makes me sad that it is not funded or available to everyone. And that there is such a lack of understanding when dealing with healthcare providers. I hope that one day you find something that works for you. I am sorry if I came off as being rude. &gt;To the parents of the little girl I do not mean to worry you my case was severe. \n\nThe surgeon told me a story of a teenage girl whose surgery got covered by insurance because it caused her so much distress she attempted suicide, so believe me, you are not worrying me lol. Thank you very much for sharing your experience. My daughter also has an appointment with a geneticist for testing for EDS/Marfans in a few weeks.\n\nHow young were you when yours was noticed? I have read it tends to get more pronounced as a child grows, and as you can see hers was visible at 2 months old. That is heartbreaking to hear about that girl I am so glad she received funding.I cannot believe your daughter's pectus is so obvious at two months. I have asked my mum and she said she would have a look at baby photos of me. I will get back to you. I remember noticing my chest stuck out from when I was about 9 but did not think much of it. It was when I was 12 /13 when I noticed I was not developing like my peers and was teased about my \"bump\". At that age the Nuss or Ravitch  procedure was recommended but my mum was nervous about it and decided to wait. Later teens I was referred to get fitted for a brace but it caused me so much pain and I was told my bones were not flexible enough to brace. After that about 22 or 23 I was referred to a plastic surgeon who had developed a new procedure called Small Incision Sternoplasty and I was tested for any heart issues and Marfan's. After a few denied applications for funding and loans I was finally able to have this procedure in March. I have attached the link to his website because it shows what he has found with alternative treatments.\n\n[Pectus Excavatum and Carinatum\n\n]( Thank you very much!

I do not want my efforts to be overshadowed by this condition The PC part does look kind of mild but it is very hard to tell from these photos.\n\nThe issues seems to lie in your cartilage under your sternum. While it is fairly normal for PC patients to have similar issues, it is how much the sternum protrudes that decide how severe your pectus are (check out haller index for more info).\n\nNormal time frame for bracing is 1-2 years. Why in the fuck is there a bike in your restroom I got nowhere to store it dawg I had a very similiar case and I fixed it within 1 year with a brace.

You are only 14 which is very good, you probably will be able to do it, but it could last anywhere from 1 to 2 years seoending on which brace you get.

It is going to be a long road I got bracing at your age and my pectus was same like yours. I think it will work fine.

Also-if anyone has good upper ab exercises that would be tight  From this angle it is not very noticeable no.\n\nSadly to say there is no specific exercise for upper abs, you cannot really train a specific part of a muscle.  That is not exactly accurate.   While it is true that you cannot target area of fat to burn, you can target area of muscle to develop.  Your \"muscles\" are actually made up of different groups of fibers.  For example, what most people call the pec, is made of the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor. Another example is the tricep; named because the muscle has three heads that can each be the target is specific exercises.  Pectoralis major and minor can also be targeted with different exercises to accentuate the upper and lower chest.  Similarly, your abs are made of many different fiber groups including the internal oblique, external oblique, transverse abdominus, and rectus abdominus.  You can do different exercises to target specific areas of the abdominal muscles.  \n\nOP, do a Google search on exercises to target lower chest, upper abdominals, serratus muscles, and do not slack on your lats.  Improving your lats can make a nice balance and overall improvement in your upper body aesthetic. How old are you?

I just found this sub reddit and think this is a wonderful resource for all of us to come together and learn more about this condition and how to treat it, as there is not very much information online about this condition or many doctors that know very much about it. Anyways I just turned 17 years old and I am just starting to wear a pectus brace. Many say that at this age the brace is not always very effective, but I am a late bloomer and still in the middle of my growth spurt so I think the brace will work fine. Ill post my before picture soon enough. Good luck to you! I am 16 &amp; I am scared to start wearing it what r u scared of? thanks man! pain, embarrassment, discomfort, wasting time Good luck man I started when I was 16 and it did not work for me and I ended up getting surgery about 2 months ago I was worried about wearing it in public as-well, and a specialist told me to just wear it as much as I could and still feel confident, so I am just wearing it while at home during the warm months, and once it gets cold I will wear it under a sweatshirt everywhere I go, except for activities such as football and baseball. do you see any improvement even with limited usage? I have only been wearing it for a week, so not much yet, however the brace seems to be working as the doctor said it would, the first time I took the brace off,  my chest almost immediately went back to poking out, but now, only after a week, when I take it off, my chest will stay in for a little while before poking out again. seems too harsh to try Nope, not at all, does not hurt whatsoever now! Just the medal bars are freezing cold when you first put it on \ud83d\ude02 ah man it is just such a scary process to start I understand dude! It is scary ngl, but my doctor worked with me and I do not even have to wear mine to school, so I am happy with my decision, especially once it fixes it. hmm ill talk to my doctor in my physical. But last time we discussed it he said he would never heard of a brace of pectus They are definitely a thing for pectus carinatum, now if you have pectus excavatum it may not be. well my doctor is kind of old fashioned lol but I will see him soon, just kind of scared it is too late since I am 16 and a half", "5\u20199 and 17.

If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!) Anyone have any similar effects from wearing a pectus brace? Interesting. I have never worn a brace (and i am too old to try) but I have chronic constipation and digestion issues which I believe are strongly linked to my pectus issues. Perhaps restricting the movement of your thoracic cage (with the brace) is impacting the movement of your diaphragm and thus your digestion? I am not a medical professional so this is just speculation. Hope you get it sorted out Thanks for the response, and yea it impacts my diaphragm a bit I suppose because it has to be tight, but I was never told not to eat while wearing it. Strange. When I had my brace on. My stomach rumbled if I breathed in since I had to rib braces for rib flaring pectus caused. Never had ur issue. I recommend you speak to your brace specialist. It may not even be a brace issue and maybe something underlying.\n\nEither way, make sure your brace isnt really tight.\n\nWhat brace have you got? Hey man. I saw your post back a few months ago,( \n\nI am in the same boat where I think I have PC. The only experience I had with it was when I was young like 13-ish when my doctor had a look one time and said my chest would probably fill out. However even with it more fleshed out now, I am 21 now, it is still very noticeable especially with t-shirts and it is bothering me. I have breathing issues all my life as well as constipation and digestion issues like you said. So it could very well be linked. My question is have you learnt anything else since then? Any advice?

I am not sure if I suck at googling today but the descriptions were very vague as to the actual mechanics.  What I am saying is, do we have \"extra\" rib length that causes it to jut out, or is it normal length and just shaped weirdly?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am actually post-brace and its been years, but now I am curious if I have a wider rib cage than people if the brace pushed it back to normal shape. Good question I want an answer too I do not have time to search for the science, but we have normal length rib + cartilage.\n\nThey have looked into it and found that \"normal\" people had more bone and less cartilage **BUT** the total length of bone + cartilage was the same.\n\nSo it is normal length but shaped weirdly.

I am looking to start bracing.", "Update on doctor Ok I saw him again and asked about treatment for my pectins carinatum(sticks out 3.5cm) and he told me it will fix itself and that bracing never works and surgery is usually never used, I tried explaining to him how I have been doing research into possible treatments and he even said \u201cwow you have read up on this quite a lot\u201d. The problem is he still says that it will heal itself and this scares me because I know that the window of opportunity for bracing is closing FAST but he says all the medical info I have read is lies by people online and no one will listen to me because I did not go to university and become a doctor, I am 15 going on 16 and I want this gone it hurts and sticks out loads Sadly, I think your only option will be to find another doctor.  It might fix itself, my younger son\u2019s chest did flatten out by itself as he got older but my elder son\u2019s did not and he had the surgery.  Please do not give up, see if there is a different doctor you can see.  Is this doctor a thoracic surgeon? Exactly what my doctor said to me. Find a new doctor or specialist because he does not know what he is talking about. Bracing helps. I did not go with the brace and just embraced (ha get it) my chest. It is not as bad as other people's. When I wear a shirt it just looks like I got a big chest. The brace really hurt my back so I did not go with it. He is the only one in my state (not American and the state I live in is enormous) i would get multiple opinions no matter what. research doctors that specialize or have experience in PC/PE. i have seen three doctors and the first two fricked me up. I cannot he is the only one in my state (wa) 1. It will not fixitself, It can only get worse, but probably not. \n\n2. Brace works and is a way better and safer option than surgery. \n\n3. Your \"doctor\" is an idiot and should not be talking about a deformity that he obviously never even tried to fix on any patient.\n\n4. Find a new doctor or do it on your own and buy a treatment in a private clinic. I did it from Serbia where there is no doctors bruh. I had to travel to Poland. Do you realise how blessed you are? You live in US, the country with most treatment options for PC. Do not be lazy. I live in Western Australia I thought it was WA for Washington. Does not really matter, because Australia also has tons of options. There is 1 rheumatologist in my state that is for children I am unable to go anywhere else, I am underage and my parents do not listen Listen, I am really not trying to be rude. I am just telling you how it is in life. Noone will help you more than yourself.\n\nAs I said, I got a brace and I am from Serbia. There are no viable treatments in Serbia. But, I decided to do it no matter what. I worked in a gas station during summer and I got money from my state for having good grades in hugh school. I spent 2 years worth of that money to travel to Poland and get a brace. And it was worth it.\n\nTalk to your parents and if you want they can chat with me. I will share my experience with them. Just do not give up. I will try but my state is completely shut off from all the others due to COVID and I keep getting told by my parents whenever I want to see a doctor that it is because I have not been exercising, that will not fix it and I cannot find anywhere to go in Western Australia for treatment. He told me there is surgery or exercise will fix it and exercise is well known not to fix it and surgery is the last thing I want. I need to get a brace but I do not know how or where because it feels like everyone is just ignoring me because I  do not have a medical degree even though I am in high school That is very relatable. How old are you btw? This COVID thing will not last forever.\n\nAnd yeah, exercise cannot fix the problem, you cannot change bone structure by exercising... That is crazy to even think about... But, it is definitely something that you want to do, it makes you look better and helps with your self confidence. Ikr I am 15 nearly 16 and it terrifies me that bracing will soon no longer be an option and I will need to get surgery I feel you. I find out about bracing when I was 17.I started doing it when I was 18 years and 2 months old. It worked great, but who knows if it would work if I was 20 at that time. you probably have a couple years left for brace options\u2026 i am 26 and have had 4 sternal surgeries\u2026 The U.S. might have the most options for treatment, but that does not mean there are not a crap ton of incompetent doctors out there. i personally recommend Dr. Benjamin Wei at UAB in Alabama. he did my last surgery which was removed a bunch of hardware that was improperly implanted by a dumb ass doctor who could not even read my CT scan to see that every piece of hardware was lose inside my chest wall\ud83d\ude43 Australia lol", "PC Affecting Mental Health I first started to notice my pc when I was about 13. That was the last summer I was actually free. Ever since then it is been an exhausting, endless psychological battle - one that does not seem to be ending anytime soon. I cannot even begin to list the number of good times I missed out on because of my stupid fucking chest. I am 18 now and so 5 summers in a row I have been extremely self-conscious and paranoid about it; avoiding swimming, taking my shirt off...etc. \nIt is gotten to the point where I flinch and instinctively react to any sudden hand movements of my friend\u2019s or family in the direction of my chest by subconsciously lifting my arms up and defending the area just so they do not know what a fucked up deformed piece of shit of a chest I have.\n\nI cannot believe how much time I have wasted worrying about it, it is so fucking mentally draining and it is beyond unfair. Everyday I wish I could wake up with a normal chest, something I could actually be proud of. I would literally walk around topless constantly. I just find it so bizarre that I used to be captain of my swimming team back when I was 11 or so and I loved swimming. I still love it now but I just cannot force myself to face this fear. It is definitely the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with. \n\nWhenever I put on a shirt, I look to see how bad my chest looks from every possible angle and repeating this routine is becoming more than too much for me. I am constantly anxious and ready to hide my chest at any moment, always adjusting my posture to the least degree of disgust. Because that is exactly what it is, fucking disgusting. \n\nI am always miserable especially during summer when I try to stay in my city for as long as I can while my family and friends go on holiday on the coast. I make up excuses and I know it is inevitable that people will start to find out. Even though my parents and siblings know about it, I feel so ashamed walking around topless around them because I feel like I am less worthy and it is not fair. I never asked for this but some fucking asshole must have made a mistake in my genetic code.\n\nI have tried the brace but it was too late, surgery is too risky and I would have scars to worry about then and body building is not helping for shit.\n\nI am too afraid to take it to the next level with girls cause I have no clue as to how they would respond if they saw it. I do not know how I would respond. I wish I could have the courage to let a girl touch my chest or anyone for that matter but I just do not.\n\nI am fucking sick and tired of this bullshit and want it too end. It stresses me out and fucks with my mind. I frequently consume cannabis to ease the suffering and although it does make me more reflective and helps me deal with it to an extent, I still cannot embrace it and I do not know why. I just cannot accept it because it is terrible and makes me feel sub-human. \n\nThis is probably the last summer I can mostly avoid not going to the coast and having to deal with excuses about why I cannot swim everyday so I need to do something fast.\n\nIf anyone can give me any advice on how to approach and resolve this problem, I would be forever grateful. As long as it is not the same shit I have heard from those who do not suffer from pc because they just do not know what it is like. Please help. I can fully relate, and felt similar for a long time. Still do sometimes, and still wonder to myself why I had to end up with this condition. Only girls that I ever dated that knew about it was one who I was with for almost 2 years, and the one I have been with now for 8. The first one somehow saw it through my shirt, and instantly reached out and touched it and told me it was okay, and her friend had it to. I was completely shook, and definitely embarrassed beyond belief. After things went terribly south with that relationship (I assure you, nothing related to that lol), I took the courage and initiative to actually take my shirt off and show the girl who I have now been with for 8 years. I am comfortable (Well, more or less. I are not got that great of a body haha) shirtless around her. I have even gone with her swimming shirtless a few times, as awkward as it is.  \n\n\nThe problem with trying to resolve this is that while we can say \"Oh, it is in your head\" because the majority of the issue with it is psychological - it is not that simple to do, because it is also physical. It is right there. You see it everyday, and that eats away at you. You cover yourself in baggy shirts, hunch over, flinch away from people, etc. You do everything you can to make it so even you do not realize it at some points. But everytime you take off your shirt, voila. There it is. The source of your rage and depression.  \n\n\nI suppose my best advice would be that anyone who is worth your time will not judge you for it, and will accept you unconditionally. But the toughest thing is, that being comfortable in your own skin is an enormous leap of faith. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I am not an expert..But I do not think that 18 is truly too late for bracing. I have seen many people in there 20s do it, and even heard of people in their 30s and 40s. I have actually been pondering getting one (again, had two..never could commit, hated it lol) again, and I am 31.   \n\n\nAnyway, that is all the advice I can think of off the top of my head. Also, you are not subhuman or any bit inferior than anyone else. A slightly different shaped sternum is a frustrating condition, but I can assure you that it does not make you any less of a wonderful person. :\\] It is really tough, I can relate to that a lot. I was always very self conscious about my body but I only realised it was PC a year and a half ago, i am 28 now. I know from experience that what you are going through is really difficult, and it has a huge domino effect on many other areas of life. But the reverse is true also, if you fix or even just improve your pectus, it will have a flow on effect and improve many other areas of your life too. If you can get through this, everything else will be easier by comparison.\n\nAt 18 you still have time on your side, research and inform yourself about pectus as much as you can and find yourself a good doctor who can guide you (dont be afraid to shop around). Where abouts are you located? (( is a good place to look for a doctor to start).\n\nAlso in regards to avoiding the 'next level' with girls. I know it is stressful but the more you avoid it the more stressful it will become. If one of our insecurities (e.g. pectus) is involved, we usually ruminate on the worst outcomes, not the potential positive outcomes. In my experience the reality is almost always better than the negative reactions I imagined.\n\nLife's not fair  but it is the only life we have so we may as well make the most of it. I have a lot more respect for people that have overcome adversity compared to people that may have achieved success but with no obstacles, and i know many other people are the same. Having pectus sucks, but it has taught me not to take anything for granted, and i know once I fix it life will be so much sweeter because of the struggle i faced.\n\nLiving with pectus is not for the faint of heart and you have made it this far so you are obviously tough. So keep at it and you will get through it.\n\nWhilst you continue to research and seek treatment for your Pectus make sure to make time for self-care too. It most likely will not be fixed over night so make sure that you work towards improving other areas of your life so that pectus isnt your sole focus. Find a hobby, a martial art, whatever it is, it is good to have some distractions to help get you through the rough days.\n\nBest of luck to you. Thank you so much for this response. I really appreciate you taking the time to write this because it truly does make me feel a bit better knowing there are others who can relate to my experiences. Regarding the bracing, it is not worth it because I have a protruding sternum and a sunken rib cage below so it is kind of like I have both pc and p. excavatum, which makes it look even worse so whatever I do to the top will negatively influence the shape of the lower part and besides my bones are rock-solid now. I need to deal with this using a psychological approach because there really is no other way other than to continue being miserable for the rest of my life. Anyway, thanks again for your response and words of support :) Thanks so much for the response i really do appreciate it. This is the first time I am actually able to converse with people who have had the same challenging experiences as me and who fully understand what it is like living with pc which makes feel a lot better. Thank you again :) I hope I find the courage to live like a normal person in regards to summertime... No worries at all! Glad i could be of some help. Sounds like a tricky case but not untreatable. I am not sure what you would look into yet but for something complex it could be worth trying to consult with an expert like Dr Jarozsewski. If you havent already you could try contacting Pectus Joe (Pectus Services on facebook) for advice - he is pretty knowledgable regarding Pectus and a really helpful friendly guy. Bracing is not too late, surgery is a great option if you are able to afford it and insurance covers it (scaring is not that bad, and will go away if treated correctly), and body building will bring some confidence back to you. Working out takes years for you to be happy when living with pc, just need to eat, sleep, and train right. And as far as finding a girl: every girl that I have ever dated or slept with has not shown disgust towards my chest. They honestly do not care. Just bring your head up and take your confidence back, strive for a better body with exercise. There is so much potential that you have control of to determine how you look. Do not let a little defect control you. Bodybuilding will 100% without a doubt help. Even with pectus carinatum, a couple years of dedication  in the gym and with diet will have you looking better shirtless than 99% of the general population. My whole life I was insecure about it, it is still there and visible, yet almost everyone I encounter admires and is jealous of my physique because of bodybuilding. That wiped away every ounce of insecurity I had. Definitely continue bodybuilding, it is also waay better than surgery. \n\nRegarding women. My ex\u2019s and girls I have been shirtless with in the past when I was really skinny did not even notice it and I had to point at it for them to see it, and mines not that mild either, it is symmetrical and sticking out right in the middle. None of them gave a fuck. Tbh it is more embarrassing showing that we are insecure about it than having it.\n\nTrust me, when you have a big chest and ripped abs, no one will ever know you have it even if it is still a little visible, and you will be proud to show off ur physique in public. i know i do not got that much experience with it as i am currently 14, but i feel the same fucking way dude. I just recently showed some of my friends to ease the embarrassment of them finding out themselves, it came with some \u201cbullying\u201d but none the less i am confident with my friends. Anyway I do the exact same thing as seeing yourself with different angles and it just deteriorates my self esteem sometimes. I still defend my chest as i guess it is just a habit, and i do not think that that will ever stop. Because i could not bare someone mention it in public.\n\nI can say my self confidence has rose for some reason, to be honest i do not know why. And yeah i am scared about girls and shit and sometimes stay up all night thinking about it. I am always putting myself down as it seems like in your case, and actually had some of my \u201cfriends\u201d mention it in school, in the middle of class and he always says the same thing if it is \u201cyou got a lump on your chest\u201d or \u201cyou got a tumour\u201d or \u201cyour chest is deformed\u201d like i know, i hate myself for it. I ended up beating the shit out of him which i guess solved the problem for now. \n\nWell hope this helped. I feel the same way dude. All of my friends are going to my buddies cabin and they all want me to come. I do not want to go because I will have to take my shirt off. It is mentally exhausting. It is literally all I think about since it is summer now. I think we got to realize it does not matter that our chest is a little fucked up. Everyone else is so worried about how they look that they are not even notice. And if they do, who gives a fuck. Just know you are not the only one who feels like that. The way you described it is identical to how I feel. First of all, there is nothing wrong with you. This condition is something so far out of our control that to berate ourselves for being this way is cruel. I just finished my teenage years with pretty severe PC and a whole lot of self confidence issues exactly like yours and I know it is hell. It is something I would not wish on anyone and as a young man who has beat myself up about my chest for a majority of my life I hate to see other people going through this because I know just how frustrating and hopeless it can be. That being said, we are our own worst critics naturally. It is the scariest thing in the world to take my shirt off for the first time in front of a girlfriend because it is extremely emotionally vulnerable and one negative comment about my chest from someone I care about could tear me down to an absolute mess but I have had a number of girlfriends and despite initially trying to hide that I have Pectus Carinatum they all eventually found out and were very understanding and loving. In fact every woman that I have opened up to about this has made me feel incredibly loved and supported and I promise they will not look at you any different because of your chest. I am still self conscious as hell about it even into my twenties but I promise it gets better especially once you have had some time to distance from the hyper-judgemental environment that is high school. People who belong in your life will love you exactly the way you are, if they do not they are not worth your time. Hang in there bro I know it sucks but take it day by day When you push on your chest does it budge at all? Yeah, a few centimetres Damn make a brace as fast as possible, or get one if you can. It is not to late if you your chest still can budge. Your just going to have to adjust it extra tight. It will hurt, but It WILL fix your chest. I made one myself, and recently started cutting back on wearing it. So my chest popped out withing a few days. Like ALOT. This was after years of religously wearing the brace. I pushed on it and like you said it barely budged, and I am 20. So I thought I wasted all that time wearing the brace. But sure enough after wearing it extremely tight for a few weeks it went back to normal. I had to wear it while sleeping to. Just try getting a brace, do not let a doctor tell you it is to late. If your chest budges get the brace. How long should I be wearing it per day? I really do not want to have to wear it when I am not sleeping\u2026 If you have never worn a brace before, your probably going to have too wear it 24/7, at first. After a while your chest will stay in for a bit, by itself. The longer your wear it the longer your chest stays in. And the longer your chest stays in the less you will have to wear the brace. So you will not be wearing it 24/7 for long. Maybe for a few weeks/months Then maybe cut an hour down. I am not exactly sure the specifics on how to time it. You should look it up for the best advice. Just try to wear it 24/7 until you can get to the point you only have to wear it to sleep. From that point it gets soooo much easier. Damn\u2026after my chest is corrected, how long do I have to keep wearing the brace for? Thanks for the help! That is what I am wondering at the moment. I wore it for a solid 5 1/2 years (not 24/7), and my chest still popped back out. But I was 20 when I popped back out. And my chest was/is still flexible. So I think it goes by when your chest completely hardens. I do not really no much about it though. Because once you get to the point where your only wearing it to sleep, then you will not have to worry about that. Just see how long you can go before your chest starts to pop back out. Then just wear it again. Yup relate to this 100%\nIt affects everything in my life, in the summer when everyone is out in a t shirt or some even topless I try to avoid going out since nobody knows I have Pectus.\nAlso when I do go out I stick out like a sore thumb as I am the only one around in a hoodie in boiling weather which only brings more attention to me with people saying \u201c why u got a hoodie on u look silly\u201d but I rlly do not want to tell everyone and feel like a \u2018weirdo\u2019\nah well I have got an appointment in a week to get a brace which I definitely do not plan on wearing whenever I am out as I can only imagine the embarrassment If someone touches my chest or notices it.\nJust know tho there is many people who feel like u and just wish they had a normal chest! Yeah sorry to hear that man\u2026 god is a fucking sicko I can fully relate to most of what you are saying.   \nSince the beginning I was very self conscious about it and I did not want to tell any of my friends. Every summer I would make random excuses and turn down plans just because I did not want anyone to notice. When I could not avoid it and had to get shirtless in public, I would be really paranoid thinking that everyone would be looking at me and thinking awful things.  \nI\u00b4ve spend many many days alone wishing I was \u201cnormal\u201d and how would my life be without it\u2026  \nBut this summer I decided that I wanted to start doing the things I really wanted to do instead of rejecting plans where my PC could be visible. I started by going to the beach more often and with new people, and to my surprise they did not even acknowledge it. Then I went to some more places with my friends, and the same happened. Some people might act surprise and ask, but if they do it just out of curiosity and in a nice way I just try to explain them the situation, and everyone has been ok with it. I am obviously still self conscious about it, but this has taught me that the people who really love you and want the best for you are going to support you no matter what.  \nKnow I am trying to keep it going and not rejecting plans just because of that. It\u00b4s difficult, but  it just feels great, I feel much more free.  \nBut remember that each person is different. I am 21 now and have had it for 5 or 6 years, and I am just now trying to change my perspective. I used to hate when my family told me that it was not as big of a deal, thinking that they did not understand anything. But trust me, everyone has their problems and they do not really care about ours as much as we think.  \nIt has also helped a lot reading experiences of other people here who are going to the same think. That has given me the courage to start acting different about it and doing more things.

I just found out today from a surgeon\u2019s assistant that based in my CT scan and referral that the surgeon i was hoping to talk to would not be willing to perform surgery on me. I think the reasoning is that my case is not health threatening, as my only symptoms are pain and the psycho-social burden. This has been a growing problem the last few years as my case has developed slowly as i have grown. My case is complex where one side goes in and the other out, so it is especially visible, even through a shirt and a sweatshirt. I notice strangers notice it, girls have rejected me for it, friends talk shit behind my back, it even affects how i move through a room, etc etc.... i had hoped surgery would help me move past it. But now i find i basically have to live with it forever. Does anyone have any suggestions to help me deal with this? Thanks Can you not brace? I am almost 23 i do not think it would do much Can you talk to the doctor and explain what it does to you mentally and socially? Apparently he will reach out to me tomorrow and i will certainly hammer this point and how much it affects me. But his assistant seemed to make it clear that he \u201cwould not do surgery.\u201d And it seems he has been avoiding talking to me as long as possible so idk if he will even give me the call. Maybe get a therapist and tell them about how it affects you. Maybe they will recommend that you get a surgery and it would not be up for debate? That is a good idea. I will look into that depending on how the conversation goes tomorrow That is what I have thought about doing. Please keep us updated!! Good luck! Will do. Cheers You can find other doctors??

Also yoga/stretching will help alleviate pain as well while strengthening the muscles that support your posture. Best of luck on your journey mate Stretch lower back, strengthen upper back and abs.

And i obviously know the process and the pain that is going to come from the surgery, and it is best fit for me, so stop tryna relate your feelings to mine bc were obviously not the same, and lastly I am not discouraging others, I am simply saying my story and the truth before someone wastes 6 months like I did, what I went through was hella rough and if I could prevent someone else from going through the same, best believe I am going to\ud83d\udcaf Thanks for all of your comments, But did the breathing get better with the bracing or the surgery.

But I will regret it in the future, though if I do ask my parents for a brace, I will feel bad for pretty much asking for thousands of dollars. No need to feel bad. Listen why, you did not ask for this, this is not a normal situation, and yet you have a chance to correct it. You will ask for thousands of dollars, but it comes second to asking to have a normal life... Your parents are the ones who will love you and understand you the most, always remember that. You must tell them how you feel, because this is not only an estetical, but also a big psychological problem. It could also cause you health problems and shortness of breath during physical activities. They will understand. At the end of the day you can borrow their money and return it in the future. You know, teenagers spend parents money on so much unnecessary things (IPhones, designer clothes,... ), I think this is very important. \n\nI felt the same, but one day I decided to finally come out and talk to my mom about this. She recieved it very well and even was angry that I did not tell her earlier. I am getting my brace in February.\n\nDo not feel bad about asking, and please live your life with no regrets \ud83d\ude4f. Remember, you are asking for a normal life. Thanks for that one mate. I do hesitate to remove my shirt, and it is not even that bad, that is the thing. I second guess the brace because people have it a lot worse. I will see how I go though, thank you heaps! Goodluck with your brace! Thanks! Good luck to you too. \n\nP. S. : Another thing, there will always be people with worse cases, but you are you. That does not mean that your problem should not be solved. Aslo if you do not already go to the gym, try to find some time for it. I am hitting the gym already, but I do strength &gt; hypertrophy, so I am getting heaps stronger but not too much bigger.\n\nThanks champ Well, idk what the hell that means, but I see that you know what you are doing.", "New here and just learning of pc.

I am going to try it, but in my city is difficult to get one\nThanks \ud83d\ude0a Yeah, I know it can be hard getting one in most countries. I am from Serbia and I had no options in my country. I found a dovtor from US and was going to get his brace and I was ready to go to UK or US to get it. Luckily he told me he also works in Poland which saved me a lot of money. I still had to travel to Poland though.\n\nPersonally, I would say that it was the best money I have ever spent. If money is a problem, get a job and work on your weekends and off school days. But, at the end of the day ut all depends on you. If you really want to get rid of it so bad, you will have to put a lot of effort in getting your brace. Unfortunately, Pectus Carinatum is not that familiar to most doctors in this world so getting rid of it can be a struggle depending where you live... Fortunately, I have a high self esteem and I can live with \"this\" for a long time, but get a brace is the better option, I have been thinking about going to the US in a few years, I have family in USA an they can help me.\n\n(If I answer your comments with few words is because I speak just a little English) Your English is perfectly fine.

The brace did not work for me, but hopefully they have advanced it since the decade ago that I wore it. I recommend investing in some comfy wireless bras and tank tops if you have not already! Thanks for the advice. I am excited because the doctor making my brace seems really knowledgeable and she was nice A good doctor makes all the difference! Actually really surprised with the results. Statistically, females are much less likely to have PC (way less than a 28:7 ratio) but I am glad that everyone is becoming involved with the sub.

I am 26 now and my only option is surgery. \n\nBasically if I were you I would act sooner than later, or live with it - you will still get good bracing results at your age, you just have to decide if you think it is going to bother you in the long run.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(To make matters worse I was put on an acne medication called accutane at 16 which prematurely fuses bones and stunts growth, so not only do I have PC, but my torso is disproportionately short and it makes the effect of the PC even worse...

I would probably say your too old for bracing unfortunately Ask a doctor :p", "To those that have gotten the surgery, can you please answer some questions... How old were you when you got it? Were you nervous at all? Where did it take place? Is the scar bad? How expensive was it? \n\n\nI am 18 and my insurance will not cover it, on top of that my mom does not want me to because she thinks it is dangerous. I have an internship this summer and might use the money I make to fund it, but I do not know where to go Hi 25 year old female here! I was 22 when I got the surgery. I was super nervous! But I wanted to be able to breathe easier and look normal. \n\nI had a super great experience having my surgery done at Johns Hopkins Hospital. My insurance covered everything fully. Pain was manageable but you are unable to drive and lift more than a gallon of milk for quite awhile. They removed part of my sternum and ribs and placed two vertical bars. \n\nIt is been 3 years since my surgery and my chest has shifted again. I am in the same amount (if not more) of pain. It is looks bad again cosmetically. I am working on scheduling to have the bars removed. \n\nHopefully I could be helpful! Let me know if you have any more questions. I would love to have a PC buddy.  I had my surgery done almost 10 years ago, when I was 15 years old. I was not really nervous at the time, but I really did not know what I was getting myself into. It took place in Scandinavia and did not cost me anything.\n\nLooking back, I would not say that I regret the surgery, but I do regret not paying closer attention to the healing and rebuilding processes in the months and years after the surgery. I did feel a lot of pain from working out and the likes, which took me 6 years to finally go to the doctor about.  I found this thread while looking for information on getting Pectus Carinatum surgery.   I  felt obligated to make an account in order to share my extreme regret with letting my mother talk me out of surgery at your age.  \n\n\nRefusing to get the surgery is the biggest regret of my life.  After refusing to get the surgery I found out that I could not join the military due to my condition.  I have never had the confidence to be in a relationship with a woman because my condition makes me feel less than human.   Despite what friends tell me, I have had strangers recognize the condition through my clothes.  I have even attempted suiide and have scars on my wrists to prove it.   People sometimes whisper about them.  But I am generally pretty confident and the scars are easy to cope with unlike my chest is for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt 18 years old I was approved by insurance but the copay still would have been only 4000 dollars.   My mom brought that up to me one day and told me  that she would still require me to attend school for the semester after the surgery even with all of the limitations..    \n\n\nI am now 27.  Most things get better with age, but this is not true with pectus carinatum for me.  It has gotten to the point where I have decided to go through the whole process again to get the surgery.  I will move back in with my parents and pay the full price if I have to.    \n\n\nI am sure pectus carinatum does not affect everyone is well being as much as it does me.  But if you are wanting to get the surgery, then I am sure it is affecting you quite a bit.  Please do not let others manipulate you into a choice that you  will likely regret. Thanks for sharing your story. My son who is 23 will be seeing his doctor this week to talk about scheduling this surgery.  He will not talk about it much but I know it has affected him psychologically. He has never dated and is very self conscious.  He had to save for a year to have the surgery because our insurance considers it \"cosmetic\".  I have several concerns about it.  I am worried about the pain meds he will be put on, the painful recovery and the effect it will have on him if it does not turn out the way he hopes.  This showed up around puberty and I really wish his pediatrician would have given us more information about not only the way it would affect health but mental as well.  If he had done the brace maybe this could have been avoided.  Best of luck to you and everyone struggling with this issue.  If anyone is interested in his progress I will post again. I would love to also hear from anyone who has had this surgery and if they regret it or glad they did it. I am 18 years old and had my surgery done 6 days ago, so can be quite reputable on how painful the procedure is due to me only just experiencing it. I do not know exactly what procedure I had done.  The bars placed are 1 horizontal bar and 2 bars to strengthen the horizontal bar or hold the ribs in place, not quite sure their purpose to be completely honest. \n\nI have a vertical scar about 5 inches in length and a few smaller scars for the bars to be placed through, look very ugly to begin with as they use a special sort of glue, but use dissoluble stitches so they said I do not have to worry about them apparently.\n\nIt took place at a hospital in the United Kingdom, it was very difficult to obtain an appointment with a specialist in the UK as there is not many, and it is always seen as a cosmetic surgery unless you actually have something wrong with you are breathing. At my first appointment I said how it is affecting my mental health and he basically said no you are fine unless you have something wrong with you. He did breathing tests and found that I had 40% extra lung capacity for my height, weight, and age, however was only using around 40% of it effectively. Since it was in the UK there was no expense I do not think.\n\nAbout your mum thinking about risks, the surgeon said it has risks but so does any surgery that uses local anasthetic, they are not cutting into your organs, only above it.\n\nMy stay at the hospital was 5 days and immediately after the procedure I was on quite a bit of morphine, with an IV which lets me administer it myself every 5 minutes, as well as ibuprofen, paracetamol, and got given gabapentin once but only that once.\n\nSurgery day: Wake up in recovery unit where the make sure your pain is managed and they wake you up to make sure you are alright, vaguely remember this and saying I was in a lot of pain, but do not remember the pain looking back. Drugs where morphine. Surgery was 4 hours and I was in recovery for about 2-3 hours. I have 3 drains in, 2 smaller ones, and one larger one. I then got back to my hospital room where I stay with my parents and do not remember much of the rest, do not believe I was in a lot of pain.\n\n1 Day after: Feel very dizzy and drugged up, not much happens on this day apart from getting one smaller drain out, did not feel a thing getting this pulled out. Still on the same pain killers. In a lot of pain this day. Have an extremely bloated stomach because I could not wee sitting on my bed so I had to get out of bed and struggle. At the end of this day I was already walking around the ward.\n\n2 Day after: Feeling a lot less dizzy in a lot of pain, painkillers do not take away all the pain sadly so you have to manage it. Another small drain taken out on this day, more walking.\n\nNot much happens the following days as I was waiting for the main drain to be removed which happened 4 days after the surgery, as soon as this was done I went home.\n\nStill in pain, it feels as if my ribs are being pushed together towards my stomach, very strange, hard to keep good posture. I thought it was standard to get the bars removed 12 months after the surgery. Not necessarily. Because I am in my mid-20\u2019s they told me they wanted to wait because it would talk a little longer to heal I believe I believe because I am in my mid-20\u2019s they wanted to wait because it would take longer to heal or something Yes that makes sense. You say that it has shifted again, do you mean like back the way it was before. Does it now look worse cosmetically than before. I am worried because I just had my surgery done a few days ago. Hope you are doing okay! It does not look the same as before surgery, it is flatter but you can see outlines of the hardware and screws. I believe it is shifted because I do need the hardware out but I just have not been able to make it work. I followed the aftercare instructions perfectly and have not had any trauma so it is just how it healed. Hey, thanks for reaching out. Another question, a big one, how does it look? The bone I mean Hope you able to get the metal out asap and get rid of the pain. Thanks for helping me with these questions. Also, what sort of instructions did you get given for aftercare? I havent been given any specifics. The bone where it would stick out before is not visible at the moment and the chest like where the nipples is where t shirts lie on my body. Bear in mind that I probably have quite a bit of swelling and it may not look like this fully healed. Hope this helps. Aftercare instructions such as not lifting anything heavy (gallon of milk if I recall), sleeping on your back, breath exercises, do not drive or work until you are cleared by your doctor. Those kind of things!", "Losing hope.. PC ruined my life My PC is pretty large. It affects several inches of my chest vertically and is asymmetrical. I have struggled with It since I was very young, I remember being like 8 years old and not wanting to take my shirt off because of it. One of my worst memories was when I gave this girl I liked a hug and she said \u201cwhat is that? You should go get that checked\u201d in a disgusted tone. I went to a doctor to ask about it at the age of 15 or so and he said \u201cno that is totally normal\u201d in an almost angry tone acting like I am making a big deal out of nothing. \n\nIm 29 and obviously too old to wear a brace now and I feel like it is getting worse. I am so uncomfortable in my skin and will not even let my long term partner touch that area of my chest. I have tried for years to gain weight and put on muscle to try to conceal it. But it does not help. The muscle just sits on top of the PC and it does not help even it out at all. One side of my chest looks way more developed than the other even though it is not. My posture is totally fucked from years of rolling my shoulders in trying to hide it. I cannot even have a normal posture without my rib cage poking out. It has completely destroyed my self image. I am afraid it will only get worse. It is really affected my self-esteem and stopped me from being confident in myself. A day does not go by without hating my body. I am also always extremely uncomfortable and lie awake every night because I can always feel it and notice it. I have had dreams where I rip it out of my body only to finally have relief.\n\nIf only I knew how much it would fuck up my life I would have tried harder to get a brace. But at the time I did not even know a brace was a thing and who knows if it would have helped me.\n\nWhere do I go from here? Has anyone learned to live with this? What can I do to accept it?

Hi guys I need advice... \n\nLast summer I was diagnosed with \u201cmild Pectus excavatum\u201d But today I though like. It is strange cuz I had this bone on my right breast that is sticking a little bit out. It just does not makes sense to me. This is probably not excavatum but Carinatum. I am really scared for Marfans and have had anxiety of it for 2-3 weeks now. I am getting tested in 8 days. I am just feeling bad generally. Reason is that I do not know what the hell is wrong with me. Under my left breast there is a hole and on the right a bone sticking out a little. \n\n3 pics down here. What you all think?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I am no doctor but this is no excavatum in my opinion. It looks like your sternum is indeed protruding on one side because of excessive growth of the cartilage. Welcome to the club.  Thank you. Do you have the same thing. And are you tested for any medical issues? Had. See my recent posts in this communities. I do not have any onderling conditions that caused my PC like marfan. I saw that. Did you have surgery? I am a 17 years old male btw. And nope you do not look skinny so ofc you do not have Marfans. Is it possible to have both excavatum and carinatum Yes did surgery. I do not think it is possible to have both. I think you have a mild carinatum. With bracing and exercising you will be able to mask it for 99%. Yeah I mean I do not care having it at all! I would be happy for a bad version.. as long as I do not have any underlying conditions. Like Marfans. I am 5\u20199,5 and weight 51 kilograms. I am really skinny. (176 tall and weight 115 lbs).. I am underweight and have been it my whole life. My dad was really really thin as well at my age. Now he is about 40 and is normal weight. I hope it is just naturally genetics from him. But he did not had any Pectus Ah. Then wait for the testing and hope for the best. I am no Marfan expert. Good luck! Thank you mate :) It is indeed possible to have a mixed deformity (PE/PC).\n\nYour chest looks very good tbh, some depression under the pecs which cause a little bit of rib flare is what I am seeing.\n\nMaybe you have some PC also, hard to tell from photos.

Just make sure you do not damage your skin from overwearing, the skin gets used it it with time.\n\n Remind yourself who you are doing this for, do not fool yourself.

Hey Guys, im 17 years old and I have pectus carinatum. Its not that bad, but my left side of my chest goes kind of like in...I have been working out, and I have the brace now. I just want to know is it normal that my chest is a unsymetrical, and will it go away (or be less noticable) after months of working out and shit. Generally with Pectus Carinatum, a side of the chest sticks out or both do. Have you been told by a doctor that you actually have PC or? I have started going gym and I am fairly unsymetrical as my left side has a lot more muscle in comparison to right (left side of chest wall sticks out roughtl 2-3 pencil widths). Whoever you got the brace off of, maybe have a chat with them and I am sure they will enlighten you, but when your wall is flat again, muscle will become symmetrical progressively, and if that is not the case, YouTube has videos to achieve symmetry in that area. Bro, I have the exact same thing as you...Lets just hope it gets more symetrical Good luck, do not give up. Working out surelly will not be bad. Yeah prolly, just the brace is pretty uncomfy. Some times my skin get irritated under the brace (only where the pectus is) but other than that its fine I will probably start bracing in February so I do not know anything about it, but I am sure it is uncomfortable. But it is definatelly worth it. It is, but just make sure you wear it 24/7 (except for showers of course). First week is the thoughest, and after its fine. The skin just gets irritated often, and that kind of sucks. And make sure you clean your brace daily (due to the sweat and bacteria it smells pretty wierd) I sure will. Thank you for the advice \ud83d\udc4a Just push through it, im 17 and started wearing around a week ago...workout daily and eat alot (gaining weight + muscle build up will help for sure) and just remember you are not alone \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I am 17 and 10/12 now, so I will be 18 when I get it. I contacted Pectus Services, they say I am still at a fine age for a brace. Gym is the best thing that happened so far in my life, I enjoy the time in gym so much. Same dude, its amazing. I live in belgium, so I couldnt get a custom one. I just got one for 200\u20ac (one size or some shit like that) and its doing the job just fine I am from Serbia, doctors do not even know about bracing method here. I was fed up with PC so I did the research and found out about it. I will get my brace in Poland, but it will be expensive, my guess 1500+ \u20ac + airplane tickets and hotel room. But I am a good student so I get some money from my country and I found a job to cover the expenses. Great to hear, its a fucking joke, my doctors also didnt even know what the fuck it was. The only thing i hate about the brace is the fucking irritation...But the results will pay of for it. Tell me how it goes and shit. If you got any questions fell free to ask dude Thank you! But I am already very well informed, I got every last bit of information from a doctor from Pectus Services and a couple of his old patients. Good luck! Thanks man! Same to you", "GUIDE on how to deal with brace pain and rashes and bruises This is from my experience). \n\nFirstly, I am not done with bracing. But I am going to give people who are new to bracing some tips to start off.\n\n1. Dont overtighten. Take it easy. If you cant tighten it fully for few days then just keep it on tight enough so that you can get used to it. Gradually you will start to get used to the tightness. Only tighten it steps at a time and only tighten it to where a specialist recommended!\n\n2. We know there is not much you can do about the pain. To take your mind off it or to calm down. Do something to distract you. Maybe do homework. Or play video games. Not thinking about it will calm you down.\n\n3. Wear padding (if the specialist gave you some) I was given extra padding for my rib braces and my chest brace. The rib brace is for rib flaring which pectus caused. The padding stops the scars and rashes and causes less pain.\n\n4. Try a T-shirt. Wear a Shirt over your brace. It wont stop the pain. But it will gradually reduce the rashes.\n\n5. Use creams for your rashes caused by the brace. The cream gets rid of the rashes and cools the chest down. You need go be careful with the rash. By itching it you can make it worse. It is best to leave it alone.\n\n6. Do your excersises. If your specialist gave your exercises DO them. The exercise program helps make your chest flexible and speeds up the bracing program..  the workouts also help you get used to the pressure.\n\n7. When sleeping. Dont force yourself. For first weeks. Take it easy. If your struggling. Take it off. Dont force it on you.  Take it slowly. And gradually you will get used to it.\n\nFinally, Wear it as often as you can. :) I am getting terrible rashes on my back. Do not know what to do. Same. I am 5 months in. You can wear a tshirt over the brace or apply cream. Its tough. You should speak to your specialist My rashes on the back even started bleedimg a couple times... Use a layer of spomge, and use some type of cream to reduve friction. My skin was already damaged when I started doingnit, but it helped my skin heal.", "Trulife brace. Better options? I have been using the tru life brace for almost 2 months now and am seeing little to no results. I wear it usually around 8 hours a day, sometimes more. Anyone else seen good results? How long did it take? I have heard talk of other braces where the doctor massages your chest into the position and the brace keeps it that way and that sounds a lot better than what I am doing now, But how do I go about doing that? I am 16 btw. Chest is pretty pliable. just want to get this fixed as soon as I can bc it is been lowering my quality of life. Sometimes i just feel like this brace is not doing much but it could just be me tearing myself down T-joe pectus/pectus services can be better bracing options I believe. Look up bracing options, consult doctors, and they will lead you to the right place. You will have to do some research T-Joe from Pectus Services is what I use and recommend. By the way, you will get nowhere by wearing it for 8 hours, it has to be longer. I was considering getting a brace as well from T-Joe. If you do not mind me asking, how much was it? im just about to turn 14 and i have been wearing the Trulife brace for a week now so do you not recommend it?", "Reverse-Nuss or Ravitch? I had a phone consultation with a surgeon and he said that he only performs the Ravitch procedure as he believes the Reverse-Nuss procedure is not effective as it does not create enough force to change the sternum (he does perform the regular Nuss for PE though). I am not disagreeing with his opinion, however I have some concerns about the Ravitch because of the fact that it is more invasive and i am concerned the cosmetic end result may not be as good. I have a narrow ribcage and narrow shoulders so I was hoping the reverse nuss might expand or broaden my ribcage somewhat (not idea if that is possible just a fantasy I guess). I have seen some studies online that showed that reverse-nuss procedures had more favourable outcomes than ravitch procedures for patients with PC - obviously those are just a few studies but the discrepancy between the studies and the doctor's recommendations concern me somewhat.\n\nIf there is anyone that has had either operation i would love to hear your thoughts on the operations and the pros and cons.

So I am 18 and live in the UK. My pectus is asymmetrical, completely to the left. I essentially half a completely normal rib cage and then the other half sticks out by around 5cm, but only at the upper half of my chest, pretty much just under my left breast. Funding for any treatments stopped on the NHS about a year ago (or at least in my area). I was diagnosed when I was around 8? but due to having scoliosis as the primary issue, my pectus was never further investigated. I cannot afford treatment privately and honestly I think I would have been okay with that. However, when I was 8 and it was diagnosed I distinctly remember my doctor telling my mum that I would likely need a boob job to ever look \u201cnormal\u201d. This has basically led my mum to bury her head in the sand over the years and insist that it is fine. But, let us be real, ribs sticking 5cm out your chest is hardly typical \ud83d\ude02. I have small boobs which really only just cover it, so for a number of years have been wearing those heavily padded bras. Anyway, it is getting to the point where I am starting to feel a bit fake and it is knocking my self esteem. I am going to uni this year, so would you recommend just getting rid of the padded bras and moving forward with bralettes? Also how on Earth do you approach the topic with a partner?? Boobs seem to be such a great part of attraction, would this be a massive turn off? I am a dude so I cannot really help u with ur bra question sorry lol . But as far as a relationship goes if ur partner asks about it just say it was the way u were born I think most men at that point would not care . I do not know... you cannot afford the brace, but you can always get a job and work for the money. I do not want to be boring, but brace is still the best option. I already work three jobs just to maintain living costs, it really is not an option for me. Thanks for the help anyway.

My TruLife brace also hurt and did not fit well at all- so I gave up. But I decided recently that I want to try again. Instead of using the TruLife brace I am just going to create my own brace. All I really need is 2 pieces of wood, 2 big nuts and bolts, and lots of padding. Maybe I will change that design in the future.

TL;DR any people with personal experiences regarding surgical repair and possible options in \u201cfixing\u201d Pectus Carinatum\n\n\nA while ago I posted some images regarding my Pectus Carinatum and options moving forward. Recently I saw a specialist regarding options for \u201cfixing\u201d the chest wall deformity.\n\nFirstly , I mentioned \u201cfixing\u201d the chest through bracing in which he completely disregarded (suggested it would not work because of age)and moved onto the topic of plastic surgery. \n\nHe discussed how they cannot fix the deformity but can camouflage it. There are 2 options one being the recommended implant plastic surgery to \u201ccamouflage\u201d the deformity and the 2nd which he did not recommend was some pushing the ribs forward using a U-bar of some sort.\n\nHonestly I am not fond of either options as they are not fixing the deformity, I would rather not have some dumb plastic mold temporarily covering the area, evening out the chest knowing the PC is still there. \n\nYou would think it is within their best interest to give all options to the candidate even if they do not recommend or not even mention it and if they refuse to not give any further suggestions I would rather try and spend 5 years in the gym trying to cover it (not fixing).\n\nIf anything if anyone wants to comment their personal experiences regarding Pectus Carinatum plastic surgery, surgery to fix the deformity (removal of bobe etc) and express further options that would be great. It varies based on the persons chest maturity meaning how far through skeletal development you are, generally the age range is between 12 - 18 although that is not saying that you cannot do it after that age. \n\nI am 19 but I also have to consider whether I am able to withstand 10 PSI if I was to wear a brace 42, it is _The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything_...\n\n69 first appears in Pi at the end of 42 digits\n\n---\n\n&gt;(\n&gt;\n&gt;^^And ^^Sarai ^^said ^^unto ^^Abram, ^^My ^^wrong ^^_be_ ^^upon ^^thee: ^^I ^^have ^^given ^^my ^^maid ^^into ^^thy ^^bosom; ^^and ^^when ^^she ^^saw ^^that ^^she ^^had ^^conceived, ^^I ^^was ^^despised ^^in ^^her ^^eyes: ^^the ^^LORD ^^judge ^^between ^^me ^^and ^^thee.\n\n\u2003\u2003\u2003^^^I ^^^am ^^^a ^^^bot. ^^^I ^^^Like ^^^Pi.\u2003 ^^^3 ^^^\u00b7 ^^^14 I am 20 and I am getting a brace in like a month Congrats, hopefully it works wonders for you, unfortunately for someone like me with an upper asymmetrical PC which is quite stiff I probably cannot get the same procedure Mine is also asymmetric and is upper.

It is weird to explain. Anyways up until a few years ago I always wondered why that was and especially why I still had major man boobs even though I was a twig lol. It sucks but now I just want to learn more. An emergency room doctor asked me about it and when I did not know what it was she was suprised that a doctor has not diagnosed it. That was a few years ago but when I looked it up I saw it can be caused by marfans syndrome. I have been paranoid ever since because I have long arms and long fingers and toes. I was diagnosed when I was 13 years old. Doctors in my country did not know about braces though, they only offered surgeries... I got my brace 5 years later in Poland from an American doctor. Was there an underlying issue that caused pigeons chest for you? No. Btw, I just read your post fully. I was worried about Marfans syndrome as well because I also have long arms, legs and fingers. However those are not real signs of Marfans syndrome, but if you are worried you should check with a doctor, but I think they would already diagnose you. Pectus appears in tall people more often because fast growth iften causes some deformities. I see - that makes sense. I need to remember to ask my doctor about it next time. I do not see a doctor very often and as much as I tend to worry about this I always forget to ask when I do see him\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the info!! Did a brace completely fix your pigeons chest? Is there an age where it is probably too late for that to work? I am almost 23. It fixed it for me, I think fully, but even if not it is not noticeable anymore. Braces work if your chest is still flexible enough, but as you age your chest gets harder. Most people brace before they reach 20, with 23 years there is a big chance that you are not a good candidate, but there is still a decent chance that you are.\n\nFew days ago I talked to one guy who is 23 and who uses a brace right now. I will see if he wants to share experiences with you. I am also here for you, anything you want to know you can ask me. I see. \n\nI just hate it because it makes it so no shirts really fit me right. They always ride up my neck almost as if I am wearing it backwards. And then there is the problem of looking like I have D size boobs as a man. Oh well Old post but I will comment anyway. I was not diagnosed until I was 18. For some reason my pediatrician never brought it up and when I finally went to a primary care physician he told me I had it. My PC was not bad enough to be that noticeable with a shirt on but you could still see how my chest was a bit more forward and \u201cbigger\u201d than the rest of my body. It is not asymmetrical so that is probably why a lot of people would not bring it up or notice it that much. \n\nAnyway, I relate to the weird body thing too.

While the hospital where I first went said that I could have the Ravitch procedure, the hospital I went to now said that they do not really like to do Ravitch because of the risk and severity of it. They recommended that I would do the Abramson procedure. This was quite a shock to hear because I have kind of been mentally preparing myself for Ravitch since I was 17. I do not really know anything about the Abramson procedure and would love to hear from someone who does. Especially because I am quite old to have it since the ideal age for Ambramson is 14-18.

He did not even mention that braces are a thing so looking back I am pretty mad (was 16 at the time, now I am 21).\n\nHowever, I am not happy with my condition even after a year of working out and gaining weight. The issues are not only cosmetic but it also GREATLY affects my self esteem. I am anxious walking around, working out without my T-shirt, hugging, being intimate and much more (I have not been on a vacation, water parks and shit like that forabout 6 years because of it).\n\nI already made up my mind and I want the surgery so I am wondering what is the best option in Europe? I want to get a bit more fit before the surgery so that it does not fuck me up too much. What is the average price and the best surgeon for my condition? When I had my surgery a few years ago the average price was about 20-25 000 euro. Then it will cost another 10 000 euro when you remove the bar, so it is not a very cheap operation.\n\nI had mine in Germany with a very renowned surgeon, but he is retired now I believe.\n\nEven if he was a good surgeon his operation did not last on me (displaced bar), he also did some resection on my lower cartilage to fix my flared ribs. And that is something I really regret today.\n\nResection of the cartilage is a very crude way to fix it. Instead it should be fixed with a metal bar, but I thick there is only one Chinese doctor called \"Wenlin Wang\" who use that technique.\n\nIf you do not have flared ribs you should not have to worry though, the reverse Nuss does not involve resection of any ribs or cartilage.\n\nBut I would still look into a brace if I were you. You are still quite young, and if it is symmetrical and not that severe I am sure you can still have great result with a brace.\n\nI am not very updated in surgeons in Europe though, but IIRC there is one decent in Germany that is still active. Maybe someone else can chime in. Thanks for your answer. My case is very asymmetrical unfortunately. I have not researched a lot yet but I have seen people mentioning the more invasive (and more successful?) Ravitch procedure for PC. I want to get rid of it for good so maybe I will research different options. I do not think my chest if flexible enough for the brace though, it takes a lot of force to push it in. I do not really like the Ravitch procedure myself, but it holds some merit if you have very complex PC.\n\nThere are some really good surgeons out there that could probably fix even a asymmetrical case without resection of the ribs. But it really depends how your chest looks like.\n\nI strongly advise you to get at least the opinion of 2 different surgeons before choosing what to do. Also make sure they will explain in detail what they are going to do.\n\nI actually had 2 surgeries and both time they used only one bar to press down. And both times it has displaced.\n\nI even asked if we should not use two bars and both said one would be enough..\n\nI am probably going for a third operation but this time I am not going to accept less than 2 bars.\n\nI may sound crazy doing 3 separate surgeries, but since both times it was a complete fix for me before displacement.

Had surgery last March 2020. Huge improvement. Hoping to get the Sandwich Technique done as it is less invasive and I think would lead to a better aesthetic result.

Good luck with the future hardware removal Which surgeon are you considering for that? I only know of the South Korean surgeon that does that. Yeah is that Dr Park you are referring to? I do not have the budget for that but Dr Goldblatt and Dr Antippa in Australia (where i am from) apparently use the same technique which they learnt off Dr Park so i am trying to meet with them asap. I had the Ravitch when I was 20. I am now 27 and can say it did not go well. The carinatum came back plus I got excavatum on the other side. I think the reason for this result was because there was no hardware put into my chest and I might have had bad posture during the recovery stages.\n\nIf I were you, I would definitely go for the Sandwich procedure, but make sure your surgeon is experienced and has done a lot of them. I doubt your chest is too stiff for it. The results of the Sandwich procedure are amazing...way more consistent than the Ravitch, plus the bars will train you to stand up straight. Sorry to hear that! Have you sought any other treatment since? Yeah I am really hoping I can have the sandwich done, I have been trying to fly over to consult with the surgeons for quite a while now but it is tricky with covid. Fingers crossed it will happen soon UPDATE: Any got any progress pictures to share? Could use the motivation. Cheers I have had two surgeries. One Abramson and one sandwich.\n\nBoth made my posture way better and removed my back pain. But both failed in the end (bar moved) so then I went back to baseline (slightly better still). Oh i am sorry to hear that. Any idea why they failed? How old are you if you do not mind me asking? The first one (Abramson or reverse Nuss) was performed by Dr Schaarschmidt in Germany. I think I was like 20-21 at the time. \n\nHe used only 1 bar with 2 stabilizers because it would be enough according to him. The thread / wire holding one of the stabilizers snapped maybe 1-2 months after surgery and I started to slowly regress over the course of 6 months or so until it stabilized.\n\nAlso since I have rib flare and he told me he could fix it also without going into specifics. I can tell you now though, that whatever he did to my costal cartilage it was not for the better.\n\nSecond surgery done by Dr Park in South Korea, sandwich technique. I was 23 years old at this time.\n\nSame story here, great result initially but he again used only 1 bar pushing down (with 2 bars pushing up).\n\nIt looked super good at first and he even managed to fix my costal cartilage with his \"magic string\" technique.\n\nThe thread / wires holding it all together broke again though, the bars are currently protruding through my skin and I can move / wiggle them with ease.\n\nSo yeah, probably they should have used 2 bars pushing down. I think Dr Park does most of his surgeries on younger kids.\n\nI was really careful after both surgeries to not do anything that I should not do. But it did not help. Probably my ribcage was just stiffer than they both anticipated.\n\nI do not hold a grudge or anything, but I can say both of them was kind of nonchalant about it, instead of offering a redo / reattach the bars.\n\nPaid both times out of pocket.\n\nReally sucks now though when I know how good it can look and feel when the sternum is in the right place. I am planning to do another surgery, but if that will also fail I am probably done with it. Geez that sucks, I imagine that would have been really demoralizing, especially with how expensive those operations would have been. Hopefully your next operation is a success, who are you planning to go with?\n\nThanks for sharing though, i am 28 so I imagine my sternum ribcage will be very stiff. I am planning on operating with Dr GoldBlatt and Dr Antippa in Australia who perform the Sandwich Technique. I cannot afford to travel overseas for surgery so i am hoping they can operate on me. My ribcage and shoulders are really narrow (especially compared to my hibs) at the moment so i am hoping the sandwich technique could make my ribs and shoulder width even a little broader as the ribs are flattened out. Did you notice any changes like that after the Dr Park op when the ribs were temporarily in the right place? Yeah as you push your sternum / ribs in it will widen a little bit.\n\nI do not think it would help much with shoulder width though, my shoulders always been naturally wide. \n\nBut with rib cage width for sure. I have x-rays pre / post surgery and it showed my ribcage got 4-5 cm wider over the lower part of the sternum. But this was after first operation. \n\nDr Park was not as aggressive in pushing the sternum down. Pre op my haller index was 1.8. After first surgery 2.5 (this is best / healthiest value). \n\nDr Park only corrected me to about 2.2 and  I am currently sitting at just over 2.0. But he totally corrected the rib flare, so it looked really great overall. \n\nI would discuss in depth with your surgeons what they will do before you decide. Like will they put 2 bars pushing down or only 1 etc. Also what they will do incase the bar moves or you get any other complications. \n\n Can you compress your sternum at all with your hands right now? If you can it is not that stiff. \n\nI am probably going to try a Chinese doctor next called Wenlin Wang. I have had some contact with him over phone and he seems like a good doctor. He have developed a few novel techniques when it comes to chest wall surgeries. \n\nAnd he agrees with me that older individuals with PC should always have 2 bars pushing down, because the risk of regression is to high otherwise. \n\nYeah it is been a long and costly journey, but on the other hand if I did not do anything I would regret it even more. \n\nAt least I am not in debt, because I started working at age of 15 to save money for surgery after the Swedish medical system denied me any help. Hmm okay that is interesting, thanks for sharing. Would you mind sharing before and after pics or scans? I would be interested to see the difference.\n\nI cannot really compress my sternum so it is pretty stiff, hopefully the sandwich technique is still possible, even if they have to do a mini ravitch first.\n\nAh i have heard of Wenlin Wang, seems to be experienced in treating barrel shaped ribcages like mine. I would be interested to hear how you go consulting/receiving treatment with him.\n\nThanks a lot for the advice. Good luck! I could do that yes, I will send you a PM when I have time to log onto my PC. The files are kind of big in size though, so I am not sure best way to share.\n\nI contacted him his the app \"WeChat\". His name is \"Wangwenlinyisheng\". Just send him a message and he will be quick to respond. Awesome that would be great if it is not too much trouble, thanks.\n\nOk will do", "Any tips for hiding the brace under clothes? I currently have the motivation to wear my brace anywhere but school.

Never really noticed that my chest muscles are uneven, but i do not really have much chest muscles so yeah haha. My top abs also do not really are noticeably different, at least never really noticed. Good luck bro! I think the best is to fix it as soon as possible because it will get harder on a later age. Thanks for the advice! How long do u think it will take for me to get it fixed, or does it really differ per situation?

Problem is I have no clue what any of prices are in UK I do not want to be spending more than a grand on it\ud83d\ude02 Yes, I understand. The question is what you find more important, feeling insecure about it and all that stuff, or getting the brace.

I put my stamina naturally higher than athletes peers who train similarly I believe it can, however in many cases it does not. For most people, PC has no physiological symptoms. It does affect the lung capacity and lumg capacity affect stamina. In like 90% of cases, no, it does not. It  absolutely does. \n\n\n\nThey did a study on 260 people with pectus carinatum and every single one of them had reduced stamina and dyspnea (laboured breathing). I notice it in myself and my case is not even that severe. From what I understand the chest wall is more rigid and the lungs are misshapen, which stops you from exhaling completely, some of the air always stays in your lungs which means you never really are able to take a full breath. This is also the reason asthma and lung infections are a lot more common in people with pidgeon chest. Okay. I am in high school cross country as of now, and although I have the right build for it, and am active and healthy, I cannot keep up with some of my peers. We do all the same exercises but I just have a natural stamina disadvantage. \n\nHowever I do not notice any breathing abnormalities, and no ones ever commented on it.

I have horrible stamina and I am always out of breath. Will this get fixed with a brace, or would I need surgery?\n\n2. Have any of you all seen the PC come back after removing brace?\n\n3. Is it a waste of money if I am 19? Not much is known regarding braces and people who are mostly developed, but worst case scenario I could sell my brace online and make back a good amount of my money. Wow I had a brace a long time ago but I do not actually know the answers to any of your questions sadly.\n\n1) I do not see why it would get fixed. When trying to get insurance to cover my surgery I did a bunch of respiratory tests to try and prove the carinatum had negative effects. Not sure there was a ton of evidence to support or deny any effects.\n\n2) I do not see why it would come back, but I do believe it is more effective when you are younger and more malleable. I have no idea where I am remembering this information from, but for some reason I feel like there is a better chance of it coming back the older you get\n\n3) I think the best money I ever would have spent would have been on the $100k surgery. Fortunately, I ended up getting a brace which was somehow covered by insurance while surgery was not...? I would try to see if the brace can be covered under a policy, but even if not, and your PC is bad, and it can be fixed, it is hard to put a price on fixing it. If that worst case scenario is true, then I would not worry about the money at all 1. Regarding brace and stamina. My guess would be that you need surgery in order to improve stamina. You are past your puperty age where bones and tissue develops. But i would recommend you talk to a doctor. Because everyone is different end every hospital had different procedures for surgery. Some procedures dont fix stamina (mine didnt).\n\n2. Dont know have never had a brace.\n\n3. I would say its waste of money.  I am currently wearing a big clamshell brace and I asked my doctor about the stamina problem and always feeling out of breath. She said it was cuz my bones were pushing on my diaphragm or something causing me to not be able to take in as much oxygen. Idk how she knows this for sure cuz I have not gotten an X-ray for it", "Can i get a brace and go on a bracing routine without a doctor?

I cant fit in normal shirts without it just not working and it has just become a huge burden to me. I have considered self harm bc of it too. I went to the doctor and he just said to wait until i am done growing but i know for a fact itll get worse. it has consumed so much of me and it is just so draining. How old are you? I am almost 15 Start bracing. Definitely do not do nothing when it is such a great burden to you. I have had surgery one year ago on my 38th. Should have done that 20 years earlier or started with bracing back then. Do not ever let your PC affect who you are or be an influence of how you think of yourself. Talk to your parents / friends and start making a difference thanks man. I tried to get a brace from the doctor but was denied so i might end up buying my own bc I have enough money for it but it is still quiet a bit. Really good that you have a plan to fix it! 15 is the perfect age to start bracing. If you have the money, go for it. Look into pectusservices.com he goes by t-joe he is the one who invented the brace in the 90s in the U.S.\n\nTwo things on top of that. You need patience and perseverance if you are going to make it. Good luck friend. If you feel like harming yourself you can talk to me. I have been through the same experience as you, I am almost 22 and I have also struggled with happiness when I was a teen. It gets better, trust me I know how you feel. Right now I am probably the happiest I have ever been in a long time Yea I do have actually diagnosis and stuff but the body problem is just something that feeds into it. I am medicated which helps but I also am into clothes and fashion and stuff and I always look in the mirror when trying something on and just hate how it fits and stuff From experience, my fashion choice was very limited. I only wanted to wear what would hide my deformity. The best advice I could give is to continue working out, try a workout plan online and get into counting your calories and macronutrients. From statistics, most people with pc are skinny like I am. If that is the case for you, you would just need to eat a lot more to fuel your body for exercises Yea I usually wear puffers, hoodies and oversized shirts a lot with jeans usually. I have noticed that tank tops actually hide it too better than tee shirts. Lee's fabric I think idk I always wore button down shirts, and after I have been working out for a while I started wearing t shirts and tank tops. Some people actually use to compliment my chest mistaking it for big chest muscles. Yea that is happened before in tanks for me. I have a pretty lean body build too so the more muscle I have the more it is noticable ig Definitely start bracing ASAP. Pectus joe in US Or London Orthotics consultancy in UK. I know LOC does remote bracing too can highly recommend them dont wait till ur done growing bro my doctor said the same shit to me when i was like 6 and it only got worse and worse as i got older.

Also ab work outs are also good for helping with masking pc Start with 50 to 100 pushups everyday.  Then add 10 when your ready until your doing 200 pushups a day.  At your age, you will see results in a month if you are consistent and stick to it.  If you have a good spot or two sturdy chairs, you can add dips into your routine.  Then when 200 pushups are becoming too easy, get a gym membership and start bench pressing, chest flys, and dumbbell presses. Also do not be afraid to gain a little bit of weight, assuming you are lean, most people with pc are. Try counting calories and macronutrients, and put yourself in a caloric surplus. Muscle and a bit of fat will help with strength and you will be a lot happier with your body Now is the best time for bracing. Building up the chest hides it. But it will get worse and symptoms could start coming on. Does it grow much after 17? Because I am 17 now just wondering if it will get worse Not really, but the older you get, the harder it is for a brace to correct it later in the years. Assuming he can do 50 pushups now.

I have never been officially diagnosed as when I went to the doctors and hospital they had no idea what it was but after a couple of Google searches when I was older it became obvious.\n\nI do suffer from shortness of breath when exercising but other than that no other troublesome symptoms. I am 18 weeks pregnant and it has only just occurred to me that the pregnancy may cause further issues. I would love to know if anyone has been pregnant with it or just has any information as I cannot find any anywhere. I have started to get a few pains in my sternum so need to know whether I should worry and consult my midwife? I am just worried because before they had no idea what it was just said they would never seen anything like it and that was at the hospital! So if I say something now they might not be able to give me any advice.\n\nAny advice or information would be so greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you :) Good luck, I cannot even imagine the struggles of being female with pectus. Hope you find good advice! Thank you :) it is alright, it did mean I had really small boobs and no clevage as well lol but I am quite tall and thin so it was not too bad. Very good question.  As a male, I obviously have no experience.  When my primary doctor saw my condition (and he was the first medical professional to even mention it when I was like 25), he had to Google it - I seemed to know more about it than he did.  I say this to emphasize how rare this condition is.  It may be very difficult to even find doctors with a lot of good information on how it affects pregnancy (or how pregnancy might uniquely affect you).  That being said, I have never heard of any issues with pregnancy.  The only problems I have ever read about are the obvious potential psychological issues, and the shortness of breath that you described.  I will take a quick look to see if there is anything in the literature, but a doctor who has some experience would be a much better resource (they are just not going to be easy to find, and I believe the condition is more common in males, making you a rare deviation from a rare deviation of a somewhat rare deformity \\). So I literally found (1) paper dealing with women with PC, and it was on surgical management.\n\n(\n\nNo mention of complications with pregnancy, but you may find some interesting information within, nonetheless.  It again emphasizes that the condition is pretty rare among females.  To quote the paper:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\" Nonetheless, surgical correction remains controversial with divergent opinions expressed regarding whether PE and PC are primarily cosmetic disorders, or if they cause physiologic impairment  \"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, according to the literature and the medical community, there are not even enough medical issues to conclusively state that surgery is necessary.  This makes me think issues with pregnancy are unlikely.  However, I have heard of excavatum being a condition which does in fact require surgery (this makes sense, as the cartilage and breastbone are developing inward towards some very vital organs).  While this does not apply to your case, it does make me wonder about the validity of the above statement, unless they were referring to carinatum specifically, which does not appear to be the case.  Good luck and congrats! Thank you, that article is interesting. I think I would be more worried if I had PE so it should be alright hopefully! I found one hospital in the UK that has information on PC and surgery so I think I will shoot a call or email to them and ask if they know anything about pregnancy. I find it incredible how vast the internet is and how little info there is on PC!

The treatment is a modified Ravitch procedure. The abnormal cartilage needs to be removed and we will frequently do a small resection of the sternum to straighten it. Happy to answer any other questions about the repair. I had a mixture of the both. I had the Nuss bar at 16 (I am now 29) by my first doctor, although second opinions have all said that he should not have bothered since it is not recommended for a mix of pe and pc. Like the last commenter said, usually a modified Ravitch is recommended. I had this at 21 and 8 years later still have amazing results.

My chest is not perfect but to a stranger looking at it, to them they would not notice. I do not have what the first commenter shared, which is the horseshoe version, I had a chest that was more of an S shape, raised on the right and dipped on the left. It was very severe and the rotation of my sternum was very big.

I am from Serbia and those methods are rarely used, it is a shame because it is so effective. The price can go up to 3500 USD, but your insurance could cover a part or even the most of it (rarely covers everything). I cannot give you precise information for price and availability, every country is different. Now regarding the pain, as I said I still have not tried it yet, based on what other people told me it is uncomfortable and painfull, but you get used to it and it gets easier. But do not let the pain discourage you, everyone who I asked about the brace told me that they would do it even if the pain was twice as big and that it is worth to try it.

I also have stretch marks from fast growth on my back, and I am also 193. There is one sentence that turned my life arround, it says: \"No pain, no gain!\". You have grown enoug, you can start working out in gym, it will help with pain as it will make your body more stable and resistant. Also, you could get some mass honestly because everything you have eaten went into height. Sorry if I am being boring about the gym, but honestly it turned my life arround and it feels so good when you accomplish something by your own work.

Also if the brace end up being too expensive (hopefully you will get covered by the insurance), you can always find a job for your free time.

Good luck at your appointment! You are welcome in this community even if you do not end up having Pectus Carinatum, us chest wall deformity people got to stick together. Damn, I have seen online that it is not fixable, do you know anything about surgery for it? The only thing I have heard is about it developing from COPD, but I was born with it. I do not have an answer for ya, but I can tell you they absolutely can be associated with one another. I do not know enough about flared ribs, whether they happen in isolation etc. Check out this link though, may help\n\n Well then I suppose that rules out barrel chest if you were born with it, does the other side of your chest stick forward like this side? If not then it could be an extreme case of unilateral Pectus Carinatum That looks like barrel chest. Unfortunately there is very limited options.\n\nIt is a sign of an underlying problem in most cases. Typically it can signal COPD in later life or something serious.\n\nI dont think there are proper treatments for it. Not sure if surgery is available?\n\nEdit: there are different causes. Some are born typically barrel chest is classed as \"concearning\" since it can cause problems or trigger underlying.\n\nIf you are born with it. Its probably just one of those things sadly.

As I work my way up, I have a question regarding sleeping. How do you guys sleep with the brace?\n\nI usually sleep on my back, but with the brace, the back pads dig into my skin and I feel that the front pad reduces its pressure as my body sinks down into the bed. What is the best position to sleep in my case that will keep the brace at max efficiency and pressure? Thanks. Oof. My first knights with the brace were terrible. Everyone with a brace has to do it at some point. I do best sleeping on my side, as it provides the most comfort in comparison to the other options. You will get used to however you sleep. If you are still adamant on sleeping on your back, I suggest putting sheep skin on the part that is digging in. Makes the nights so much better. Okay so this worked for me. I wore my brace as long as I could  during the day then took it off, and repeat. At night I would recommend a memory foam mattress topper they are affordable and feel amazing. I used to sleep on a normal mattress and I got back pain and I could not sleep. So I did not wear my brace in bed until I accually was going to fall asleep. I would wake up at 2 in the morning or earlier and just take it off because I was in pain, and take ibuprofen. Then I kept repeating this process for about a week and a half until I finally could go the whole night with it on, and through the whole day. If you are in pain take it off because you are just starting out and you need your body to adjust.  When I first started I could only wear my brace for 20 min at a time before I took it off. Then every day I wore it longer and longer. I also used numbing cream on my sides, back and chest, but that did not work too well because it still hurt. But I would say it took 2 weeks for the pain to go away and then a month for the discomfort to go away. After that I was so used to it I forgot I even had it on. Hope this helps", "Question Can you do bracing when your pectus is asymmetrical? Yes you can. That is why it is important to get a custom made brace. That is good. Now I just need a CT scan and if it is bad enough, I can see a thoracic surgeon who I have heard does a bracing program for PC. Most of the carinatum patients are asymmetrical. I do not routinely get CT scans for these patients, since there is no Haller to check or cardiac compression. Also the first line treatment is usually a brace unless there are reasons not to (anatomy, pain, etc). Just an exam and a measurement of pressure for brace fitting is sufficient.", "Should I seek professional advice from a GP/doctor before buying a brace? In late 2019 I spoke to my GP as I was complaining of my chest hurting, the fix at the time was to stop lying on my chest at the time. We discussed a brace for both my chest and scoliosis but then Covid 19 happened and I have not been back as I do not want to block up the surgery. I am in the UK so it will most likely be covered under the NHS as I am under 18.\n\nAnother question I have is will it make my lower ribs go in? They jut out really far which combined with my chest makes my body look all bumpy, especially when I am bloated. The lower ribs condition is called flared ribs, and yeah it can also be fixed with a **quality** brace.\n\nI would probably talk to some kind of doctor since you also have scoliosis. But the ones making the brace should also be knowledgeable in this matter. Sorry to disappoint but I do not think your be able to get a brace free on the NHS. I could be wrong but I did check into it and could not. \n\nOne thing I would recommend is do not cheap out on the brace.

When I was skinny, I was very young, but as I got older I gained weight. I started losing weight a year or two ago and lost over forty pounds or so. As I lost weight I noticed my chest would not follow the rest of my body in slimming out. I just figured I held more fat in my chest, and while I was rather embarrassed about it, I thought it would eventually flatten out. Turns out, it is not going to flatten out. I took my shirt off in front of my friends and they just looked at me and said \"dude, you are not fat. You are like big boned, but actually big boned.\" They did not make fun of me and kept saying I had a burly chest and that It will look really good with some muscle on me.

I am not from Australia but Germany. Maybe I can help you. The health insurance system does not cover the operation unless your PC is causing massive health problems. It is costing around 6k \u20ac so 10k Australian $. In addition to this, you probably have to pay for a Rehabilitation and/or a brace to keep your sternum in position after surgery. So you will end up with something around 15k +-5k in Australian $.\nNO GURANTEE FOR THESE NUMBERS.\nThese are my assumptions from my German POV. I live in Aus, got my PC corrected in Berlin with Dr. Klaus Schaarschmidt. The surgeons in Aus were not that experienced with nuss surgery in 2014, not sure now. I think all up in cost about 25-30k.

I was around 12 years old when I first found out I had pectus carinatum. I tried the brace option however that did not work for me because it was difficult to where out in public. It only works effectively if you wear it often. When I was 16 I decided I wanted to undergo surgery because I was very insecure about my body. I went to my doctor, saw a surgeon and scheduled an appointment for surgery. I had surgery at the age of 17. It was the ravitch procedure. The surgeon broke some of my ribs, realigned them and placed a metal strut bar across to hold them in place until they grew back in a normal position.They placed an epidural on my back before the surgery which helped a lot with the pain. It was very painful but still manageable. I do not regret it and am very pleased with the results. I stayed at the hospital for six days. On the first day I slept a lot and did not feel much of the pain. The second day was the worst It felt very uncomfortable and I could feel the metal bar they had place across my chest. The next four days were still painful but not as bad. I had to sleep on my back for the next two months and needed help getting up from bed for a few weeks after. I also needed assistance to shower for a few weeks after. By about two months I was able to do things on my own. I returned to school and was almost back to normal. It is been six months since my surgery and I feel amazing. I am so happy I went through with it and do not regret it one bit. I am so pleased with the results. I will be going back in six more months to get the metal bar removed. I wanted to share my experience because I know there are not many girls with pectus carinatum and I remember searching for similar experiences.  Nice to know you are doing well!

Hey all, i recently got my brace, and am thinking about wearing while i sleep instead of during the day. the problem is that the orthosis maker said that i should sleep on my back with it, but i am a side sleeper and definitely will not be able to sleep with it while on my back. Has anyone here slept with their brace while on their side and did you find that it caused complications? Did you end up have to switch to doing something else because the side sleeping didnt have the same therapeutic value/messed up the alignment of the brace?\nMy other question is, i am just a bit worried about the way it squishes my boobs, has anyone who is also a young adult and female had any issues with the brace causing problems for your breasts? Pain? Sagging?\n\nOn a side note, i got the brace because i suspected that my pc was the cause of my very bad back pain i get: that the hunched way my back is, is because of this deformity.

I am worried that i am actually going to cause worse deforment of my back- should i hold off on wearing the brace until i can speak with the thoracic surgeon again, or was this also a problem you noticed? (As background, my pc is only on the right side of chest, so i wondered if the pressing in the back was due to the front panel being centered to the right... either way the back pain the brace is causing is so bad, its the same level i normally get after hours of activity, but now in a short time).\nThanks to anyone who is able to answer my questions!

I wore braces for 1.5 years.\n\nThis is the same thing, but for my chest. The reason I justify bracing is because such the protrusion is such a rare condition/defect. People get rhinoplasty surgery all the time (nose job) - it is common. People get braces for their teeth- it is common. But no one ever see's a protruded chest wall and ribcage like this. For this reason, I feel way more insecure because no one can relate. People will happily be chatting me and all of a sudden see my chest and say: \"huh, what is this. and touch my chest.

You should try bracing because you clearly want to give it a try. \n\nMay I just point out that your PC is so mild? Like brother, even if I am trying my hardest to look for it (and I can spot PC easily since I have it and notice it on others) it is really hard to even see some deformity on you. \n\nI honestly feel like it makes your chest look bigger and better.\n\nIf you want to try bracing, go ahead. But for that kind of money perhaps it is better money spent elsewhere.\n\nGood luck brother.

After the surgery things got better very soon. After a 1,5 month the pain was almost gone. After 2 month I started doing everything again. Like cycling, working out and stuff. Had no pain or never felt bad.\n\nThe surgery had a big positive influence on my life. things changed a lot. Everything I did hiding my PC is gone. Life is better, and I am feeling great. So, just want to share this with you guys. Have a nice day! Looks great! congrats, awesome result congrats bro Looks amazing.\n\nDo you have any before pictures? Who did the surgery? Any internal bars? How many cartilages did he remove? Was it assymetrical or symmetrical? Yeah we need a before pic bro I have posted a before pic about 7 months ago when I informed this sub about my surgery. Removed it, as I will with this pics in a view weeks. Will post it via Imgur later today including a pic of the removed cartilage. They removed 8 in total. Did not have any internal bars, the surgery was done in the Netherlands by dr. Morshuis in Nijmegen. Had a slightly assymetrical PC. It is one of the best Ravitch\u2019s I have seen - congrats. Do you know how many Ravitch procedures your doctor did before you? Thank you. Also very pleased with the result :)\nMy doctor is performing the modified Ravitch for almost 8 years and he does several a week. He is an artist. I have seen some pictures from other surgery\u2019s where the PC was very extreme. The after pic was amazing. \n\nBtw; here are the pics;\n\n Thanks for posting great results, considering this op too I am not surprised he does so much. Thanks for the pics. \n\nDo you have any lingering effects from the surgery that you did not have previously? Tight chest? Any trouble breathing? No. Only thing is a light numb feeling around the area of the incision. Hey, wondering what the top of your est looked like pre and post surgery? Did it stick out much ? Hi! It did stick out pretty much... ( They had to remove the excessive cartilage from 8 ribs to repair it. Thanks for the reply man, this really put into perspective how much of a difference the surgery has made! Links have expired it seems. Any chance you could dm them to me? I may be having the ravitch op done soon so i would love to see your before/after pics if possible. Thanks Wow man... this looks great. And youve had it done at 39?! That Is mad. Your before pic looks a lot like my current situation. Where are you/your doctor based? \\*scrolls down again\\* The Netherlands! Thanks for sharing your results! You are welcome and thanks for your compliments! How much did it cost Nothing. Insurance covered it up. I am from the Netherlands so things work a bit different here. But it will cost you about 15k - 25k depending on hospital, length of stay and type of surgery. No I cannot remember having those symptoms. Great to here you are planning the surgery. Good luck with that!", "Doctors visit So i just recently went to the doctor to see if i could get a brace. the doctor said that health insurance would only pay for it if it was a surgery or if i was in pain because of it so He just said that I would have to wait it out and see what happens but i know it will just get worse as time goes on B/C that is what has already happened.

But why would you not do it / lie about it?\n\nThe brace is not for the doc, it is for you. The only one you are hurting not doing the exercises are yourself.\n\nIf you want a good result, I would suggest you take this serious. I know but I never really cared about my posture, the bug thing for me was my chest which is now virtually fixed, I tried doing the exercises at the start but they took an hour and half to do everyday and I just do not have the motivation, anyways thbjs Well it is your body.\n\nBut it is likely you will have bodily aches when your older if you do not fix your posture.\n\nIdk what exercises they gave you, but it would be enough with 15-30 min daily I am sure.\n\n1-1.5 h is excessive. Hello again, you motivated me to try posture excercises again, just wondering how long it took you for your posture to be completely normal I still have some PC, I have bars inside which moved and forced me into an awkward position.\n\nIt you do exercise with the brace on, it should show good progress within 2 months is my estimate. Great thanks so much\n\nBut how did not you lose motivation, I was given instructions to do these excercises for 2 months before I even got my brace, and I got burnt out before I even got the bloody thing Well for once I like to workout and also I knew of a few people who have PC without bracing that are on their 40/50's. All have back issues due to the sternum pulling on their backs.\n\nI do not want to have back pain in my 40's so I rather fix it asap I guess.\n\nAlso I would not exercise 1+ hours, but just 10-15 minutes a day. Maybe twice some days.\n\nWith that said I have had two surgeries which both failed (bars moved). If I could go back in time and get a brace instead I would, but not even one doctor thought about it at that time.\n\nIf I could brace and workout 10+ hours a day I would do it instead of surgery (but I was to old). Surgery sucks and it is expensive asf (with no guarantee). Thanks, you make a lot of great points.\n\nI really do not want back pains when I am older because i know that will cost me a good amount of money in the future with meds not even to mention the pain\n\nBut I am always fighting with myself to do something I know is important,There is a part of me in the back of my head that knows I am going to give just as fast as I started because this is going to be the third time starting them again\n\nBut I am sorry to hear about your surgery,truth be told I wanted to get surgery initially but my parents did not allow it, but after hearing about your experience I am humbled", "How to wear a bra/bikini with Pectus Carinatum? It is not easy finding girls that have this chest deformity like me. It is so hard to find a right fitting bra for me. Whenever I wear an underwire push-up bra I have so much pain and it just sucks. It lowers my self confidence knowing that I cannot be the best version of myself. Is anyone else going through the same thing, any advice?", "Accepting our condition and my story. Hello everyone, \n\nSince a lot of the posts on this subreddit are focused towards surgery and bracing I want to give an account of my story as someone who did not get either of those. I am an 18 year old with quite a prominent pectum. However I am fortunate to live in a country where I was diagnosed early (at 13) and offered treatment. However, I refused it. As the years went by my PC became more prominent to the point you could see it through tight fitting shirts. My friends, extended family, and others noticed it just as I entered the tough years of highschool. This led to me being nicknamed \"traffic cone\" and bullied by other guys and girls. This was obviously taxing on my mental health as people would touch it in the hallways and point it out every single day. At this point you may think; \"Why not get a brace, or get surgery\"? And to that question I cannot give a clear answer. The bottom line is that I felt it important to overcome this challenge. How could I ever love any part of myself if I did not accept this one? \n\nSo, I began to look around at others and saw that absolutely none of them were perfect. Lazy eyes, flat feet, acne, moles, bad hair lines, massive foreheads, and ugly knees were amongst hundreds of features that they had. This made me realise that even though my \"feature\" was quite large, I was not abnormal, and other people had weird things just like me. I also pushed myself mentally. I went to places where people could see my chest like the beach and even though it was painful, I pushed through. People noticed, but after the initial shock of seeing my chest the person I was talking would just treat me like I was any other guy. Most did not bring it up more than once. That helped me to see that having my chest out in public would not drastically change what people thought of me. \n\nI also hit the gym, which I would really recommend as a solution. As I gained weight and muscle, people began to notice my chest less and less. I even found a positive side of it was that it made my pecs look bigger from the front! As someone else pointed out, having an above average physique helps as it gives you confidence in yourself and makes people view the pectus as less significant.\n\nThe mental and physical training I put myself through helped me to see past my PC. I no longer consider this a condition I am \"suffering\" from. I see it as a challenge I overcame, and a part of myself that makes me unique. Forget the people who bully you. Forget that voice inside your head that tells you to swim with a shirt on. Forget the people telling you it is so ugly that you need surgery. YOU decide. If you want/need bracing then YOU go out there and do it. However I promise that there is another way. That way requires you to push yourself, to cry, to struggle, and to fight. But I promise you that you will come out the other side victorious. I embraced my pectum and learnt what true self love is. You can too. Wow, this really just helped. I (19M) also have a quite noticable bump, and I would not say I got bullied but there was a bit of name calling. I did look into getting a brace but that form of treatment is not really available where I am. So in short I also had to just kind of deal. I will not lie and say that I am completely okay with my body yet, I still where a shirt at the beach and pool, ect. But I am getting to a point in my life where I give less of a shit about what other people think, which kind of helps.\nAnyways thanks for the boost. It is always nice to know there are other people going through similar things.", "what type of clothes to hide the braces?

I am wondering if this condition can lead to any effects later in life From what I have read, Pectus Carinatum is mostly a cosmetic defect. Although there have been reports of people have shortness of breath etc. It is always best to consult a doctor if you feel it is leading to breathing limitations. I have Pectus Carinatum, and I have troubles breathing through my nose, but that is because I have a deviation in my nose and it is blocked.", "I doubt it, but I am curious. Is anyone here ftm? Bc I need to know how the brace works with like chest binders and stuff. Can any females with a pectus tell me how the brace worked with your breasts?  You can use special designed braces which is designed based on your own body specifics I am FTM and extremely interested to hear any input as well. I am too told for a brace now and have already had top surgery but have always wondered about this. I am cis female, I just had to wear sports bras with my brace, because a wire would dig in under the brace. I can see a binder actually making the process more comfortable because I was generally more comfortable when I wore tighter sports bras with it. Thanks. That is incredibly helpful hello. i dont have anything relevant to add(i just learned what this is at 19, im currently looking into bracing whichll be hard af to find in my area) but wanted to say im also trans(mtf). its really hard to not feel like nature dunked on me, i started hormones and could finally pay attention to shit besides my secondary sex characteristics and i was apparently looking forward to fuckin pectus the whole time", "Our 6 year old was diagnosed with moderate PC We saw a nurse practitioner who specializes in bracing treatment for PC. She says it is too soon to brace him, as his chest will just \"pop back out\" if he does not wear the brace constantly. We are supposed to go back in 3 years or so to reevaluate but she is confident he will need to brace, and probably brace early, just seeing how far it has developed already.\n\nSo I guess I am wondering... how do I keep him confident and not self conscious about it? We talked about it pretty matter of factly at his appointment. He has always been outgoing and goofy with lots of friends. One to have his own style and flair and not care if other kids laugh at him for it. I would hate to see that crushed out of him by kids teasing him. Not that they would not ever find something else to tease about, but this seems like something that would make him an easy target. You can definitely see his chest sticks out under a tshirt. \n\nI am probably borrowing trouble by worrying about the future. I was bullied a lot as a kid and you know, you want to spare your kids from some of the shit you went through, if you can.\n\nI am also worried about the brace being uncomfortable? She made it sound like it really was not a big deal but reading first hand accounts makes it sound pretty miserable for at least the first few weeks. I have PC, but for me I did not really become noticeable until I was about 11 or 12 (22 now). Looking on the internet, mine is mild compared to others but it was still something that was noticeable and could be seen while I wore a shirt. \n\nFrom middle school through college I was always very self conscious about it and would where a hoodie or jacket whenever I could.  I guess to answer your worry about being teased, my real friends in middle school (who I am still friends with today) asked about it, I told them what it was and that was the end of it, we just moved on. I think he best thing you can tell your kid is that your real friends will not care, they may crack one joke here or there but that is what kids do. \n\nUnfortunately for me the doctors were not sure what I was dealing with and never recommended the brace to me. I wish that it would have been discussed and an option because I feel like it would have been helpful and something that I wanted to try. One of the best recommendations I can give is to start working out when it is a suitable age for him (early high school). I have taken weightlifting very serious over the last year and it has really helped to make my PC less noticeable. \n\nFeel like I was rambling a little bit sorry. Feel free to ask any other questions you may have! The advice I can give you is start early enough to prevent it from becoming an issue later on. Many of us have had bad experiences due to doctors with misinformation. If it is already visible through his shirt, I would seek immediate action before it becomes an issue in his adolescent years. Most importantly though, find a doctor you can trust! If you trust the current doctor then that is fantastic, but I had two doctors that gave me misinformation before I found a knowledgeable one.", "I have an question to everyone who has PC.

But I have heard it is helped others. The sooner the brace the better. Why are you scared of the brace? How old are you Hey dude! I would definitely recommend the brace, but for working out, just do exercises that workout your chest, such as push-up, bench press, etc. I hope I helped, and good luck! &gt;ago\n\nDo not just do stuff for chest though.

The most relevant parts are Part Seven and Eight, you can find the time stamps in the description and in the pinned comment. Please, share your thoughts with me, thank you.   \n It is painful to see people still use a homemade brace instead of a doctors one.\n\nFirstly,\n\nA doctor would measure the chest in my case to get the appropriate size for a brace.\nUsing your own is not advised in all circumstances.\n\nBraces made by professionals are ensured to be much more comfortable and safer followed by Excersise programs. And regular checkups\nThe disadvantage is this costs a lot of money. And GPS do not do it. Only some private surgery's do\n\nHomemade can work..but it can take longer If you do not know how long to wear them for.\n\n\nAlso great video. Very informative for people. *\"A doctor would measure the chest in my case to get the appropriate size*   \n*for a brace. Using your own is not advised in all circumstances.\"*\n\nYes, you are right, I cannot measure online, this is why I will require the patient to do it. We are talking about a 5-10 minutes long stuff. Also, I go further, I design both of my braces in a way, if the patients measurement is not a 100% correct, also if the patient lose/gain weight while he/she is under the treatment, the patient has the opportunity to adjust the brace A LOT.\n\n*\"Braces made by professionals are ensured to be much more comfortable and safer followed by Excersise programs.\"*\n\nI do not know why you think my brace is not comfortable, because I literally made a brace which is invisible under clothing, no \"professional\" did such a thing before. About safety, only the hard brace could hurt the patient, but I will make sure, that they do not over pull it. Beside that, it is common sense, when it starts to hurt, you have to stop.  \nAnd also, I do not know what do you think about me, but both my braces are 3D modeled and printed I make negative molds, positive castings, I even cast the foam, I bend and mill metal, and also I sew, I am curious how many \"professionals\" can do it.  \n\n\n*\"And regular checkups The disadvantage is this costs a lot of money.\"*\n\nBuddy, I will sell two braces for 400GBP with the full program and supervision, while these professionals charge 3200GBP upfront, and God knows how much with each checkup. I came from a poor family from eastern europe, and my family could have never afford this much money. I am glad you have the money for it, but many people do not and I want to help them too.\n\n*\"Homemade can work..but it can take longer If you do not know how long to wear them f*\n\nYou are right, that is why I made the supervision program, so I can check up on them, and made the corrections if they need it.\n\n\"Also great video. Very informative for people.\"  \n\n\nThank you, if no one is interested in my braces it is fine, but at least there is a comprehensive guide now, and I am making new videos about spinal deformities and many chest deformity related other conditions too. I wish there would have been a video like this when I was 13 years old... Fair enough. I actually respect what you are doing. Personally I feel there are not many places that actually do braces. So what you are doing is awesome. And I have to agree the prices they charge is disgraceful. I think what you are doing is right.\n\nI apologise for the way I worded my paragraph..from all the details you have provided. It is wrong for me to call it homemade. Its actually quite great how you get the models and use metals and sew. (I am not an expert on all the modeling stuff)\nI am not sure if you need to like pass safety checks. Since most if you sell with that quality are FDA approved? I am not too sure on all that stuff.\n\nBut with mine. My chest shape changed. So the brace had to be slightly tweaked. (The bar was molded again as it was causing pain) so I am not sure how you can approach that with people. \n\nBut keep at it. Hopefully people will see this.. as its much better than getting charged 1k. Yes, there are only a few clinics in the whole world which make braces, and everyone is pushing the surgery.\n\nI am not angry at you, it is still a homemade brace, I just do not like that it is degraded, and I barely put up some photos of a model which is not made for my chest (I know, it is my bad actually, but the guy who I made it for did not wanted to be in the video..)\n\nNo, it is not FDA approved (I live in the UK btw), but these braces do not require such an approval, as there is not even an organization let alone measurement system which could give a quality approval. It is in the same category as the so called \"posture\" braces are, and they are fully unregulated. The clinics charge so much because they can, they have no competition and you cannot do anything about it.  \n\n\n\"But with mine. My chest shape changed. So the brace had to be slightly   \ntweaked. (The bar was molded again as it was causing pain) so I am not   \nsure how you can approach that with people.\"  \n\n\nActually this is the dialogue what I want, and thank you for these two sentences.  \nMy \"hard\" brace works in a way which makes it highly adjustable in width. Depends on the measurements but the patient can easily make it 7-8 inches wider. Also, I use a super soft foam, it \"sits\" on the most protruding area, so only create high pulling force in a small area, while the other parts of the pad remain very soft. Also, the foam covers the padding, and also the padding and the \"bars\" are all rounded in every direction.  \n\n\nI highly doubt that anyone would \"outgrow\" it, or change their chest in such a way where it would be unusable.\n\nThe \"soft\" brace is follows the shape of your body, I will supply many bands with different lenghts, and strenght so the patients can find the most suitable one, and work their way up to the more and more stronger/shorter ones. Despite the \"padding\" is very slim, this brace is actually very comfortable too. No problem. Keep at it. I am happy you are doing this\n\nIn all honesty I would not call it homemade. Nearly all homemade braces do not have that much comfort and stability. Yours could pass as a proper brace. And looks the part. Keep it going. \n\nI would love to see you get a lot of requests for them. It will help families that may struggle with money.\n\nYour video seems to be getting more views\n\n\nI hope more people see it. What you are doing is phenomenal! Homemade does work. You just have to do it right. I did it with 3 belts and a roll of toilet paper. Took about a year before I got to the point of only needing it for sleep, but now I do not even need a brace. I just sleep on my stomach keeping constant pressure on my chest. I believe it is a lot safer than people think.", "Did anybody did pectus pectus carinatum surgery in canada?

If I had just been prescribed a brace to wear from age 11-13 I would have no pectus carinatum which I am really angry my doctor did not reccomend one. My pectus carinatum causes me more stress then it needs to. I do not think about it to often and am not too worried about it but it is just really annoying It constantly feels like something is out of place I just want it removed. I suspect it is the cause of the severe cramps I get when I run. Get the brace ASAP!", "how do you cope title said everything. my only hope is going on roids or paying 10 grand for a shitty surgery isnt it?", "Any doctors in Toronto Canada or close to Toronto? I noticed my pc when I was 12 now I am 15 and doctors have told me not to worry about or just to exercise and do stretches. It is not working.\n\nDoes anyone know of doctors that specialize in this that are located at or around Toronto?", "Anyone ever have trouble swallowing food?  No. why ?? I do. Pretty sure it is related to my condition. Turns out a lot of people with pectus Excavatum have trouble swallowing too, and my condition looks like something in between carinatum and excavatum,  so it makes sense I never had trouble swallowing, but sometimes I had trouble breathing (I have pectus carinatum), does anyone else have it? Very much so yes", "How well does the bulk up method work? And how much would I have to bulk up, because I do not want to become super strong like a bodybuilder. Does not work too well from my experience. Your rib cage is the foundation for any muscle you put on so it will still be uneven. But it is the best you can do if you cannot do the brace or surgery. I am at a stage we are people cannot notice it and even said how I used to have pectus but I still want to brace  or get surgery because it is very noticeable when I lie down and I just do not like the feeling of it. So you can probably bulk to a point we are people do not notice it but it will always still be there so it is not a valid solution at all. It honestly will come down to genetics. Everyone can gain, but muscle structure is different for everyone and it may not give you the look you are hoping for in reference to hiding the pectus. I did manage to cover it up, personally, however. It is absolutely worth a shot if you are symmetrical. Worked for me, i mean my chest is not perfect but i look pretty good and nobody seems to notice before i tell them about my condition. How much bulking up did it take?  I have been lifting since i was 16 years old so it is been 4 years. Went from 65kg to 90kg. I am 188cm if that matters. I really recommend that you start lifting if you enjoy it. It helps to hide the pectus but it also makes you confident and other bodyparts will look good so people will not be thinking about your chest at all. same I put on 30kg recently and it hid it quite a bit, and becoming stronger only helps me to think about my disfigurement less. Would not bulk too dirtily or it will be flabby though", "how bad is my PC? even my ribs are pushed in  Wrong sub. You got PE. nah my sternum is sticking out it is just that my ribs are pushed in for some reason it is probably because i am really skinny Also looks like you have flared ribs. how much kilos yoi have? and how much cm you are? i am 201cm and 68 kilos", "Too old to get braced, and too scared of surgery.

I feel like doctors should take in the account the psychological suffering when covering the costs of the procedure not just physical pain:( Yeah I have thought about surgery I just do not know if I could handle the physical pain after the procedure I have heard it is extremely Painful I will probably just gain some weight and move on. At least I have got all my limbs and I am healthy could be a lot worse tbh yeah im scared of that shit too but if the lil kids get the surgery ill try to power through it too ... I started doing calisthenics and eating more because of it and it looks better but I am still anxious and self conscious about it. I try to look at it as just pain that will end sooner or later but the psychological shit will prevent me for living my life to the fullest ... I have not been on a vacation for 6 or 7 years now, since 9th grade I do not think that could have been braced to begin with. It is not \"normal\" pectus carinatum as your sternum does not seem to be affected.\n\nBut you do have some deformation going on with your rib / cartilage but it looks to be under the sternum. It is super fucking painful for the first couple of days. Then pretty painful a couple of weeks. \n\nAfter 2 months you are not even noticing it.\n\nAll in all, it is not that bad. I mean it is awful at first but it goes over quickly.\n\nOvercoming suffering is strength. We got almost the same version, lifting weights has been the best solution for me. You are so hot. Lol.

I do not think it is effective in adulthood because the main point of a brace is to prevent your sternum from growing outward and also pushing it inward. Your body is more \u201cmalleable\u201d at a younger age. At your age I would imagine your chest bones are mostly fully grown. \n\nThere are surgical options like Ravitch procedure which are very effective, but that is an invasive process that comes with greater complications and more costly if not covered by insurance. \n\nWhy not speak with your doctor to see what your best options are?

It is not what they are made from, it is the fact that you need an educated specialist to get the treatment.

Every now and then I would get pressure sores and had to make things to keep the pressure off of certain areas for a day or to, so I would definitely ask your doctor about what to do if pressure sores become a problem. As for sports after about 2 or 3 weeks of wherein it 24/7 except for showers I was allowed to take it off for my cross country practice so I did not have any problems there really.

Haha thanks man, its all good, thanks for the compliment :) im 16 and am deciding whether i should get the brace, questions id like to ask if youre willing to answer although they can be highly subjective but a rough estimate would suffice: How expensive is the brace ? how long would i need to keep it on? do you think its worth it based on your experience? How is it worse than average? It is hardly noticable. Maybe it just the muscle covering most of it, but I can barely tell there is anything wrong.

Pain was bad during the first 2 weeks, breathing is not a problem, it is a bit shorter, but it is almost normal. The pain was definately bareable and worth it. After some time it becomes normal for you, almost no pain, feels almost like wearing a T-shirt, obviously harder, but you get used to it. How close is your chest to being 100% flat? Is there a noticeable change after 3 months? It is very noticeable. My rib chest still stick out a bit, but it is because of something else. I have a large ribcage naturaly, and I am skinny.

Depends if it is a structural or postural problem, I assume it is kyphosis. Postural can be fixed by fiximg muscle imbalances, steuctural can only be fixed woth surgery and I do not think it is worth it. If it is just a sloght curve, working out will cover it easily.

I have opened up to some people about it and all of them said that had I not pointed it out they would not have noticed it. Your overall presence and confidence outweighs an imperfect chest in every aspect of life so you should accept yourself the way you are and focus on the things you can influence about yourself.

I am likely going to be doing that soon when I get my brace and curious to hear how others have dealt with that successfully or not Dont bench press with a brace. It isnt really healthy. My specialist gave me a book of exercises I needed to do. Include types of press ups. Stretching exercises with band to make heat flexable Ok interesting. Why is not it healthy? I do not think it is a good idea. The sweat and heat will build up causing your skin to get irritated and potentially getting damaged. If that happens you will have to stop your bracing and wait a few weeks until the skin has gotten better. Ahh that is an interesting point. Yeah and my skin is sensitive so that would likely happen.

If you do it, do it with very small weight, but what is the point then?\n\nSquats are not even doable with proper form, if you do it you can seriously injure your back and spine, obviously it is not good for the heart for same reason as bench press.

I am usually a very athletic person, very skinny but always had to exercise in some or another.\n\nPC has impacted me in so many ways that it is been so hard to express myself about it, I even took about 2 months before even finding this subreddit and actually write about this, sorry. As a result of my PC, I figured the best way for someone not to find out is to basically not having many people who could find out about it, as a result I do not have many friends, I never had a girlfriend and I do not let anyone touch my chest.\n\nI am writing this right now because I am scared, scared of never being able to find someone to trust, to tell my biggest insecurities, I am tired of hiding myself, I am an easey going person but this has made me shy, girls have been attracted to me many times but never actually moved forward to having absolutely anything because my PC would not let me.\n\nI just do not want to be scared anymore, I want to be better, I want to be normal.\n\nI need help to solve this situation, I really do and I think it is time for me to do it, but because I am living alone since I was 17 (I am 20 at the moment) I have limited resources.

What did you go through and what challenges did you have to confront? Try harder to get the consult. See this as your first challenge.\n\nI have had the surgery in March this year. A few days before the pandemic started. I am from Holland so things work a bit different here. Struggled with PC way too long (20-25 years), and finally did the right thing. Got a referral from my GP (emotional en physical reasons) and was scheduled for a Ravitch procedure at the Radboud Ziekenhuis in Nijmegen done by dr. Morshuis. The surgery itself was pretty intens. They removed the extra amount of cartilage from 8 ribs (4x2) and then the recovery started... first week of just laying down with no moving at all. Then 2 weeks of rest and not being able to lift anything. 6 weeks sleeping on the back. After 3 weeks I started with very light (breathing) exercises and after 1,5 month I have started with muscle strengthening in the gym. Now (8 months later) I am hitting the gym 4 times a week and things are developing great! Never felt and physically looked better. Game changer. First of all, I am really happy you could overcome your PC, congratulations :)\n\nSecond, after the surgery you had to recover for about 3 months or so, how were you able to cope? That is too long without working at your job, which means no income and without the income how were you able to live? What about the scars? Here commenting to follow/return to this thread. Just joined the sub and happy to finally be able to relate to people about this topic You are welcome, have a great and I hope you find the answers you look for :) Thank you!\n\nI had to take of approximately 2 weeks of work. No longer. After 2 weeks I started doing work from home for a couple hours a day. After 4 weeks I was making 40 hours again. \n\nMy scar (I have only one) is about 6 cm vertical in the center of my chest. Does not botter me at all. 6 cm is 2.36 inches Bro I know exactly how you feel. It is like a daily mission to try and hide it and also to try and be \"normal\" whatever that is..\n\nThis is one of th toughest things, I tried to commit suicide when I was like 16 over it. \n\nIts caused me truama for years. I also have quite mild PC. But mentality it owns me every day. \n\nKeep strong bro and know you are not alone. \u270a\n\nI am looking into surgery \"It will go away from exercise\" is what we all heard at least a couple of times in our lives. Do not be shy in this sub. We are all here to help you. We can relate and that is very important. My second comment. I did solbe my PC with bracing. In July I posted 2 pictures, ome before the brace, secomd ome 5 months into bracing. My provider actually works in UK so if you are interested you can ask me for detaul. The doctor is willing to have Skype conversation with patients, no matter if you decide buy his brace or not. He knows a lot about it so maybe he can give some advices based on your age and everything. You probably do not have those thoughts anymore, but please do not try it ever again... Be strong and good luck! Look into London Orthotics Consultancy- they are excellent and do PC bracing. I am going to be working with them this winter hopefully I would be extremely thankful if you could please let me know more details. \n\nI am happy that you solved your problems, man. Wish you good Thank you for taking time in replying, and thank you for sharing too, have a good day Sure man. I am not home at the moment, but I will DM you later and share my experiemce in details Thank you for your words and for sharing your perspective. I hope you are good now emotionally speaking.\n\nI hope you can get through the surgery in good conditions, have a good day Thank you for the information, I will have a look. Take care Thank you, it means a lot to me, take care. Yes I have used them. Spoke to the specialist sam walmsley. Amazing guy. Really has helped especially with bracing Reccomend you get a brace asap. Push your chest down  gently. If it goes in it will be flexible  if it feels really rock hard. Bracing may not work or may take even longer.\n\nIts best to get a brace during 13-17  after that depending on hoe flexible your chest it. It may be even harder to fix. I mean, if I push it down it moves but I do not know if that might helo when getting a brace. I am 20 at the moment, hopefully I can use it and avoid surgery Hi there,\n\nI am in England I do not believe you can get any treatment for Pectus Carinatum on the NHS anymore. \n\nI am 24 and tried the bracing program at The Pectus Clinic in London which cost \u00a32.5k this is the T-joe brace. \n\nDo not regret trying the brace but it has not really worked well for me likely due to my age and I went hardcore with it extremely painful and your be wearing it for a least a year. So I would definitely check your flexibility to see if it would be worth the cost and effort.\n\nI have a consultation with a surgeon next week who offers the mini ravitch surgery for 7k quite quick recovery, to give you an idea of the price difference.\n\nBest of luck\ud83d\ude00 Just shy of turning 23, however have JUST got my brace fitted through the NHS ( specialised clinic in London at st Mary\u2019s hospital ) which all came from a referral from my GP. \n\nIt did take a few tries. First when I was 15, where it went nowhere, and was left for a few years. Tall slim build, with a offcentre big lump. Messes with your confidence constantly. \nHowever I went back and talked about it again, featuring a little research and knowledge on my end, and it then led to a back and forth of letters and referrals. It is slow. However if you just keep cracking on, it will definitely come about. I am at the very back end of bracing - your skeleton reaches maturity at pretty much 22/23 I believe, \nYet the doctors last words to me were that he believed I could get up to 70% reduction..\nI had in my head 10/20% would mean the world to me. I still refuse to believe 70, but instead use it as the hope and motivation to burn through the pain that the brace has initially caused..\n\nLong story short, keep at it - trying to work on your health is not something to be shy of, and long term it will benefit you for the rest of your life - jump at it while you still got that chance. \nI cant sleep with it on, but that is a point for another thread hahah. \nHope it helps (:", "Anyone had success with bracing over 25?

I was diagnosed with PC at age 12. I am a girl, and have always been very thin. People have pointed it out and have made comments which has made me very insecure. I received a brace at the age of 16 (I was told my case was moderate to severe) but it was too painful and noticeable to wear to school. I am now in college and have been trying to wear it more. It is still super painful to the point where I am in tears everyday. What should I do? Is surgery a good option? Hi there!  \n\n\nIf it is that painful, that makes me wonder if you need to be fitted with a new and different brace. Much like you, when I was younger I started wearing a brace. I did not stick with it, simply because I found it awkward, and did not want to be seen with it - it was easier to hide my chest than the brace. But while it was certainly not comfortable, even at times uncomfortable, it was not painful like you describe.   \n\n\nI would certainly encourage looking into a different brace before going to surgery. Surgery, of course, is an option that many choose. I am not sure where you are, what your insurance situation is, so I cannot give much help on price. I am sure someone else can do that, though. The thing about surgery is, that I have heard it is a good option for some - but not all. It depends on severity of the pectus, as well as many other things. Thank you for your reply! My parents are kind of disappointed in me for not wearing my brace regularly when I was younger, so having them return and pay for a refitting would be brutal. How old were you when you started rewearing it? I feel like I am running out of time and need to save up to revisit the brace doctor. Welp, I am 31 now..And I do not have either of the two braces I had when I was a teen. I am contemplating getting fit for one, but sometimes I think I have more or less come to terms with it. \n\n  \nI am actually curious myself as to just how effective bracing as an adult is. I would imagine it depends a lot on how flexible the sternum is, which definitely varies from person to person.", "Will you answer questions about your life with PC? I made a brief survey to gather data about Pectus Carinatum. After taking it, it lets you see how you compare to everyone else. Thank you and please share with others after you take it. Gathering data is the first step to fixing any problem scientifically and effectively. There is very little data in the medical community about this condition and very little understanding of the serious impact it can have on people's lives. If your going to live the good life with this condition, you have to find the solutions for yourself because there is no one out there yet whose proposed a good solution because most doctors do not care enough. Being different is challenging because you look around you at your friends and family, and most of them DO NOT have this condition. You likely do not have a personal relationship with anyone that has this condition. Because you are alone IRL in this, it is hard to make sense of it. Why me? Why am I different? What IS this? and how can I move on with my life and live in a normal way without being negatively impacted by this condition? We need individuals in our lives who are similar to us to model after. These people help us make sense of ourselves and how we relate to the rest of the world. In the absence of that we find ourselves a bit confused and we seek stories of others with the same condition so we can finally put our own lives into context. \n\nthanks @ deadwalker2000 for being the first to fill it out.

The scan probably took a total of 30 seconds which included only 2 scans of my chest. Both times I was told to take a deep breath and hold my breath during the scan (which only lasted a few seconds). I am told the scan indicated that my 6th and 7th rib on my right side were protruding but nothing else. However i believe that more ribs are protruding i am wondering whether it is worth having another CT done when i am in a neurtral/more normal position. I feel like when my chest is expanded to hold a breath my rib protrusions are less evident. For that reason i would like to get another scan done just in case.

My case should not be representative, but I will explain anyways. I am from Serbia and there are no brace options here. I conntacted the doctor from Pectus Service, Joseph Anthony, on Facebook book Messenger in October last year. We also had a Skype call. He explained his methods and he told me that in Europe he work in UK and in Poland. Poland is closer to Serbia and it is easier to enter in Poland with a Serbian passport so I went with that option, but I had to wait until Februar because Joesph travels there once or twice a year which is understandable since he is an American who works in multiple locations in US nad UK, and one in Poland.

Yeah. Mine is asymmetrical, ive got it on my right ride. (Or atleast I believe it is). We found my PC at a fairly young age so we got it braced fairly quick before it could develop far. So it is either just on my right side , or it is just a lot more on my right side and the amount on my left is unnoticeable. My recommendation is to go get diagnosed, and if its PC get braced as soon as possible as mine is barely noticeable.

Hello, \n\nI am 19 about to turn 20 and I have a case of Pectus  Carinatum (not super severe and no one says they notice it but obviously it is a huge issue to me) I got my brace when I was 18 about to turn 19 but never wore it due to it being uncomfortable and fear of wearing it at school. I recently went back to the doctor and got the brace readjusted in order to start wearing it again, however I have fears it may be too late for me due to my age even though my chest can be compressed a fair bit when I push on it. I started getting back into the gym in order to build muscle which I am going to keep doing irregardless of the results of the brace and I go back to the doctor in a month to see my results. My question with anyone who did the brace at a late age is did I miss my opportunity and am I just wasting my time with the brace and if not does anyone have any tips or experience preferably with sleeping with the brace? I would love for the brace to help my chest even a little bit and I am determined to work out regardless of the results.\n\nThanks,\n\nP.S I am making this post also in order to hold me accountable so I continue to wear the brace :) It is not too late.

Many will tell you that it is late, but all the doctors told me that it just needs more time. It is not impossible, just make sure to get a good custom brace, I recommend T-Joe PectusServices because his method is to massage your chest in natural shape and then the brace holds it. Check Out my post on this sub it will tell you abt the best kind of brace on the market Bro no it is NOT too late.

Seriously", "How bad is my pectus ?  show from side I would say mild, I have the exact same body shape as yours but my PC is much more noticeable from the side. Could be a factor of muscle mass as well, looks like you work on your chest regularly so that definitely helps to reduce the appearance. You can tell you have PC, but you still look a lot better than a lot of people There is two pictures... It is right in the middle of the sternum which is annoying because I always have a little bit which points through a t shirt. Have been training the past couples of years to hide it by putting on a little bit of muscle. I would recommend trying to bulk and getting down to the gym. After a while the abs start to merge with the sternum what helps to cover it a little Thanks mate, that is a little bit of an ego boost for me, especially because I do not see my body in that light well i am glad, just being honest\n\nPC can suck for sure, but it pays to remember that basically everyone struggles with body image in one way or another... there is a lot of imperfections that we can fixate on\n\nsomething like PC does not take away the positives, being in good shape, having a good set of arms/shoulders and a toned stomach and all that... if anything having PC might make you more motivated than you would be otherwise to focus on fitness and what is in your control, so there is a silver lining :--) i am sure if you keep with the training no one will care about the pc - the way I have always dealt with it is by trying to hide it with a set of pecs, and you seem to be like me where it is relatively symmetrical. without sounding dismissive, it could be so much worse. be kind to yourself.\n\nalso: it looks like you do not have terrible rib flare, which a lot of us do Mild/moderate but it is quite symmetrical so looking good. Might be good candidate for bracing depending on your age.  I have tried a brace mate. Was wearing it for about a year and my chest would not stay in very long and the pain was too much even after the first couple of weeks. Just coming to terms with it and training hard to shape the rest of my body around it Well that is unfortunate. Did you get a \"quality\" brace?\n\nYour physique still looking good asf. You do not have flared ribs and it is symmetrical.\n\nI was to old for the brace but had two failed surgeries sadly, with top surgeons.\n\nSo if you can live with it I would not pursue a surgery.  Not that bad bro. I bet most people will not even notice it. It was about 3k for the brace but after nearly a year of wearing it and getting severe back pain, I thought it was not worth it. I have had friends and other people tell me over the years it is not noticeable and does not look bad but guess it is one of those things anyone with pectus will never really accept Thanks man. Appreciate all the second opinions, especially from those who have to live with this as well I totally understand your feelings. It is the worst when people (esp doctors) are like \"it looks fine\" when you know it does not.\n\nSounds like your ribcage is to stiff for a brace. I can tell you surgery is super hurtful as well, you cannot breath for a couple of weeks, but the doctors force you to do it anyway.\n\nIf you feel you can live with it and do not have any physical issues that is good.\n\nI felt in my early twenties that I could live with how I looked, but started to get back pain when my rib cage started to stiffen up so I went for surgery.\n\nAfter my first surgery my stiff back went back to normal within a couple of weeks and my pain went away. Funny how the doctors all said PC is \"only cosmetical\". Sadly the metal bar moved and I got almost back to baseline.

I agree with the other comments, do not worry about it. And bringing it up before hand would make a bigger deal out of it than it really needs to be. Make mention of it in the moment, that is what I have always done. No one has ever cared You should be able to share it with her, but not necesarily in the beginning. Do not think about it, people do not really care like us. I would try to have sex with her ASAP and not say shit. Are you going to tell her if you have a little dick as well??

My breathing is normal and I wore it non stop except for special occasions and showers. I am certain the more you wear it the quicker it goes away. 23 hours makes sense because you are trying to stabilize your flexible sternum as quickly as possible. I did have to finish school online because I was self conscious about it, and it was much easier to wear it without it moving and walking from and too classes and sitting in a hard uncomfortable chair. Their are exceptions for sports, or the gym etc. but your goal is to wear it as much as possible. Does your chest stay in for a long period of time or does it pop out quickly? How long does it stay in? I have forgot to wear it at night like a couple times and it pops out like a tiny tiny bit but it stays in.I am going to still have to wear it at night for another year to keep it in place, so I am not worried about it protruding out. Also it is because I have been wearing it for 1 year and 7 months Bro this is so inspirational im 16 now and im trying my best to wear it Good luck it will be so worth it trust me!! Do you have any side pictures of your PC before starting the brace?   \nAnd also, it looks great in the right picture. I am happy for you! I have no side pictures but my sternum was stung out 3 inches which is a lot. I am 23 yo and I will start bracing in 1 month my sternum is still pretty flexible That is awesome I am still wearing mine and I am 18 because It still sticks out a little on my right side because of sleeping on my side. My brace would move and cause less pressure It really depends on the person hey man my PC comes out more on one side. If your the same, did it fix that? Yah I just have to wear it longer which I am fine with. My specialist said I looks good, but I still see it so I am wearing it longer did you wear it in school or did you just not I had to finish online school because it sucked Does it hurt many people say so", "Brace price? How much does a brace cost on average? I got mine months back n it was a (custom mind u), roughly around 4-5 k without insurance. But I have seen braces online for way less that could fit u. I recommend if your younger tho getting the custom it will truly change your life if u wear it. 1750$ in my case. There are a lot of cheaper ones, even some more expenisve ones.", "When did you start to notice a difference when you were bracing? I have been wearing my brace for about 20 hours per day(I somehow wake up with it off every morning which is why it is not longer) ever since my last doctors appointment which was nearly a month ago. The doctor said it should be flat within 3-4 months. When should I start seeing changes? Because I have not been able to see any noticeable changes at all unless they are really small and I have not been noticing. When did you start seeing noticeable changes? \n\n\n\n", "How do you guys deal with \"intimacy\" So i have a pretty noticeable case of pectus carinatum (protrudes out of t shirt if standing straight) and recently i have been talking to a girl. It is going fairly well  but in the back of my head i keep thinking how she wont think im attractive or will be disgusted and leave if she sees my chest. Im especially concerned of the possibility of sex, as it probably would be really strange of me to insist on keeping my shirt on during. Im new to all of this and have no idea how to proceed. Do i avoid mentioning it until later and instead hide it as it isnt THAT important? Or do i tell her about it in advance and risk immediate rejection and disgust. I have a hard time seeing how anyone would be okay with it and would want to continue talking to me as it IS a deformity and looks strange. Have you guys dealt with this before? What did you do? Bro, I have the same problem. You are not alone in this, but I also have no answe for you. I am just hoping anyone answers you lol I felt the exact same way as you when it came to intimacy with my partners. Once I realized I had pectus , I thought I looked deformed and wondered who would ever want to be with me. Who could find it sexy in a woman, especially when my chest of all things is pushed outwards?\n\nHowever I have learned that if the person I am with finds something like my pectus to be disturbing then we were not meant to be to begin with. I have had about 5 partners now and all of them treated me exactly how I think I would be treated if my chest was not deformed. My pectus never got on the way of being intimate. \n\nI think, from your post, you just struggle with confidence in how you look. If you feel strongly about this person, have a discussion and explain you would like to keep your shirt on during sex. If she is a halfway decent person she would not care about your physical appearance, only how you make her feel. Once you come to realize that we were just born a little different than everyone, and become more comfortable in your body I can promise you it will never be an issue again.\n\nI hope you the best in your ventures bud \ud83d\udc4d I would honestly bring it up with them, possibly even swimming if you are comfortable with it. I try to be joking about it when I personally do and I even stick it out as far as it will go. If I see even a little disgust in their face then I know they are not worth it. I would go as far as to say some find your confidence to be shirtless while deformed attractive. in my experience no one actually gives a shit except mee\n\njust focus on what is in your power m8. everyone has things about their body that suck and if you are a decent person that will not put anyone off No one cares. I hate mine with a passion but none of my partners care at all. Be more open about it. Do not keep your shirt on, that is would be weird if you do it all the time. Most people do not actually care.", "My chest hurts here many times on the left side. It is upper chest? Is it because of bad posture and slouching because it is thight and when i press there it hurt  Answer pls I am assuming you have Pectus Carinatum too? I do also and it hurts pretty frequently in different spots (the left area you are pointing to is one) especially after doing heavy lifting or exercise that uses a lot of chest muscles. That being said the left of where your heart is so you should always be extra aware of chest pains there and mention it to your doctor next time you have a check up just to rule out anything worse Hello feel the same like you. But when i play sports i dont fell it but after i am done and resting i feel the pain. Also i have mild case of pectus What about you I have pretty bad Pectus Carinatum but I also do not really feel in pain while I am up doing stuff but it gets pretty bad after when I rest. Like if I am up moving around and doing things it does not really hurt  but after doing a lot of stuff it starts to hurt if I take a break and just stand there or sit down. It feels better after I sit down for a while but it is the most sore when I stand in one place after doing heavy lifting How old are you Why are you not getting brace Late reply but a different angle could be used. If you see it popping out it is pectus. To be on the safe side I would go to a doctor to get scans to rule out anything else because you never know. But it could be pectus.\n\nPersonally, see a doctor. Chest pains can be a bad sign. Pectus does not normally cause chest pains like that. You could be referred for an Mri I believe or an x ray\n\nIf you feel any lumps that feel unusual. Go to a doctor early to rule out any sinister underlying problem Thank you but my left chest stick a little more out than my right is it pectus then, but when i search pectus carinatum it is just severe cases i think i have a mild", "Vent in comments  My parents and doc are convinced that all I need to do is exercise to fix my chest but all I see is people saying that bracing is the best for the flared ribs and sternum, they reduced to take me to a specialist because they keep saying that since I have not being doing the random exercises my dad came up with so apparently that means I do not want to get better. Even though I am in constant pain and have to wear baggy shirts to hide my chest Seems fixable with exercise to be honest, although of course it still sucks that your chest is not symmetrical. Yeah but the problem is that will just hide and later it will stick out more because it is asymmetric I feel you man, im kind of in the same situation. I have seen 3 doctors to let them look at my chest, but they all rejected me for bracing, because they say it is not severe and it is not that noticable. It made me realise that we make too big of a deal for it ourselves, and that we have to accept it. It is fucking hard because we have struggled with it so long.. I really recommend to start working out, and start masking it this way. I bet that also no doctor is going to treat you, so it is way better to take action yourself, instead of just sitting in the house and feeling like shit because of your chest. You got this king Fixing a chest deformity is all about the forces that the patients apply to the chest. You are right, random exercises not going to fix it, it can even worsen if you do not apply he right forces that your chest needs. The best I could advise you is to lay on  your stomach, on hard, flat ground and use your bodyweight to push your carinatum back, but at the same time pull your upper abdomen back with flexing it (so pulling your ribflaring back with your muscles, and through breathing). This mimic bracing and can help to some extent. But you would need to do it a lot, and monitor (measure) how your progression is going. ALso, general abdominal strenghtening can help not just to mask, but to pull the ribflaring back.  \nHow old are you? Your doctor did not tell you that you have spinal deformity too? Have you had CT, X-ray? I will try but I am 5,75 foot and weigh 48kg so laying down will not do much Trust me it will, as your chest never been pulled before, it will feel weird. Altough it sounds odd, but later you could weight yourself (foe example put on your backpack, with a lot of weight in it, it can be salt, flour, sugar, water, sand what ever) and you can increase the weight (progressive overload). Your parents and doctor are wrong, doing exercises will only cover it up, not fix it.\nIf your parents refuse to take you to a specialist, they can at least get you a brace. Heres one for about $200:\n Thanks for the advice Exercise will not do aynthing other than hide some of it. Who gave a degree to those \"doctors\"? Why do they always have a need to talk about something they do not know anything about? Whenever I bring it up with my parents they say did you oh google that or do you you have a medical degree we do not know about? SMH Very similar to the severity of my chest. If you are young do not wait to get a brace because my Pectus has grown out more as I age. If you are thin body shaped exercise likely will not entirely cover it and definitely will not be a permanent solution to Pectus Carinatum, if you are doctors are telling you this they are very wrong. Many medical professionals are uniformed about Pectus Carinatum because it is very very rare so definitely do not take your doctors word for fact on this, medical literature hardly mentions are conditions. I remember years of baggy tshirts and hoodies or whatever I could to feel like I looked natural because I am thin and it was very obvious that something was wrong with my chest, again if you are young do not wait and please self advocate to receive the care you deserve so bracing is at least an option given to you which it DEFINITELY should be provided it is financially possible for your family. You could just make a brace yourself. As long as you find a way to apply sufficient pressure to your chest, and wear it long enough then it will work. That is how I did it See, the only 2 ways i can think of logically are surgery or excercise. Im a 13 year old who is 4'11, so i hope mine doesnt get worse if i ever get a growth spurt. The first way (obviously) is surgery. I dont want to get surgery tho. I know its safe and all, but it just scares me. 2nd way, the one im currently working at, is increasing my pec size to be level with it. Im also working towards abs so the pectus will either be hidden by pecs or it will look like a top ab. Mines is a mild case though, and i prey it doesnt get worse. And, there is the big bad brace. I dont consider it an option. Think about it. Pectus Carinatum is when you have an overgrown sternum. So, if its overgrown, all that excess bone is being pushed back into your body! Yours looks relatively symmetrical but lmk if that is wrong. If it is then you can actually probably get decent coverage with weight lifting. Regardless I would attempt bracing though The picture does not really show but it actually peaks at the left just above my heart  Trust me i was just like you. I got a similar looking pectus like you along with flared ribs. When my parents and specialist told me to start working out i was pissed cause i thought it was not going to do shit. After 1 year, i got over feeling sorry for myself and began to hit the gym. Im really proud of the results as after 6 months, I have basically hidden my pectus through chest and ab workouts. Keep your head up bro. I had an X-ray and it said mild scoliosis and pectins carinatum", "Bracing fucking sucks I am 16 and am bracing right now. I do it through the day but do a ten minute break every couple hours or so and I try to sleep in it but usually lay wide awake for hours until I give up, or I wake up frequently thru the night or take it off in my sleep. It makes my life a living hell, huge rash on chest, always in pain, cannot lay down comfortably( or do anything comfortably), cannot leave the house bc wearing the brace is just not practical for doing shit and very embarrassing. I just do not know what to do, maybe some advice or motivation from people who have braced? I am using trulife. And it is even more discouraging that this hell I have been living through for the past month has been for not as my pectins looks maybe 1% better. All it is done is made my chest more pliable (I can easily push it into a normal flat position) but it still pops right back out. I have been in your situation but trust me the pain and discomfort will be worth it Thanks for the motivation bro. How long did it take for you/ hours per day? Any advice on living with it or pics? I heard many people who were not satisfied woth Tru life brace. Maybe you should consider trying a diferrent one, but see how it goes.\n\nWearing tge brace is not embaracing, it is just you who think it is. You are doing something for yourself and it is hard. For me personally, it was the easiest to not hide it and tell everyone, and noone really cared. If you are not comfortable woth that approach, yoz can say that you have a lung problem or a broken rib. Just keep the brace out of your mind. I went through phases i can elaborate more just send me a dm DM me as well, I can share my experiences with the brace as well. I even posted some pictures from before the brace and 5 months into bracing (the treatment lssts from 8 to 12 months). Trust me brother it is worth it everything, you will get used to sleeping with it on after a couple of days and make sure when you do not have it on to take off ur shit and let ur skin breathe, it is all worth is man you will see a lot of improvement also start working out to get your body more defined you got this brother we are all in the same boat I was in the same position you were I had to wear it for a few months at 16 and it was hell but holy shit was it worth it. It takes a bit to work and awhile to get used to it but you will start seeing results and be really happy u did it trust. How many hours did you wear it for if you do not mind me asking? Basically 24/7 for the first few weeks. Then it went to wearing it all the time except for when I was at school. The process went much more quickly then I thought and the brace gradually gets much more comfortable and familiar. You stop taking it off in your sleep after a week or two and it starts to get a lot easier. I know how mUch it sucks but I really wish you the best and hope you find similar results to the ones I got. Yea, I have it on the right side and I am using it rn, it was not a very serious case like others. It is pushed down most the surrounding around and now a small part in the middle of where it was sticking out, so I think I can fix that and it will even out. Thanks for the info :)", "Pectus carinatum If a 10 year old has mild pectus carinatum does it get worse with age? Or does it stay the same? Thanks I am no doctor, just a person with pectus but from my experience it got worse. I would say if you choose treatment, the best thing to do is have them wear a brace while young because the rib cage is much more flexible and strengthens with age becoming more difficult to fix later. Hope this helps. Starting treatment at the age of 10 would mean he/she would need to wear it through puberty. That is a long time. Keep an eye on the PC and start treatment at the age of 14/15. Yeah it will get worse. PC is the result of excessive growth of the rib-cartilage which happens during the puberty. So vest thing to do is to start with good advice about bracing. It gets worse, especially in quick periods of growth. Luckily, he is only 10, the barce is a very good option. I would say 13 It often gets worse when you get older", "19yo, does this look flexible enough. Thinking of getting a brace this January  Also, how severe does it look? Looks like you have a lot of flexabiliy think the brace would work well I think it is good. As lomg as you can push it in by your hand, it is a good sign. That is more than enough flexibility. Looks mild.\n\nHow old are you? His age is literally in the title. haha sorry", "Is this Pectus Carinatum?   My sternum started protruding in middle school, I have always felt as if my build was awkward and I did not realize why I was so insecure about my chest until adulthood. I was told that surgery would give me a vertical six inch scar and bracing would have been more effective in adolescence. I have been trying to build muscle to my chest but it seems like I have atrophied. Any other similar experiences? It is very difficult to tell if you have PC or not, especially from this angle. Which I suppose is a good thing. Yes this is Pectus Carinatum. \n\nOther than surgery and bracing many clinics also offer breast implants that will help cover PC for females. The vertical scar is only if you get a Ravitch surgery. There is also Abraham's (or reverse Nuss) which will leave you with two small scars on each side of your rib cage. as a female who has had the ravitch proceduew, if you do look into the surgery, the scar will most likely be mostly hidden by your chest. you can only see a small line right between my you know what and the rest of it is hidden.", "UK Brace guides For all my UK people here are some sites to get you started on potentially booking appointments with consultants\n\n(I am using the London orthotics brace rn and I have seen such a difference \n\n(\n\n( Services International Division \u2013 London England&amp;text=Our T-Joe Brace is,the shoulder straps are needed.)\n\n(\n\n\nAlthough there are many more.", "This is how i look shirt on and off.I look horrible in both pics,How would i change it?

Do not be embarassed by it though, I straight up told my friends about the brace the first day I wore it. You do not need to worry about it, they will understand and probably never mention it again. You are doing it for yourself, not for others, always remember that. yea my friends know too and i am going to pool with them or somewhere else, i dont have problem because i have pectus but i dont want to wear it at party i feel like brace blocking me to feel relaxed haha It does make you feel like that.

I got my brace recently and since then have had upper back pain to the right of my spine. This has made it very uncomfortable to wear the brace and i cant sleep in it.

I was going to add a picture of my PC to this post, but since I am extremely private about my body and everything, even if my face is cut out and the bg is blurred, including my nipples, I cannot bring myself to do it. However, I need to get this off my chest (lol). I did not know I had this until I was about 16. I am 22 now and it is gotten worse. I can never wear most bras without it being uncomfortable, I have major insecurity issues about it during intimacy, and it overall makes me feel less of a woman. Maybe it would not be so bad if I had bigger breasts, but since I do not, it is apparent and pushes my breasts slightly apart more than if it had not been there. I am so upset I never found out in time for a brace, and even growing up when I had started asking my Mom about it, she just assured me it would go away as I got older (???). Not many people have PC, and even LESS of that group are women. I want some kind of surgery to shave this down or SOMETHING. I know about the other surgery where they insert a bar in, but I am terrified of the long term effects and honestly, how it would look cosmetically. I wish I did not feel so alone and J did not know really where else to talk about this.  People always told me to try swimming. Mainly because lifting weights to increase pectoral muscles at a young age was not healthy. And it turns out, it really helped! Same can be said for my sister, like you, she used to be really self-conscious about it but after we swam for about a year and a half, we could not really notice it at all, of course, it does come at the cost of having a swimmer body. But that is not so bad, after all, it is the safest and most wholesome sport around\ud83d\ude42 Hi! 25 year old female with PC. I did not find out a true diagnosis until it was too late for a brace. I have always had tiny boobs and what my sister called \u201ca third boob\u201d. Really it was just my deformed little ribs/cartilage making themselves known. I was always tired and struggled with taking full, deep breaths. I also could not wear underwire bras because they would sit on the bump funny and rub. \n\nI finally chose to have surgery at age 22. I had 2 bars inserted and honestly it was not bad. Recovery was easy. But now 3 years later my chest has changed again and it basically looks the same as before the surgery, except with metal bars instead of bone sticking out. I am in the process of arranging to have another surgery to remove the bars. \n\nFeel free to DM about advice with bras or making clothes, seatbelts etc more comfortable. Or about the surgery or anything PC related. I have had such a hard time finding another female to connect with about my struggles.  The underwire bra problem is SO relatable, holy shit. I still wear them sometimes just because those seem to be the only cute ones that are also push up. I try to ignore the awkward rubbing and pull it down constantly since they always climb up on my chest over the PC. \nI am sorry the surgery was not able to permanently change your PC issues for the better...I hope when you get the bars removed it will be okay, and I hope you have a speedy recovery!\nOn that note, I wonder if a cosmetic surgery like bone shaving would work on PC? I mean, they do it for jawlines and I am assuming cartilage is easier to wear down than bone...lol. At least just enough to make it stick out less sharply.  I am 16 yr old girl and realized I had pc like 2 yrs ago. I would cry for hours over it because I hated it so much. I went to doctors and tried to look for solutions. I used to always feel bad about myself for having it. Now I do not even care. People tell me they do not notice it. Even guys who have seen my chest. Idk if they are lying or not but it does not matter to me. I have learned to love it. The only thing that really sucks about it is not being able to wear wire bras. Only bralettes for me. Hi I am a 19 year old (F) with PC, I discovered it when I was 12. I wore a brace and all it did was make my rib that sticks out more visible. Honestly wearing a brace and the experiences I went through at children\u2019s mercy as a child led me to develop many self image issues when I was younger. The best one was when I had doctors telling preteen me that I will not have the visibility issue once I get old and fat or pregnant \ud83d\ude1c. Honestly I have come to accept that as a human we all have weird bodies and we just need to embrace it. If you would be interested in creating a female only PC support group that might make you feel more comfortable to share some bikini photos. We could support each other as twisty rib sisters. Sending all my love\u2764\ufe0f Dude I feel you. My only difference is I was young enough to get the brace, but all it did was flatten my sternum but  push my \u201c3rd boob\u201d out further. The only comments the doctors offered was \u201cthat happens\u201d.  Underwire bras KILL me, but thankfully braletts are in style. I am very late to your post here but you are not alone! I am new to this subreddit, I did not even know a brace was an option as kid wow. I think I was diagnosed around 11 or 12 but nothing came of it. I remember my mom told me I could have surgery if I wanted but that I might die (wtf mom? She is crazy and super against doctors so probably lied to make me not want surgery). Anyway I was told that it would not matter once I developed more and got boobs. I am lucky that my PC is rather small and slight but for the majority of my life I was skinny and boney so it always stuck out. I hated it, still hate it. I have gained a healthy amount of weight that I no longer look skeletal from it and I wear extreme push up bras 100% of the time so my boobs mask it. Even with small boobs, you can get so pretty magical push up bras that can work wonders for it haha. At this age (26) I am not nearly as self conscious about it as I used to be. Again, push up bras and bikinis majorly help. Of course they are uncomfortable, but I find Aerie brand to be pretty barrable.", "Do you think I have pectus carinatum? visible assymmetricality  I get short of breath real fast during exercise and occasional pain too. \nFollow up question, I am 19, would a brace even be affective?

I was diagnosed with \u201cexercise-induced asthma\u201d as a preteen, which now looking back on it, pretty sure had to do with the PC, so it is definitely possible.

I am a little worried about it tho and what will happen. I have been dying to get my chest brace and always hoped for the day to happen. My biggest worry is that my doctor Will say I do not need one and send me off without a brace. That is literally my biggest fear and I am super scared for it, I absolutely hate my chest and this is my one opportunity to get it fixed. It sounds dumb I know but it genuinely scares me. \n\nAlso during my appointment  what will happen?\nLike will my dr send me off to another place and get checked there or anything like that? Make sure to make a follow up post. Hopefully it will be good.\n\nWhen I had my appointment, I got the brace. But I literally traveled to another country knowing that I will get a brace, it was not a question if I will get it because it was a private clinic. May I ask how much yours cost? I replied in your other post. Oh just saw that, thank you for the help! I will make a follow up post after my appointment! What happened when I got a brace was first they took x Ray's of my chest (the whole process of leaving the room getting the x Ray's takin and going back to the room only took 2-3 minutes). Next some middle aged man trying to be cool came in the room and said \"so your chest is bumpy.\" Then he recommended that I should get a brace and told me that it is rare for a brace to correct pectus carinatum so my brace would not correct my pectus carinatum but it would keep it from getting worse. Which is complete bullshit because I am 14 5'10 and still growing very fast. He also told me that I would have to wear the brace 24 hours a day until im 18 which is ALSO complete bullshit. Then he said that I would have to come back in 6 months to take more x Ray's and see how my pectus is doing. After that he said that i would have to go to this other place to get a brace. I got there and they said that since we did not have an appointment we would have to wait a few hours (it only took 15 minutes). Then this lady handed me a truelife brace which is the most cheap and uncomfortable brace that you can get. My mom was asking 1729401 questions like \"so it wont correct his chest? Will it affect anything long term? How does it work?\" Then the lady assured me that the brace will correct my pectus and the other guy had no idea what he was talking about. Ps. If you get a truelife brace you NEED to get at least \u00bd inch rubber foam to put on the front and back of your brace to make it bearable to wear. GOOD LUCK!!!!!!", "Do I have PC? ", "15 yr old male with Pectus carinatum I find it very difficult to wear the brace for more then a hour or two due to the very bad pains I get and when I do manage to sleep with it I subconsciously take it off can anyone help please I just want to be normal the constant hiding of it in public or wondering how people view me or if I will get a girlfriend it just freaking sucks I will do anything to be able to fix this pain problem thank you for the help and stories you all share it keeps me going knowing I am not the only one in the world going through my little slice of hell I do not know what to tell you, but wear the brace. Pain is temporary remember that. Hang in there buddy.. I have had pc since I was a teenager and I wish everyday I would not have worried so much about what people would have thought if I had to wear a brace.. I am 32 now and trust me you do not want to be my age with a mature skeleton and your only option is surgery.. take it from someone who is lived it.. there is not a day that goes by that I do not wish I would have fixed it while I was younger Thank you for this I appreciate the support my parents do not seem to get it and my dad likes to bully me about it even if it is just play I will surely do my best to fix it now and be done with it for the both of us!!! It torments me everyday.. I am like you just want to look normal and feel normal.. fight through the pain bud and just do you.. my parents were the same they do not understand what it feels like to feel so different.. Where is the pain? Is it specifically on the pectus bone or somewhere else?\n\nTip: if you are subconsciously taking it off, wear a tight shirt to bed so it is harder to get up under and take the brace off, or if you do not wear a shirt at all, try wearing a shirt one night and see if it helps. It is directly on the bone right where it makes most contact and thanks for the tip I will definitely try that Has the pain gone away at all? Sometimes it hurts for just the first few days. lol sorry to tell ya bud but ya either deal through 6 months to a year of pure hell with the brace or have a very invasive surgery! Is not this condition wonderful? im 15 too and have pc, i workout out since the beginning of autumn every single day 20 minutes and i can say that it becomes less and less obvious. i recommend you to do that too(pushups, chest exercises, etc.) i understand your pain and frustration and all you can do is keep strong and dont let yourself down.", "PC discord :D ", "My experience with PC and surgery - 28F Hey all,\n\nI am a female in my late 20s living in the U.S. I had surgery to repair PC a few years ago. I have replied to a few posts here and gotten some questions and direct messages, so I want to make a master post about my experience in case it is helpful to anyone.\n\nThis is a lot of info, so I have added section headers in case there is some specific info you are looking for.\n\nBefore I dive in, I want to say that I think the decision to get surgery is one that should not be taken lightly. I am not advocating for or against surgery. I only want folks to understand my experience to help make an informed decision.\n\nI also want to note that I know nothing about this beyond my personal experience. Of course, I have met with multiple physicians and scoured the internet for information while seeking treatment. But everything I know is individualized to my own case, experience, and perception. If you have questions about your condition, meet with a physician who is experienced with chest wall deformities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why I decided to get surgery**\n\nI went to see a surgeon about my PC when I was in my early 20s. By that time, my body was fully developed, and I was not a good candidate for bracing. In addition to the defect itself, I had developed scoliosis and kyphosis, as well as a slight barrel chest as a result of my PC. Over time, the deformity of my chest wall pulled my shoulders forward so that I was always sort of hunched over. My understanding is that if left untreated, this can get much worse over time. I was also having pain in my back and ribs and often had trouble breathing when I exercised. My PC was severe and asymmetrical. \n\nFor me, no amount of muscle gain or breast augmentation could have covered my defect. It also would not have fixed the other problems my PC was causing. My surgeon and I decided that surgery was a good option for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Surgery**\n\nThe surgery I had was the modified Ravitch repair. It was done at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, AZ. \n\nSurgery took about 4-6 hours. They made several cuts to my ribs and removed some cartilage. They also placed two plates to keep things secure. Those are cleared to come out 2-3 years postop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Recovery**\n\nI was in the hospital for 3 nights and stayed in Phoenix for a total of 8 nights (that was for my pre-op visit, my surgery, my hospital stay, and then a stay in a hotel until my post-op visit when I was cleared to fly home).\n\nI was up and walking with the first 1-2 days after surgery. For the next week or two, I needed some help (managing meds, dressing myself, occasionally a hand getting out of bed). This got better every day and within a couple of weeks, I was back to living on my own. I spent the next few weeks resting and recovering and slowly weaning off of pain meds as I healed. \n\nI was back at work full time 6 weeks after surgery, using mostly just ibuprofen to manage any discomfort. I was advised not to try to lift/push/pull anything more than 10lbs, but that restriction was lifted soon after as well. \n\nThroughout the entire experience, my pain was very well controlled. I would describe the worst of it as \"uncomfortable\". I had some days when I woke up a little sore, but I would have never rated my pain at more than maybe a 5.\n\nAs far as risks and complications, I was warned about the normal stuff (all surgery comes with risk), but I did not get the impression that it was a very risky surgery or that there was a lot of risk of complication. It is a good thing to review with your physician.\n\nAlmost 4 years postop, I do not have any physical restrictions, pain, or problems from the surgery. I will go back soon to have the plates removed, but that is a simple outpatient surgery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Results**\n\nI remember feeling shocked when I saw under the bandage for the first time. I do not know what I expected, but my chest just looked \"normal\". I really could not be happier with my results. It is a night and day difference.\n\nMy ribs lie flat and everything is symmetrical, even, and clean. There were some ribs toward the top of my ribcage that they chose not to touch because healing can be a bitch. The surgery did not fix my scoliosis and my chest is still a little barrel-shaped, but I am able to pull my shoulders all the way back and stand up straight, which is a huge improvement. My scar is about 3.5 inches and healed very nicely. It is never bothered me.\n\nI made the hard decision not to post before and after photos here. As much as I am a free-the-nipple, fuck-modesty feminist, I am just not comfortable sharing photos of my chest on this forum. \n\nBut speaking of my breasts, mine now have a much more natural-looking shape to them than before. I can wear bras with underwires, bikini tops, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Cost/Insurance**\n\nThe total cost of my surgery (including hospital stay, labs, etc.) was just under $70,000. My health insurance did cover my surgery, so I only paid my out of pocket max for the year, which was around $3,000.\n\nIt took several months to get the surgery approved with my health insurance. There were a lot of scans and diagnostic tests and I received at least two denial letters in the process. The hospital took care of all of the communications with the insurance company. I just had to sit around and be patient.\n\nI also had a good ESL (extended sick leave) benefit that allowed me to take 6 weeks off work without missing a paycheck. This is something to look into with your employer prior to surgery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**A note about coping and emotional wellness**\n\nFor me, surgery was a great decision and I am glad I did it. My PC made me miserable. I was uncomfortable and I found it very hard to cope with. Over time, I developed a deep-rooted hatred for my body. Surgery did not fix that. \n\nOnce the defect was gone, I just found something else about my body that I hated and focused on that. I had to go through some pretty hard mental and emotional work to learn to love my body and all it does for me.\n\nI say all of this because I wish I had done this work earlier. I wish I had not spent years of my life unhappy, desperately looking for ways to hide my defect and believing that my life would be exponentially better if only I could fix that one thing. Everyone has something they hate about their appearance, and that thing only has the weight you give it. This is easy for me to say now, but I wish I would spent a lot more time worrying about my happiness and a lot less time worrying about my PC.\n\nIf you want it, my advice is to advocate for yourself and whatever treatment you think is best for you and your health. Love your body as it is. And PC or not, stop being afraid to take your goddamn shirt off at the beach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading. Feel free to hit me up with questions below or message me.  You all are beautiful. \u2764 Thank you so much for sharing!!! I am almost 14 now and bracing. I 100% agree with the last part. I am very happy for you. I have heard Dr. J does not do surgery for Pectus Carinatum anymore. Is that true and if so why? \n\nAlso did you ever talk to any other patients that had the surgery done at Mayo Clinic? How was their results? \n\nThanksss Hm :/ I am not aware of that and cannot really speak to it either way. \n\nI have not been in touch with any other patients, but I have seen a Facebook group for them. Might be worth checking out.", "Workout recommendations I have a noticeable protrusion on the front of my chest right below the nipple are, I was wondering what would be the best workouts to help cover it up?. I am not to keen on wearing a brace and was wondering what are the best body parts I need to train to best cover it up? I always say that full body workout plans are the best. Obviously, you can work only on your chest, but you will not look good after some time. You will be disproportional. Thanks a lot, I will probably just do the full body work out just to avoid looking disproportional, but how long you would say till I start noticing changes? That is a hard question. Depends. You will see some changes in first 2 months, but they will not be huge. It takes time. Also, if you are skinny, eat a lot. Do not worry about the scale, begimmers need to eat. That makes things faster.", "Is it possible to have pectus carinatum in the middle sternum? Hello.\n\nI had PC as a baby but it went away. When I went through my growth spurt two years ago I got a bump on my upper sternum. Its hard and symmetrical with my ribs. It hurts slightly when I breath in deeply and sometimes very rarely hurts. Can pectus carinatum come back when you grow? I am worried I might have unchecked cancer. I am losing sleep over this. Thank you. Hey, if you are born with it then it shouldnt really disappear. Perhaps when you starting to grow up as a baby the chest wall changed shape and now protrudes again. Its unlikely anything bad although I would get checked out for the pain to be safe. Carinatum in teens can be checked if you push down on the bump. If it goes all the way flat. Its carinatum. So press down with two hands gently.\n\nRemember cancer lumps tend to grow everyday. So unless you see the chest get worse daily. Nothing to worry about. But if you are still worried it would not harm to see a doctor. Thank you so much, I pushed my hand down on the area and my chest went in a bit and and my hand flattened out. Is that what you meant? I was able to do more when I first noticed it a year and a half ago. Yeah that sounds right. From what I can think of. As you developed in puberty your pectus has protruded out once again. Unfortunately yours could be genetic. I have never really seen your case. Ik people can have it as babies. Yet I do not really see posts where people say it comes back.\n\nYou could perhaps see a doctor and request a X ray scan or anything to check the wall shape.\n\nThen you can. If you want look into bracing from a specialist.\n\nRemember pectus gets worse. So if it gets harder to push in then you could have issues fixing it. At 15 it should not really get harder to push in but we are all different Yeah my dad's uncle had it. Great Uncle Moishe died when he was 40, but he was still able to live a normal life. I always did have a funny look ribcage anyway.\n\nThank you so much. Np, just remember it isnt dangerous. Yes it can get worse but it wont be unsafe \n\nYou are the ideal age for bracing. I would look into it. But it depends if your country has a specialist for it.\n\nGoodluck. And once again if you still worry it isnt something with pectus. Dont panic. Just get checked to put your mind at ease.", "here is another angle of my PC  To me this confirms a mild case.  Side views are usually more obvious, and with this side view i think I could see you irl shirtless and not necessarily notice you have PC.

Yes, it is", "20y M considering Brace Hi guys, great to see a community for us lot, it is certainly not an easy thing to live with so been nice to read others stories and know I am not alone! I am a 20y Male who has always been told the typical 'put muscle on, it is not that bad etc' but I am fu\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* sick of all that, and I would always been told by people with no real expertise I was too late for a brace but after research and the fact my chest feels fairly  malleable I am intrigued by the prospect of a brace. The pain would not be any issue for me, the end goal would be enough to get me through that but I am wondering if anyone of a similar age has been through the process and if the results were satisfactory? I am not expecting it to become completely normal, but I have suffered so bad I have not left the house without a jacket or jumper for about  3 1/2 years and would like it to at least not be that noticeable under a t-shirt.. anyway, cheers and I hope someone can help Hey man I am 15 I have this shity chest thing too I have not got a brace yet but I will be soon.

I still feel self conscious about it, and currently I am working on bulking muscle to cover it up. But I have stopped keeping my shirt on at the beach, slouching my posture to cover it up. It is not ideal for sure but I no longer try to hide it. I am doing basically the same. I am lucky that I have supportive friends n stuff so I do not mind if people look at my sternum. Having a good posture is key if you want to stay healthy with a pigeon breast. Keep your heads up kings! Nah lol, still cry every day:(( I did not, I went so far and did so much work to get the brace. Accepting it was never an option that I liked, everytime I considered that it is fine and that I sgould accept that, I would just get depressed and sometimes start crying... Do you guys have any other issues with your body connected to the pigeon breast? Like scoliosis or a tilted pelvis n other stuff. I have like all the problems. But I can give you recommendation: Do sport. Especially sports were you work with both sides of the body simultaneously. Weight lifting is the best if you are doing it right. You can build muscles to cover up your breast and will get an overall better posture. In addition to this, you will feel more comfortable in your own body. The hard part is that at the age you are usually trying to accept it, is the age the least invasive options work. I see. I think I accepted it even though I try to do something about it. Makes that sense in any way? I do not feel uncomfortable taking my shirt off but still acknowledge the fact that this is there and I can do sth. about it. You have any pics? I do, but I will not show it on the internet. Maybe at some point I will show myself in this Reddit, but I want to wait a few weeks and explore this Reddit a little bit more.

(Also for any of those wondering PC does not disqualify you from service just mention your case is asymptomatic) so I will be about 20/21 before I can even start wearing a brace. I know typically doctors recommend wearing a brace when you are younger but my parents always refused to take me to the doctor about my PC bc they did not see anything wrong with it.\n\nAm I too old for the brace to be affective?\n\nThank you all for your time and insight :)\n\n( Listen, I am 18 and a half. I got my brace in February and it is working. That 18 years limit is bullshit, you just need to find a good doctor who will firstly manipulate your chest down and then put a brace that will hold it in place. My suggestion Pectus Services, I am using their brace. They work in mamy locations in US, few in UK amd one in Poland. I posted some pictures of me before the brave and 2 months in. Now I am 3 months in and the results in the thkrd month were suprisingly awrsome. Direct message me for more info. You need opinions from people who already went through this. I was evaluated for a brace around 25 years old by a pediatric thoracic surgeon. After taking some measurements and physically pressing down on my chest to test how flexible my ribs were, they determined I was not a candidate and I ended up getting it surgically corrected (which insurance paid for). \n\nI think my point is, even at 25 I was not ruled out for a brace until after I was physically examined. Even then, no one could say for sure a brace would not be effective, they just were not optimistic about it. Ok thanks for the input! Also your insurance covered it? I have been worried about the cost bc I am sure it would be considered \u2018cosmetic\u2019 and I figured insurance would not touch it. Yes they did. It took almost a year to get it approved. There were multiple denials. But the Mayo Clinic was ultimately able to make the case that it was medically necessary. I cannot remember the exact figure without insurance, but it was a lot. Wow that is great. I have read a lot online discouraging the surgery though, most forums/articles say it is risky and you end up with a large scar. How was your recovery process? And did you achieve your desired results? I guess it depends on your case. For me, it is no question that the scar is nothing compared to the deformity. I think it was worth every bit of time, effort, risk, and recovery.\n\nThe results of the surgery look amazing. However, there were some things they could not fix. For example, my collar bone is a little deformed and they did not end up fixing it (I think because of the risk and healing process.)\n\nRecovery took a couple of months. I spent a couple nights in the hospital. I needed someone around to help me out a bit around the house for a week or so after that. Just help getting in and out of bed, changing my shirt, helping with a whole mess of medications. And then it was just slowly regaining strength and energy. I was out of work for 6 weeks.

(Posted from r/PigeonChest) I got my brace from my doctor a while ago but I never want to wear it because it makes me depressed. Simple social situations are made awkward and I do not have very many friends. I am never anywhere near comfortable and I wish things were easier. Focusing in class is difficult, it is painful, I feel as though I can barely breathe, and the stress is getting to me. I am going into high school next year and soon my bones will become more stationary so I really need to be wearing it. My brace has been ruining my life and I am only making it harder by not wearing it. Does this whole ordeal get any easier? I really just need some words of encouragement and perhaps advice while I work my way through this. Yes it gets easier. As your pectus gets pushed in your chest gets used to it. It starts to become less painful. \n\nI had one of the worst pectus\u2019 my specialist had seen in his whole career, and within a few months I was 75% corrected. The first 2 weeks was the most pain I have ever experienced but now I can barely even notice it is there. \n\nPlease do not give up on bracing. Now I have no idea what it is like bracing in public as I am doing online schooling but Im sure it is hard. Just try to have a positive outlook on it and think of what it will do for you long term. Best of luck :) Thank you so much I will try my best. There is a lot of pressure in school and trying to stay social is quite difficult. Classmates are usually either confused about it or they make fun of me for it. It is hard but I will try to push through it. Thanks Yeah school will be school and mean people will be mean people, high school is easier. A lot more opportunities to make friends, and a lot of people just stop caring so much about making other people feel bad. It will get better :). Thanks for the kind words my man. This is why I love Reddit. Just want to say I am 1 week in to my own bracing programme and reading this is really encouraging, thanks for sharing! It is still painful and I am getting sore skin under the pressure points. Cannot wait for that to clear up I am glad I helped! And yeah, I got a really bad rash  and sore skin on my back from the brace but it cleared up within about a week or two just making sure to apply some zinc or lotion and covering it up with a soft pad. If you have any questions, please ask :) It definitely gets better, I am near the end of my treatment but I remember having a panic attack while taking my dog out on a walk while wearing the brace, it is worth it, I know it is tough now but but we are going to come out of this tougher than this condition, I know you can do it, good luck in high school, I am about to be a freshmen as well", "This is my 3 month bracing progress wearing the brace 18-20 hours a day.

", "Just found this sub... should I tell my girlfriend? My girlfriend has \"pectus carinatum,\" a term I would never heard of before tonight. Before we started dating she mentioned that her breast bone sticks out--I did not know what that meant but was lucky enough to figure out what she was talking about a few weeks after we started dating. \n\nAnyways, she is incredibly insecure about it. She told me that she spent her childhood banging her fists against her chest hoping that it would change the shape. (She reenacts it and it just absolutely guts me that she ever wanted so desperately to change herself like that.) To me her condition is utterly frivolous. She is stunning, she is kind, I won the lottery the day she gave dating me a shot. \n\nHowever, my adoration of her body does not undo decades of insecurity. She still tells me that she hates her chest and wishes she could change it. From the looks of this sub... I am thinking that might be somewhat possible? You are mentioning braces and surgeries. If anyone is willing to explain what those options are to me, I would be so appreciative.\n\nOf more importance to me is what seems like confusing information from her doctors. She has a heart condition and so often has doctors looking at her chest. Every time she comes home from an appointment she complains that the doctor mentioned something about her chest, \"As if I do not know!\" But, is there something they are not saying? Is this condition dangerous in any way? Are there possible complications? \n\nI would be so grateful to anyone who could give me more information about this. I would ask my girlfriend directly but I get the sense that she does not know much about it herself--it is something she just overall prefers not to think about. From the discussions we have had, I did not gather that there is even a name for this condition. I will take any information I can get.\n\nThank you, truly. The chances of complications with pectus are super rare and unheared about.\n\nThe surgery is relitivily dangerous and takes a long recovery time and leaves a big scar but results are good.\n\nbracing is a tough road and is not for all people (I tried it and got deppression) its something pushing your chest down at all times (you wear it like 16 hours a day) but the results are worth it. Keep in mind its works until age 19 but later it might not work because your body is already evolved.\n\n  I am 14 (male) and I tried bracing and just resorted to lifting wieghts until mucle covers it up. Maybe she should go to a proffisional doctor that specializes in pectus and other bone structure cases to check if it has complications and if there is a treatment. sorry for bad spelling and grammer ang good luck dude feel free to ask more questions DM me. I can share my full experience of having Pectus Carinatum and I can share my story on how I fixed it. I have PC and am a girl who dealt with insecurities growing up. I was also rather tall and skinny growing up so my boobs were non-existent and the only thing that stuck out was my PC. I was often told I looked like a dinosaur - it sucked. (Also really unsure of what kind of dinosaur I even resembled). Anyway, as I have got older (27) I have cared less and less about it. My boobs are still small but there larger than my PC now which makes it way easier to make unnoticeable. I used to exclusively wear push up bathing suits and bras so that it can cover it up but now I wear whatever is comfortable. I have come to learn that people are too busy being insecure about themselves to notice me. If ever someone does notice it, I educate them about it. Dealing with doctors is certainly annoying though - I hate having professionals point it out because I feel like they should already know! I do not let it get me down anymore though. Also my PC pulls my ribs in a way that helps give the illusion that I have a small waist so it has its perks :) lol. \n\n\n\nAnyway I do not know how old you both are but you sound really sweet and caring! It was so important to me to date men that helped to build my self esteem around it. My current husband will occasionally kiss where my PC sticks out which I find really sweet. So I recommend helping to remind her that she is beautiful in every way and there is not a thing you would wish to change about her. Of course, share the other info from this sub as well, but I just wanted to share my experience. It gets better! I used to have PC until I took the route of a brace (I am in the UK). DM if you want information of any kind : ) We need a subreddit just for women with PC/PE there is few of us but we do well at support each other. I was self conscious about mine too, but now I am in college I do not really care about it. I also love pointing it out to my pre-med sorority sisters because they love weird med stuff. My flared ribs are kind of a good luck charm to rub around here. Yeah that would be great! I am a bit uncomfortable sharing too much info on this sub because it is pretty male dominated and I dont want to keep bringing up my breast lol. \n\nThat is hilarious it is a good luck charm though! I had nurses as college roommates and they were fascinated by it as well. Pectus Carinatum  can be a symptom of a connective tissue disorder that can involve cardiac issues.  My son has EDS with severe pectus carinatum that he had surgery for.  Unfortunately he is had complications because of broken cartilage due to the EDS and will most likely need further surgery.  There is genetic testing for connective tissue disorders that can be done and sometimes rheumatologist can diagnose but I would think her doctors would already be on top of that. DM me. I would be happy to share my experience and answer any questions you have. I would also be happy to talk directly to your girlfriend about being a woman with this condition. \ud83d\udc9c I think that this sub is too small for something like that, now imagine how small would a girl only sub be. I think a better solution would be flares, that way you simply chose a flare and see all \u0161osts from girls. Thank you so much for sharing! It is a relief to hear that complications are unlikely. Wow! Thank you for posting this. She has mentioned that her insecurity was worse pre-puberty because there was no breast tissue there and so the \"PC\" was more noticeable. \n\nShe has made comments that as our relationship has progressed she feels less insecure about it. I hope that continues! I tell her that I think it is sexy, (maybe weird to some but still true,) and that makes her smile. \n\nThe reminding her that I would not change her is super helpful, I think. I tell her often that while she may want to change her chest, I would not if I had the magic button. It is her body so it is perfect to me, because it is her! \n\nAnyway, thank you for responding. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Do you think I should tell my girlfriend about this subreddit? I am worried she will think I was searching for the wrong reason but really I just stumbled across it because I spend way too much time on the internet. \n\nWas it emotionally beneficial for you to find others who share your condition? And perhaps some of the same self consciousness surrounding it? How would you have felt if someone you loved were to have shown it to you?\n\nPS: That is the coolest trajectory for an insecurity--went to college and made it famous! Good for you :)", "Muscle attachments Obviously pectus carinatum may shift where my muscle attaches, would getting a brace make this seem a bit better?\nI have been going gym and the pectus seems the same, does not seem to have been patched up much. Chest has grown a fair bit and have noticed this large gap of muscle in the middle and the chuck of lower peg that is missing/attached differently.\n\n\n\n\n\nWould a brace help here or maybe something else could be suggested here?\n\nThanks. I honestly feel like you are worrying too much about how you look... PC could be way worse looking than what you got going on.. It is what it is man. I can go on a beach without worry about anyone carrying, I am just curious really. You should try it Its barelt visible but if you can ger a brace why not?", "Giving up Officially gave up on bracing, I know I will regret this down the line but wearing a brace is so dam uncomfortable! Oh well looks like no girlfriend for me Do not give up on it man. I know how uncomfortable it is because I am also going through that right now(17) but it is really the best option out there. I am 19 man... I have had since January 2018 to do this shit and just cannot bring myself to start doing it Yea I understand I mean I have had the brace for over a year now as well. It is also taking so damn long for me because I do not like to wear it at all which sucks. I am wearing more often now(every night) but it is for sure a struggle man. Yea, You knows what is the worst about it? Summers because you can wear sweatshirts to hide it Yea I tried wearing out once during summer but man... never again. It was very visible and it was hella hot. 100 degree weather did not help either lmao. Now I just wear it whenever I sleep. Even if it takes a bit longer it is better than nothing. I know it might seem bleak right now, but I would encourage you to keep looking for solutions. I was in almost the exact same boat as you two years ago and I know how it feels. I do not know how severe yours is but its possible that your chest wall is just too hardened for a brace. You should be upfront with your doctor about your situation and if they cannot do anything then you may have to find another doctor. I know it is hard. feel free to pm me of you want to talk more How severe is yours? How old are you? You can get a girlfriend man, girls do not care about looks as much as other things anyways. Appreciate the response, my biggest fear would be a chick feeling me up and then eventually feeling the profusion and thinking I am some type of freak. I am well built though and have sizable pecs so I guess that kind of helps I used to have the same fear and avoided intimacy because of it. I still sometimes worry about what a girl might think when with a new girl, but 4 girlfriends in and each one has a similar response to my chest. They do not react or seem to notice at all, and then eventually when I mention it or ask them about it later in the relationship, they acknowledge that they know my chest is different but that it never bothered them or even made a big enough impression for them to say anything about it. Trust me it is just one of those things where you are so much more aware of it and have such a different perspective than anyone else does. Oddly enough I have had guys comment about my chest before a few times but I have never had a girl comment. Girls do not really know what is normal for a guy's chest and their not going to compare your chest in the critical way that other guys may have. Guys are always going to be comparing themselves with other guys. Yea fair point, makes sense Mate, I am 6'5\" and 170 lbs and mine is clear as day although it is only mild. Let me tell you, my lady does not care for it at all, it is nothing at all, and from what I have read, you have got meat on you, you will be right. Let me be very honest. PC does not mean you will not get a GF. I also see many pieces of advice that revolve around changing your physique as opposed to accepting it. \n\na beautiful partner is out there for you. The right person will not give a damn about ur chest. \n\nNote:\n36 yrs old male\nPC\nNever been treated...still quite have not accepted as I always catch myself massaging or pressing my sternum throughout the day. \n\n\nAllow me to save everyone here time by encouraging you all to explore Cognitive Distortions now while your young. Its basically what is taught to individuals In therapy. These same principles apply to our insecurities about our bodies (pectus car.) I am 26, 6ft1 and skinny. So obvious to everyone that I have PC. Most people do not know what it is and think either I have weird chest muscles, I have even had someone tell me they thought I was in a car crash (after 3 years of knowing them). Let me tell you too, I am not the most confident of guys, I was shy as a kid and have remained that way. Anxious of whether people can see my chest or not made me nervous in the summer and walking round in a t shirt always puts me on edge, constantly looking to see if people are staring at me. HOWEVER, since the age of 19 I have not been more than 1 month without a girlfriend... girls do not care about it dude, if anything they see it as something unique that they can poke and prod. If you work on your personality when around girls, they will be attracted by you. Girls look more at the personality rather than physical attributes. They want someone strong reliable and fun (strong mentally). Trust me on this one, when I was 18 I thought exactly the same way you did, until I just gave up so hard that I did not even care any more about being around girls and it gave me the confidence accidentally, to attract girls! You need to think \u201cwhat can I lose\u201d and then you will be onto a winner my dude. Good luck", "Does anyone know why my sternum pains after i do ab workouts?sternum feels sore for some reason.  Guys? So I just went to a specialist about this because I was having the same issue and he said that I was shifting the cartilidge in my sternum and caused some irritation. So that could be what you are doing too.", "Questions about bracing Hey everyone! I am currently 18, and I never really knew about bracing until recently. I have looked up where to go for bracing, and I could never get no serious answers. I have heard of something called \u201cMayo Clinic\u201d but the closest one to me is in another state almost 300 miles away! This is not an option for me at all, and it really frustrates me. I do not know what other kind of doctor I would see about my Pectus Carinatum. I am really insecure about it due to how bad it is. I tend to wear hoodies often, and I do not like showing my chest. I was just curious what kind of doctors I would see about bracing? Perhaps what is the name of these doctors. For example there is pediatrics, physicians, and more. \n\nI have been questioned about my chest a lot, and it makes me feel insecure. I do not like having a pointy chest and it bothers me. So I would like to try bracing, but I do not know where to begin.", "NHS I was told to wait a year before asking about getting surgery for my PC and the doctor told me to wait a year, so I did. Then after a year I was told that they no longer offer free surgeries, and that if I wanted the surgery I would have to pay 7k. I just want a normal chest but does not look like I ever will. Save the money, work. Your feelings are much more important than 7k. Eventually you will get there. How old are you? I am 17 and literally cannot find any work Yeah, it must be even harder because of the virus... Do not worry, you will eventually. But since you are only 17 there is a cheaper option which is a brace. In the UK they are around 2000$, there are cheaper and costlier ones. I heard that my provider sells them for 3500$ in UK. There are some before and after (5 momths in) pictures that I posted recently. Check them out, I am 18 and a half. I heard that the clinical commissioning group changed the guidance on surgery for chest wall deformity about a year ago. They contradict other publicly available  NHS literature i have seen regarding the indications and outcomes for surgery. It is written  as though they have made their mind up to stop offering surgery before even considering the evidence base. Is BS and they just want to save money IMO. \n\nWhere did you try to get surgery and is it 7k to go private or to just pay to have the NHS do the surgery?\n\nAnd like others have said 7k might seem like a lot at 17, but you will be surprised how quickly you can make that if you really want it. Meanwhile the nhs offer free gastric band surgery \ud83d\ude21", "Grade my Pectus Carinatum (14 years old) Hey guys, I am 14 years old and I am constantly getting concerned about my chest. Could you please grade my PC on a scale of 1-10, 1 being unnoticeable and10 being extremely evident? Thanks. \n\n\n\n\n\n Also, do I need corrective surgery Hard to say without a side picture, but I am saying 1-2.  Very minor. Hey u/dudeblackhawk, I have updated the post with two side pictures. Sorry for the bad quality, I am using my computer. Agreed, 1-2. If you build chest muscle and overall gain a bit of weight, you will likely forget it exists.\n\nBut, monitor it. Since you are 14, it may continue growing outward. Mine did (and is only on one side). Yeah man, I am sticking 1-2.  You are skinny like I used to be.  Forget surgery.  Too expensive and invasive for such a mild case.  Get into the gym.  Work on those pecs, and, obliques and lats to balance things out on your upper body.  Do not neglect legs and back.  Look for a good push/pull/legs routine on the web.  In 6 months to a year, you will be shocked at the change, both physical and psychological that you can make.  Good luck friend. Thanks u/25InchVertBTW, do you know when about it will stop growing? What happens if it continues growing outward? Thanks bro, will do Whenever you stop growing generally. Mine might still be growing at 18. If you can, look into a brace. A lot less invasive, and can avoid future growth. But again, yours seems to be uniform across your chest, so you can manage with some muscle growth and it will hide 90% of it. At your age, the brace is also a great, non invasive option to try.  It can be expensive depending on your region, insurance, etc.  But, you are at the prime age to try bracing.  Additional research had shown that bracing, combined with targeted exercise is even more effective than just bracing.  Read about bracing for sure.  \n\nKeep me updated on your progress if you feel like it, I always like to hear about other people's journeys with pectus.  Best. u/25InchVertBTW, it looks uniform but I can feel the right side sticking out slightly more to the left. I will look into braces, but my main concern is whether or not Pectus Carinatum will have any side effects. Is it merely just a cosmetic issue? u/dudeblackhawk, I will look into braces, but my main concern is whether or not Pectus Carinatum will have any side effects. Is it merely just a cosmetic issue? Should be mere side effects, yes. In extreme cases may cause issues but yours is subtle and should not cause any issues. Though if you do have some concerns, best to see a local GP. Alright, thank you so much! :) No worries! It is usually just cosmetic.  In some circumstance there can be breathing or digestion issues.  Some rarer associated conditions.  But, more often than not, it is just cosmetic with mild cases.  You should consult a doctor if you are concerned about anything beyond the cosmetic concerns.  But, the brace has done wonders for kids your age, so look into it before you get too much older.  The cartilage hardens as you age until the brace will be much less effective. u/dudeblackhawk, it possible to hide it with just exercise? I am not really super concerned with the cosmetic issues, as long as it does not impact on my lungs and heart if you get what I mean Weight training can make a huge difference to your appearance.  As for the heart and lungs, you can go see a doctor to ease your worries.  But, minor pectus is not usually associated with major medical issues. u/dudeblackhawk thanks, I think I will stick to weight training then. Since I am 14, and I have school, is 5kg ok?", "Anyone else suffer from chronic pains? (\nMy back pains are pretty unbearable at this point ngl. I believe my bracing was partly responsible for my chronic pains today. Be careful with the brace you all. As it pulls in on your chest it also yanks on your spine. Particularly bad is the sleeping on it if you always sleep on your back with it without cushion, that is not going to go over well in a few years. Not at all saying not to wear a brace, but be careful and aware, and do not wear it too tight.\nI stretch extensively nearly every day to cope, but it does not heal, that is just getting by.\nCan anyone relate?", "Today\u2019s the day I go to the doctors for my pc today!!

Then got fitted a few weeks later then waited some more weeks for it to be built Hey I have had a pretty significant pigeon chest when I finally started treatment at age 14, I am 18 now and it is pretty much gone.\n\nPlease try to wear the brace as long as possible. If the pain starts to annoy you, take a break and let the skin rest. Put some cream on the skin to rehydrate it and try to cool it (I did not do this part but it will help a lot in the beginning).\n\nIt hurt so bad for me that I could not wear it directly on the skin. I have worn the brace over a t-shirt or hoodie and it was a lot more pleasant and made it more effective because the pressure increased.\n\nWhen I felt like the brace lost pressure, I have folded some tissues and put it in between the brace and the chest.\n\nAlso, do not always do what your doctor tells you. After a while he will probably tell you that you can start wearing the brace only at night. Try to push it, wear it as long as possible, it will pay off.\n\nKeep in mind it is just the beginning that is hard, after that your skin will adapt, the area will get more flexible and you will not have any pain wearing it.\n\nIf you need any more help dm me. Thanks so much for this. I just got in high school and I am very nervous to start wearing it.

That said, how long did you or your child have to use a brace? Any info is welcome. Completely new to this. I am still wearing mine. It all depends on how serious the chest wall is.\n\nIf it sticks out badly, then it can take a while.\n\nPrimarily I wear it throughout the whole day and night.

Brace has to be worn for lonh hours because to make a change, you must adapt your body and do it more than half of the day which means more than 12 hours. For the first few months after taking the brace off the chest stays in place for minutes. But as you progress it will stay in for hours. Then eventually one day forever Do you know when the forever part happens? Is that like early 20's? After age 20. The chest starts to go solid and not as flexible.

Also, it is fixable by a brace, but the vrace works better when you are young so if you decide to do it, better do it before 18 (even earlier in my opinion).

Recently I started noticing it all the time and became self-conciouss about it,l. I fell in depression, but since I have a realy strong will I decided to get rid of it and defeated depression. I started working out and built my body very well, but PC is as visible as always. It is hard to get braces in my country (Serbia), but they would not do much in my age anyways. Because of that decided to have a surgery, but the obstacle are my parents who think it will make things worse because of scar and that it is dangerous. I cannot find many examples on the Internet, if anyone is willing to share some pictures after their surgery please send them to this e-mail:  Thanks in advance! It does not have to be your picture. If you find some pictures on the Internet please send them to me because I cannot find any.

Yeah I know what you are talking about, try to gain some weight and start working out. For me my ribs stick out almost as much as my chest", "I believe I have a rib flare (will post more pics in the comments) I called a cardio thoracic surgeon office and they were not helpful. I do not know where to start specialist wise to begin the process of fixing this and wanted to ask for advice.  ( It looks fine. you should go look at some of the young guys on here who have it worse than you. I have pc that is not really noticeable like you and I stopped letting it bother me. I found out I was subconsciously using it as an excuse to not go and do something with my life. Telling me others have it \u201cworse than me\u201d does not help. It is like saying that to someone suffering with depression. I can still move on and live my life regularly while actively working to improve this. I just wanted to know where I start the process. I called the cardio thoracic surgeon and they were not helpful and did not seem too knowledgeable on this. Orthopedist said they do not deal with this kind of stuff So Im one of those young guys that \u201chas it bad\u201d and sadly I have found this forum is not full of the most supportive people who are quick to tell you to either \u201cget over it\u201d or \u201cget it fixed\u201d neither of which are helpful. In your case I would agree that your ribs do show signs of flaring, this could be Pectus Carinatum if your sternum has also begun to protrude but either way is likely a chest wall issue. If you are still at an age where you are growing then finding a doctor to address it would be much more pressing because chest wall defects tend to present themselves during puberty and continue worsening until the patient has stopped growing completely. That being said it is really frustrating the amount of doctors who have never even heard of chest wall conditions let alone have any helpful knowledge on how to treat them. This is mostly because chest defects are super rare (Pectus Carinatum is 1 in 200,000) so honestly most doctors have only briefly read about these conditions if even that (I have had specialist google it in front of me) and only about two doctors I have ever been to had even seen Pectus Carinatum before. In my experience the medical community is not very informed or helpful when it comes to this, but I would recommend that you seek out a doctor who is a chest wall specialist so you can at least get a proper diagnosis and go from there. Good luck, it is not an easy thing to live with but there is support available and the right people will always accept you the way you are. Thank you so much for taking the time to respond and provide advice. It is harder to see in the picture I provided but the left bottom rib out sticks out way more than the right side. Unfortunately I am 24 so I am out of the growing range I believe. It is wild I can find a specialized, Pectus Clinic in the UK but no one knows what I am talking about in the US where I live. Knowing now to look up chest wall doctors gives me a good start in my research. Thank you so much again! You are definitely welcome, my ribs stick out more on one side too so it is definitely a feature of Pectus Carinatum. That is almost amazing that they have clinics for it in the UK, having lived in America my whole life I have never met a doctor who confidently understood the condition and I live in a hospital town so yikes. I hope you have some luck finding a specialist, dealing with Pectus Carinatum in your 20s kind of sucks at times but there is always treatment and hope. Thank you! I have been calling places for 2 hours and really can only find pediatric surgeons who do chest wall deformities. Luckily one children\u2019s hospital will take patients up to 28 if I can get a referral. Looking up chest wall specialists instead of flare ribs was huge in helping me better find answers so thanks again! It really is nuts how little information there is here in the US I was given a rib flare brace since its linked to my carinatum. Got it in uk from London orthotics private clinic. Not sure what countries do them I would definitely be interested in a brace but would not want to do it unless under doc supervision. In the US there is not really any Pectus clinics like the UK. It is been difficult for me to find a place that does Pectus corrections that is not a pediatric facility. I will look into the braces more for sure tho! I have had several doctors who had no idea what my condition was. One told me that I have a syndrome that happens to old ppl in nursing homes. I am 29 now and informed, if you are doctor is not familiar with the term \u2018pectus carinatum\u2019 then go see someone else. I have had similar experiences with therapists for my anxiety that are supposed by some of the symptoms I tell them, when in fact they are common experiences. Just ppl without the expertise I just want to let you know I went down the path of trying to fix it and it is not pleasant. I have spent 4000$ talking to doctors and getting opinions and it was so depressing because I could not get an answer. I was so unhappy because I thought the world was ending right before my eyes. You can only find happiness in yourself no one else can give it to you. Please trust when I say that you will not be able to fix it. If you decide to go down the road like I did... good luck because you will need it.\n\nI just want to give you the most straight up honest answer. I do not know much om the subject, but focus hard on abs exercises. I had a bit of a rib flare and it helped. It never bothered me, but I got rid of it by doing abs exercises every day. Thank you!! I will definitely make sure do so more research and stick with docs who know what is up I appreciate you sharing your experience and I am sorry that those events happened to you. However just because those were your experiences, does not make them universal experiences. I am still happy with my body but I can still wish to make improvements on it. I am luckily in a position where I have some extra funding to pursue this and will look into my options. If nothing comes of this, I am happy where I am now. I believe wanting to improve yourself physically is not a negative thing to want. Again, the original intention of this post was about where to start the process, like what specialist doctors I should see first? The type of scans needed? Etc. Thank you! I have seen the ab exercises and will incorporate them into my workouts for sure. I have read that those work if it is minor but not very well if it is more serious. I saw abound bindings too. However I wanted to see a doc in case it may be more serious than I think/a potential spine issue. At a minimum, the ab workouts will make my stomach nicer if it does not fix the rib issue!! Good luck! Thank you! And thanks again for the advice about the ab exercises \u263a\ufe0f Sorry that I cannot say anything more. I literally got rid of my rib flare (that was very minor) \"by accident\". No no I really appreciate it. I am glad you were able to fix yours!! A therapist I hope you see the same I have this too! My ribs protrude from both sides and it makes me so insecure. I am a 27 year old woman and always thought this was just my body and I could not fix it, or that I am just fat and \u201cbig boned\u201d. Thankfully I recently learned that most ribs flare because of a weak core. The problem is that crunches and other ab work outs do not fix this issue. What I have found online and what I have been doing is working on my posture and working on diaphragmatic breathing (breathing from the belly while tightening your ribs). It was a confusing concept for me to grasp but after watching a few YouTube videos I got it down. I have only been doing this for a few weeks but I really do feel much better.

That means your soft (cartilage) tissue becomes bone instead.\n\nThis process can make your sternum hurt and is usually experienced between 20-30 years of age.\n\nI do not think it is inflammation per see.\n\nFrom my own experience when this process starts, it can be both painful and also give you new symptoms like back pain etc. This is very interesting as I think I am currently experiencing this, never heard about it before. Sternum hurts at certain movements/ body postures. Occurring occasionally, right now it is worse than before. 29 y/o. Can you tell me more about that? Well I do not know what to tell you. It is a normal process in aging.\n\nThis is why bracing needs to be done in teenage years, as the cartilage comes to stiffer as you age.\n\nWhen your chest becomes less pliable you are more prone to \"feel\" it being out of position. \n\n Thank you for the information, will do some research", "Reverse Nuss Surgery by Prof. Scharr Has anyone had the reverse \"Nuss Surgery\" by Prof. Scharr? What about the \"Sandwich Procedure\" for combined Excavatum &amp; Carinatum? Can you post your story?\n\nThanks!! Hey, I will be interested in seeing the responses aswell! \n     I am getting the brace for P.C. (Pectus Carinatum) next week, and I hope it helps show improvement, I will let you know how that goes if you are interested in that! Thanks for the reply. \n\nI tried the brace when I was 20 but it was just too hard. Maybe my chest was too stiff or I was not as disciplined. I think it would have worked if I pushed harder. I wish you the best of luck because the brace is truly the best way to get this done if you can do it. I have PC and PE. I do not know what to do too (I am 21) I have had both surgeries.   \n\n\nProf Scharr did my first surgery. I asked for 2 bars but he said 1 would be fine. I was 20 or 21 at the time. Initial result was very good. Lots of pain though and he cut my lower ribs to decrease ribflare. Sternum was great job, ribs did not improve much (even looked slightly worse since no longer symmetrical).  \n\n\nThe wires holding the bar snapped and the bar changed it is position, giving me my PC back although not as bad as before surgery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I decided to get a new surgery, trying the sandwich technique, because between my chest and ribflare I had some depression. Also had my ribflare corrected with steel wires.   \n\n\nThree bars used. Two for correcting PE (e.g pushing upwards) and one in between for PC (pressing down). \n\nInitial results were super good, perfect looking chest and no ribflare at all. After a few weeks something happened and lost pressure on sternum. Also PE and ribflare is little bit back.\n\nDid not get any CT or x-ray yet to see what has happened because it is only been 4 weeks since surgery. But we will see.   \n\n\nWill probably opt for some kind of Ravitch surgery next time unless there is any possibility to re-apply pressure with my current bars... Very interesting. I met with Dr. Scharr in Germany and found him to be a very thoughtful and experienced surgeon. I already had a Ravitch surgery at age 20 but it did not work so I went to him to inquire about the sandwich technique. He spent so much time with me and my family to figure out the correct course of action. I actually emailed Scharr about the Ravitch before I got it from another surgeon in the USA and he told me to not do it. He said surgery without bars usually is not effective. He ended up being correct but I did not listen. I have a few questions for you if you do not mind...\n\n1) How have your interactions been with the doc? Did he give you enough attention when you had trouble with the first surgery and now with the second? I found him a bit too much on the salesman side even though he was very patient, smart, and knowledgable. I came out with the impression that he is the most experienced PE/PC surgeon in the world but maybe exaggerates some of his claims to persuade you for surgery. Not sure though.\n\n2) How was the care at the hospital?\n\n3) He is retiring soon. Did he tell you who would take out your bars?\n\n4) The aftermath of my Ravitch surgery has left me with nerve pain. Do you feel any pain with the bars in you? \n\n5) Did you pursue the surgery for aesthetic reasons? If so, how good did you feel when your chest was flat after the second surgery? A big boost in confidence or what?\n\n6) Are you from Germany or another country? First I want to say I am very sorry that Ravitch did not work our for you. I also wanted Dr.Scharr to do Ravitch on me due to having an asymmetric PC (sternal rotation 7-10 degrees). \n\nBut he adviced my against it and said reverse nuss would be better, and I agree with him.   \n\n\n1. Initially it was quite good, although not perfect. He did not push the surgery at me at all. He just confirmed I had PC and then said it is up to me if I want to go through with it. I think he is one of the best, or at least the one who has done most surgeries in the world. \n2. It was very good, but some nurses did not talk any English. But if you scream for painkillers they will understand. One issue I had was that they almost forgot to do pre-op tests on me. So I had to do it in a rush just before everyone went home. Did not have time to get any pre-op CT.  \n\n3. He did told me about that. But he only did my 1st surgery and that bar my 2nd surgeon removed before inserting my new bars. Removing the bars is an easy operation and I think alot of people would be able to do it. \n4. The weeks after they insert the bar is super painful. It is the worst thing I have ever felt, especially during nights. But other than that I felt no \"weird\" pain. After a few weeks I could not even feel the bar unless I took a really deep breathe. After my wires snapped I could feel a discomfort with the bar, but no real pain.\n5. My reason for getting the surgery was 70% because of  physical problem and 30% aesthetics. Mostly breathing and posture problems.  I have had so much problem with my left side back and scapula since I was 15. I have done physiotherapy since that age and I got some improvement but not much. It is a really long story, but my rib cage was very very stiff. After my initial surgery I got my mobility back within weeks. I think this was mostly because I had asymmetrical PC. But I can tell you this, laying in bed and touching the lower part of your sternum and not feeling a bump. It is an amazing feeling! But you get equally crushed when it comes back.\n6. I am from one of the Nordic countries. Had to pay both my surgeries out of pocket. \n7. No I did not. Hard to find other people who has PC because it is so much rarer than PE. \n\nMy 2nd (sandwich technique) is done by Dr. Park from South Korea. \n\nMy haller index pre any surgery was about 1.85 with alot of ribflare and depression under my chest. After first surgery I got 2.35. No rotation on sternum.\n\nAfter wire snap went back to about 1.95. 7 degree sternal rotation. \n\n2nd surgery got me back to around 2.05 but with no ribflare and no depression under chest. No rotation once again.\n\nSince bar lost pressure on my left (asymmetric side) now I do not know exactly where I am at. It was only 4 weeks since surgery and I will get a new CT in a few weeks to see where I am at. I hope I can get someone to re-apply pressure but we will see. \n\nIf there is anything else you want to ask I am glad to answer what I can. Would be a novel if I told you my entire story though. How old are you? 20 during first surgery, now I am between 23-25. Do you have pictures of before and after?", "Stole this from r/PectusExcavatum but figured it still applies to us ", "Considering mini ravitich at 27 Hi everyone. So I was diagnosed with PC around 5 years ago, I first noticed it when I was 15 or 16 and it progressively got worse. I was offered a surgical correction by the NHS in 2015 but unfortunately I had to turn this down as around that time we suffered a very sudden, major bereavement in the family which left me with massive anxiety issues around my own mortality which led me to not follow up on the offer of surgery. \n\nNow I am 27 and I do not have those anxiety issues around my own mortality I have decided to seek out corrective surgery to finally get my PC sorted. Unfortunately I have now encountered the fact the NHS have removed all funding for this sort of operation. Obviously gutted does not cover it, my PC is purely cosmetic and does not effect my physical health in any way so the chances of being offered the surgery on the NHS again are non existent. \n\nI have decided to reach out to Dr Joel Dunning, a surgeon based in Middlesbrough, he offers the surgery at cost price (\u00a37000). I am in a position to save up and pay for the surgery so I am strongly considering it. I was just wondering if anyone has any experience of going down this route? Any information and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.", "Need your opinions on my chest. What do you think ? What am I supposed to do to fix this ?  Barely noticeable brother. Mine was so much worse and needed bracing. You should just try the gym and mass gainers, they work wonders and will cover it up I would do the brace man. Pectusservices.com is your best bet. He is the guy who invented it Yes I already started hitting the gym. I am 22 year old man. It is to late to go for bracing. My only option is bulking up and hitting the gym You can brace still have you even tried seeing a doctor about it? Noo have not visited doctor Get a brace prescribed if it bothers you. Just hit the gym, do not use mass gainers. Search how to eat properly and that is it :) What do you recommend ? Training: A hypertrophy based training in general, remembering at least 2 times/week chest excercises (bench press, push ups, bar dips...). You should talk to a professional (NO BRO SCIENCE ALLOWED).\n\nNutrition: more calories that you require (hypercaloric diet) with real food (dont use mass gainers for example). Talk to a nutritionist (NO BRO SCIENCE ALLOWED).\n\nAnd just let time do its thing, you may need a few weeks/months to start seeing changes ;) When I said gym it could be calisthenics or any other compatible sport If you are looking to fix your condition, see a doctor that understands what pectus carinatum is. Do not explain it all off the bat, just mention the term and see if he recognizes what it is. It took me several doctors before one recognized what I had At the same time, like I said, yours is not too noticeable. Regardless, stay strong hand I promise it will matter much less as you get a little older", "I am 13 and 5\u201910 was wondering if I have pectus or just am very skinny. (Ps if it seems like I do have Pectus please add if it is mild/moderate or severe, and what I should do to treat it)  very mild pectus carinatum. its mild so it shouldnt affect ur helath but if u want get a  brace. i dont think its worth it tho so just go to the gym and pack on some muscle to help cover it up Thanks np Mild and only noticeable cause you are pretty skinny. 5\u201910 at 13? Jesus what are they feeding people now? Sounds like you just had your growth spurt or you are in the middle of it. Just be aware that it will probably get more severe as you continue to grow, so if you know you have a lot more growing to do, I would suggest you get a proper brace to prevent it from getting worse. You are at a great age to successfully brace so take advantage of it now do not wait Thanks - I currently am going to the gym so I was wondering if I were to get a brace how that would affect it.\nAlso, what would be more effective on reducing/hiding the pigeon chest, going to the gym or getting a brace.\nRegarding my height and future growth I have just had a big growth spurt so there is a chance I start to slow down but I might grow a bit more as my predicted adult height is 6\u20191 \nOverall I do not really want to get a brace as it is very expensive (2000\u00a3 in the UK), and it is a lot of effort as you must wear it at all times for some time and not be able to do sports.\nAm I making the right decision in choosing to stay by going to the gym? It is expensive that is true, but it may be worth it regardless. A common misconception is that you cannot workout while in the braces, but that is not true. It is actually better if you workout while wearing the brace because you get results even faster. It is true that during competitive sports you probably will not want to wear the brace, but you only need to wear it like 16 hours a day to start getting effects Very mild PC. With going to the gym and building up some muscles it will be hardly to notice! Good luck!", "Has anyone been able to change the angle of their sternum through an operation? (Not bracing) Just wondering if anyone over approx 25 has been able to change the angle of their sternum with an operation? My surgeon said at my age (28) the sternum is too solid and he cannot change the angle of it. No expert but if it is too stiff probably not I do not disagree but do you mind explaining why? Just trying to understand what is achievable through surgery.\n\nI have had one surgeon tell me he can twist the sternum into the correct position and another say that he sternum should not be operated on so i am a little confused. I have heard that they sometimes flip the sternum completely over to achieve a good result. So. I would get a second opinion. I think it is possible easily with using Abramson procedure Ngl I am no expert or surgeon. Just took a guess based on how stiff it is I (22F) have also had 1 surgeon in the past who said the sternum was too stiff, and another one who said it would still be possible. I was 20 when I underwent the Ambramson procedure, and at this moment I am waiting at the hospital for surgery to get the bar taken out after 2 years :) very happy with my decision to go through with it! I would get a second opinion if I were you. Good luck!", "Has anyone tried sleeping with something under their chest to push it in? Does it work?", "Do braces correct the condition with people over 18? Do they alleviate the pain?  No offense buddy but this question has been asked so many times...\n\nDepends on your flex in chest\n\nYes first weeks hurt. Hi,\n\nIt all depends on the flexibility of your chest. If you press down on your chest if its flexible you should be able to push it flat. If it is near solid and solid and will baerly go down. Bracing may not work or may be extremely difficult.\n\nTypically after 17 the chestwall doesnt get as flexible  but everyone is different. I am a perfect example.

I did not really think about my pidgeon chest that much when I was younger, but now I am starting to realize that it is been causing me a lot of posture and self esteem issues. Has anyone else worn the brace in their 20's? What was you experience? Am I too old for it to make a noticeable improvement? I am also 23 and it also really started to bother me during the last year. I recently went to a professional but unfortunately he concluded that my chest wall is too rigid for the brace to work. I definitely recommend you to get it checked if it could work for you, you have nothing to lose and so much to win.\n\nIf you\u2018re too old for the brace like me, then at least you know this isnt an option. This thought helped me a lot in dealing with my pc as I now have no choice other than to live with it and enjoy life with what I have. Peace Thanks for the reply! It is nice hearing from somebody who went through almost the exact same thing I am going through. I have an appointment with a specialist 3 weeks from now so I will let you know how it goes. \n\nHave you tried doing anything like posture exercises or working out once you realized the brace was not an option? Good luck with the appointment, I hope it goes well for you!\nYeah since the appointment in february this year I go to the gym regularly, it was kind of a motivation that I had no other choice left (for surgery it is too mild of a deformation) and the specialist also told me it will help cover it up. Since my deformation is pretty symmetrical I can say it surely looks better now that I gained some weight/muscle and I even sometimes completely forget about it when I\u2018m out, something which I could never do before so that\u2018s really nice. Do I have good chances for a brace, I am 17 and a half? Yes, your chances are pretty good. It says that if you are under 19 years old that there is a 65 - 80% chance of it working for you. However, I would get the brace asap and start wearing it for the best results. I already contavted Joeseph Anthony (Pectus Services), I just need to tell my parents I want a brace. Thank you for the answer. It is definitely worth checking with a specialist, the brace works differently for everyone, so you may be a great candidate for it, or a really bad one, but definitely worth trying to find out! If not always remember surgery is an option! For me I prefer the brace because I personally do not like the though if surgery, but it is always an option if the brace is not. Update: \n\nJust went to the clinic today to get an assessment for a brace and it looks like I will  be getting one. The doctor did not make any promises and said that because of my age there is no guarantee that it would work but that he is had some success treating adults. \n\nOn the plus side, he said that because my pectus was on the milder side and that it was centered more towards the middle there is a better chance it might work. The brace actually looks pretty  discrete but probably going to have to wear it for close to a year though. \n\nI will post another update a couple months from now to let you know how it is working. Any updates on this? Did you end up getting the brace? How is it so far if so. I am considering getting one myself It actually worked pretty good for flattening my chest down but unfortunately I did not realize at the time that my biggest problem was my back. Apparently I have a spine deformity too and I think the pectus was there to balance me and stop my body from swaying backwards. In summary, I would reccomend the bracr only if your back is not also messed up like mine is. How is your back messed up? Like scoliosis ? Kyphosis ? Wait so your chest did flatten ? Are you done wearing the brace? Kyphosis. Ya my chest did flatten out and my pectus was almost gone. I only  wore it for like 3 months too. Not wearing it anymore once I realized it was messing my back up more. Started having lower back pain and leg spasms. My kyphosis was in like the 95th percentile though. If you want to try the brace I would say go for it but just make sure your kyphosis is not worse than your pectus like mine was", "will my mild pectus get worse with age? i am 14 and went to the doctor over my pectus deformity. he told me it was a mild case of pectus but where it is mild and barely noticeable he said that it is deemed as a cosmetic problem so did not feel the need to give me any treatment options. he also told me that as i get older and work out my chest will fill out and i can hide it, but from doing a bit of research i have heard that it can get worse with age. Yeah at your age it can definitely get worse and probably will at least a little bit\u2014 until you stop growing at like age 17-22. Doctors are typically very inexperienced with this condition, so do not automatically trust their judgement just because they have a degree. You should consider getting a brace. Since yours is very minor you will not have to brace as many hours a day Yup that is exactly what my doctor told me when I was around your age and it had just began to be noticeable. She told me that I will go away but it just got worse. It was not until I was around 16 and I went in again where they actually gave me a brace (mild case). It was not to late but it sure would have been better and faster if I got it earlier. Get a brace man, you are very young and will continue to grow Get a brace, I think everyone on this subreddit had a \"it is just cosmetics\" doctor. They are just ignorant, it obviously bothers you so why not get rid of it when there is an option, a pretty good option as well. Just contact a brace provider, you have time since you are only 14 (it works the best until you are 19), but better do it as early as you can. I got my brace at 18 a few days ago. In my country noone would even mention anything besides a surgery which is awfuly agressive. I found out about the brace while I was doing my research, I got my brace through pectusservices when their doctor traveled from US to Poland, I had to travel there from Serbia. I hate Serbian doctors from the depths of my heart, if I was not smart enough I maybe would get a surgery and destroy my chest. I am 23 now, mine got worse indeed. Our body grows, so it is natural that the leftists will grow a little bit as well.\nIt annoys me less nowadays though, people have not asked it about it for years and I simply forget I have it.\nBut I have developed some techniques that are so natural that I do without noticing. I tend to cross my arms, hunch over a little bit while I walk and feel uncomfortable If I have to stand up without a place to lean on, I always use backpacks and even if they do not have to be heavy, I put extra stuff in there so they disguise a little bit crumpling my t shirt, so it affects my life in some negative ways. I do not go to places where I have to take off my shirt like beaches, waterfalls and whatnot.\nMy girlfriend and ex girlfriends have never asked about it, but I always found a moment to explain them and let them touch it, so it would not create an embarrassing moment during the sex, none of them worried about it though and accepted very well.\n\nI am thinking about surgery, not sure yet, it costs 13,000$ here in Brazil in the most famous doctor (that treats pectus) here. It does not have a big effect in my life, even though it is uncomfortable.\nYou are young yet, you can do swimming and even work out and you can disguise it having larger and and stronger chest, your bones are growing yet so you are in a good phase to work out, of course with the advice of professionals. i spoke to my parents and they are going to phone the leading pectus clinic in the uk. hopefully if i get an appointment with them i will be able to get a brace to fix my pectus. i am pretty sure they teamed with the guys who created the t-joe brace so i know that i will be getting something high quality. hopefully all goes well :) Which clinic is that?", "How bad would you say that it is?

I did not know he would do this and I regret it every day as I have increased symptoms after the resection. Oh okay. That is why I am planning on getting Ravitch done since I saw pretty good results on this subreddit and other sites even though it is more invasive.

I understand, probably better than most that getting out of a mental slump.  Any time you need to talk, hmu.\n\nFor reference, I have been balding since 16, I am 66\" and 125 lbs(at 28).

Thanks for sharing your story, I am actually curious to hear more yea I will dm u hey man, just started high school and beginning to hear the names fly in. Because of covid the school is set up in quarter systems, first quarter we have 2 subjects (i.e english and cooking) now i am at the last quarter. Which includes P.E, and this lasts 3 months. Any advice to accept this deformity in locker room situations or just when i get straight out made fun of? People always make fun of things that are different, and things that others cannot fix. It sucks, but own it! Own who you are, come up with something you like about it and when someone tries to make a comment about it, turn what you like into a joke. Cannot make fun of someone who makes fun of themselves. The comments will come HEAVY because they think you are uncomfortable with it, then that make your more uncomfortable. Do not let it happen!\n\nBe happy with who you are, as you are. Change only for yourself and not for the things others say. Thanks man \ud83d\ude4c No need to thank me!

It is not very noticeable, but I am worried it could possibly lead to difficulty breathing. Should I get a brace? I am just concerned that I would have to wear it all day which would make it extremely obvious. Any advice? Typically when you first start bracing you will have to wear it 23hrs a day for around a week. If it is not causing you any serious problems, then you do not have to brace if you do not mind it.\n\nIf it does bother you cosmetically, then maybe it is something you can do over winter break, or summer break. If you do choose to get a brace I recommend   I had an extreme case of PC and it was corrected in about 4 months using his brace.

I am a 22 female that never got their pe/pc fixed surgically or with a brace. If I could go back in time and my parents would have let me talk to my doctor about it more, I would have. Now that I am older I do not think there is really any options for me, and I think the surgery would be too invasive for someone who is terrified to go under. This is the best time to get it fixed if you want to! But if you do not, just talk with your doctor and maybe see if you get x-rays. They will be able to tell how far down the cartilage/bone goes down in the inside. My chest is sensitive to firm touch, but other than that, it is never given me issues. I just had to work on my self esteem really hard and learned to love myself. My pm\u2019s are open if you ever need support! Mind me asking how old you were when you got the brace? Any pain or skin issues etc when you were wearing it? I got it when I was almost 15. So about two-ish years ago. I had some skin irritation on my chest and back from the brace, but it was not anything crazy. \n\nThe pain was almost insufferable for the first month, but this was also because I have some connective tissue disorders which gave more pain on top of it. I had to wear it 24/7 for the months that I did do it, if I did not then it probably would have taken at least a year to correct due to the severity of my PC. It is still there, but barely noticeable now. Definitely worth it.", "severe pectus. what can i do to improve it and how bad is it really?  Bro, that is not bad at all!

Any advice? Bench press. Press ups. For excersises to work on that chest\n Great tutorials on YouTube I recently got back in the gym (aftet my bracing treatment that was a success). Boy did I lose a lot of strength, but I am almost back to my PB after a month. I would just look up workouts on youtube, if you really need it you can get a personal trainer for a few months to help with motivation and form if you do not have a friend to go to the gym with. Then after you get the hang of it, just do it on your own yeah, I have been doing youtube and working out at home.  \nI probably do need someone to help me check my form.   \nI have been working out pretty consistently for a few months, but particularly with my chest I do not feel that the muscles are engaging. what you eat really helps as well.

Any advice? Mhm, I am not sure why you are getting rashes even when wearing a shirt. Do you sweat a lot? Try taking short breaks and applying some skin smoothing cream. \n\nBut I do not see why you would get red when wearing a shirt. I was given extra padding. Rashes can occur with shirt on. Especially if you are new to it. Ask your specialist or doctor what cream to use. I have had a bad one om the back, it even started bleeding once.

They say the brace is barley visible under a tshirt and it is a painless process well let me tell you both of those are lies, you can see the brace clearly through a winter jacket and hoodie underneath then the brace causes this burning sensation in the effected area and the expect you to wear this for 2 years yea idk. Just thought I give all you a heads up with this terrible thing Braces usually are not that visible to an average person, but if you hang out with same people they will notice it and I honestly do not see the problem.\n\nThe bracing treatment is very hard, but it pays off. Without sacrifices, the result will be minimal. Also, plenty of braces that are worn for only a year, not 2 years. 2 years will come you can either have a normal  chest by then or not. Only other option to get rid of it is surgery so you have 3 choices live the rest of you life with it, surgery or brace.\n\nIf you do not wear the brace because of other people you are basically saying there opinion of you is more important than your own body. Which is not a good mindset to have in life.\nWithout pain without sacrifice we would not have anything. So true. I recently finished my bracing treatment and it was successful. I remember that I told my friends about the brace the first day I wore it. They would never even mention it. There is no reason to feel uncomfortable about the brace because you are doing something good for yourself.

My sternum began protruding noticeably around puberty at the age of 12. It took a year or two of it developing outwards further before my parents decided that I should see a doctor for it and sadly most doctors have been unhelpful to downright hurtful in this regard ie. showing me off to med students which I always agree to so I can promote medical awareness of this frustratingly rare condition. I was given a brace at 14 and after trying it for a while decided just to live with my body as it naturally is, no brace no alteration to my protruding sternum. As we all know the self confidence issues are awful, especially in those teenage years I was anxious 24/7 and always dressed to hide my chest. Now I am almost 21, happy with my natural chest and have always been supported and loved for myself by my partners who never judge and always do their best to understand.

Check the T joe pdf for useful information  My brace cost thousands and it felt cheap. It was made from a decent quality hard metal and felt horrible. It constantly clicked when I walked and was super bulky around me. Very noticeable if I was wearing a shirt and decently noticeable when wearing a hoodie. I could not sleep in it at all even tho my doctors told me I had to. Words can not describe how uncomfortable that thing was to me. I got it when I was about 15 and I wore it for a total time of about 2 days. I would take it off every second I could. I can attach pictures of my actual brace if requested. I am almost 18 now and my chest still looks awful but I would rather live with it than wear that brace. I mean, bracing is hard, but it is not supposed to be easy. In the end it is worth it. \n\nBrace being noticeable is the last thing that you should care of, I told everyone who I spend time with about the brace on the first day I wore it. That way you do not have to wory if anyone will notice it because you already told them about it. My friends never even mentioned it after that.\n\nYou cannot do anything about it being uncomfortable other than using creams or sponge. It is very bad at the beginning, but as time goes you even forget about it at times.\n\nFor anyone that wants to get a brace, listen. It is a great way to get rid of your PC and it has high success rates. It is not dangerous at all and you avoid a surgery. It is also cheaper than surgery in most countries. It is not easy, but it seriously changed my life. If you can, you should get a brace. You are correct, I was going to say. It is never that easy or never uncomfortable.\n\nIt will be a pain in times, but certainly is worth it. Overcoming the difficult part is hard but when you do it gets easy. I really did not care about it being noticeable. I really cared about the pain. I am always in pain either from wrestling or working out or pulling a muscle in my lower back. The pain that brace gave me was unbelievable. I could not tolerate it at all. The doctors said I had to sleep in it but the way the brace was I could not lay down or sleep at all. If the brace did not hurt half as much I would of worn it with little complaints. It was the worst. Damn, was you not given any padding or foam. Braces are painful early on for some. I understand what you went through. But it should not of been super severe pain. What brace clinic did you see? Children's mercy in Kansas city. There basically was not her foam or padding. I told my doctors how much it hurt me and they said that it was normal. What I went through was not normal. The brace I wore kept breaking screws too. If you google children's mercy Pectus the braces in the picture are similar to mine. I have kyphosis (scoliosis too if memory serves) so it made it worse. How much time it took for brace to ship? Might cry and I never do but I just had the surgery to remove it and found this", "Is this pectus carinatum, or is my sternum just arching a bit? I never really noticed it until a few months ago. I do not think I will necessarily do anything about it, but I do not love the way it looks on myself.\n\n I am 29 and have this.\nUnfortunately I do not have an answer, I am sorry. \nYou probably want to speak to your GP or get an Xray. Looks like PC to me, your entire sternum has an angle.\n\nThe normal PC only protrude in the lower part, but some cases protrude in other areas. And they told you yours was not technically pectus carinatum? Or are you meaning for my case in particular you do not have an answer Is there any reason I should have it checked out by a physician? Or is there not much I can do / not much it would change? (Not necessarily externally, I just mean like are there internal adverse effects of having such) If you do not have any issues from it (physical or psychological) there is not much reason for it no.\n\nIt is not inherently dangerous, but in some cases it can have some comorbidities, like back pain.\n\nUnless you want invasive surgery done, a doctor is not going to be able to do anything. A physical therapist might be able to help you if you have poor posture or back pain. Ah okay. Thank you! I already see a PT for back pain and poor posture actually haha, so I guess I am ahead of the game I have pectus carinatum and even scoliosis, to be honest I actually have not had anyone look at it. \nJust been told, this is what I have.\nAnd yes sorry, in you case I do not have an answer.\nI just thought, a GpP or an xray would be your best bet or even a specialist", "Cheapest possible brace can someone link me to a really cheap brace, this thing has been annoying me even though im young (15), but i heard that its better to get rid of it at a young age before things get worse, plus my familly is really low on money right now so a cheap one would be nice, i would also like any workouts that could help hiding it or decreasing it until i get a brace, thanks I would advise to not go for a cheap brace, you need one that is custom made to fit your chase.\n\nI used a cheap brace and it is really not worth it trust me. What is your location? Sorry, I would go for a expensive one. NEVER buy one online. It can harm the chest. Why? Well because when you get a specialist brace. They will measure your chest and everything to ensure it would be alright on the chest.\n\nHonestly, if you want an effective one. You got to spend the money I am afraid. Although some countries do it free.\n\nDo press ups. Search pectus carinatum excersises. Bench pressing would be good aswell.\n\nSpecialist brace which will cost is only option. They will give your excersises. Check up on you with progress and give suggestions. egypt, its not available ANYWHERE here, im asking for what to buy since my uncle in chicago will be visiting us in egypt and he could buy me one and bring it with him so, yea well I understand but my case is actually pretty mild, its barely noticeable with a shirt on, even with a shirt off you wont notice it until you touch my chest, so buying an expensive one would be a waste, since id only wear it for a month or two and then take it off, that is why im asking for a cheap one, can you tell me the prices of a decent one, not so expensive and not so cheap maybe? i just want to control it before things get worse and i dont want to leave it untreated I mean, a cheap but effective one would cost 1000. Depending on the country. 1000 dollars? Correct Only a specialist brace would fix the chest since u got to get measured or scans.. Non medical wont work. 1000 is considered cheap. alright i appreciate the help, thanks There are some DIY options online if you are really desperate, but I cannot imagine they work very well. I am not a doctor, and so I cannot give medical advise.. \n\nBasically you just look at the shape of the braces online and get some materials like wood for the back and wherever you need it on the front. You would also need some padding, so that it is not just wood against your skin. \n\nThe sides connecting the front and back work better if you can get a firm material that will not push into your sides, but if not just using something like a belt will hold them tight.  \n\n\nI hope you can find some better options. Best of luck. I made one myself tbh. I do not think you really need to buy one. Just used 3 belts 2 over my shoulders, and one around my chest/back. Rolled up a pair of shorts, put it right on the OUTER MOST bump and problem solved. Now I do not even wear it, I just sleep on my chest, put a pillow/ clothes under it to keep the pressure. Not comfortable sleeping, but it stops any protrusion. So I would say it is worth it. It got pretty bad around 13/14, to where you could see it even with a loose shirt. Then I started self bracing around 16 years old. Around 18 years old it finally went away. Now at 20 it is coming back, as I have been getting lazy with the maintenance. You have to be VERY diligent with the bracing, no matter what brace you use. It is a very annoying condition but completely reversible depending on your commitment. Just use something SOFT to put on the bump. It will ensure that most of the pressure is focused on the most protruded part of the chest. I know it is not from a doctor, but it worked for me. And it was free.", "I am 15 with PC but my parents are against getting it treated. My parents are scared that a brace might affect my body and they are 100% against surgery. Is there anything I can do to help reduce the problem without the 2 methods above? What logic do they have to say that the brace might negatively affect your body? The worst that can happen is some skin rashes that will likely fade or completely go away over time and some discomfort- in exchange for correcting a chest wall deformity that will likely impede on your social and mental well being for the rest of your life. My advice: GET THE BRACE WHILE YOU CAN - you are 15 and are a perfect age to do it. You need to get on the brace NOW if you sincerely care at all about correcting this. Even if it means going against your parents will, find a way. But I suggest convincing them first. I think the best you can do right now is to try to educate your parents, if* they are willing to listen. Your teen years are the most ideal time for bracing, because your body is developing, or in late stage development. Yes, it is possible that bracing may cause rib flare. Yes, it may cause skin irritation. Your parents may have their own reasons they are anti-bracing, and they are entitled to their opinion. As far as surgery goes, it is a serious surgery. \n\nHowever, I think the best you can do now is to inform/educate your parents on the real affects of PC and how it impacts your life, and how it may affect your future. I think the largest impact that is difficult to overcome for all parties is the psychological impact it has on you. However, the most solid grounds to argue your case is the physical affects it has in your body  (i.e. shortness of breath, tenderness or pain, rapid heart rate, etc.). As you age, it may continue to worsen, and cause additional pain/symptoms as your chest wall moves and develops, which could worsen all of the physical side affects it can cause. \n\nMaybe not all of this directly relates to your specific health, but while a minor under the care of your parents, I think the best thing you can do is inform your parents of the facts (there are many studies online and a reason insurance companies will cover treatment) that may have them reconsider treatment with a doctor. its very mild tho so that is what is enoucraging my parents to ignore it.\n\nwith t-shirt its not noticable but when my top is naked it there is a noticable buldge as well as a chest slightly larger than the other its very mild tho.\n\nthroughout my childhood i did have shortness of breath and high heart rates but its getting better and my parents blamed that on nose allergies.\n\nother than that the only real effect is the shape of my body, my sternum sticks out a bit Understandable.\n\nThere may be symptoms that you cannot fully comprehend or attribute to your PC, and as I stated, it is possible that it gets worse as your body matures and develops. \n\nIMO, mild cases while younger are even better to brace because it can be corrected much more easily, and prevent potential symptoms later in life. \n\nI am not a doctor or in your shoes to understand your case, just giving my opinion. yea i understand that. \nthanks for your opinion Brace is the best thing they can do for you... What are those people doing, make sure you show them the results and opinions of other peiple, because I literally NEVER saw a negative one. Try to get a brace.   \n\n\nIf you correct it now it will be fine. If you are not comfortable with your body down the line you will have to get surgery which is A LOT more expensive and more complicated. Results might even be worse than bracing too! \n\nBracing will 100% not affect your body in any negative way, just the other way around. I agree with everyone to get a brace and give it a shot. You are pretty young and there is serious potential of it getting more severe and problematic as you reach your late teens. To you are parents point, It DOES have negative side effects to your body which no one talks about. It will cause chronic mucle tightness, raised anxiety, and if you are uncareful with it you can cause scoliosis by sleeping with a big bulky thing on the back right on your spine. BE CAREFUL and diligent about protecting the health of your body if you get the brace. That being said, I DO recommend you get the brace mainly because your pectus could get much worse with age. Many of us have been in your shoes with pectus not very bad and very innocent about it but I promise you we have all been through a lot of pain in our lives that could have been avoided if we would had the opportunity to brace at a younger age. So maybe just do it and know you are probably dodging a bullet. Also if you get the brace, to protect from the negative effects, stretch frequently alright thank you for ur advice!\nwill sure keep that in mind", "Do Rounded Shoulders braces work as well?

Its only on one side and my dr said its the \"good kind\" that makes my chest look more muscular and that he wishes he has it like me (the cartilage on the very inside of my chest is a little more pronounced so it makes my pecs pop out more, its not like most peoples where they have a pigeon chest)   If you are 19,it probably will not get worse.

To sleep on my left side more? I am not sure it matters but I think sleeping on the back would be the best, even though it is the most uncomfortable.", "Just curious if I have it or not ? I have struggled with this a bit.  Pics are not great but yeah, there is a bit of PC. How do you feel about it ? Age? Yes, there is pc here. I am not a doctor(or trained medical in any way shape or form). But your ribs also seem to be flared a bit.if you struggle with it personaly you should go get it checked out. Yes, can also spot the flared ribs. PC and PE It is affected me a lot with my self image I have always been quite thin so having it there visible and right underneath the skin has just got to me. It is also made wearing bras and laying on my side extremely uncomfortable.

Get ointment or somthing dude Yeah I get this too. Get some Vaseline or ointment and wash it a lot and try to heal before putting brace back on fully I wear a sports t-shirt instead of just normal cotton one. It helps for me with vaseline. I just poped it or just wore it over it. It did leave a rash constantly on my sides and chest but it went away after I got my brace readjusted and overtime the scaring went away", "Are there any experienced surgeons that do online consultations for PC? The options for surgeons that treat PC are very limited in my city, even  more limited for surgeons that have decent experience or knowledge in PC. I am desperate to find a surgeon that can treat me so I thought online consultations was worth a shot, at least in the meantime until I can travel to meet them. Has anyone done this or know of any good ones? Thanks They probably all do now that this virus stuff is happening. I know Dr. J at Mayo Clinic does it. Awesome thanks i will try them", "? what exercises should i do for my PC? Here is one suggestion for you  Do not think of it as doing specific exercises for PC, your going to want to start a full body workout plan. As you add size across your whole body, this is important for health and aesthetics, your PC will diminish in noticeability", "How bad is my pectus?  \nIm 17, not diagnosed with pectus caranitum yet but speaking to a orthotic surgeon next week. I am sure I have pectus but wanted to come to here and see what others thought. I had a heart condition and had surgery for that on the 5th of March this year, around that time I was also about 5\u201d4 / 5\u201d5. I have had a massive growth spurt since now nearly being 6\u201d0. My chest is flexible and i can push it in a little with some force, I am thinking of Bracing.  Would love to hear your thoughts I would go for a brace for sure. It is worse than mine was, but what is important is only how you feel. +1 Okay Thankyou, I am speaking via zoom to someone about it on Monday Definitely pectus. Was exactly like mine. You also have the rib flaring. I suggest you get a pectus brace. Have a look Into London London orthotics (LOC) Google them they do brace treatment in UK. Yh Thankyou it is so annoying over in the UK they do not understand it, been to hospital numerous times, had a MRI and nothing Yeah, I went straight to a pectus specialist called LOC  definitely reccomend in UK. Although he brace is expensive  the big lump like in yours is smaller now after I have started the bracing Yeah I have been recommended them and I am FaceTiming someone on Monday to speak to them about it, how much was the brace if you do not mind me asking? 1k I believe. All the prices are here  Thanks, what does the clinic fee mean ? Can I just go with the bracing? I believe so. I cant remember. It looks very symmetrical The picture probably does not show enough but I can definitely tell the left side is bigger I have a similar pectus,very symmetrical, I think less severe than yours and I am currently using a brace that I made for myself", "What do you think is the latest age someone could start wearing a brace and be successful doing so? Also, explain you reasoning if you want to.\n\n(", "I am 16 years old. This affects everything in my life. I cannot even feel comfortable in most of my shirts. Am I too late for the brace? The doctors I have seen do not really seem to know much about it. They are recommending me the brace, I just want my chest to be flat more than anything.  not too late get the brace bro Yeah, the only thing is I am concerned because my chest is almost hard as a rock at this point, I used to be able to push it in easily. I feel like the brace would hurt really bad and I would feel a ton of pressure on my chest  i feel u but i think the bone will only get harder from here tho. I believe there is still time but i am not professional. ur age is why i think there is time. It will reduce it. I believe u want to get a recommendation from ur general doctor to see an Orthopedic. I think that is what it is called Thanks man. The process of getting my chest looked at has been a pain in the ass. I have been to like 3 or 4 doctors over the past like 6 months and none of them really knew much about it at all. About 6 months ago I had really high hopes I was going to get this fixed, but it is taken sooo long to finally get an answer for them, probably because I have shit insurance. Now I am waiting to see if my insurance will cover for the brace. Shit sucks  keep trying do not give up. seriously. wish u luck bro. ur not alone \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc Thanks man I know exactly how you feel. My chest looked very similar to yours before I had surgery. I do not know what type of doctors you have been to but you absolutely must go to a doctor that specializes in pectus deformities. In my experience, normal orthopedic doctors did not seem to be very much help. I posted my story on this sub a while back and I think it might be very helpful for you to read if you can find it (I will  try to link it below). I can give you some doctor recommendations if you need them. I promise there is hope around the corner and I know the horrible feeling of not being able to wear a T-shirt. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Thanks a lot man, it feels really nice knowing other people have dealt with this too. There is barely any information/people talking about it online, so I decided to post in here. I really want to get the surgery, but it almost everyone in my family tells me it is not worth it and I should not because of how painful it is or whatever. I honestly do not care how much it hurts or how long the recovery time is. It would just feel amazing waking up to a normal chest. Thanks a lot man I will pm you if I have any questions  If your insurance does not cover the brace, search on Amazon.  There is one available that you can buy without a prescription and it looks quite similar to what the prescription companies offer. Thanks man. Yeah I am going to talk to my parents about that. My dad just started a new job and I will get good insurance from that, just will have to wait a while. Do you think the braces you can buy online will fit any chest? I feel like mine is a bit worse than most people that have it  I think they have a large range.  Try searching for it and have a read.  I think it is about $200. Thanks bro I will check it out  No problem, stay positive.  You are not alone. &gt;I really want to get the surgery, but it almost everyone in my family tells me it is not worth it and I should not because of how painful it is or whatever.\n\nThis sounds familiar. I would advise that you do not give a lot of weight to the opinions of people who do not either have the deformity or specialize in its treatment. I had surgery to correct my PC and it was absolutely worth it.\n\nI hope bracing is still an option for you and that you continue to pursue whatever remedies you and the *right* specialist decide are best.\n\nPlease reach out of you have questions or need support. Best of luck to you! Thanks a lot bro. The doctors I have spoken too have not even mentioned surgery.. which is kind of odd. It is annoying because I want to mention the surgery but for some reason my mom seems so against it.. I just want the surgery, it would be way easier than wearing an uncomfortable brace for like 2 years Hi RedBoss ! 19y old guy here. I have a pectus similar to yours, mine is a bit asymmetric and noticeable.\n\nI recommend you ask doctors about the brace and try that procedure. If your sternum is still flexible, it may help to correct it. \n\nIf you can find a pectus specialist it would be great, there are no specialists here in my city, so I had to go with a chest specialist who sent me to an orthopedist. He took some measurements and made a brace for me (which is super uncomfortable lol) But anyway I will try :) \n\nI am supposed to use it 23-24hs a day. Today is the third day in which I will try to use it 18-20hs.\n\nSo, try and find out about the brace ! \n\nSorry if my English is not very good hehe Hey man sorry I have not logged into this account in a while. I have a brace now. I have been having a hard time wearing it for more than an hour. It is super uncomfortable. I am trying my best to remind myself to wear it everyday but it is hard If you are young enough to get the brace DO IT!!  Waiting could mean a very expensive surgery that insurance most likely will not cover. I wish that we would have done that for my son but we did not because the pediatrician acted like it was no big deal.  10 years later my son is having to shell out over 30k for surgery.  Get the brace! Oh and a Thoracic dr would probably be able to help you and would know more about this if you are having issues getting a Dr to help you.", "Hurts my back when wearing Pectus Brace. Please help!  HI! So I got a Pectus brace a while ago, and there came instructions on how long go wear it. It starts with 1 hour, next day 2, next day 4, next day 8, all the way to 24 hours a day. But I never got past 4 hours because when I wear my brace my back feels so sore/in pain while wearing it. And as soon as I take the brace off it feels better. You would think the front would hurt because that is what the brace is trying to fix, but the pain is mostly on the back for me! I am 15 years old rn. WHY is this happening? Am I wearing it wrong? Will it get better over time? Is there something I can take while it is trying to get used to the brace?? Help!   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for bad picture quality, dunno why its so pixelated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Goddamn, that is a bulky ass brace. I also had the back pain, it will go away in a couple of weeks. How many hours a day do I have to wear it for it to go away? 24/7, that is the only way its going to do the job Wondering if it is the type of brace you have it does look bulky and bigger then it needs to be. I had a bulky brace and the pain was too much on the back and ended up switching with a less bulky brace and it was an improvement on the back due to it being lighter.\n\nHopefully your pain goes eventually are you doing any physical excersises ? Posture excersise can help a lot, or can you add any padding to the back peieace? Yeah, the brace worsens you posture. Little can be done, but try adding sponges on thes back. When you take it off do abs and back exercises I have a different kind of brace but I have the same issue. My pc is far out from the middle so the right side of my back carries all the pressure so that is what is causing my pain. I now can wear it for 4 hours straight and I am trying to sleep with it but after 1 hour I wake up and I am sore everywhere.", "heart rate 30 trans ftm with fairly significant PC and flared ribs. Knew I had it for years but only just started doing  serious research. The aesthetics are not the most important thing for me, but I have had a concerningly high heart rate all my adult life (rarely dips below 100 bpm, currently at 117 while totally at rest). I have also had breathing problems for the last 5 years or so (attributed to asthma and stress), mostly managed with improving posture and building core strength but I have to take meds every day and still have flare ups. I had no idea PC could affect heart rate, and I have a lot of concerns about maintaining a heart rate this high as I age. If you had surgery, brace, or physical therapy to address your PC, was your heart rate affected?", "I may have PC but I have not been diagnosed Sorry if this is not relevant or something, I just want to talk about the struggles of having a possibly undiagnosed PC.\n\nI am a female who is just turned 20 and I have been thinking that I have PC for a while now. I am writing today because I am having pain in my ribcage, both back and front. I have always thought that there was something wrong with my chest, it is not very visible becaus of the breast, but my sternum sticks about a centimetre more out to my right. I will have pain in my chest from time to time but today was the worst. My right clavicle also sticks up more than the left. \n\nI have not been diagnosed but I am certain I have PC and it is starting to effect me more and more. I do not feel comfortable in regular bras and it is really affecting my self esteem. \n\nI am a student and had to change my doctor because of moving but I am in a waiting list. If I want to go to a doctor for this i cannot really go to the ER so I do not know what to do. I live in Norway if that helps you understand the doctor system. It is hard for me to express this but I  think you have to hit the point where you realise you simply do not care anymore about what people think about you are body anymore. It is not something that changes you as a person, they do not tend to actually look that bad and do not tend to be overly harmful. It is a part of yourself, we conceive good and bad through societial norms so once you see through that, everything becomes easier. You will not worry about things like breast size, height, chest or anything because none of it ultimately matters. It will only matter to one other person in your life, whom should accept you, for you. In terms of it hurting, I am not sure if that is because you are a female but I am pretty sure that is not part of it exclusively, it could be something else. I think there are cases of it affecting stamina to an extent. Anyways I hope you consider what I said and have a good life without the worry of what people think :)", "Getting a brace at 16 I was 14 years old when I went to get my pectus carinatum diagnosed and they never mentioned getting a brace. Early last month I went to the doctor's to get my scoliosis diagnosed and he brought up my pectus. He said since I am near the end of puberty the brace will not be as effective. I wanted to know if there is still a chance for me to get the brace. Yes you likely are. Do not listen to doctors who say you are too old , they are mostly quacks who do not know shit about PC. You are as ripe of an age as it gets. I am 10 years older than you and am bracing right now and it is working Does bracing hurt? Can we talk Happy to answer ur questions here sure Did you have a brace? Did it hurt Yeah I am doing it now. It hurts in the beginning mostly when your changing your chest shape. Once you got it down say after 3-4 months then it hurts much less and is more just a thing to manage. Definitely not easy tho Does it hurt more than tooth brace or is it the same you think How do you recommend helping the pain? I experience severe burning on my chest and pain in my back. It is a different kind of pain sort of but maybe not as painful as braces on teeth Have you tried using sudocrem? I also use baby powder and that helps the skin a lot. Other than that take breaks if you can to let yourself heal a bit But Are you done now and did you have a severe case", "Could muscle fix this uneven look? If so, how long would it take?  I cannot even see it to be honest. You seem built to grow a lot of muscles so i think if you are going to work out, you will not be able to see it yourself anymore in probably a couple of months. Yeah, this probably is not the best angle but from the side i do have quite an inflated look on my chest, but I am only 15 so if I build some muscle and it is still bad, I could probably consider getting a brace. yours is barely noticeable, jut get muscles and ull be good. remember its a long process of consistency and good diet so dont give up early! Thanks for the encouragement, forgot to add that I am still growing though so it will probably just get worse as that happens. I am 17 with a bit more noticeable pectus than you but still purely cosmetic really.  \nStarted building more muscle and the bigger I get the less visible it gets.  \nJust trust the process do not worry :) yours is barely noticable my guy, ppl would not know it was pectus unless u told them it was.\n\nyes building muscle helps but i would also reccomend cutting down and getting abs as it makes a big distraction in that area and makes the bumps and lumps seem normal and fit in", "PC with boobs: wire bra that does not hurt!! So I have (F26) had PC since I was 8, live in Canada so while our healthcare is free, non life threatening conditions are usually brushed aside since Drs usually have way too many patients to handle. Like everyone else in this sub I have had a lot of self esteem issues; like a lot of the women in this sub I have never been able to find a supportive bra that does not hurt. Up until the past year or so I have ALWAYS had a push up bra on to try and hide the protrusion - did not matter that I was hurting myself by wearing them, I just wanted to feel more feminine (doing better now, it is still an insecurity but I am trying to be more gentle in the way I label my own body). I have mostly been wearing unlined bralettes but wanted to find something with a little more support. Decided to try the blush lingerie cotton underwire bra, and am so excited about it! The first wire bra that I have found that does not hurt/cause blisters. The wire stops at a higher point on the chest than most wire bras, so they are not directly poking the highest point of my protrusion. It is unlined so I personally find it more comfortable than the padded ones, I know some do not like that though. Their size calculator worked perfectly for me also. Anyways I just wanted to share and hopefully make someone else's bra hunt a little easier :) ( Wow thanks", "I have had the pectus carinatum brace, it has definitely helped but u can still feel it sticking out a bit, my parents say I am just being paranoid but I am sure it still sticks out a bit. Any opinions?  sticks out a bit but not enough to make me think anything is wrong. Ribs do not have any flaring/upper chest is not flat i would say you are better off than a high percentage of ppl that have PC. I would not stress yourself out or worry brotha", "Where can i buy a brace online? I think the only way to get it is if i purchase it online, im 20 /m , tried to talk to a doctor once about it, brushed it off like it was nothing (it is very visible), this is sort of my 3 am cry for help, PC  does not pair well with anxiety/suicidal tendencies. Need a change.  Thank you. Have you tried this for yourself?  Yes, it is the brace my doctor gave me You cannot", "Brace I am 15 and started using my brace last July I only see a little difference is that is normal Good for you I am sure it takes time I wish I started early I am 19 and have not even meet anyone yet due to COVID if you ever feel bad about it know your future self will thank you greatly I am in the same  boat as you. I had mine in july time but I have seen a major difference. But mine does not stay in for long. I am guessing mine is going to take ages because mine was really really bad.\n\nHow long do you keep it on for. Normally it should be for atleast 18 hours. And sleeping.\n\nAfter few months they told me to move my brace down to focus on the lower part of the protrusion. \n\nAlso make sure you do exercises if you was given them. They help the chest get flatter quickly.\n\nIf you started in July. From now when you take your brace off it should stay in for 8 hours.\n\nBut my chest looks much much better", "Brace I am 16 and I recently just got a brace from a doctor who specializes in chest deformities. I am supposed to wear it all day but the problem is that it is very itchy and noticeable. I am supposed to wear it on the skin which gets itchy after like 10 mins of wearing. Also when wearing it, it is very noticeable. My friends make fun of me (not seriously). If I wear the brace with even a sweatshirt on, it looks like I am packing a calculator or something on my chest. I kind of just want surgery to make my insecurities end. Should I just wear the brace? Has anyone gone through the treatment yet? From what I have read, surgery really sucks. If your doctor told you to wear it, then wear it. The brace will correct the deformity in a few months so you will not have to worry about the condition ever again. If you do surgery now, as you grow your bones will get bumpy. Also it sucks, they remove most of your cartilage which is obviously not good, good luck with training without cartilage. \n\nWatch the first half until tjey get to Pectus Excavatum, there is a part where they show all the removed cartilage Bumpy? I do not speak English as my mother language. You will get bumps on places where your cartilage was reconected to sternum becasue the cartilage will try to grow and it does not have space to do it anymore. It can resultt in bumps. That was hard to watch", "How bad is my pectus and how long would it take to fix with a brace.  Depends on how flexible it is, can you push it down easily?", "How do I tell the guy I am seeing I have PC? Hey guys, so I am a19 y/o girl and have pectus carinatum (one of the very few girls). I recently started going out with this guy. We really like each other and he keeps asking me out but I am hesitant because of my pc. I should tell him before we go he deserves to know but whenever I try to bring it up I get super anxious and nervous and the fear of him freaking out and never talking to me again is killing me. I just do not know how to bring it up without having a total panic attack. If anyone has advice on how to bring it up it would be greatly appreciated. If he is a good guy, he will understand. You really should not even have to tell him unless you really want to. 21 y/o F here and I have never had an issue with a guy judging my sternum. There is also a good chance he will never notice it, even if you two do get intimate (Some guys tend to be distracted by the boobs and get tunnel vision) I have a pretty bad rib that sticks out a ton, my boyfriend has given it a pet name :P he is never said anything negative about my body (as it should be). If you two get intimate, the last thing he notice is your PC. He will be too excited and focused on other parts of your body. \n\nAnd I feel like nobody really cares about PC but those who suffer from it. But I guess that is how it is with most things. Always bigger in your head than it is to others. I think it comes down to you. If you feel really bad not saying anything and would feel better getting it off your chest (pun intended) then perhaps you should do that. But like others have said I doubt it would be something he would notice or bring up if he is a reasonably mature individual. And if you feel ok with not saying anything then you should maybe go that route. I am a male, but have never had anyone bring it up as an issue. I think some have noticed and maybe made some curious looks once or twice but after about 2 seconds they do not care. If he likes you already this will not change that (and if it does he is not the right guy!) Yes, that is what I am a little scared about getting intimate which we are bound to do eventually. It is just so nerve-wracking thinking of telling. But you and your bf are so cute I hope this guy is like that with me. Hey, \n\nI have also PC and want to share my story with you. I do not hide it and I am always open to talk about it. I am 24y old, and things seems to be normal now at this age, considering that I was also anxious at your age, but feeling now stupid that I was.\n\nYou are doing a big mistake thinking about what will happen if you tell him, guess what, it does not matter, if he is not right guy, soon enough another thing will happen and break you guys apart, and you just wasted your time, so tell him right now, and do not care what he will say, think or do.\n\nJust about everything else applies this advice, its your life, get control of it and do not allow some stupid PC or anyone else tell you how you look or to feel. There is no enough time in this world to worry what others might say or think, even if there is time, would be pity wasting.\n\nTry to learn to not be bothered by PC while learning to be confident, and soon enough you will not care about PC. Confident in a way that NO ONE AND NOTHING can do something to get you out of your good rhythm. Of course, if there is a chance to fix it, it should be fixed, every problem should be fixed! Im a 26yo girl with pc. Its not too noticeable but asymmetrical. I think ive only mentioned it to 2 guys before being intimate. They definitely blew it off bc it didnt matter to them. I used to be alot more self conscious but theres nothing wrong with having pc so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  i think you should go out with him. You can tell him when you feel ready or before you are intimate, its up to you. I kind of just threw it out there like \"oh my chest is uneven, want to feel?\" Like others said, boobs will probably be too distracting anyways. Thank you so much! This is what I really needed to hear. Unfortunately, there is no way to fix mines because I have heart issues and using a brace may cause complications so I need to accept it and be confident. Talking to other girls who have PC and actual experience with guys helps a lot. So thank you so much for sharing Glad I could help and also glad that you are trying to accept advice.  \nIf your PC is not treat to your health, just ignore it.  \n\n\nBut it could be treat to your mental health, so be aware of that, mental health is developing slowly while being hard to notice, but eventually will come and it will be a real problem then.\n\nI was at multiple doctors asking if brace can cause any complications to heart, they (most of them) said, organs will adapt to anything if you give them time, so taking brace slowly, will most likely prevent any complications. But that is **my case** and I do not have any heart issues, do not try anything at your own.\n\nFocus on your goals, try to achieve something big, considering how things develop nowadays, in 5-10 years they might find a much better and efficient way to fix PC.", "Anyone one here that has pc and still lives a normal life? Like do you have a girlfriend or how do you manage with pc in public? Of course, my friend. Do not let it destroy your life. It did make things much tougher though. As a teenager I spent 2 years working physical jobs to get the money to travel in the country where I could get a brace. Even that would not be enough if my country did not give me money for having good grades in high school. But, once I got the brace I was very proud of myself, I realised how I really worked hard and it made me happy in the end. I had periods where I felt dead and soulless. But since then I changed, I work everything I can to become better and stronger, I am not letting myself fall down there again.\n\nMy condition was not the worst one, but it was definatelly not the smallest PC. It was somewhere in the middle, still very noticeable. On top of that I have Scheurmann's kyphosis. I looked so bad, but believe me, gym is a life changer. I could not believe that I suddenly became \"normal\" and things could only get better. My personality has also changed completely, I became a strong confident guy, before I was hidding, at one point even suicidal... I do not have a girlfriend, but PC is not stopping me from having one, I just did not find one.\n\nLive your life with no regrets, do only the best for yourself, it will be hard, but it will also be satisfying.\n\n\nP.

I am 16 turn 17 pretty soon. People have told me it is not noticeable, I guess it is just in my mind then. It may just be my posture because I tend to slouch when I wear t-shirts to stop my chest sticking out. Yeah I did not think it was anything major. Do you think working out and gaining muscle would benefit me? I would definatelly work on posture. I do not even know if you have PC, posture can make ribs stick out.

Thanks for the reply :) it is encouraging", "25yo male considering PC surgery Hello, I am a 25 year old male with moderate, asymmetric Pectus Carinatum (protrusion on the right side) and am considering surgery as an option for correction. I thought I would write my thoughts out here to hopefully get any advice from others out there as well as generally add another data point to this body of discussion. \n\nI have had PC since I was about 11 or 12 years old and it has affected me mentally for as long as I can remember. Usual things like not wanting to take my shirt off, go to the beach, swim, etc. Fortunately I never had anybody bully me or really even point it out to me, but it has definitely been something that bothers me personally and I am getting to the point where I really do not want to live with it anymore.\n\nI tried bracing a few years back, when I was about 21 or 22 years old, and while my bones were still relatively pliable, the brace just did not work with my lifestyle - I was / still am working a 9-5+ job in a professional environment and the brace was just unsightly and uncomfortable. It also wrecked part of my skin on my back and I still have scars due to that. So I ended up doing the brace for about 6 months and then basically threw it out with little to no noticeable improvement in my PC.\n\nFast forward a few years and I have started going to the gym / working out more regularly, and while I have made some progress there, the PC still bothers me on a daily, constant basis. I am now considering surgical repair as an option but am obviously wary and scared about the idea as it is a very serious procedure. Earlier this year I actually moved to Japan (am originally from the US) and visited a Japanese thoracic surgeon a few weeks ago for consultation. He said he could improve my PC but that it would not be 100% fixed mainly because it is asymmetric. Also fortunately because I have Japanese insurance the cost is pretty affordable. \n\nHowever the method of surgery he uses is apparently not the Ravitch procedure, and it is not the reverse Nuss either - it is a one-time operation where he cuts part of the excess cartilage off and reattaches that to the sternum via sutures (no metal bars or foreign bodies inserted). Apparently this is the same method he uses for pectus excavatum (and btw he has done \\~300 surgeries over past 20 years or so, but only \\~20 for PC). \n\nIs anyone familiar with this type of surgical method for PC? Or if there are any others lurking out there who have undergone surgery or are thinking about it, please do share your thoughts and experiences. Would love to gather as much information as possible.\n\nHere is the link of the guy who I saw in Japan with a description of his method (although primarily talks about PE not PC):  ( \n\nThanks! Glad you are doing your research. Here are my comments on your post...\n\n1) I also have asymmetric PC. I also tried the brace at age 19 and could not do it. I also have scars to show for it haha. \n\n2) You are correct - this is a serious procedure so do not go to a bullshit surgeon. Your surgeon raises a lot of red flags in my eyes. First, you said he does not do the nuss procedure for Pectus Excavatum and instead goes with this technique he created. That is stupid because the nuss procedure is by far the best way to fix regular PE and it is not even debatable. Second, you said he has only done 300 PE surgeries over 20 years - that is peanuts compared to an experienced surgeon. And only 20 for PC? And you have asymmetric PC, the hardest version of PC?? You can see that this does not look good. Third, I looked at the pictures for his PE results and they are not even that good. He is showing patients with the easiest form of chest deformities to fix (regular symmetric PE) and it is not even close to perfect. I can still see a dent on all of them. If these are the cases he chooses to show, imagine the ones he does not show. \n\nI had the Ravitch for PC with no internal bars and it did not turn out that well. I would advise you to try the brace again if your PC is mild and if that does not work, find an experienced reverse nuss surgeon (there is a great one in South Korea). The Ravitch in experienced hands is not the worse idea, but I would advise you that you are rolling the dice with it. Sometimes it will work perfectly, sometimes it turns out just OK, and sometimes it completely backfires and causes more issues. In my opinion, asymmetric PC does not turn out that well with the Ravitch. Wow, first of all thank you so much for your thorough and honest reply.\n\nThat is rather interesting that the surgeon I saw raises flags for you - you are indeed right that if I were to get any surgical operation done I should definitely go to the best one I can find, and to be frank this guy has relatively limited experience as you said and his techniques may be questionable. It seems the next best step would be to continue doing research and potentially seek out other surgeons to consult. \n\nWould you mind mentioning the name of the surgeon you were referring to in South Korea who has experience with the reverse nuss? Also what are your thoughts on the associated potential complications with the reverse nuss? I have heard it is not uncommon for the bar to move in patients or for wires to break, etc. That is something that would probably scare me. \n\nAlso after reading this I am indeed thinking it may be worth another go at the brace, although some of my original concerns still remain. I would need a really high quality brace to minimize skin issues and discomfort, and I would need to really psyche myself up to be fully compliant. Another major consideration is that I am 25 and i am not sure if my bones would be flexible enough, but I suppose it is at least worth seeing a Dr. to get a real opinion. Based on just using my own palm to push my chest in, it does indeed go in quite a bit, so maybe there is still hope? \n\nAlso on the brace just god damn it is so unsightly - I am trying to have a decent dating / social life and all and that would definitely cramp the shit out of that. I do not know if you or anyone else knows any solid bracing doctors (preferably in Asia)..\n\nAlso I sent you pics of my chest, let me know what you think. And my skin scar on my back does not really hurt but it feels /slightly looks like a spot of melted skin .... not great. How about yours? The name of the surgeon is Dr. Hyung Joo Park. Do a bit of research on him and check out his perfect results on YouTube - compare that to the surgeon you linked! I was scared from doing the Reverse Nuss because I was also worried about those bar complications and was just uneasy about having hardware in my body for 2 years. What if I fall playing basketball? What will I do about bar migration when my surgeon is across the world? They are valid fears but I did not quite understand that although the Ravitch is an easier procedure to go through (very easy recovery) and is relatively simple, its effects are PERMANENT. If something messes up, you might have pain for the rest of your life in addition to having to live with a possibly WORSE chest in an aesthetic sense.  There is a reason these surgeons moved from the Ravitch to Nuss for PE, and are now moving from Ravitch to Reverse Nuss for PC. I am fear-mongering a bit here because the Ravitch does work out a lot of the times but I want you to understand the gravity of the procedure. The complications from the Nuss are also scary but I would take solitude in the fact that the negative effects from anything that goes wrong with the bars will usually not be permanent. In addition, if the first Reverse Nuss fails, you can try it again or even go for the Ravitch. However, if your Ravitch fails, you might not be able to go for the Reverse Nuss. I emailed this South Korean surgeon about my chest but he said that my previous Ravitch has made my chest very complicated and it would take a second Ravitch + Reverse Nuss for him to fix and the results would be \"far from perfect\". \n\nIf you can push your chest down with your palm even a little bit, the brace will work. Your age does not matter - it is just a matter of will power. Try wearing it just when you sleep or are at home. As for brace doctors, I think most hospitals use the brace now so I would just ask around. \n\nI saw the picture of your chest and it looks nearly identical to mine, maybe a little bit better. I am curious if your experience matches mine: how much did this affect you growing up? Did you always care about it? Did your parents tell you it was nothing? Did anyone ever mention it? Do you think it molded your personality in some ways? \n\nA few more questions: Do you have scoliosis? Did you play videogames a lot? Bad posture when you were growing? \n\nAs for my scar, yeah, it hurts a bit but not too bad. Make sure you do not overdo the brace! haha. Okay interesting I will definitely check out Dr. Park. Also, seeing as you seem to have already had discussions with him, do you know how much the cost of the Reverse Nuss procedure is (with him at least)? And yes I literally think the same things about it - like what happens if I have a sudden bar movement and need immediate attention from someone who knows what they are doing and the doc is just too far away? I also believe I have read some horror stories about it - see the following article (although this is Nuss not reverse Nuss):  ( . Perhaps the complications in the above article are not as likely in reverse Nuss though due to the fact that the bar is above your sternum and not below, closer to heart and organs? No idea though. \n\nInteresting point about the permanency of the Ravitch - are you done with your procedures then you think? How do you feel about your chest?\n\nAnd yeah I agree with you 100 on the brace - its all about the flexibility of the chest, not your age at all. I am sick of all these docs and reports purporting that it is all about around age (although obviously flexibility is generally much better at a younger age, so it makes sense why they end up just saying that). I will start looking around the internet for something close to me. Do you know if the Park guy also does bracing?\n\nAs for my chest experience - happy to tell you all about it. It affected me quite a lot when I was younger, I just *really* subdued my feelings and did not talk about it (something I am still trying to work on generally). My parents noticed it but did not say much at all and I never really said much to them either to be honest. I think I complained a few times, and we went to see a doc once but he was a quack and did not know shit. So I basically lived all of middle school, high school, college, and my early work years through now with this thing and it has *definitely* shaped who I am / my identity. I am 100% sure it is so deep that I cannot even imagine what my daily mental thought process would be like without it - like I cannot even *imagine* it. I mean, I think about it at a certain level in almost every thought I have - whether I am watching a movie, glance at the guy's chest and see that it is flat, walk down the street and look at people's chests without even realizing I am doing so, all just adding data in my head confirming how rare my condition is and reaffirming my negative feelings toward my own chest.\n\nHonestly also a very small part of me has a bit of resentment towards my parents for not being more proactive about it when I was younger - for not asking me more about it, how I felt, looking into it on their own, etc. I only feel this way because I think of how I could have been done with bracing already by the end of middle school had some action been taken. But I know this is not a fair way to think.\n\nAnd I do not have scoliosis but my last bracing doc told me I have mild kyphosis, which I can see. Although adding muscle on my back has helped this I think. And I think I do generally have bad posture, where my shoulders hunch forward naturally now and I do not realize it. I even got this strap thing that is supposed to force your shoulders back and help fix your posture, and sadly even when I wear that and my chest sticks out forward as it is supposed to naturally, I actually *feel* uncomfortable and insecure, even though I am all by myself. Fucked up condition, right?\n\nSorry for the long post - this is actually somewhat therapeutic to write about so thanks for giving me the opportunity to share. How was your experience growing up? Did you ever have people point it out to you? How involved were your parents? It feels like I could have been the one writing this. Especially the part about resenting your parents because they did not do anything when you were younger.\n\nI also have asymmetric PC. I have had two reverse nuss operations and both made my chest look great, for about a month.\n\nFirst time wires broke and bar displaced.\n\nSecond time something similar happened, not sure if it was the wires or my ribs who let go though.\n\nMy PC is better than before but it is no where near perfect. Honestly I think a brace would have given me a better result.\n\nSurgery with Dr. Park is 30k USD. Thanks for replying man. \n\nWow you had two reverse nuss that both went bust basically? A few questions - when the wires snapped / bar displaced, was it really painful? Like that would be my main fear and seems really scary if the bar moves and fucks something up inside you. Do you mind me asking where you had the procedure done? Was it like an emergency when the wires snapped / bar displaced and you needed attention immediately?\n\nAlso, when you had the bar inside you how much did it inhibit your daily normal activities? Can you still exercise / lift? And one more thing - how long did the recovery from the reverse nuss procedure take you?\n\nDo you think you are done treating your chest? I still have some flexibility in my own chest so am thinking maybe giving the brace one more good go before opting for potential surgery. Do you think this is a good idea? \n\nAlso price wise damn 30k for a surgery I do not know if I can afford that.. No worries man.\n\nWell both surgeries went \"bust\" but atleast they both gave me some improvement. \n\nGot the surgery not so much because of looks but because my ribcage was really really stiff and it gave me troubles with breathing and mobility. Basically destroyed my left shoulder because of ribcage stiffness. \n\nFirst surgery was in Berlin with Dr. Schaarschmidt. Second was Dr. Park in Seoul. \n\nNo it was not very painful when wires snapped. It is not like it just pops off. It just migrates slowly over time. Did not need any emergency care, but my pectus came back both times. From being perfectly flat. \n\nYou can barely feel the bars if they stay in place. It is really really painful the first few weeks after surgery though. But after 2-3 weeks you feel ok, and after 2-3 months you are back to normal. \n\nI am not sure, I still have bars inside me so I will see when I take them out. I do not have alot of physical problems anymore though. I hope I can maybe get a brace to fix the last part.  \n\nYes I would for sure try the brace if I was in your shoes! I wish I did before I tried surgery, think I was 20 or 21 at that time. \n\nYeah 30k and then another 10k when they take the bars out. It is rough, but mine in total has been 70k :D. Wow, well yeah it is a good thing they did provide you improvement. \n\nJust curious, when the bar moves or the wires snap, do the docs fix it for you at no additional cost? Seeing as it was not your fault that it happened, probably theirs if anything...\n\nI wish you luck with the bars you have inside you. Is it normal for them to move so much? Like does this happen often, or is it rare? Is it more common than the normal Nuss procedure?\n\nYeah I will probably go for brace if anything then... just so damn worried it is going to wreck my social life in the meantime. I guess I just got to see long term if i do go with it... Some might do, some do not. \n\nI did not trust my first surgeon enough to even ask him to be honest. \n\nThank you, it was not very long since I put them inside so I have not discussed redoing it yet. It is not \"normal\" for them to move this much. But it happens. \n\nPC repair is usually harder than PE. The wires might snap or you get a ribfracture on the ribs where it is attached. There is been some research trying to fixate at more points with good results. But research still so new most surgeons have not changed their procedure. \n\nAlso some surgeons might use two bars instead of one in adults. But it is not widely used either. Probably because most surgeons work with children who is much more pliable.\n\nI think you will be fine. Remember it is not for such long time in the long run. If you do nothing you will have to live with PC all your life, which I would think is worse. Gotcha. \n\nAfter experiencing surgery under both surgeons, which one would you recommend? \n\nAlso do you mind me asking your age? Just curious. \n\nYeah you are right, I am thinking it over hard and just imaging what it would be like to potentially live life WITHOUT PC is already a ton of motivation. Would def be worth even a year of shit social life. I do not know honestly. You will have to make your own opinion about surgeons.\n\nI think Dr. Park have a more refined technique, especially for mixed deformities or asymmetrical PC.\n\nI am currently 23. Has first surgery at 20 or 21. Also do you have any ribflare? Then chose Dr.Park or Weling Wang because they have good methods to correct it. Gotcha man -\nAnd I do not think I have rib flare but I have like inverse? rib flare maybe. Like my right side protrudes and because it protrudes the right lower rib sticks inward almost like a little pectus excavatum down there. Idk if you can imagine what I am describing. \n\nAlso like dr park and his staff speak English fine? The pain would scare me the most tbh. And also I need to be out of work for like how long you think? 2 months? Like this picture under the nipples? (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah Dr.Park speak really good English and you will get a English speaking coordinator which will help you out with translations and if you have any questions. \n\nIt will depend on what you are line of work is. If it is heavy lifting maybe 2 months. If it is a desk job, 3-4 weeks tops. \n\nThe pain is immense but it will go over, and you get good pain medicine. Yes similar to the picture under the nipple. Do you think that would get fixed with reverse Nuss? \n\nAlso, curious when your bars snapped with Dr. Park, what was the procedure like afterwards? Did he fix you at no additional cost? If it cost extra how much was it? Also how many patients has he done the procedure on to your knowledge? Yes similar to the picture under the nipple. Do you think that would get fixed with reverse Nuss? \n\nAlso, curious when your bars snapped with Dr. Park, what was the procedure like afterwards? Did he fix you at no additional cost? If it cost extra how much was it? Also how many patients has he done the procedure on to your knowledge? Maybe, I have it too, with my lower ribs flaring out a lot.   \n\n\nDr.Park managed to fix it for me at first, but it came within 1 month (prob due to bar movement). \n\nHonestly do not know yet. I am back in my country and waiting to get an x-ray before I contact him. \n\nI do not know the exact number but he is one of the more experienced surgeons for sure. A few hundred at least. Do not know kid / adult ratio though. Thanks for your responses. Another few questions:\n\nIs age / chest flexibility a restriction when it comes to reverse Nuss? I am 25 but feel i still have some flexibility.\n\nDo you know if Dr Park accepts insurance for the procedure? I have Japanese insurance so I do not even know if it would be possible to get some covered. \n\nIf I wanted to get a consultation from him, how much is just the consultation and what does he do in that meeting? Also do you happen to have his email or contact handy - I am curious about reaching out to him.\n\nI emailed a pectus bracer in Hong Kong and they basically discouraged me from trying their program b/c they do not think the brace would work on me cause im \"skeletally mature\" even though I told them multiple times I still have some flexibility. They then recommended I speak with Pectus Joe in the US, which I am planning on doing over Skype, BUT even if he is an option, it is just logistically hard to do a bracing program with a provider in the US while I am all the way on the other side of the country....\n\nReally want to fix this pectus though god damn. Flexibility can be, age should not matter as long as your chest wall is not to rigid. I know they do surgery on people in the 50's. \n\nHe should do, but I believe it is up to your insurance.  I mean, after all Dr.Park (or his hospital) get the money anyway, just either from you or your insurance company. I would talk to your insurance company about this.\n\nI do not know the exact number on top of my head right now. But it is not very expensive. First time I met him I got x-ray done and consultation and I think it was about 100 USD. To get in touch with him you have to go through the international unit at his hospital. Contact e-mail is  Just write your story and they will come back to you, probably asking for some photos (if you did not include it right away).\n\nHe will talk to you, let you ask questions and you will show him your chest etc. Then he might want you to take x-rays. The normal thing.\n\nYes I know all about the nuisances having your caretaker on the other side of the planet, lol. But if I understand it correctly is not making a brace a \"one off\" thing? \n\nLike you go there, they measure etc and then manufacture the brace. Then you can tighten it yourself over time? \n\nDo you mean this one ? (\n\nIf yes, then no. The technique used on me is this one. (\n\n The sandwich 2 technique + magic string. \n\nI can say for sure the \"magic string\" broke so my rib flare came back. Other than that I am not sure what happened to the bars itself other than that my PC came back also. You might want to contact Dr. Wenlin Wang also. \n\nHe is a Chinese surgeon and seems to be quite good. Apparently he uses 2 bars as standard to distribute the force on the ribs. \n\nHis email is:  \"  \".\n\nI never had any contact with him though, so I do not even know if he takes on international patients. Gotcha. Thanks again for your thorough response.\n\nI will ask my insurance company about this matter yes. \n\nAnd thanks for the email information - I think I will email Dr. Park about a consultation and maybe just see what he can offer me.  Another question: Do you ever had issues going through airports with a bar in your chest? Also, you said you have yet to see Dr. Park after your bars moved, right? So you are just living your life right now with displaced bars in your chest or what? Have you talked to him at all since this happened? I am really curious what the next steps will be for you and how Dr. Park responds given that he purports to have one of the highest success rates with his surgery in the world.\n\nAs for the brace, yes I think fundamentally it is a one-time thing, but there are check-ups that you are supposed to go to every few months. Also, I think you need to go to the center first to get checked up on, then you have to come back in a few weeks to get your brace and get it fitted and all. And for me that would just be logistically difficult to do, but I could probably figure it out.. Honestly doing the reverse Nuss sounds much simpler and quicker acting... but it is also still a surgery and has its risks and is much more costly... idk\n\nThe next fixation technique I was talking about is talked about in the link below at the bottom of the page. Idk if that is the same as the one in your article you linked.\n\n ( \n\nAlso, what is a flare buster? And another question - do you think the risks of damaging internal organs and such are lower with reverse Nuss vs. normal Nuss because the bar is over your ribs as opposed to under it? What about with Sandwhich procedure, as that does have a bar below your ribs too?\n\nWill look into the Chinese doc too, thanks That sounds like a good start! Best of luck. I will try to answer your questions. Always glad if I can help someone else with same problem as I know how tolling it can be on body and mind...\n\nNot really issues. When I had only one bar it did not even react on scanners (and I had a paper). But with 3 bars in after my last surgery I get detected all the time. Usually only show them the scars and tell them I have metal in my body and it will be fine. Once they made me go through this x-ray machine and after it was fine to pass. Took me a minute tops. \n\nYeah pretty much. There is not really any problems since the bar is just under the skin. Only \"problem\" I have is that you can see / feel the bar a lot. It usually does not move like a crazy amount either. Just a few centimeter or so and your chest pushes the bar \"out\" or to your front. Might be a little uncomfortable at times, but not much more. \n\nHave not talked to him yet. I am thinking I will wait for x-rays first, but my country is not the fastest when it comes to that things. \n\nI have read somewhere they can make the brace in like a week. It is not really a very complex thing to make after all. I might be wrong though. But I agree it might be little more work. \n\nBut on the other hand surgery is like 10-15x the cost. And with a brace you have the possibility to change \"how you correct\" over time. If that makes sense. Do not know how to phrase it. But with surgery you are in your surgeons hands. If he does not do a good job the first time, it might be hard to \"correct\" it. If you know what I mean. \n\nIf the brace slide, you can re-mount it. If your bars move, not so easy :( . \n\nYeah I believe I have the fixation technique they are talking about. It is a \"bar\" that connect the other bars on the sides. Basically it makes it much harder for the bars to rotate. My bars lost \"tension\" in the other axis or how to explain it. Not sure if it makes sense. I think the fixation would benefit a normal Nuss more, because bar rotation is a major issue there. In reverse Nuss, the biggest problem is applying enough force and fixate it to the ribs without damage to wires or ribs. \n\nFlare buster is where he put some strong strings to push down on your lower costal arch (where your ribs flare). If you do not have ribflare, then you will not need this procedure. \n\nYes reverse Nuss is much more \"safe\" since the bar is just under your skin. Although even with a normal Nuss, the safety is very very good. If the surgeon know the procedure well, there should be close to 0% chance of any damage. \n\nDo you have any pictures or anything how your chest looks? Just a little bit curious. I can share x-rays, pics and stuff too if you are interested. Did you have any CT, MRI or x-ray done? Yo man thanks again for your thorough reply.\n\nI sent you some pics of my chest - let me know what you think of them and please send me what you have as well. Would be very curious to see your chest condition, especially before surgery and after during the different phases if you have that.\n\nI reached out to Dr. Park via email and sent him pictures and he said (via his nurse Ms Choi) that my chest is \"not the severe case that the surgery is required\".... I was pretty disheartened to get that response. Like first of all who the F are you to decide the severity of my case if it is largely psychological - hair surgeons do not turn down patients with 98% full head of hair who want 2% extra hair. I understand it is a much more serious procedure, but I still have a deformity for god's sake and want to fix it badly. \n\nAm I correct in thinking that even if my chest condition is not severe, reverse nuss procedure should still be effective? Would appreciate if you looked at my pics and gave me your opinion as well.\n\nThat said, I emailed her back and also tried calling and then she finally replied and said she would be able to set up a consultation with Dr. Park this month. So I guess at least I can see him in person and get a real assessment. I am also going to talk with Pectus Joe for his famed T-Brace program over Skype next week to see what the deal is with that. Hoping that one of these paths turns out to be the right one for me...\n\nGlad there are at least others out there in the universe who dealing with the same thing and care to share / be a part of this community. I really wish every person suffering from this / who has real life experience with PC would be on this damn forum. Every data point is so helpful. I answered your PM. Sorry for late answer. \n\nLooked at your pictures and also sent some of mine. Looks like you have PC and it is somewhere between mild and moderate (much like mine). Also some rib flaring. If you get some x-rays done it would be interesting too see what your haller-index is at.  \n\n\nIt should still be effective with a good surgeon and using the right method. I think it is crucial in cases like ours to use a shorter bar to get a lot off pressure on the sternum. I think my first surgeon used a 12 inch bar and Dr. Park 14 or 16 inch bars.   \n\n\nThe literature states shorter bar = better sternal pressure and less likely to have bar movement. \n\nGood luck on your consultation with Dr. Park and Pectus Joe. Keep us updated! \n\nI am still waiting for the referall to be able to get an x-ray done here. Public healthcare - zzzzzz.  \n\n\nI also had some contact with the Chinese Dr. Wenlin Wang. The price for surgery sure was cheaper and he was happy to setup a consultation for free if I was interested. Here is a video I found about some of his surgeries.   \n\n\n(", "I have a weird form of P.C. I have pectus carinatum but it does not look like any of the pictures of PC that I have seen on the internet. My protruding bone is more rounded and to either side of it, just below my pecs, it is noticeablely caved in. But the lower half of my torso is normal. I am 5'10 (178cm), 13 years old and I have very muscular pectorals for my age, as I have already been working out for three years and so far, building up my pecs is the only way I have been combating my PC. Please could somebody offer some info on my weird type of PC or even give me some excercise to make my odd chest less noticeable thank you. Please somebody offer some advice, because this seriously effects my self esteem Do not worry about it. There is unfortunately only three options you can take. \n\n1. Get surgery: this could be very painful, expensive and they might not even let you get it because you are 13.\n\n2. Get a brace: less painful and expensive but takes time. If you want to get a brace you will have to do it before the bones harden when puberty is over.\n\n3. Workout: not the best results. But after enough time and effort you can hide the affected area and get ripped too.\n\nDo not worry what anyone thinks about you. The best thing to do is just ignore them and not take any bullying to heart. Self-esteem and how other people see you has nothing to do with how you look. \nIf you act like it is not there and you stand up straight. \nBe confident or act like you are and it will work out Thank you Pzychic, I will try. I appreciate the support! You might have a combination of PC and PE. The thing is you are lucky you have caught it early, PC can be corrected with a brace right now! Do not delay. There is also surgery with the reverse nuss if its severe  Thank you lesbehonest29 but I have seen the doctor and they have eliminated any surgical options or a brace. So right now I am just looking for any workouts or exercises to make my condition less visible, but thank you nonetheless! No worries. How many doctors have you seen? Have you been to a pectus SPECIALIST? Not just your regular doctor, this is extremely rare and complicated. I was told nothing could be done when I was your age and it could have been fixed. Now it is too late and I just recently had the ravitch at the age of 30 and it was awful. It also was not a big success so probably have to go to Germany to the Helios Clinic in Berlin to have 2 bars put in reverse nuss. Going to cost a fortune! Do not take no for an answer, keep looking, do your research. All the best  I cannot really picture the issue you are having. But I can recommend exercises. Before I do that I will give you some background about myself and my case of PC. \n\nAround my early teens, I noticed my chest protruded outward. I did not notice anything really wrong until my brother brought it up to me. I did not think much of it until I heard the term \"bird chest\" somewhere. From there I did research and realized I had a slightly mild case of PC. Although it was mild, I was skinny and it was noticeable. I usually wore a lot of button ups, loose fitting shirts, laying up, etc. I was self conscious about it for all of the obvious reasons. \n\nAs I got older I started gaining weight. The more I gained, the more it was less noticeable. As time progressed, I gained too much weight so I decided to start exercising and working out. As I got into a routine, I wanted to build my chest. I suspected this would make it less noticeable and furthermore give me the self confidence I need. I did some research and found a lot of info about other guys who had PC and worked extensively with building their pecs. For a lot of them you really could not tell.\n\nThis really motivated me to really give me that extra push in the gym to build my pecs. For me personally, I found that cable flies helped me build my pecs very well. That is my favorite chest exercise. The chest takes a very long time to build up so you really have to stay dedicated and keep to a routine and figure out which type of exercises work best for you. Bench press is also a good exercise for your chest as well (narrow grip). You can find a ton of tutorials for chest exercises. \n\nI went on this sub just to do some research because I noticed one side of my pecs is more defined and pronounced than the other side. I think this may have to do with one side of my sternum being more protruding if that makes sense. \n\nI wish I could have started working out when I was younger. You are lucky because you get to have to early push into your fitness. My suggestion to you is not just to work on your chest, but work on your entire body. Arms, back, core, all of your upper body (and do not forget leg day). I used to be very self conscious about taking off my shirt, swimming, etc. I remember at one point close friends commented about how they have never seen me with a shirt off. Flash forward to the last few years, I have no problem with my shirt off at all. \n\nThere is a lot of debate whether you should start working out at a young age but if you ease into it now and make it a routine, that would only benefit your lifestyle, give you the confidence, and make you stronger. \n\nWow this ended up being a really long post. Wish you the best of luck. ", "A day without the brace I have been bracing for 2 months and I have seen some results.

The overnight use period is mainly for keeping it in place and the duration depends on how old you are. The younger you are the longer this duration is as your bones are still developing and your chest will go back to how it was if you dont continue wearing. i do not wear it to school and some 2 days a week i have work after school so i wear it 15 hours a day some days but can only wear it for about 9 some other days. but on the weekends it is the whole day so is that enough wear time day to day", "I found this group and it makes me feel good that there is a place I can share what I feel.

I am 13 and I learned to love it and I take it as something special now I hope others think like that. Hey when I was 13, Reddit had barely been around, and there was no place with extensive information to learn about this. I am amazed by your ability to turn this condition into something positive. When I was 13, it took over my life and brought out me being super self-conscious which has affected me to this day.\n\nJust know that one day it may partially affect your athletic performance, breathing/ashtma, or potentially cause scoliosis. So even if you want to get it 'fixed' it would not have to be necessarily superficial. There are people here and resources that should be able to help inform you about braces and how they work. Always an option, but just know that the younger you get one, the less painful and more effective it will be. Maybe now you are not embarrassed, but potentially when you are 16 and trying to date you will be - who knows. If you truly are able to put it past you and embrace it, more power to you and I think you are a good person! I find it so difficult to go to beaches and pools Thanks, I did not know it could affect breathing my brothers never complained about something like that I do not ask the doctor too much about it because my brother went and he has a \"big one \" the doctor said that it wont be a problem for him with breathing but I did notice he bearly passed the running task in school graduation even though he is thin and does workout.

I feel like my bar has been moving around and i felt it pop against my sternum just wondering how much of this is normal thanks! Did not think you had bar in for the ravitch procedure ? I assume you are talking about the sternal plate(s). It is normal for them to pop and click when you breathe or move around. In terms of moving around, I would not think they should feel like they are shifting, but they are very flexible and do flex with your ribs. Its been more then 2 years now, the bar is still inside my chest. The worst part was getting off the meds, honestly that was a rough part of my life. Pain was unbearable but only in small intervals and \"pain strokes\". Going to the doctors was pointless at that point so I just had to tough it out. I think it took 8 months for the pain to go away completly. \n\nAnyhow, today it feels fine and next summer they will most likely remove the bar. The results are good but not perfect, I dont think it will ever look normal until I start working out or im like 25. Wich is fine with me honestly it does not bother me that much anymore. Im turning 18 next week.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions at all or if you would like to see pictures of the results, I do not mind.

Hi I am not experienced on this, I got my brace at the age of 18. But, I did ask my doctor for potential deformities on my future kids. He said that bracing sometimes need to be done twice if you start very early. But, you should not be that case as you are 14. There are tons of 14 year olds who pulled through with no problems. Stick to it, it is worth it, if it does not work, find a job at 15/16, and go for another brace in some other country. But, I think you should not worry, just wear it as much as you can and everything should be fine. Good luck! My 14 year old just got his brace. We live in the USA and went to a top doctor and place for his brace. The hope is that wearing the brace while he is still growing will help correct his pectus carinatum on more naturally instead of waiting until he is older.

I do not have big hips or anything, it is just my rib cage is much narrower than normal. Could this be caused by PC? I feel like my whole ribcage sticks out more than it should, not just my sternum. Also, will a brace make my chest any broader? Yes it is connected, yes the brace will make it better. I have got the same issue, definitely think it is caused by PC. As the other commentor said apparently bracing will help with that. I am probably a little too old for bracing so hoping surgery can achieve the same result. Good luck! I had a very narrow rib cage but as I grew it started to widen quite a bit and even wider that my hips. That could be my body compensating and trying to make room for my organs or just my genetics.

Ofc its going to take even more months to stay in for lots of hours without protruding but seeing that difference and it is harder to see the chest sticking out really is better. \n\nI only really wore it for 12 - 32 hours. It all depended on the mood I was in.now I am really pushing to get it slightly better but not to the point where it sinks in causing pectus exacactum.

Do as many pushups as you can do in a day, then add 10 to that every week until you are doing 200 pushups per day.  It will happen faster than you think.  If you have access to a pull-up bar, or want to make one ($20 worth of pipe and plumbing fittings from  home depot), pull-ups will build your core including lats, obliques, abs, and delts as well as your arms. \n\nKeep in mind that is not just chest muscle that will help your aesthetic.

Most people in gyms are fine, the typical assholes are roiders, but who cares about them. I was so insecure about it as well that I even thought of taking my own life.

Words cannot describe how much relief I feel of how much pain I went though to take my shirt of in front of friends or people, or go swimming. I am set free The pectus experience: feeling devastated and insecure about it, but having people tell you they do not notice or do not think it is a big deal.\n\nI guess what I would say is - if you want to care less about it, try and remind yourself that you are the only person who cares about it as much as you, most other people most likely just see you for who you are and not for some cosmetic imperfection. I get it sucks trying to find the right shaped clothes, swimming, and it kind of makes for awkward cuddles, but ultimately it is just a cosmetic issue for most of us. Body positivity is not easy but if you are healthy otherwise, be grateful for that? (not trying to sound dismissive I totally relate) Let us try to keep it simple:\n\n1.

I want to fix both but I dislike my posture more.                \nBtw I am 15 It does not look very severe, I would say it is in fact relatively mild. Given that you are 15, and that you have a moderate case of what does appear to be PC, I think you would have great results with bracing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBraces typically work best when they are on almost always, except when showering or what not. Also fifteen,do not have a brace but do know it is needed to be worn as much as possible. It does not seem too serious I would give it a 4/4.5 out of ten, ten being the worse. The posture seems more of an issue, I often work on mine just because I do band, but I am just 15 so take what I said with that in mind an I maybe wrong. You have PC not extreme. I highly recommend the brace. Your posture would most likely improve too but you would need to do a lot of exercises and stretches over an extended period of time It is pretty mild but you have the standard \"PC posture\".\n\nGet a quality, custom brace and a good exercise program and you will have great results in both areas. It is almost impossible to have normal posture with PC.\n\nAlso the brace needs to be worn 24/7 for the first couple of months (can take of short periods) and after a while you can wear it less. Start doing pull-ups every other day. 3 or 4 sets to failure. You will build muscle, but it will work wonders for posture. Good posture does make the defect look much less noticeable. Do push-ups on the other days to balance out muscle development and to help cover the pectus specifically. But yeah like others have said, if you can get a brace, do it now, you are at the right age. Yours is quite similar to mine at your age, I did not have a brace and mine has gotten progressively worse so I would definitely recommend trying a brace. I am having to have surgery to correct mine due to not trying bracing as a kid. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d Say if you went a week without wearing it through the process would it completely reset progress? It depends. If you wear it for 1 week and then 1 week without it will reset the progress 99%.\n\nIf you wear it several months and then 1 week without it will maybe reset 10-20%. It will make your posture better in 2 ways. 1. You will be more confident so you will stand better, 2. The chest deformity itself is connected bad posture.

The anxiety and stress using a brace is still there. Sometimes I wish it would go so I tighten it way to tight. I dont recommend and it made me nearly sick. It is all because I want my chest to be normal and it isnt fair man. I am still fighting through it and I am determined to finish the bracing.\n\nOn the good side, my chest has seen an incredible difference. Taking it off it stays in. And when it does pop out eventually. It is no where near the side it was. The chest is getting flatter \n\nI will admit on times I have only worn for 7 hours a day. Ik I should not but sometimes I just cba. Since I struggle sometimes. But I mostly wear it until I get up the next morning. My back is sore with the skin damaged. I do have extra brace padding. So I am going to keep an eye on the skin and if it gets bad. I will probably go easy or give it a break.\n\nFor people who are starting bracing. My advice is dont give up. It will be challenging but it is worth it. About the damaged skin on the back, is it on the middle where the spine is? I had (and still kind of have) damaged skin there.  It was so painful, but I got through it. It is still dark, but once I got to a part where I can taked the brace of form more than 3 hours, my skin got better and is not bleeding anymore. One thing that helped me go through is that every time I had to put the brace on I would apply a cream on my back where the skin is damaged to reduce friction, I would put a very thing layer of medical cotton (or cottonwool, i do not know how you say it in english) over that, then a layer of sponge which in your case would be that extra padding that I do not have.\n\nBtw, which brace do you have? Keep going man! And keep the updates coming. Yeah diddo which brace? Yes it is the spine part. It is like dark ish from the pressure. I have one from a private specialist called 'London Orthotics' Does the pain get better? I litteraly cant sleep with mine For the front of the brace yes I can baerly feel it. , the back part of the brace is still hurting sometimes.\n\nIt took me atleast 2 weeks to fully sleep with it. Is it a T-Joe by any chance? Nah. It is like this round one. Hard to explain. But like, he measured my chest and everything to get it perfect. The specialist is one of the first in UK to have introduced a chest brace years ago. And people are well pleased with his work. He even saw posture issues and stuff.\n\n\nThe brace is very similar to T joe. Just different design If you take it of for school but were it all day do you think it will affect it? Not really. Ideally for a faster process you should wear to school. But if you are not confident enough.", "did not know there was a reddit group for this, but i am happy about it as i said in the title, i did not know there was a reddit group for people with pectus carinatum, but i am glad i looked. i had the ravitch procedure done in 2019 (female) and idk i just love that there is a group for this :) i felt like i should add some details to my experience here, so i will - i was in a trial for my brace (basically just means they had a heat sensor in my brace so the data in how long i wore it each day was being sent to my doctor) and had it probably for around a year i honestly do not remember and it was not really helping me anymore. when the bones in my chest became less flexible i opted for surgery which was, honestly, an incredibly painful recovery. my doctor undersold it to me and told me i would be back to work in two weeks (i was not, i was back to work like two months later). specifically, for my surgery, they cut my chest plate in half and scraped the cartilage out of my chest. if anyone has any questions or concerns, i would be happy to answer any. :) Woah I hope my bracing works because yes that does sound painful!! Genuinely curious when you wake up from the surgery what is the pain like? Is it unbearable kind of pain or is it alright from anaesthetics? for me, the first thing i felt when i woke up was INTENSE nausea. so much so that i could not even feel the pain from my chest. to be fair, i also had a lung partially collapse during my surgery. my first memory of waking up i just kept saying how hungry i waa, but i was really just nauseous. the drugs for the most part covered the pain until i got home. doctors tend to give minors less painkillers and i really felt the drugs wear off and the pain hit me hard the first two days. after that it was painful, but was less than those two days Woah, that sounds bad. I hope you are doing well. \n\nPlease stay in this group and  share your experiences.\n\n I once got into an argument with one 16 year old but cause he was too lazy to wesr a brace and said he is going for surgery. I tried to tell him why it was a bad idea to get a surgery when you can just try to use a brace first, but he just would not listen... There is also a discord! \n\n yes i think you should always try out the brace first even if it does not end up working it just avoids you having to take months recovering from it. although i am happy i did it, it was definitely rough haha. although, for me, by the time i was 16 my chest plate was not flexible anymore so i did not really have an option to keep going You tried, that is what matters. Vut brace should always be the first option.", "Pectus and Lung Capacity I have been poking around online and have not been able to find a very concrete explanation on the effect P.C. has on lung capacity and strength. Is it possible that it is increased due to the larger cavity the lungs have to expand into? Or the inverse causing the lungs to work even harder than they should be? If anyone has any supported insight on this it is of great interest to me as a trumpet player and vocalist with P.C.  Hi,\n\nWhen i was undergoing surgery for PC i asked the doctor about that and she said that the loung capacity isnt affected much when having PC. If it is, its minor.   \nI am not a doctor myself and do not study medicin, so take my word with caution ;-) I am actually not sure if there is ever been an official study on this topic since it is so rare. I can tell you that when I had severe pc so I took a pulmonary test and found that my lung capacity was reduced by about 30 percent. I doubt that it is that high for most people, but that is how it was in my situation. After I had corrective surgery my lung capacity was fully restored.", "(17) how bad and should I get a brace?  Just like mine! How is your posture? Your PC is very mild but you have some deformities in your cartilage below (the hollows under the chest muscles).\n\nBracing might help, or it might not. These kind of deformities are harder to correct. you are 17 yrs old? I think you should get a brace even if you just wear it at night. My son is almost 17 and he is been wearing back brace full time for the past 2 months and his back really improved.  Doctors might tell you that you are at a late stage of growth so might not recommend any treatment but boys have residual growth well into their 20 so yes I recommend you to get a brace.  My son's doctor was wise woman she prescribe back brace and physical therapy for him so it is been working out really good. Best of luck to you Actually 16 turning 17 soon Is it ok for me to do push-ups and other chest exercises? Yes!", "Is this PC?  It is like two points up top then goes to a v shape at the bottom Do not know, but if it is it will barely be noticeable, even with your shirt off. At least by the angle I need a side and a diagonal view to tell if it is. You should gain some weight and start working out harder if this bothers you. I would need to see some other angles, but I do not believe I would say you have PC.   \n\n\nYour xiphoid process is the part of the sternum with prominence at the bottom point, and the top two are the 7th rib articulation knobs. Yours are just a bit prominent. I have seen some people get an inferior sternoplasty and xiphoidectomy to alter the appearance, but that would really only be due to cosmetic reasons that I know of. I believe if you put on a slight bit of muscle it would be even less noticeable. I do not think many people would even notice this without being drawn attention to it, but I know it might be a cause of frustration and insecurity to you. In that regard, maybe some light chest exercise to build muscle? Mine looks the exact same, I was tired of the uncomfortable brace so I just put on muscle and you cannot see it!

I have P.C. on my left side and it pushes my entire left side out. I have been going gym and it has improved somewhat, but it is something I just want to get rid of while I can. I am 17, so obviously a brace should be an option, and I would rather get it done now over regretting not having it done later on when surgery is the only option.\n\nPhotos (opinions on PC?):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks! You could try it.  Alternatively, you have such a mild and pretty symmetrical case, a little time in the gym and nobody will ever notice.  Honestly, I am struggling to see it from the photos, but I know you see yourself differently than we do.  Good luck. Try it, do not have regrets. Pretty much everyone is satisfied with the brace treatment. The thing I am thinking is that, although it is mild, is it worth paying and using $1,000+ of my parents money on this? I would feel horrible for doing it. Do not underestimate mental issues that this can cause you. Toothbraces can also cost 1000+ and people do it all the time and it is a much smaller problem than a deformed chest. Also teeth can be replaced this cannot... You are almost adult, there is an alternative that you borrow the money from your parents and find a summer job to pay back. Just do not let you chance go away. And believe me, parents are people who will love you the most and want the best for you. You need to tell them how you feel, they will understand. You know what amount of shit teenagers buy with parents money, stupid IPhones, PS4's, expensive clothes... This is definately worth it. Thank you heaps, yeah I just do not enjoy asking for money really, I try to avoid it, but I might as well get this done as I have 6 week holidays come up soon.

I think that shit woulda helped me a lot when I was just finding out so yeah bro. If you do this make sure someone who does not know the words Pectus Carinatum can still find it. If they are looking for basic stuff make sure you include more basic search terms (\u201casymmetrical ribcage\u201d, \u201cuneven lower ribs\u201d, \u201cprotruding sternum\u201d, etc.). Otherwise the people who need to find it probably still will not be able to. I think its a good idea Yeah, appreciate the feedback. That is useful. Yea do it Yes do it! You should make about how to fix pectus carinatum without surgery or brace . Like which stretch and which exersice is good? I would not use the word \"fix\". I would use hide.\n\nGot To remember with excersises they do not fix it. If that was the case baerly anyone would get a brace.\n\nIf you say get bigger chest muscles. It will hide it. But the moment you stop building or have weight loss. It will show You can still fix it by stretching because you always Get new skeleton in your body Stretching only fixes it with brace. Once the skeleton matures and you stop growing. The chest will ofc stop getting bigger. But will always be there.\n\nMy specialist doc told me This guys is completely hidden. Motivated me years ago when I saw that to get into lifting.

I was reading online and found a few people that report to have both conditions. I have PC and am supposed to wear a chest compression brace, which happens to be right where my lower esophageal sphincter is. \n\nMy GERD is really bad, I have been super depressed because of it for about a year. I was recently told I have Distal Esophageal Spasms, and I am now on Gabapentin to ease it.\n\nI used to eat like shit, eat before bed, and smoke weed multiple times a day. My worst symptom has to be a gross mucus-y globus sensation present in the back of my throat 24/7. No amount of throat clearing will get it out, but when I cough from my chest sometimes there is brown speckled phlegm (I am assuming it is dried blood). \n\nI am so desperate for answers. Any help would be amazing! Hey bro I have both GERD and PC. I also have bad eating habits (feast before bed etc) and smoke weed heavily.\n\nI know exactly how you feel man. As for the stuff your coughing up, it is most likely tar from the weed (not blood). A quick google/Reddit search should confirm this for you if your symptoms are in line (speckly mucus), it was a surprise to me but I was the same.\n\nHaving these issues it is difficult to discern what causes what. For me personally, my weed habit causes GERD directly (smoke irritates stomach), and indirectly (I binge eat more when high). Further, when suffering GERD I get anxiety episode/very mild depression. But I would absolutely not say I am depressed and these symptoms are manageable (I just cool my diet/fast/lay off the weed). It is a cycle though that I am trying to break.\n\nAs far as pectus carinatum comes in, mine if quite bad but I have never once attributed it to my gerd/mucus. Obviously everyone is different but for myself I feel my PC is pure \u201ccosmetic\u201d and does not cause any major physical ailments. \n\nThe only bad thing from my PC is my sternum feels like pressure builds in it often and I have to crack it all the time (by pressing on it with fingers/hand). It is like cracking your knuckle and can feel a release of pressure (air?). Not sure if you are familiar.\n\nAnyway, hope you are feeling better and I would be happy to chat further if you want.

Not more than a few seconds at a time  It is normal. I have it and I have spoken to a friend with PC who also experienced. I have read in plenty of online forums that it is common for people with  it. Would not sweat it. I did all the time prior to surgery. I still have it every one in a while but not near as often. Maybe once or twice a month now compared to a few times a week. Yes, thank god im not alone on this one. Ive been getting it for so long and I always overthought it and believed I had something more serious\n I do yea.  I always thought it was cardiac, I have a history of drug use and smoking.

I went from being able to wear it 2-3 hrs a day to now pretty much all day (10+hrs/day). However, no matter how I try it, I cannot possibly fall asleep because the back side of the brace is very uncomfortably pressing on my back. Any of you guys have some tips ?", "bulking for Pectus Carinatum. Hi all. I have pretty bad P.C. I am 28 years old. I am open to getting the brace, surgery or taking the bulking route. However, I have not decided which to choose.. \n\nCould you please provide the pros/cons of your choice and why you went that route? \n\nThanks.\n\n( It is a little late in the game for the bracing route, as your bones are pretty set in their ways at that age. But I believe you could cover that up with bulking easily. Check my last post if you want to see some reasonable results to expect. The brace is the best option, but you are 28 so you do not have much chance of it working. It does not depend on age, but as you get older your chest gets less flexible which lowers the chamce of brace working.\n\nBulking will not fix you chest, it will just hide it, but it can give great results. Make sure to do you research on working out. I suggest ypu to train your whole body, not just your chest. You can focus on your chest more, but do not skip other parts of the body. \n\nSurgery will fix your problem, but it is a 3-6 months recovery and obviously every surgery carries a risk. In my opinion it is a very agressive surgery. I mever suggest doing this, but in the end it is your decision. I was thinking that I was probably late to the party for the brace, although I did not want to admit it! I might as well face the fact though!\n\nAh you, even to hid it would be good enough! I do not really have any chest pains or shortness of breath. So bulking would make sense. Plus it is something I wanted to take up anyway!\n\nWhat would be the risk?\n\nThanks for your advice! It is very much appreciated.. I thought so! I have just seen your last two posts. That is serious progress! Well done! I would be very interested in doing the same! The only problem is that I have no idea where to even start! As I said below, bulking is something that I always wanted to take up! Thanks for your advice, it is very much appreciated!! Look, I cannot gurantee anything. The brace can work, but it is rare that someone with 25+ even tries it.\n\nEvery surgery carries a risk, that is what I meant. Nothing specific, but you probably already know that you should avoid surgeries. If you are satisfied with bulking for example, do not get a surgery. If you are not satisfied, then get a surgery. I hear you! That makes sense! \n\nAh, I see what you mean! I could do that. I could try bulking first and go from there that is a great idea! It looks to have worked very well for the member above though!! \n\nThanks very much!! All this advice from you both is very helpful! Try gain muscles If you have any friends that lift, that is honestly the best way to get into it and stay with it. If you do not, I really would recommend seeking the advise of a trainer or a coach just to get you started. It is much better to learn how to do things correctly straight away, before picking up bad habits and being counterproductive with your effort. The basics are you want to lift heavy on pretty much everything. You want as much weight as you can do that will gas you out in the 6-8 rep range. If you can do more reps than that, add more weight. There are numerous bulking programs online, and to start, absolutely any of them are going to work, because everyone gains easily their first few months in the gym. Eat a gram of protein for every pound of body weight per day. Whole milk is one of the easiest things to add throughout the day for both calories and protein. Lots of peanut butter, oatmeal, and chicken are the best staples to add. Do your ribs come out all the way around on your left side or is it just the middle and the ribs are even with your right side? Btw mines simular to this except im build a little different, i can say i had low fat and prwtty muscular when i was younger, it wasnt as noticable, i gained about 50 or so pounds a few years ago and lost some muscle mass, it seems to be more noticable now, im 33 btw Do not dirty bulk, you will just have another insecurity to worry about. If anything lose weight, eat right and weight lift I cannot add another photo, but it is worse on the left side and protrudes out more. Thanks very much for your input and opinion, I find it most beneficial. I think bulking is the right way to go for me personally. I was going to clean bulk. I am a total; novice with gyms and bulking. To gain muscle mass do not you eat right? I assumed losing weight was achieved by eating fewer calories? So would not that disrupt me putting on muscle? Apologies if I took you up wrong. Thanks for your advice nonetheless.. I think this is the way to go! Thank you! Or maybe surgery that is maybe the only solution Surgery would be the ideal permanent solution. Although, I think Pectus Carinatum is a good motivator to join a gym and learn to bulk. I have a similar PC build as you but just a slightly skinnier body. Similar age too. Brace is probably out of the question for either of us. I did not learn about it until I was 18 and my doctor made it sound like it would not be as effective and having PC was not a big deal (easy for him to say when it is just viewed as a small \u201cpsychological\u201d issue at best). Seeing others here say you could probably wear a brace into your early 20s kind of sucks because I would have considered it more seriously, but oh well. I do not think your PC is that bad so building muscle would be the best option. Surgery can end up being time consuming due to recovery and expensive if your insurance does not cover it. It will also leave a scar, unless they have changed techniques since I last looked into it. I was going to the gym but the pandemic hit so I stopped. I think it is good to exercise anyway and even with a little bit of muscle mass it should help. Thanks for your opinion! What you say is relatable, I was diagnosed when I was 17 and the doctor told me it was not serious enough to do anything about it! So I forgot about it for a while until my mid 20's. I would totally have got a brace back when I was diagnosed, although the brace was not told to me as an option! Just surgery. Which I try to avoid if I can.. Please I do not have health insurance.. Are you going back to the gym once it reopens though? I think I will take the gym route to hide it. I am just busy apply for a new job at the moment though! By the way, I meant to say your \u201cPC is not that bad\u201d, not \u201cis that bad\u201d. I realized my mistake when I reread my earlier comment.\n\nYes, I am planning on going back to the gym. Everything has been open again where I am at so that is not an issue. I have just been lazy and I have to go out of town next month so I would not be able to exercise much. \n\nBefore the pandemic, I was doing a basic weightlifting routine plus trying to get strong enough to do a single pull up. Someone on this sub posted about their weightlifting results and mentioned how pull ups helped a lot with their back issues, which I also deal with. \n\nI think you would benefit a lot with some muscle. I am assuming you look similar on the other side of your body. You probably will not even notice your PC if you got a muscular chest and built up abs. Your back will also probably look straighter with some muscle there. Ah that is okay.  Do not worry, I knew that is what you meant! and that it was genuine!\n\nGood stuff! I guess getting started again would be the most difficult part. Once you get back to it will be all good though! \n\nGood stuff, keep it up! :) I think I have actually seen that post. Muscle appears to be a great method of hiding P.C.\n\nIt is defiantly something that I am looking into. I have not started yet though. The left side is at a steeper slope than the right, which is pretty odd.  Bulking really have so many benefits.", "Does a brace help a gap between your pecs at all?

However, if one breast looks bigger than the other. This might indicate that the chest is out more on that side. For instance, the left side is further out than the right. If you still feel worried maybe go to a doctor to get a professional opinion. There is not anything to be scared about. Sometimes Pectus Caeinatum is a system of Marfans syndrome. But not always.. OP promotes her only fans using this account. Do not think she is worried about that. Wow if it is really that... damn... that is a new kind of low Cannot even tell! i think it might be a minor pectus deformity, but the breast hide it well, so you do not have to worry. But can it get worse while I grow up? depends on your age. If you are over 18 i think you should be good Okay gooood perfect I am 19.

", "Did a surgery 9 years ago Hello!\n\nI know exactly what some of you people go through. I was born with Pectus carinatum. And today ive almost forgot how it was to live with. \n\nBut i remember when i was like 3-11 years old i didnt really care about it. But when i turned 12 i almost got depressed cause my chest didnt look normal. When i was at the beach people started to ask or laugh at me, and that hit my self esteem really really hard. So it ended up that i didnt go more to the beach and didnt wear t-shirts outside in the summers. \n\nI always used to walk in hoodies. And isolated my self at the computer playing games.  Instead of being with friends, often thinked what i could do to be with friends how to hide my chest. (Dont have any pictures of it, since i hated it so much) this were from when i was 12-17. When i turned 17 i remeber that my mom asked me how i felt about my chest. And i said that i didnt feel very well, that i had some bad thoughts but didnt think i could do anything about it. \n\nSo we we called the hospital and got a appointment, so a doctor asked me some question and took pictures. And i told the doctor that i felt super bad.  I said if people asked about it i almost felt that i wanted to run away and never come back. And he sent the pictures to a specialist. I waited for answer of they could do anything about it. My chest had almost like a lump going out like 2-4cm. And i got a answer 2 months later and got a appointment to the specialist. \n\nDont remember exactly how long time it took, but think it might took 3 months since the first call. And we got there and talked for like 30-40 minutes. And he said that he wanted to do a surgery on me. And my hapiness just flew away. I never thought that it was that simpel. And i got a surgery 5-6 months later after that meeting. The surgery took about 6-8 hours. And i woke up high as fuck and in alot of pain. And stayed on the hospital for 4 days after the surgery. \n\nGot home and was still in alot of pain. When i laughed, sneezed or cough the pain was extreme. It was like that for 7 days and the pain went down. And when i took off bandadge my chest looked \u201dnormal\u201d had a huge scar on the chest but i never cared about it. Today i got my chest and stomach full of tattoos and no one have never asked me about my chest since then. And i feel so much better today. Feel free to Ask questions i can post a picture today how it looks if you want. \n\nSorry for bad spelling and all, wrote all this on my phone in the couch. Ravitch surgery?

I am extremely self conscious about it and do a lot of the same things you used to do. I wish my chest did not consume my life, but it is just something that I have to deal with I guess. Wow how can your parents be against your choice? Do not they care about your mentalhealth or do they want ya to use a braclet instead? \n\nI live in Sweden and we have free healthcare, you might do not have that in your country? If that is the reason for your parents? I live in the United States and the surgery would be classified as cosmetic and not be eligible for healthcare.\n\nI have a brace and wear it everyday but despite it being uncomfortable it would only help up to a certain point. Ohh I see, remember that the doctor said that a brace wont work when you are over 13 years. It did not have such a effect. Hope the brace works for you, or you can afford a surgery later in life! Yes it is kind of flat now. Still have some left but it does not bother me at all. Here is a picture before I got my whole chest filled with tattoos.  Looks great.

FYI I am 26 doing bracing and it is working on me well How did you get the brace? I have been to numerous doctors in Luxembourg and Germany and no one has ever brought up bracing. They all say its genetical I cant do anything about it and I should definitely avoid surgery. I am 22F and the pectus has only really started growing 2 years ago. Before that it was just one rib that was standing out since puberty. I got mine from London Orthotic Consultancy. Guy named Sam he is amazing. Go speak with them they do free consults I am even doing mine 100% remote it is working great. Do not listen to people who say you cannot do anything about it Damn you chest is flexible at 26. Do not you have to wear the brace until you chest hardens? That would mean a lot of the people bracing now might have to wear it for 10+ years. Damn this disorder stinks. No you only wear until your chest adapts to the new shape. It should take only a year or 2 in most cases regardless of age", "Scared that my chest will harden before i manage to get a brace. Hi, I am 14, 15 in Nov and I have pc. My pc is very asymmetric, my left side sticks out a couple centimetres and my right barely sticks out. I did not care about it for a while but now it is very noticeable and I hate it. I cannot go a day where I do not think about it, I live near a beach and I would usually go there a couple times a week during summer but now I have not gone there in almost 3 months. last year I went to my doctor and they told me that I would have to go to the UK to get a brace. I was meant to go but due to school exams my parents decided to delay it. We kept waiting and asking for a new date but they never gave one. Then covid came and the hospital no longer took appointments and they seemed to have completely given up on giving a new date to get a brace. My parents tried to get another appointment recently but they still are not taking any.  I am just so worried that they will never get me a brace and if I do get one it will be too late. I am very insecure about it and I think the uncertainty of what will happen is making me feel even worse. I am scared that my chest will harden and I will not be able to fix it.\n\nI am sorry if it sounded like a big rant but it is difficult to put all my thoughts out easily. It is been really difficult recently. Try looking into this brace.  I will bet you could get it delivered to your country.\n\n Pectus Services is my provider and they also ship their braces.

So I thought that I would share my experience from working out with PC, as I see myself as rather successful in that regard and have made some interesting observations along the way. The rest is of this post is broken up in different section, each with their own headline. Feel free to skip to whatever part that intrigues you.\n\nSome context:\n\n* Male\n* 25 years old\n* 196 cm (6\u00b45\u201d)\n* 96 kg (212 pounds)\n* Been doing strength related workouts 4-6 times a week the past 4,5 years\n* Was above active as a teen (which can play a huge role when it comes to gaining muscle)\n* My PC-severity is about medium or \u201caverage\u201d and I am able to \u201cpush\u201d it somewhat out, as seen (\n* I have not had any corrective surgeries nor worn a so called \u201cbrace\u201d\n\n**Why workout?** \\- Firstly I want to mention that working out is a great way to deal with PC. Not only did it help me with \u201chiding\u201d my PC, but arguably more importantly, it helped me build the confidence I was lacking as teenager. In the end, I believe that I am more confident and self reflected compared to if I did not have PC.\n\n**Lack of symmetry** \\- One of the greatest challenges with my PC is that my upper body is uneven or lacking symmetry in several areas. Although not visible at first, after looking closely it becomes obvious that my shoulders are not aligned, my collarbones protrude differently and the bottom of my ribcage is slightly uneven. This makes it difficult to do exercises where both hands are fixed to the same position, e.g., most exercises that use a barbell. I have found that my hands, and possibly more importantly my shoulders, need to be able to move freely and independent from each other. Therefore I avoid barbell exercises for my upper body and stick to dumbbells. So instead of doing barbell benchpress I do dumbbell benchpress and instead of doing barbell rows I do dumbbell rows. In addition to this, I feel that my \u201cunevenness\u201d makes it difficult to get into a safe and comfortable position when doing scapula retraction on the bench press (and similar exercises). I can clearly feel one of my shoulder blades resting very differently against the bench. To this end, even though dumbbell benchpress is my go to exercise for training chest, the dumbbell benchpress is difficult because of the uneven foundation used when lifting. Because of this I find it useful to supplement with standing cable flys because this allows both shoulders and shoulder blades can move freely and independent of each other.\n\n**Posture corrective exercises** \\- Having a bone that protrudes out of you chest is at first very embarrassing, as many of you probably can relate to. When I was younger I would crouch over in an attempt to hide it. As a result my shoulders had become somewhat rolled forward and my posture resembled someone with a hunchback. In my experience, hunching over just makes it worse. To fix this and I strengthened my upper back by doing a lot of face-pulls. Athlean-X on youtube have good videos demonstrating this exercise for those wondering. I did, and still do, face-pulls at the end of almost every workout. Focusing on training my lats also helped to strengthen my posture.\n\n**Insecurity** \\- Although feeling insecure at the gym is not unique to people with PC, having PC certainly makes you very self conscious about what you do and how you look doing it. To make matters worse, most gym apparel is tight, almost see through and made with light materials. All of this made it difficult to focus on my workouts as I was constantly worrying about how I looked. I even avoided certain exercises because of the vulnerable positions they required. My tips is to just wear a large hoodie or sweater. It is a lot easier to focus on your workout rather than on others when you are safe in knowing that your PC is well hidden. Also, I have been less prone to injuries after I started wearing a hoodie because I am able to keep my joints warm, as well as being able to focus on proper technique instead of a technique that best hide my PC. Finally, I workout early, before school/work when there is less people at the gym.\n\n**Pecs** \\- I personally do not care that chest is my lagging muscle group nor am I obsessed with training chest to hide my PC, but I wanted to share a tip that I got from my chiropractor once regarding training pecs. He said that PC makes it so each pec is positioned slightly differently and so you will feel that certain angles will \u2018hit\u2019 your chest differently. What I got from this is that doing chest exercises at varying angles help avoid muscular imbalance. I do not necessarily change the angle of the bench between every set of benchpress, but make sure to use different angles for my benchpress and flys. As an example, during my first year of working out I mostly did flat benchpress and as a result one pec developed significantly more than the other.\n\n**Blending PC in with abs** \\- I do not have the best genetics for abs, but from what little I have managed to develop I see that it significantly helped with making the PC look like its part of the abs. In my experience doing regular crunches is kind of weird and I am not sure if this is due to PC, but I have found most success doing hanging leg raises.\n\n**Losing weight** \\- I have seen several people discussing weight-loss as means to hide their PC or at least not \u201cmake it worse\u201d. I started off as rather skinny at 78 kg (172 pounds) and maxed out at 107 kg (236 pounds). Both are probably not ideal, but I can for certain say that being skinny did not help in any way. In fact, being skinny just makes the PC more visible. If you are still not convinced, know that being higher in body fat percentage allows you to hold more muscle and thus more mass to hide your PC. So do not starve yourself. It does you no good.\n\nTo finish things off, having PC probably means you will not set any strength related world records or look like the ideal fitness model, but that is completely fine. Generally PC is merely a small obstacle in life. For example, despite my PC, I have served in the army and competed professionally in cross country skiing. Also, at the end of the day, life is about more than you appearance and physical abilities. Finally, my PC has never been an issue when it comes to relationships, whether it be friends, long-term partners, hookups, \u201cfuck-friends\u201d, etc. I have never been rejected nor broken up with, so I feel confident in saying that having PC is not a dealbreaker for others.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need someone to talk to about PC.\n\nTLDR: Do not do barbell benchpress Can you share how do you train abs? Some say that abs can be done in 10 minutes every day, but I do not really see results from that so far. How should I train them, how often, how much? Abs are made in the kitchen That is not completely true... You do not have to have chiseled abs to feel them. I am skinny and I eat well, I can see them already, I just do not see any progress. You have to train your abs, not just eat healthy. Abs is the result of several factors where diet, training and genetics are arguably the most important ones. So saying that \"abs are made in the kitchen\" is true, partly. Regarding your question, I have found the most success from doing hanging leg raises and variations of it. At first it does not burn as much as regular crunches, simply because it takes time to learn the exercise. I recommend looking up some videos on YouTube. As for frequency I train abs 2-3 times a week, at the end of my legs workouts. This usually takes 15 minutes. Sometimes I even train abs between sets of legs exercises.", "My left pec is very protruding compared to my right, and i am wondering if this is pc/a condition or something I can even out by lifting.

I have pectus carinatum as well but it is not too noticeable. \n\nI have noticed  harder time breathing when running with peers and I always blamed my chest. I have light sleep apnea and I am wondering if getting a brace would help both .. Huge difference, it is practically gone and I love it, sleeping is just more comfortable because I sleep on my stomach, idk about breathing because I never had a problem with it but I am very sure the brace will help and will be 100% worth it and better than surgery", "Anyone in Australia have any experience with Dr John Goldblatt?

It makes your chest more flexible. Its key to keep it flexible so the chest doesnt go stiff. If the chest stays stiff over time. It will be extremely harder to fix the pectus carinatum and could get too late. The exercises keep the chest in longer after taking the brace off and reduce the amount of time u have to go through bracing. That is why I am given a brace exercise booklet and they gave me equipment to use. The excersises include\n\nPush ups\nBand stretches to really stretch the chest and get it flexible.\nLots of exercises tbh.\n\nYou can bench press to mask it. But in bracing. It is not recommended to bench press as it puts more pressure on the chest and can be bad. And from my experience caused me to have bad chest pains. \n\nSo it is best to bench press without a brace.", "Back and posture problems due to PC or something else? I have dealt with back problems and posture for many years now. I assumed that it might have been due to pectus carinatum, but was not sure. Another problem I have is that my skinny arms do not seem to fit my body because my chest is enlarged. That is more of a seemingly psychological issue, but wanted to know if other people experience the same sensation.\n\nI am 26 now and while surgery seems like a great option, I do not think I would qualify due to my PC not being a serious health problem, other than the possible back pain. I have gone back to the gym, so I can gain some mass to hide it at this point. Same thing here Idk what it is from TBH. I always could never have good posture as hard as I tried growing up. I wonder if it is from that. My right side is good my left side seems deformed at this point I am 22. Shit sucks but going to see if working out more helps. Working out seems to really help with appearance and usually it helps people with posture too. Oftentimes, we have poor back muscles which gives us poor posture. I am probably dealing with a combination of PC related discomfort and poor lifestyle related back issues. Definitely, I spend quite some time on the computer also... have u noticed any \u201cRib flare\u201d on yourself\u2753 I have heard that they often go hand in hand. Pectus Carinatum and back prpblems are ussualy associated with rapid growth in puberty. Did you have a period of rapid growth? If you did, your lifesryle is not the main reason of your problems. I work out for 10 years, but still I got Pectus Carinatum and Structural Kyphosis due to my rapid growth. I also have stretch marks on my back because my skin could not keep up with my growth. Sadly Kyphosis is fixable only with an extremly risky operation, but so I tried to correct my posture as much as possible and I am really satisfied with the result. Yes PC will give you bad posture and sometimes back pain.   \n\n\nUsually when you are young there is no pain. But as you age and everything stiffens up you get pain. \n\nPeople saying PC is only an appearance problem does not know much.\n\nI have had 2 surgeries but both with recurrence and I can tell you there is a BIG difference in my back health. \n\nWorking out is always helpful, because it will keep your muscle strong and not to stiff. But it is not possible to get it 100%. Yeah I know. It is really upsetting how my family doctor did not seem to believe or care when I told him about my back pain. It is so frustrating dealing with this minor problem when I have a lot of other seemingly small mental/physical problems to deal with and medical professionals tell you it is not a big deal.", "22, have had PC since I was 12. As the title states, I have had it since around 12 years old. My dad had it and I guess genetically I have it. My older brother does not have it so maybe it skips generations lol.

I have been to insecure to swim so I never learned \n\nA 12 year old with body insecurity is not cool and should not be a thing. I used to walk with a slouch so people would not notice it sticking out of my shirt. I did a presentation and some girl said I looked like iron man once (and it made me feel more okay with it).  I have actually been thinking about getting the arc reactor tattood over it but since it is all bone idk how that would feel \n\nWent to the doctors and my barely getting by parents got me the brace (shit was like 500 bucks and insurance did not cover it). I wore it for a couple months but fuckin hated it.  Not knowing how much it costed, I stopped wearing it. Did not want to wear it in school as I thought kids would make fun of me. Reading this sub made me realize how it was more of a blessing and how I should have just worn it and I would not be dealing with PC right now. \n\nI worked out and it never really covered up but it made it less noticeable until I stopped working out. I gained weight and again it was less noticeable, I hit 200 pounds and had a dad bod so I lost 30 pounds in a couple months to be at a healthy weight and the pc is right back to where it was when I was 17. My girlfriend does not care at all about it, and no girls I have messed around with in the past seemed to care about it either (if that makes anyone feel better about getting into relationships), and that made me a lot less insecure about it. \n\nBut why do I still feel insecure if I take my shirt off at the beach? Or insecure when I walk around work with my shoulders straight up, I think it is just imbedded into my brain. Nobody really cares what is on your body except you. Unless your a doctor and they spot a lump I guess \n\nAnyways like I said, i do not wear my brace, have not touched it in years. I am going to ask my mom if she has it still and hopefully I will be able to give it out to somebody in this sub ( but only if it was recommended by a doctor cause some people with PC cannot wear the brace as it can cause damage to organs)", "Do we all have narrow rib cages and small waists and then wide hips? Or am I just unlucky Not really\n\nI just have PC and rib flares, which makes my entire chest more slim and not as wide (cause things sticking out instead of to the sides) \n\nThe small waist big hips thing is probably just genetics? I do. I think it depends which ribs are affected, and how many are affected. Narrow rib cages (relative to the hips) is common among PC. anything you can really do about it to look more normal? and not pear shaped? so yes narrow rib cage? Oh sorry, yes to that part. Having PC is not having \"extra bone\" it is literally the bone that is suppose to be flat that is now sticking outwards. \n\nAs bracing has helped my PC I have gotten broader and wider shoulders as well. No. Although my chest did get wider after using the brace, it was always wide. I got blessed with wide shoulders and chest and small waist. I do not think anything other than chest width is affected by PC. I think what makes it appear that way is the fact we have the same length ribs as anybody, but they have to go around in a slightly different shape in order for the sternum to protrude. So must of us will look a little sunken under the pecs. You would need to flatten your ribcage which should widen it too if you are not removing cartilage. If you are young enough for bracing to work I think that would do the trick, otherwise you could try a abramsom or sandwich technique procedure. I am going to try the latter, though i am not sure much can be done to broaden the ribcage once you are old enough for the bone to be solidified (which has happened in my case as i am 28). 27 :( scared I am running out of time to ever not hated my body", "Is it normal for Pectus to hurt a little sometimes? I had pectus as a baby and it mostly got better until my recent growthspurt. The growth has since ceased but my newly recovered Pectus is not fun. It makes it harder for me to exert myself and sometimes it just hurts for no reason. My mom says I should wait for a while to see if its just growing pains before seeing a doctor. Perhaps I will get used to it. My great uncle also had it so I suppose it runs in my genes. Different for everyone. When I had it really bad I was out of breath fast and had tight chests. \n\nShouldnt be worrying but you should get it checked if it is on your mind.\n\nMine didnt hurt.

It is not easy because you need to wear it for a year, but it is worth it. I finished my treatment in February. But, brace is more effective if you are still young so hurry up. Yeah I went to the doctor and they put it through an x-ray and examined it. They said it was barely noticeable and nothing to worry about. It is on my record now.

Has anyone that is braced had scoliosis?\nPlease tell me what you guys think I should do. She thinks if I use a brace my body will become dependent on it so it will not work I would disagree with your chiropractor, I remember seeing someone on here whos has scoliosis and was making good progress with a brace. Plus your back has nothing to do with the shape of your chest. That is a huge misunderstanding on her part.

Restarted last year with LOC another brace provider Yeah I am also having some back pain with the brace its going to be tough to wear at night. I just hope that gez knows what he is doing. I am a bit skeptical about it. Did you go to the location to get the brace or order it online? I went to the location. To be honest his brace in my opinion, at least when i did it, was not the highest quality now that I have been exposed to other braces. It is like mid at best. But it does work if you stick to it. He is a smart guy, no doubt but it is all up to you really. You got to stick it out So I guess you used to live in la and moved to England?

I started using it when I was 18 years and 2 months old and my PC was gone in a year. Yeah I made the appointment for November and will most likely go for it. It just seems more reliable. Is the measuring and fitting of the brace all in one appointment or is it over multiple appointments? One appointment to measure your chest and shortly after put the brace on your chest.\n\nThe next day you go there again so they can see if everything is all right and make some adjustments if needed. After that you are free (from appointments lol, not from the brace). Ok great I scheduled those apointments. By the way were you able to sleep in the brace pretty well or did it take some getting used to. The current brace I have has a pretty bulky back part so it causes a lot of back pain trying to sleep. I had troubles. I have a very small kyphosis (hunchback) so the pressure on my back was concentrated on a small surface. This caused my skin to break at some point and made 2 months of my treatment very uncomfortable. Watch out for that, use a cream to reduce the fritction on pressure points and you should be good. It will take some time to get used to the brace while sleeping. Ah ok. Appreciate the help bro No problem. Feel free to ask me anything, just DM me if you ever need something. I used to live in La then moved but not to England. I actually do everything remote with LOC, have never been to England in fact. But it is worked out just fine. I would say do what you feel is best. I think t joe is good but tbh I was not huge fan of joe himself when I consulted him. He is very salesy and I did not get the feeling the after care would be that good, but I would not know for sure as I did not go with him Hmm I have heard really only good things about joe but yeah at the end of the day he is selling a product so it makes sense. Yea well if you like him you like him you got to see for yourself I have been wearing my la brace for about 1 month now. It has definitely made a difference for me. How old are you? I am 16", "Hey guys. I have pectus carinatum and it is really killing my self confidence. The left side of the bone sticks out considerably more than the right (hard to tell in pics.) I was wondering if I should get a brace to fix this problem while I can. Thanks  Yes, try it. If something bothers you, fight for your happiness. I have carinatum too, and mine is worse then yours, and I got a brace and all that. Honestly I would say yours is not really that noticable, and it is not really that bad. Braces are really uncomfortable and annoying to wear, so I would sit with it a little bit and think about if you really want one", "14/M My country provides no pectus brace services, I got mine of Amazon. As the title stated, I got my brace through amazon by Alimed. I have no idea what the wearing schedule is.\n\nI did some research, the thing I learned is there is a correction phase and a maintenance phase, but the thing is there is so much different and variating answers that its kind of confusing, the correcting phase was all the way from 2 weeks to 8 months. \n\nAny advice? Wear the brace until you are satisfied with the results. Take it like this; you tighten braces continuously every month or so (probably tighten every month or so with pectus brace too) and then after they might give you a retainer to wear each night. You should wear the brace until satisfied with the result, and wear it every night to sleep for example, or every afternoon after school until the next day. This will keep your chest from returning, and hence 'maintain' the result. \n\ntldr: Wear it until you are satisfied, tightening it every so often, and then when you reach your desired outcome, wear it at a specific tightness level each night for 3 months for example, then every 2 nights for 3 months and continue with every 2 night for a while. Do it until you are around 17-18, and by then your chest should be solid and stick!\n\nGoodluck! These distinctive \"phases\" do not exist. Just brace consistently for a very long time and you will get great results at your age. I recorded a video about my experience and tips for bracing check it out there is definitely important stuff everybody needs to know ( Thank you!! I did not know u had to do light pressure, i cranked it to the max. I will check out ur other vids. I learnt alot more than I did on that video than I did from weeks of researching. No problem bud! I obsessed over the my chest for two years alone with no one to share my observations or experience with. I love being able to use all that now-useless knowledge to help the next generation I think I did, It is the one from trulife similar to the one in your videos. It is a newer version now though, I do adjust the screws so yeah. Hey man I saw your vid - very helpful thank you! Can I ask: 1) how old were you when you started bracing?\n2) where did you get your brace?\n3) how long did you wear it in total and what was the schedule of your wearing? (1 year 23/7 , then maintenance, etc etc)\n4) What was the severity and type of your PC? Did you have asymmetric? Was it mild or severe? How flexible was it when you started bracing?\n5) in terms of weightlifting, can you be more specific what exercises were helpful to do while bracing to get the PC down?\n\nFor reference I am a 25M about to do bracing next year and am trying to knock it down for good this time. I did bracing once before 3 years ago and I had solid results after 6 months of constant use, but then gave it all up bc I had serious back and skin pain and did Zero maintenance phase. I think the tip you said about not hiding the Brace is also important because when doing this we need all the support we can get.\n\nAny other tips you have to get through 2 years of bracing would be super appreciated man. I hope I can get to the other side of this with a nicer chest. Hey dude cool to hear you are bracing at such a late age and still making progress. That is pretty much unheard of. Those are some good, valid questions, so I went ahead and made a video response: \nThanks for supporting my vids man. Cheers. Wow thanks for making a vid just for my questions!! Much love and appreciation. I really am enjoying your videos so please do not stop making them- every tad bit of information is super helpful. One last thing - do you mind showing pics of your chest before bracing? No problem man. I love putting all my old Pectus Carinatum knowledge to good use to help other people going through it. If I ever find any pre-bracing pics I will definitely upload some sort of before and after video. They are hard to come by because I was so dumbly self conscious about my chest during that period that I would have avoided cameras while shirtless.", "help hello,this is my first post here\nim 16 yo and i have pectus carinatum\nis push ups everyday good idea for \"hiding\" pc?i dont have access to gym so i need to do bw workouts\n\n\n\n\nsorry on bad english,its not my native language Ouch. Yes it is. But ideally you are a good age for bracing. Your chest could become stiff if you hit 17. Pectus will always get worse even if hiding it. I have been cranking out 70-100 push ups a day for about a month. If anything pc helps the front view of your pecs. Still a long way from covering up from the side", "Need help...

Maybe make another post about a brace in UK. I have been through the exact same process as you have and I am 16 and I have pectus carinatum , there is this medical facility called the pectus clinic in the uk and you can email and call them to find out information about the bracing treatment however it is very expensive Try London orthotics.

Every Pectus is unique and progresses different. This is just for beginners who want to know what route to take for fixing||\n\n1. This happened to me but about age 7. I went to doctors about a lump. The doctor said it was the sternum. Sadly he did not tell me it was Pectus carinatum. Its more of. They are not experienced in dealing with it.\n\nPectus usually shows at young ages. But as you get into puberty. You start to see it peak. At the age of 14/15 that is when it can start to show. As you get growth spurts. Your chest will gradually protrude more and more. For people who baerly have much chest muscle this can really be so visible to see. \n\nOn top of that. Not always. But you can develop other issues such as breathing issues. (Tight chests) or very rare. Frequent chest infections. Just not this is extremely rare and I have only seen it on websites that are supposed to inform you about pectus. Scoliosis can also occur. A back deformity that is linked.\n\n2. After your growth spurts stop. Normally at 18. The chest well will not protrude anymore. Although that can be a good. The chest wall will become less flexible. Meaning it will be harder to push. This can be bad news for bracing. But do not worry. Adults can get braces as long as it is flexible.\n\nAs you get older there is a chance with age. You will get more breathing issues. None which require surgery or emergency help. Just more tight chests.\nNot always. People just have the protrude and no symptoms.\n\nI saw someone ask. Will pectus affect CPR? In all honesty. It could. But you should be able to press down on a pectus patient.. but it would be best to get bracing. If it protruded far and you needed cpr. It could be harder to give cpr. But this is a very interesting question that no one knows a definite answer.\n\nPectus could be related to other body issues..like one collarbone bigger than other. It seems People with pectus have other issues that could be related.\n\nIf you have barrel chest. This is not for you..its extremely hard to fix and unlike pectus. Unless you are born with it. You should get checked out by a doctor as it is linked to underlying health conditions like copd.\n\n\nIf there is any info I missed. Comment. I will gladly add :)", "Does anyone have suggestions about how to make my back hurt less when using a brace? I wear a brace at night while lying on my back, and there is always a lot of pressure on my back. I think this might be partially because I am really skinny, so it is right up against my spine. My doctor made a ridge in the back for my spine to be in to make it more comfortable. This helped, but it still hurts. Does anyone have any recommendations? Feel free to ask questions. Yeah I had this too multiple times, one thing I did that did help is get another pad maybe from your doctor, make sure it is relatively thin. And cut a square or something in the middle where your pain is centralized then put this on your back pad. Then the middle part (your spine) should be given a break while the pressure then moves to the parts right outside your spine. If it still is in pain you might need to take a break and let it heal, or maybe try sudocrem, or potentially a larger back pad altogether to diffuse the pressure I found that getting mattress topper helped a bit", "I am 14 years old and i am pretty certain i have pectus carinatum, how bad would you say i have it? i spoke to my parents about it and they are taking me to see a doctor about it but i am quite worried about getting a brace and wearing it to school.  Yours is not bad. If you packed on a bit more muscle, it would be completely invisible. It may get worse though as you keep growing, so getting a brace to prevent that would be very smart. You would not have to wear it to school. I never wore mine to school and still got results. Wear it to sleep and when you are not at school and it would be enough Nothing wrong in wearing a brace to school, just tell that your lungs have low capacity and that will help you get a bigger capacity. Believe me, you will regret it if you do not do it. yeah, i snowboard so i was thinking of saying that i have injured my chest snowboarding and have to wear it. but at the end of the day i want the results and for my chest to be fixed because to have a nice chest the price to pay in the grand scale of things is not that bad. after all, the brace is only on 24/7 for 6 months and after that wearing it to sleep is not that bad because i am alone. When I had Pectus it was very hard to breath while swimming. Somehow it was he is for me to exhale. So this might be another reason to start on the brace. For everybody who has Pectus and if you are in the US I recommend ( Seriously, when I got my brace I just told people what it was and made it a part trick to knock out like a door and freak people out, it was quite fun actually He is *great* he came to the UK so not limited to US", "How serious is mine?

Honestly it does not look that bad to me at all. kids/teenagers can be harsh though, I know. Keep lifting and they will learn to keep their mouths shut. It is kind of ironic.  You say you are being told you have man boobs, but those \"man boobs\" (which are really just pecs, pretty sure you are kind of jacked) actually make it hard to tell at all you have PC.  You just seem...I think the phrase is 'barrel-chested'?\n\nI cannot tell how old you are so do not know what treatment would be most appropriate (I am also not a doctor), but lowering your body fat might give your pecs a more 'cut' look, if that is important to you. Okeh,ill try cutting and im 16. In my case the left part of the chest sticks out more. Thanks. Get a brace. I got mine 3 days ago. It is uncomfortable as hell, but definately worth it.

I was first offered the brace treatment when I was 15 years old which already places me in a position of privilege as I had access to it. Instead of facing my fears of embarrassment and undertaking this process, I ran away from it and tried to justify this myself. I was terrified of the idea because my confidence was extremely fragile. Looking back I thoroughly regret this decision. I know it is a big undertaking but **if you have the chance, I recommend you to begin bracing as soon as possible, your future self will be grateful**.\n\nMy own bracing journey began years later at 18 when I realized it was not too late to change my life. By then, I had developed enough self-esteem to not care about how the brace looked or that I would have to explain it to people. I thought once I get over my fear of being judged, wearing the brace would be easy. I was wrong. \n\nI began experiencing severe damage to my skin which was excruciating since I was working full-time in a physical job. Slowly, a wound began developing on my chest that eventually began creating puss and blood. At the time I thought this was a part of the journey and I stubbornly continued to wear the brace, afraid I would lose all progress if I stopped. This was a terrible idea and **I urge all of you to stop immediately if you see any blood**. My arrogance only lead to major skin damage which forced me to take a long break and delayed my treatment by 3 months. Not worth it. \n\nIn retrospect, I was wearing the brace directly on my skin which all of you should avoid. **Instead, I experienced that wearing a cotton tank top and several layers of a thin sponge under the brace improved my pain drastically (see image)**, a technique which my doctor later approved. Moreover, I found that **using baby powder on my skin under the brace helped remove moisture** and therefore reduced the likelihood of developing blisters - I applied baby powder in the morning and evenings.\n\nAfter my skin recovered and I started taking care of it, I began to make progress. I foolishly underestimated how long the bracing process takes to work and dealing with extensions from my doctor was certainly another challenge. I found relief in the thought that this whole process was only a fraction of my life that my future self would look proudly on. Thinking along the lines of \"why me\" or \"what did I do to deserve this\" certainly did not help. Every single person in life faces adversity, we are not unique, the question is how will you deal with that adversity. \n\nI am now in my final month of treatment and if there is anything I can help any of you with, please message me. I know this is a difficult journey. Good to hear that stuff's working out for you man! I agree. There should be no shame in wearing a brace. I told my friends about it the first day I wore it. I was 18, so I was probably more mature than an average 15 year old, but it is still worth it to do it as early as you can. There is no shame I am wearing a brace, but there is also no shame in living with your chest as it naturally is. I have never wanted treatment for my Pectus Carinatum and I am thankful that I was born with it. I almost think of it as a gift to make me unique and teach me strength, it has definitely taught me compassion and growth on levels that I would not have been able to experience if I did not have this condition. Congratulations on your last little bit of bracing! I am very excited for you, if you are comfortable doing so you should post a picture of your chest once it is off! Congrats, and keep spreading awareness about the condition:)", "Taking off Brace while Asleep This might sound pretty funny but every time I fall asleep with my Brace on, I wake up and my Brace is off. it seems that I take off my Brace while I am sleeping, what do I do?

I have a similar problem but instead of taking the brace off I always loosen it mid sleep ... tried that, somehow my unconscious body finds a way every time wear a shirt over the brace, as it will make it harder for the clip to come undone", "Does this look like Pectus Carinatum? Hi guys,\n\nI have never been formally diagnosed with PC and it is only something i have recently discovered to be honest. To me it looks like I have Pectus Carinatum and I plan on seeing a doctor asap to have it assessed but I just thought i would ask your opinions first. I have always been self conscious that my chest/ribs jut out but I did not realise it was something that could be treated. My ribs stick out more on the right side of my chest. I have had postural issues like Kyphosis most of my life and i have had breathing issues for many years, particularly shortness of breath and feeling like I cannot take deep breaths (which has been particularly bad lately). Aside from it being a potential cause of those health issues I am just really not a fan of the way it looks. I also have quite a narrow rib cage from the front, so it would be great if my ribcage could be treated and made to look more normal. I am 27 years old so I imagine bracing is out of the question so i imagine surgery would be the only option. I am not sure if it is severe enough to warrant surgery but if it fixed my breathing issues and appearance it would be well worth it. Does this look like PC to you guys? Cheers Note: the tshirt photo is what it looks like when I try to straighten my posture, most of the time i have quite hunched and it is not quite as visible i think. Yeah, it is definately pectus and breathing problem alone should warrant a surgery, tell them this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour ribs look normal and if they are asymmetrical and protruding it is not something you will notice Definitely PC. And yes it is absolutely treatable. Like the other comment stated surgery is an option, and since it is causing breathing problems you have cause for insurance to cover it. Be sure to mention the breathing problems at any consultation you go to. Many cases are asymptomatic so they may assume you want to correct it for cosmetic reasons.\n\nIf surgery is too expensive or too intrusive (it will leave a scar) then getting a brace is another option. It will be super tight and likely cause skin irritation and hurt for a while. But after a few weeks you should be adjusted to it and you will start seeing results in 3 months. \n\nIf neither of those are up your alley you can also bulk muscle to cover it up. This is the longest and hardest way but is cheapest. The main muscles you want to focus on are pecs, upper abs, and your back muscles (to correct posture). \n\nBest of luck to you, if you have any questions feel free to DM Definatelly Pectus  Carinatum Thanks for the reply. Yeah i will be sure to follow up with a specialist regarding a potential surgery. I personally think the asymmetry is quite noticable in person but perhaps the pictures do not do it justice. Thanks for the info! Do you think a brace would still be an effective treatment at 27 years old? I am imagining surgery will be the best/most realistic option available to me, but it cannot hurt to try the brace to avoid an invasive surgery. It could be. I think you are near the cutoff time but everyone is different. If you go to a specialist about it, before giving you the brace they will push down on your chest and see how flexible it still is, and they can better decide if you should try a brace or not waste your time. Great thanks a lot for the info!  For anyone that wants an update: Met with a surgeon today and he had a look at my chest and I showed him some photos and he believed it does not look as bad in person as it does in my photos. I myself did not think it looked so bad today (it kind of becomes more or less obvious as my weight fluctates imo) hence why I showed him the photos. He was not convinced that I have PC, instead he thought he could just be one rib protuding. As such he did not believe PC would be the cause of my breathing or prostural issues.\n\nHowever to his credit he referred me to get a CT scan of my chest to get a better idea of what is going on before completely ruling out PC or how my ribs could be impacting my lungs.\n\nSo my next step is to get the CT scan of my chest/ribs done and then we will discuss the results and go from there. Not going to lie, i am kind of hoping that it is PC and it is the cause of my breathing and postural issues. Those symtoms have been bothering me a lot for years so it would be life changing to be able fix it all in one go (especially since i have tried almost everything else to fix them). Hi odd-socks,\n\nYour chest looks quite like mine, and I too have kyphosis and breathing issues. I wonder do you get feelings of anxiety as a result of a tight feeling in your chest and restricted breathing (not due to the appearance)? \n\nWhat else have you tried to help the breathing and kyphosis?\n\nFeel free to message me whenever, I am a similar age to you and am going through the same thing, so it would be nice to hear how it is going for you. Thanks Hey, that is interesting it would be good to hear about your experiences too then. \n\nSometimes, I have definitely dealt with anxiety in the past but i do a good job of managing it these days. My breathing issues definitely put my body into a sympathetic nervous state at times though.", "Does the brace look obvious under clothes? Kind of scared of getting judged highschool girls can be mean. Im female so I have boobs but my PC is on onside so worrying if it will look super obvious. Feel ur pain!!

Glad to see the group exists, when I grew up before the internet was quite as commonly used, I definitely felt very alone. I hope this can change things for kids growing up now.  thanks so much for sharing! Have you ever thought about treatment? Definitely thought about it, especially when I was younger.  I was a lot more self conscious then. It affected my social life significantly.  At my age I do not care as much, and definitely do not consider it worth the risk of surgery. I had surgery last week for this. If you have any questions feel free to ask :)  Thanks! How much did it cost you, and can you see the difference?

Not sure, but your camera quality is definitely worse. Not as bad as the picture", "Update to bracing Well I have made posts about this before.\n\nSo recently I have not really been that great with bracing. 11+ months in and it still is not staying in.\nOnce again I just have not followed the excersise program and since I have been suffering with bad anxiety again I have not worn it much. Especially sleeping.\n\nAfter talking to the consultant. They reckon if I really stick to it. I can get it staying in for hours by September.\n\nAs of now. I have been back doing excersises. I have been doing bench presses. Yeah they are not reccomended but I am at thr final stages. I do not want to just take my brace off every time I to them. I just loosen the brace.\nBut I am really starting back at it.\nWith anxiety, it can make me non compliant.\n\nSince I am naturally skinny the goal is by December. To have more chest muscle. Plus since I have gym equipment at home. I am really training as hard as I can.\n\nI just want to tell people who are currently bracing. Do not be me and be less compliant. Really push it. It Will eventually work. You got to trust the process. It also depends on the flexibility and severity. Mine was really severe so yeah. Does it get fixed like all. Let us say your right ribcage sticks out but not the left, does the right side goes inwards to the left? Or is it still a bit sticking out Different with everyone.\n\nMine was one of the worst cases reported to my clinic. Both sides sick out. Not just 1 side.\n\nIt gets fixed. But depends on flexibility and commitment.\n\nMines 80% fixed.\n\nSome people have a mix of pe and pc. Which is harder to fix If you dont have severe like mild is it worth having a brace It can be. It can cause issues in later life. Nothing life threatening. But it will not go. And could get worse.\n\nAfter ages of 16. It can start to get harder to fix. As the chest wall matures it becomes less flexible. \n\nFor best results. You need one at age between 15-18. Many says that bracing hurts How long is your chest staying in now? Mine stays in for like maybe 30 minutes then starts to pop out gradually over a few hours. Very frustrating as when it is on it stays very flat. I am going to give myself till the end of the year to wear full time then I am going to wean off. Cannot let it interrupt my life for too long as I am going completely without any social interaction at the moment Yeah atleast 30 mins. It can take up to 19 months. Plus I was not very compliant with it. And due to thr severity of mine. It is going to just take bit longer. Hey man can you help me understand the ways of fixing carinatum in todays age? Im asking for a friends 3 year old. I have pectus excavatum and know alot about it but not much on carinatum. Can you please tell me a brief detail on repairs and success. Does not hurt. Just uncomfortable. Like teeth braces. They are uncomfortable but worth it Only ways to really fix carinatum is surgery or a chest brace. Both very expensive. Some countries have it free. Like Finland I believe.\n\nA brace will push the carinatum down. But I would only recommend it to people age 13-18.\n\nIt is very uncomfortable and has to be worn for months.\n\nOther option is surgery. This is minimally invasive and can cause problems. Sometimes). Two bars are put in the chest..then after a period of time they are removed. This would be the ravitch procedure correct? How expensive would you say a medical brace can run up to? Im actually getting myself the nuss procedure tmr around 11:00 am but like i said this is for P.E. Although my brother in laws kid has carinatum and is easily noticeable at early age could this worsen alot through growth spurts im assuming and is it likely it will get worse since its so noticeable now? It is ravitch. Prices vary in each country. My brace costed 1k. But in some countries.. I am not sure which ones..its free. \n\nAnd yes. The Pectus carinatum will get worse. When I was young. At around 7 I noticed it. At age of 15\n It really stuck out badly and was severe. It is best to get a child bracing asap. As the chestwall is very flexible at younger ages. Only downside is wearing to school. With growth spurts it will show more. And could even cause some breathing issues. (Like tight chests) Awesome ok ummmm now i was able to purchase something such as a vb bell for P.E. Are these braces something i can purchase without needing a medical diagnosis? Is there any resources you can share with me by any chance? I would love it so i can forward it to my brother in law. Thanks alot Im not great with pe knowledge. I think it would be wise to get a medical diagnosis.\n\nTry asking.\n\nR/PectusExavatum.\n\nThey have some good answers. I am sorry, I think you misunderstood my question. I was wondering if braces are something that can be acquired outside of a medical diagnosis, such as a 3rd party that sells them? If so, are there any resources you can provide me with that you might have handy. Thanks, I know enough of P.E but would like to know if your able to acquire such a device ( brace) because people with P.E are able to get such a device without needing a diagnosis. Thanks again. My bad,\n\nTechnically you can get 3rd party braces.\n\nWell, if you say bought a brace online. It could work. But it is also harmful for the chest. See when someone gets a brace they need their chest scanned. Or possibly measured. That is to ensure the brace is fitted well. If it isnt a brace specifically given by a doctor. It can be bad for the chest.\n\nFor a efficient brace. You would need to see a doctor. They would press the chesy down to see the flexibility and will decide if bracing would work.\n\nThird party do not really work aswell as a private medical facility brace Copy that makes sense ok thank you very much for replying and answering my questions. What i have had tooth brace and it dosent hurt like only on the start but it was worth it. I live in norway and i dont know where pectus doctor is, should i just go to my privat doctor and Ask her? Private doctors do not have a clue about pectus and say some untrue stuff. They will not know. Perhaps Google.\n\nAnd it is exactly like a tooth brace. Hurts at start.. get used to it in roughly weeks Where should i go to which doctor does fix pectys Private doctors\n  \nSome countries may not even have doctors who fix it.\n\nYou may have to research", "Is this PC?

I take painkillers and I am wearing a sports t-shirt wich eliminates a lot of pain but I still lay there for three hours, not falling in sleep. Do you guys might have any tips or advice for me? Interesting I have a different problem where I can sleep with it but I always loosen it sometime during my sleep cus it gets painful. I would just keep trying, maybe make it as comfortable for you as possible? Thnx, but will not you think that when I will loosen it, it is going to be less effective? I am 18 years old, my ribs are still quite flexibel, but what I have read so far is that I should start tighten it up bc otherwise it will not be effective. Yeah I think you should tighten it as much as you can. I am just saying for sleep maybe make it more comfy with blankets and such to help you fall asleep Thnx Ill try that I used to sleep on my stomach with the brace on 4 pillows. After sleeping like that for a while I just slept on my back Im much more a side-sleeper but that is the most uncomfortable position if you ask me while wearing the brace. Cheers mate I will try that out as well! Im much more a side-sleeper but that is the most uncomfortable position if you ask me while wearing the brace. Cheers mate I will try that out as well! I do not really have a real advice. It is hard anf you adapt to it overtime. Try sleeping on your back and chest, and decide which is more comfortable.

Classic pull-push-legs, best workout imo. Your pc does not look noticeable at the moment, and gaining a few pounds of muscle should be good. i cant even see it dude you look great It is honestly hardly noticable. Some pushups would easily help though, if you feel it is a problem. Just make sure you use proper forms (elbows in) and you should see some noticeable muscle gain within a few months. Also I do not recommend it for everyone, but I used a brace for a while. But eventually I got to the point where all I needed to do was sleep on my chest, with something pushing up against it. Just something to keep the pressure pushing my chest in. And this would basically keep my chest in all day, until going back to sleep. If your chest is still flexible It should work.

But i font get the would not I have a more efficient hart  What? What? Please try to write this again because I do not understand a thing. Ur implying that u have more efficient heart as it pumps out more? What Yes. Rush B. Doctors have pointed out to me that I breathe at a quicker rate and more efficiently than most people. I attribute that to Pectus Carinatum inhibiting me from deeper breaths. PC definitely affects how your respiratory and circulatory system function a bit so I would not be surprised if you have a more efficient heart. Not to be like that, but not being able to do deep breathes is not more efficient.   \n\n\nI agree that PC will give you a shallow breathe because of restrictions in the expansion of the chestwall but it is less efficient if anything. Maybe I was not clear. I am saying that the physical limitation of shallower breaths forces people with pectus carinatum to compensate by having more efficient breaths. In the same way that a runner gets a more efficient heart and breath because of the challenge of running, the challenge of breathing with pectus carinatum forces people to adapt. We are in agreement brother.

Eat healthy and exercise before. You are physical state is an important factor for recovery.\n\nIf your PC is causing you problems; DO NOT WAIT!! Do not accept your PC if it gives you problems. I waited 25 years. This was the time, make sure you pick yours.\n\nWill post again in about 6 months. Thank you for the update. Looking forward to the 6-month post.\n\nBest of luck. How much did it cost if you dont mind me asking?\nI suffer from pectus carinatum too im 18 6'3 and looking to get surgery in a couple of months from the help of my parents. Just wondering how much it cost It did not cost me anything... my sociale security covered it up. I live in The Netherlands... The only thing I needed was an referral from my doctor.\n\nI looked it up once and I thought the total costs are between $ 15.000 and $ 25.000 depending the hospital, your length of stay in the hospital, depending your doctor and the initial surgery and procedure.\n\nTake care and hope you will get the surgery. How was the pain management ? And did your pc successfully go away ? My only worry is that itll come back after surgery but i doubt that will happen, its just in the back of my mind Thanks for sharing this. Do you mind sharing some of the problems that you experienced living with pectus carinatum? I believe I have been dealing with minor \u201cissues\u201d that go beyond physical appearance but my primary care doctor did not seem to really put much weight to my concerns. The pain management was okay. After the surgery you have a lot of pain. On a scale from 1 to 10 I give it a 4 or 5. Every day they checked if the pain was acceptable which it most of the time was. If it was not they increased the morfine. Now (2 weeks later) I am - within my limitations - almost painless. Stopped with painkillers (had 3). They made me dizzy and lazy.\n\nIf you had your puberty growthspurt (do not know how to call that), do not be afraid that the PC will come back. They remove the cartilage which will not grow back if you finish your own growth. My PC is 100% gone! There is no better feeling then waking up each morning and realizing you will never have to deal with it again. update? Besides corona; Things are going great! Very mild pain during the night and no pain during daytime. I can walk normal without pain, sit normal, bend normal and do everything besides lifting more then 6 pounds... that are the written precautions.\n\nAlso got the idea that the muscles are healing good. My chest feels much firmer than previous weeks and can notice that the breast-muscles are getting stronger again. \n\nThis Thursday it is been 3 weeks since the surgery. After that I can start cycling again (we love doing that in the Netherlands) and can start with fitness. So the cartilage never grows back ? Im a boxer so im kind of worried i thought the cartilage would grow back in a normal position that is why they put the bar there? Are you saying it will grow back normally or never grow back at all? The PC is caused by excessive amount of cartilage which connects the ribs with the sternum. In other words; the cartilage make the ribs to long pushing the sternum forwards (PC) or backwards (pectus excavatum). \n\nDuring the Ravitch surgery they will remove the excessive amount of cartilage which is in a sort of membrame. After that they close the membrame and new cartilage forms which makes the connection firm and strong again.\n\nThere is a minor chance that it will grow back, but only if you are not finished growing. \n\nI do not have a bar placed (thank God). The sternum is reshaped with the removal of the cartilage only. Im only 18 so theres a good chance ? If it doesnt grow back do you think ill be able to take a shot there and be fine I am no doctor... so I am not in the position to give you any medical advice. Only thing I can say is that - when the time is right - you go to the specialist and get a consult. Before that, read about it. I waited 25 years for a surgery and always monitored the experiences with the Ravitch procedure which was not available when I was 18.", "Surgery Story I had severe Pectus Carinatum/exacavatum where one side of my chest would stick out and the other would sink in. from around age 16-18 when I would go to the doctors etc they wouldnt really know what they were looking at and if they did they didnt recommend much. I eventually got put in contact with a specialist in thoaric surgery and met my surgeron. . We spoke about the options and he told me that he would be happy to go ahead with surgery as soon as possible. I agreed to this and I had surgery on 26.04. I had my ribs detatched from my sternum and a STRATOS bar inserted into the middle part of my chest to keep the chest flat. I am from the UK and got the procedure done on the NHS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was in hospital for 4 days before going home with 2 drains still attached to me which was pretty hard and the pain was still pretty bad. The medication was pretty heavy going with morphine etc. Pain in hospital would wake me up in the night however through the day was not so bad, movement is obviously very restricted. At this point I still had covers over the wound and over my drain sites so it was difficult to tell how much had changed however I could tell my chest did look a lot better. After being home for a few days I had a severe pain in my back which turned out to be a fluid build up in/around my lung meaning I had to be readmitted into hospital for a further 6 days. Here I had the 2 drains originally inserted taken out which was unpleasant to say the least and then had a new one put in my back to drain the fluid.\n\nAfter leaving the hospital a second time I had no drains which meant movement was better however was still on a lot of drugs and pain was still quite bad. I work an office job and ended up having an orignal sicknote of 6 weeks which had to be extended a further 3 meaning nine weeks in total off work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy case was severe so a lot had to be done in order to make my chest look normal but for anyone going into the surgery I would say that it is painful however if youve gone as far as surgery the mental pain the condition has caused you over the years would have been worse. Im 2 months since the operation and dont expect to be back to normal in terms of gym/sport for another 4 months (i was advised to leave it for 6 months).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor anyone considering the surgery I would say 10000% to get it done if you find a surgeon who knows what they are doing and is confident with the job. It has changed how I feel about my body tremendously and it is amazing to think of all the time I wasted hating the appearance when it can be rectified. The pain is bad but it gets better every day and it will eventually subside. For me I felt that without the surgery I would never be happy with my body but since surgery have gone on holiday and have no issues taking my top off etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif you have any questions please ask id be happy to help.", "Barrel chest Has any body here who suffers of barrel shaped chest(not PC) gotten any kind of surgery to fix this ?\nDoes anybody knows sth about it?

Some people do not care if they gain a little fat and would prefer that to being skinny. Fat converts easier to muscle than nothing at all. Most skinny guys never gain because the irrational fear of gaining fat One product based diets are never good anyways. You will never gain mass without getting a little bit of fat, but only milk is not going to build your muscles the way you want.

When I was 16 I bought myself the Tru-Life Pectus Carinatum brace online to try and correct my chest- but the brace did not fit well and hurt extremely badly. The brace was definetly not right and I should have gotten a custom one instead somewhere. I gave up and decided to live with my chest, and now I am almost 19. I thought I missed the boat of braces because my bones are all solid now, however I have read that pectus carinatum braces work even in adults- which makes sense because of you apply pressure for a long enough time to a bone why would not it eventually bend, especially the flexible chest bones. My Pectus Carinatum Is more than just cosmetic, it makes me feel weird and sometimes causes cramps and I cannot lay on my side without it hurting- I just really have an urge to apply pressure to it. So I have decided now that I want a brace, but I have no idea where to get custom fitted? Any Help? Thanks. I remember when the cartilage was super bendy when I was 12, but my 'not-so-great' doctor said the only way to fix it would be surgery since it was 'so big' and did not say anything about a brace- my pectus carinatum is not even that big it is just very annoying. I would recommend going to your local doctor that you usually go to. Ask them about getting a brace and he might give you a number for another doctor who specializes in Pectus C. That is what I did but I got a couple appointments and come back every 3 or 4 months to check my progress. I do not know if you are able to still wear one due to age but try your best because this a tough problem that sucks for most of us. Where do you live? I was about in your boat and my doctor told me the same thing when I was like 15.  After fighting insurance for years to get them to approve the $100k or however much surgery, when I went to see the Nuss procedure guy (for excavatum) himself, I ended up meeting a different doctor in his practice who was piloting a new brace program. I could not have been happier with the results. \n\nI lived on the east coast and that hospital was Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters. I drove a couple hundred miles just to go every time. I believe some people even flew there. Here is a (  to their practice, but if you are not on the east coast I am sure there is somewhere else now that uses these same braces. I also think you might be too old, it will be extremely painful if it is still possible, but definitely go to one of the hospitals that has these braces and get an opinion I thought I was too old for a brace, but in looking at research online it appears that adults can be braced with success- it is just harder than for a child who still has cartilage there. Where do you live? My brace is made by T-Joe Pectus Services, try to look him up and see if he is in your place too. He travels a lot.

( to the original post also I never tried a brace I do not see anything too wrong with your chest, exercising will cover it up even more if you continue training, however you posture could use some fixing.

You seem quite young so I am sure you will pull it off, just do not give up. thanks bro, and I am 15 so I still have time Can definitely see some muscle development, especially on your back lol. Not sure if that is exactly what your looking for though. btw If your doing workouts at home I got a pretty solid routine, that covers all the bases if you want. Other than that I would suggest you try and fix your posture. Your head is tilted a forward, and your shoulders are a little slouched. There are some stretches you can do that help to fix that. Just look up athlene x on youtube, he is got some good information on fitness in general. And oh, the last thing. TRY NOT TO SLEEP ON YOUR SIDE. That is the one thing that can make it from bad to worse. If anything try sleep on your chest, with something pushing up against it, to kind of hold it in. That is what I did after my bracing and it worked. It kept my chest in throughout the night, and even throughout the whole day. Did not even need to wear a brace at that point. Anyways even if you do not do all that just keep exercising. You have gained a decent amount of muscle in just the few months you have been working out.

But I am still happy with it the only thing I am disappointed with is that I thought I would fully recover in like 2 months but they did not tell me until after the surgery it is kind of depressing man but 6 months I have to go without lifting things so I would recommend doing the surgery young so you have someone to help you do things Thanks for the question man simply to be honest I fully regret the surgery I would rather live with pectus carinatum then not be able to lift quote on quote heavy things for six months I think you mean Ravitch procedure? If so, recovery will not take 6 months\u2026 I also had the Ravitch last year March. You just said above you are happy with it but here you say you regret it? Which one is it? How painful was it, any before pics? Was bracing not an option? My 16 year old son refuses to wear his brace. I am afraid surgery is our only option at this point. I stopped bracing because the pain was worse from the brace then pectus itself so yeah the only option after that is surgery my mom was afraid of it but I was fine with it the surgery is very painful though and you cannot do normal things like lift things and twist your body for 6 months I would discuss it with him before I would have it I am happy with the results not the consequences of the surgery I do not have any before pics but the doctors said it was severe I too am having a really hard time with my brace. Was your surgery covered? I have developed severe insecurity as a women with this ): I also refused to wear my brace in my teens (it is a ton of social pressure to wear something that makes you look different and messes with a teenage boys already extra fragile self confidence especially about their chest). I never did end up wearing it and have never chosen to go after surgery even though I thankfully have the resources to, it is something that can be lived with and I have had a healthy life with many good, loving relationships. That being said my chest has caused me progressively more physical pain the older I have gotten so that is something for your kid to consider. I am 21 now and I can completely understand why your son does not want to wear his brace, high school is hard enough without slapping a big question mark on your chest, I can also imagine how frustrating this is for parents. Usually neither of the parents have Pectus Carinatum so it is easy to feel alone and and not understood for the child who has it, but I can say that my dad talking to me honestly and not shying away from the topic of my chest and always reassuring me with things like \u201cthere is nothing wrong with you\u201d and \u201cnobody is going to care about your chest so just be yourself\u201d helped me more than anything I have ever heard from a doctor about this condition. Sorry for such a long response I just remember doing this exact same thing when I was a teenage boy because I was too embarrassed to wear my brace to school and also because it was pretty physically uncomfortable, I am sure your son feels some of the same pressures. Do not be afraid to tell him that he is okay the way he is and that it is his choice at the end of the day, that is what I always needed to hear.", "Follow up post I had my doctor appointment and looks like I am getting my brace!!!!! Nice that is great hope it goes well, will be tough but sure you can do it. Do you know what brace it is ? No not yet, I am receiving the brace on the 25th Cool not to long to go then! Did they measure your chess and everything? She did not measure but she did feel my chest and then took me in for X-rays Yay Let us go! Now prepare mentaly for the trearment, it will be hard, but I promise it will be worth it. Just be strong, you got this far, and I believe you can get to the end. I am thinking about getting a brace, what exactly is hard about it. Is it painful? Uncomfortable as hell, hard to sleep with it, if you are not careful pressure can break your skin on the back or on the chest so that makes things painful. mannnn i got to sleep with it on too? I am just afraid it will hurt man. Like i can push it in but i feel like if it is like that all the time it will start to hurt Depends on yout treatment, follow your doctor's advices. If you gave to wear it sleeping, you just have to do it...", "PC ruined my life I have PC &amp; this shit makes me want to kill myself. People tell me to get help like there is even an option. I have tried many times doctors are useless. Had I been given a brace at a young age id be ok but they said I will be fine IM NOT. I fuckin hate this shit with all my life. I do not go outside I hate Sitting I hate standing I hate laying down. My spine is fucked now too. I am 21 &amp; I give up. I am praying for everyone else who has it. Good luck.  There is always an option. I was fortunate enough to be able to get a brace at a younger age. I recall when I was deep in depression about it that I found this one guy on YouTube who worked out so much you really could not tell he had it that much. It was really inspiring and I always thought that would be an option if I could not get surgery or a brace.\n\nI suppose this is a start:\n\n\n\n\nI would figure with how much it sucks and you hate it that it would be enough motivation to go get ripped. It takes a lot of motivation honestly and you do not see results for a long time (months for little progress, over a year). But it could definitely be a great start. There is a ton of info on r/fitness about how to diet and count macros for lifting.  Bless you homie.  Thank u  &gt; bless you nigga.  thank u \n\n\nFixed the comment. I felt pretty bad about mine too when I was around your age. I am 28 now and rarely think about it. I never had a brace or surgery. I would recommend the same as the other guy: get in shape. Even if it does not help cover it up it will help you feel better about yourself and your body. If you are spine is indeed fucked it is probably best to talk to a medical professional first, but I am sure there is plenty you can do.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt sucks I know.

Nah its not going to happen it will only get worse with age. Brace or surgery are the only options Hate to burst your bubble \n\nbut no Nope. Itl get worse. Not serious or dangerous.\nJust will look worse and only treatment is brace ir surgery. Building chest muscles hide it buy wont cure or fix it.  but you would need a big effort.

Now in my late 50s the Pectus is greatly reduced I do have a bit of rib cage sticking out on one side and I have continuing bouts of precordial catch Do you wish you could of braced or was it not a big hindrance I was really embarrassed and I hated it when I was younger but I mean I am over it now I cannot describe exactly when it became not as important to me but that is what eventually happened I am 29, I have put on a little weight since my teenage years (like 1.5 stone) and although I kind of of notice it still because I know it is there, I can say Its less noticeable.\n\nI used to avoid having my shirt off around people/girls and kind of bit the bullet with my last girlfriend as I moved in with her (kind of unavoidable), I lied and made up a tall story about being in a car crash so my chest sticks out a bit in the middle, showed her and she was like \"I do not see anything...\"\n\nSince then I have been with a few more women, never mentioned it and they have never mentioned it, so I guess in my case yeh, also as i_never_learn mentioned, you kind of just stop caring over time, it does not bother you and if it bothers someone else, move on with your life yknow?\n\nI did not have the option for a brace when I was younger but did go in to see some specialists in London about surgery a few times, the thought of the pain and recovery process put me off of it and I regretted not doing it for a few years, but now I am really glad I did not.\n\nNothing anyone says to you will make you feel better about it, but please set a reminder on your phone, pop back to this post in 10 years and let us know how your thoughts have changed no matter what you do, because I am sure they will change.", "Pectus Brace makes my back go numb??

Enter your age below \n\n(", "AMA: 25M, UK citizen with PC. I tried the T Joe brace through the NHS earlier this year but stopped due to pain and no improvement. Had the Ravitch procedure to improve it 1 week ago at St Bartholomew's, London. Ask me anything  \nWas your PC symmetric or asymmetric? Mild, moderate or severe?\n\nHow did the cosmetic result turn out?\n\nDo you have any internal bars or plates?  \n\nHow long did the surgery take?\n\nWhat is the pain level right now? 1. Symmetric and moderate\n2. There is still some swelling around the area so I need to wait and see. I am not convinced on current appearance though as there is still a protrusion but it is smoother. I will update when it is subsided. \n3. No bars or plates, the surgeon filed most of the protrusions away and removed some cartilidges, though there is an option to go for surgery again to get plates to try for a better result.\n4. Around an hour I think\n5. Surprisingly had very little pain, despite being warned it would be bad Regarding the t joe brace, how old were you when you got the brace? \nHow long did you wear the brace and how long did it take for you to get pain? \nHow flexible was your chest upon doing brace treatment? \nDid you wear the brace fully 23 ish hours as scheduled? Any other factors that contributed to no improvement? \nDid you try to work with Joe to improve your pain? Also can you describe the pain specifically? Was Joe responsive and helpful to you when you tried to contact him?\n\nI am also 25, with moderate asymmetric PC and talked to him last week about the brace. I found him to be EXTREMELY sales-ey but the guy definitely has a ton of experience and told me I am a \u201cgreat candidate\u201d and could probably get up to 80% reduction. I would like to believe this but I do not know how much of it is him just trying to push his brace on me. No pun intended... I have quite a lot of flexibility still at my age though so it may indeed work. I did not get his brace yet, but I talked to so many of his patients and fornonly one pf them it did not work. I will get my in February, I think it is worth to try as he is one of the few who works with adults. Yeah for sure I may end up doing that. I am going to see a surgeon who does reverse Nuss tomorrow and see what he has to say and will then weigh my options Apologies for my delayed response.\n\nI was 24. I wore it for 2 months, the pain was immediately there because Joe \"massaged\" the carinatum down as low as it could go into the ribcage then they apply the brace to keep it in place. My chest was constantly pushing back out as soon as it went on. The internal pain was really bad for about a week then it subsided and was fine and didnt come back/I got used to it. The first pain after application of the brace was an internal throbbing pain - very difficult to put into words to be honest. I did get some sleep in the first few days but was quite exhausting. Prepare yourself to be bedbound for a few days if you go for it. Then a bad skin pain came when the pressure sore that developed since application started to really get bad about 6 weeks in. Having a pressure sore was a very unusual occurence I think as I did not get much information or help from Joe or his team about this. I took it off after 8 weeks because theres no way the sore could have healed with the pressure, combined with it not working anyway.\n\nMy carinatum was pretty flexible, It went down probably about 2 inches with some pressure and the brace held it in place. I wore it for 23hrs 45mins every day for first 6 weeks. I was told that I should tighten the brace when at night from lying down, I did not do this as well as I perhaps should have done due to the pain which meant the carinatum could push out a bit. But after talking with joe at the end of this it this he said it wasnt a big issue and it should still have worked. I had a few skype calls with Joe, he would always make himself available for a video call on Sundays but the pressure sore pain I had, he clearly had insufficient medical knowledge to help me with that as he said apply a bit of sudocream which did nothing to help. \n\nYes he is salesy as it is his company but I was advised by the Consultant Cardiothoracic Surgeon (Kolvekar) in the NHS, as well as Joe's UK based colleague (Gordon wright - very genuine honest guy) that I might get good results as well. I suggest you really push them to say how effective bracing is for people in their 20s. I imagine the success is fairly limited.\n\nI wanted surgery instead of brace but the advice from my parents and the surgeon was that I should try the brace first then explore surgical options.\n\nHope that covered everything, if you have anymore questions please ask away. Super helpful response , thank you!!\n\nSome follow up questions if you do not mind: \n\n\nIs the internal pain you experienced something that he said is common with his patients? I read somewhere else that it hurts so bring like Advil or whatever .\n\n\nYou mention pressure sore and skin pain - can you describe these in more detail, like what did you feel exactly? Did you have any bruising or permanent changes to your skin? \n\n\nDid you notice any improvement at all after you took the brace off? Like even a cm or two?\n\n\nIn terms of wearing the actual brace, what was your experience like? As a 24 year old like were you working full time or in school? I will be working a 9-5 job with the brace on so it would be a bit embarrassing, but I would just have to tell my boss. How did you deal with this aspect? Was the brace big and noticeable? \n\n\nDid you have any issues with slippage of the brace or comfort, besides your pain? \n\n\nDid you ever have experience with going through an airport with the brace on? Do you know if agents would ask you to take the brace off or is it ok to keep it on as you scan through check in?  Like the last thing I would want is to fly home with my new brace and the agents make me take the brace off when I am not supposed to. \n\n\nWhat were the exercise limitations you had with the brace, or the things Joe said you could not do? Can you still lift weights? Should you avoid building chest muscles? Can you run with the brace on? How about stretching? \n\n\nAny particular exercises he recommended as part of the bracing program to beat the pectus? \n\n\nAlso how long did he tell you you would have to wear the brace in order for it to fully correct? Like did he say 6 months and then wean off, or 1 year then wean off, or even more? He told me in total it could take up to 2 years. \n\n\nDid you have any trouble with your social or personal life living with the brace on? Like did you find yourself not wanting to go to parties or hang outs or anything like that? \n\nSorry for so many questions!! I am seriously considering t joe brace at this point so want to get as much info as possible. Internal pain is very common. Basically the pressure sore was a yellowy ring of inflamation around the highest point in the carinatum, it was oozing with gross stuff for most of the 8 weeks I think. Up to 6 weeks in or so it was bearable and just uncomfortable as I was shifting about but after that 6 weeks or so when it suddenly became a lot worse it was really horrible. I did have a scar of hardened skin around it when it healed. \n\nI would notice it would pop out maybe 50% of the way when I took it off for 15 mins after the first week. But when I could take it off for 2 hours (as part of the weening off phase) it was back out to near enough where it was before the whole brace programme by the end of the 2 hours. That was really demoralising.\n\nI was full time in an office in central london and work were nice enough to allow me to work at home for the first 2 weeks. When I was back I told my boss about it and that I would be wearing t shirts and hoodies from then on and they were okay with that. I wore black t shirts to do my best to hide  it. No one really remarked on it without me telling them though.\n\nNo slippage because the carinatum was constantly pushing out so it held it in place. But if it is successful I think slippage is common. It was uncomfortable as I couldnt really lie back or lie down properly for weeks as the back pad pushed into the middle of my spin quite uncomfortably.\n\nI didnt go through an airport but they give you a letter to present to airport authorities to explain what is happening. I think you can lift weights but I didnt during my use. I avoided exercise as the huffing and puffing would have been uncomfortable for me. I think sweating is not good for the fabric over the brace because sweat/wetness of the fabric will make it really uncomfortable.\n\nTotal brace wearing programme was supposed to be 9 months or so I think, they give you a chart to help you with the dates. But by the 6th month I think you only need to wear it for a few hours a day or so, so if you can get past even 4 or 5 months you wont have to wear it very much in the day. the last few months are wearing it only at night. In fact I was told that pretty much all the success of the brace comes in the first week or 2 and the rest is about training your chest to stay where it is without the brace. Therefore if you are a few weeks in and youre finding no slippage or it is pusing out quite a bit still then it probably hasnt worked.\n\nI am not a very sociable person so parties arent really my scene, but it didnt stop me visiting close friends who I could explain before hand. If you have a bit of confidence about your position there is no reason why this should hold back on your social life! \n\nNo problem, happy to help! I hope the brace can work out for you. I do not like being negative about something that can work in theory but I am being totally honest with everything I have explained. While it didnt work for me maybe it can for you! Had an Ravitch procedure yesterday and was reading this previous post. How are you at the moment? Satisfied with the result or did you get the extra surgery? And how long did the recovery take? 24 and had the same issue as you lasted 2 weeks the pain was unreal and got a pressure ulcer so I have had no choice but to take it off so gutted. How have you found the surgery option, mind me asking the cost ? Sorry to hear that. Surgery was successful but the surgeon was cautious so it is still there but less protruding. I had the operation for free on the NHS. What are your options? Glad your surgery was successful, are you glad you had it done in the end ? Which surgeon did it for you ? I am not too sure what I am going to do atm I do not think the surgery is available for free anymore.\n\nI am going to see if my scar tissue heals up but I really do not think it will it sounds a lot like your story. The advise from them to keep the brace on and apply sudocream had only made the situation worse, I cannot fault the brace but annoyed with the health advice this could have prevented early. Who did you get the brace with? Hi, sorry late to this thread . Hoping you are still responding to questions.\nHow is your chest now after this time after the surgery? Has it reduced in size at all?\nI am 26 almost 27 and wondering whether this is a treatment I should go for. Any advice on whether you think it is worth it would be a great help. I have quite severe PC with the right side sticking out much further than the left. Thank you No not reduced much to be honest. Well I am lucky to have been able to get the surgery totally free on the NHS. So obviously any improvement was worth it for me. I would definitely have a chat with your doctor about how invasive he/she is prepared to go. I did not and my doctor took the decision to be minimally invasive. Which ensured easy and painless recovery but a modest 50% improvement. If you have a good chance to get a full improvement then I say absolutely go for it", "too late for brace? I am 16 and I am turning 17 this year, do you think it is too late for a brace?\nidk if I am still growing, I will maybe grow for 5cm more at maximum\nbtw, can you workout with a brace?\nthanks I started bracing when I was 18 years and 2 months old. It is very possible that you are not late, but I cannot gurantee anything. I think you should try it.\n\nWorking out with a brace is very hard and uncomfortable. I think it is borderline impossible. You will have parts of the day when you can take it off though so use those hours for working out. You are absolutely not too old. I am 26 bracing and it is working. All depends on chest wall flexibility, period. Yes you can work out in it, it may be hard and uncomfortable but it is def possible and many people recommend it Thanks!   ", "Any advice for females? I am 14F and skinny, so I am pretty sure it is noticeable and advice about that? If you are skinny gain then gain some weight, eat food and hit the gym. But you are a teenage girl so you are probably not as skinny as you think, you are probably just overly critical of yourself because you are in your teenage years when most people are very self-conscious about their body.\n\nYou need to ask yourself, are you bothered about yourself personally or are you bothered about how people perceive you? You are PC probably isnt as bad as you think, our minds over-analyse everything to the extreme. Just focus on yourself and gain some confidence. Surgery is always an option if you want. \n\nFor me I have a noticeable case, its not too extreme but its not exactly unnoticeable. I took up bodybuilding to help cover it up, what i have learned a long the way is that what truly matters is your confidence, dont let it bother you. You have one life, just live it to the extreme. But as you said you are 14 years old so you got a lot of time left to grow as a person, eventually it will stop bothering you like it did to me. \n\nIm 18 now and if i could say anything to my 14 year old self it would be \"dont sweat it, just live your life\". \n\nHave a good life bro Thanks :) I was a ridiculously skinny teenager that loved wearing tight shirts which was dumb because everyone noticed my chest. My bump is small but it took a long time for my boobs to outgrow it. Honestly as I got older and gained more weight and somewhat larger breasts it got way less noticable. It is not a big deal to me anymore so do not worry to much about it. Try to gain more weight but know that that will come easier with time lol. This advice is trash never get surgery Just get a brace surgery will remove a ton of your rib Cage", "Any adult women with severe PC and bigger boobs to cover it? I have noticed most of the people here are men with more mild PC. I am a 22F with severe asymmetrical PC. It used to not bother me, but as I got older it got worse and really took a toll on my mental health/body image. \n\nI have average boobs that are asymmetrical to begin with too, but my PC pushes the already bigger one out to make it look even bigger. I cannot wear the clothes I want to or go swimming or to the beach because I hate my body. \n\nBut I realized if I wear bras with a lot more padding, it makes my chest look slightly normal (at least with clothes that cover my chest). \n\nSo to the women out there with severe PC and big boobs: do your boobs help cover it up? If so, would you recommend a boob job? I have not seen enough on PC\u2019s surgical methods to convince me to get it. I am still very wary. I want to fix my severe PC in the least invasive way possible. I would not call my PC severe but I do still relate. I am always wearing a push-up to help hid my PC. I hate going braless around my home even by myself because it can remind me how much I hate my body. I would not think a boob job as a solution compared to options to get rid of PC though. But honestly I am not completely sure what options there are. I am a 23F with PC. However I have small boobs, it is really noticeable that I have PC when I am not wearing a bra because it makes me look weirdly even more flat chested (or like I have 3 boobs lol)\n\nWhen I was younger (I believe around 13-14 years old) I went to a few doctors to see what I could do about my PC but it seems that in my country they have very limited knowledge about it, they did not know anything about special braces.\n\nOne of the doctors told me that the only way to get it fixed was to get breast surgery, to have big boobs \"to cover it\"... he said that to a 13 YO! That was messed up. \n\nYour post reminded me about it and made me think that it would not make sense that bigger boobs would cover severe PC without making it look weird, at least in my opinion. Hopefully someone will be able to tell a successful story about it. I (25F) have a similar situation, although I have already had intensive back surgery due to a deformation, so am more resistant to the idea of surgery/bracing (post surgery complications and pain have not encouraged me to go for another intensive surgery lol). Unfortunately as women we have been taught to hate our bodies so I am not sure that hiding or getting surgery to get rid of the PC will result in a positive body image :( it is a strange bunch of feelings to understand though, as I and other women with PC have expressed feeling less of a woman with the difference in structure. Personally, the work I have been trying to do is wear bras with little to no padding and try my best to love my body as it is (I used to only wear pushup bras even when I was alone - could not handle the uni boob feeling lol). Fully understand the difficulty in finding bathingsuits/clothes/bras that I feel confident and comfortable in though.  Still not there in terms of loving and appreciating my body but I do wish that there were more women talking about their experiences! So thank you so much for sharing. In terms of getting a boob job/PC definately do whatever will help you feel most confident with your PC (within your budget haha - appreciating your body can increase tremendously with just a few dance classes or something else you might be interested in!) go for it!

I will definitely post more updates over time :) Great results well done \ud83d\ude00 Can you show a side angle? Did you have a particular workout plan or focus? What exercises have been the most effective? Cannot even tell you have PC in the most recent pic. Thanks man, I followed a 5 day rotating PPL routine. The most effective exercises were definitely the main compound lifts that you should do at the beginning of your workouts (bench press, OHP, bent over rows, deadlifts and squats). After those it is up to you for what accessory lifts you want to do, just make sure you really focus on working the muscle you want to work meaning have good form over heavy weight. My favourite accessory lifts are skulls crushers, lat pulldowns and Arnold presses. \nFor my diet at first I just tried to eat as much as I could and often as I could. I rarely eat and junk food or fast food so it is mostly healthier foods in my diet. I also try to consumer a lot of protein throughout the day, protein smoothies really help with that! Thank you! \n\nCould not really found a good before picture but found once close enough. In the most recent pic I am not flexing, when I flex now from a side angle you can hardly notice my PC looks amazing! thanks. Nice job man! hello man can you told me how you fill abs and how you fix ribs going in V The V will come from Lat exercises and routine ab workouts", "Pectus Carinatum Discord I created a discord focused on PC. The server can function as a place for all of us to get advice, support or just hang out with other people dealing with PC.

Yeah probably your pectus is not that bad just give the brace a try If you braced, I would imagine you would have good results and not need it for as long as most. It is very mild, and with some chest exercise, it would be super hard to tell you have!  \n\n\nGood luck. I would brace if it bothers you.

How much will it be and how long am going to wear it. I am 20 years old is it even a good idea to try the brace. \n\nRecently i have talked with a doctor and she told me the brace cost is 250$ which is weird because i have seen the cost in many places and it was at least 2000$. \n\nSo what do you recommend me guys thank you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb 250$ isnt a lot of money. Give it a try. There have been 25 year olds who have been able to fix their PC with brace. At the same time, there has been 15 year olds who havent been able to fix it due to their chest not being flexible enough. Either way give it a try! Thank you \ud83e\udd0dSURE!

Unfortunately no I do not know the brand. But i am going to visit the hospital soon to get informed about everything. Are there good brands? And how much they usually cost?

I grew up with some mild pectus carinatum. I was referred to as pigeons chest growing up, girls and friends would accidentally touch my chest and make weird disgusted noises. \n\nI was a skinny nerd with a fucked up chest\n\nThe day that absolutely shattered me was when I was 12 or 13, I went to my doctor and they said my chest would never be fixed, and i would have to lift weights for maybe 20 years to even cover it up.\n\nTime to face the facts, you have an ugly chest, girls dont want to see it, you do not want to see it.\n\nTime to man up and be motivated. My LITERAL safe haven was when I started lifting weights when I was 16.  \n\nTake this deformation you have as a seed of motivation.\n\nThe best advice I can literally give you now, I am 21 years old and have practically forgotten that I even have a pigeons chest, I have friends that beg me for workout advice, girls that love to see me shirtless. \n\nStart lifting weights CONSISTENTLY and EAT FOOD.\n\nEat like a savage, lift weights like a savage. \n\nCreate a routine, gym takes up 1-2 hours of your day.\n\nMainly bench press and abs. \n\nI promise you, you will put on size and shape over that chest and you will fucking love yourself. \n\nTake supplements like creatine monohydrate and drink a gallon of water a day, you will put on size and power much quicker, do not listen to anyones opinions, do you. I would also recommend to start taking martial arts for confidence, you will meet cool people, learn self defense, get in shape and will thank yourself when youre older and someone tries to mess with you.\n\nStart with brazilian jui jitsu and muay thai/kick boxing. \n\nThank me later Dope motivational post man. Was/ Is your PC symmetric it asymmetric? \nFrom the pics I cannot really see it at all. I feel symmetric PC can be almost perfectly concealed with body building. Asymmetric however not so sure, as body building might just accentuate the imbalance. Not dogging the efficacy of body building if you have asymm PC tho. I think it is super necessary regardless of what you got, and personally plan to hit that shit heavy later this year. \n\nPersonally going to get a brace to fix mine since it is asymmetric but going to do serious workout regimen simultaneously.\n\nAny reason you never went the bracing route? i have it mild and asymmetric so i went to the doctors today and they could not do anything about it. the doctor did recommend doing exercise which would apparently pretty much hide the problem. so i guess body building works with both asymmetric and symmetric or tie carinatum. I am abit asymmetrical towards the right side, I find myself pushing it downwards often.\n\nI never went the brace route because 1. I live in California, back when I was 13-14 the only braces for PC I could find were in New Jersey and it was expensive for my family.\n\n2nd I also read you cannot use a brace when you are past 16 so I just gave up on the idea of wearing a brace all day and took a different route. \n\nAs far as working out to cover it, from what i have seen, almost every PC guy is skinny, so not only is it working out to have a nice shape but eating a crazy diet to build that mass is crucial You are an inspiration brother. Mine was cause by a tumor expanding in my chest when I was 10. I just recently started pushing hard to cover it. I do not have a gym available so I am hoping some p90x3 and calisthenics can fix me Keep at it.. it is not going to be over night but this is super necessary to getting your confidence back. I wish you the best on your health as well. wow man im going to a swimming place idk what its called but its with my class... its going to be a huge step... thaanks for the SAVAGE motivation man i have already been doing alot of pushups and my chest muscles is starting to cover it... man love you fr! U really changed my life with that comment btw im 15! Glad to hear man. Start watching skinny to big motivational videos on Youtube and ectomorph workout routines, take creatine monohydrate, drink a shit ton of water, eat alot of protein and calories, you will look like a beast is there some way i can keep contact with you? that will motivate me frfr You can direct message me on here ok mate thx! You can get a good work out done in 20 minutes if you know what you are doing 1-2 hours it is time wasting bs unless you are going for something specific You definitely can use a brace pat the age of 16, how old are you now?", "20, f, my chest looks to mildly have pigeon chest? Hi all! I have not been officially diagnosed but I believe that I may have mild/moderate pigeon chest (as it clearly juts out a bit above my breasts and I have always had a handful of the symptoms but attributed them to anxiety). Is this something I should have checked out by a doctor? I experience mild pain from time to time, but nothing that is impossible to manage at this point. Does anyone else feel a soreness from time to time in that area? I am really new to learning about this whole thing so just trying to soak it all in, any and all advice is graciously welcomed. You should visit a doctor especially because of that pain. Pectus Carinatum usually does not cause pain. It is usually a cosmetic problem that causes some mental issues as well. You will probably have a hard time trying to find someone who is experienced in chest deformities so try to get multiple opinions. Make a post and ask if there are some good doctors in your area.\n\nThere are way to fix pectus. The safer way is a brace, but the chance of it working gets smaller as you grow older. It is possible that ypu can still do it at 20, but I cannot gurantee. Try to push your chest down, if ypu can, your flexibility is good and the brace probably can work. I had great results from a brace treatment and I started it at 18 years and 2 months old. If you are interested in more information, feel free to DM me. \n\nThe oher option is surgery, but I am sure you can imagine how agressive it is and that you should always try alternatives before surgery. Hello,\n\nI can say when my pectus was bad. I didnt get pains. It was hard to breathe.\n\nIts uncommon to get pains. I guess it would not be bad since it is a deformity but these pains are not really common.\n\nYou should just get checked out by a doctor to rule out anything else causing pains. Perhaps they could send you for scans to check you and even to check how bad the carinatum is. But you can mention pectus. But normal doctors dont know really anything about the deformity. Best to go to a proper pectus specialist.\n\nDw, carinatum can be fixed by bracing or surgery and isnt dangerous. Just we all find it embarrassing and I have anxiety over anything. New moles. My health in general. I always worry I have conditions. And my best advice is to stay positive as this can easy be fixed\n \nHope that helped.\n\nRegards, OLI Hi! I appreciate your thorough response. When you say mental issues though, what do you mean by that?\n\nI think I will likely have it checked out as soon as I can, though I know not too much can be done for it so I am not necessarily in a rush. It is not necessarily pains, I mean I suppose it is, but maybe just more of a sore feeling in the upper sternum area? Haha idk. I appreciate the response and will look into a specialist in my area. Thank you :) I maybe did not pick the best words, but I meant on: low self esteem, bad self picture and even depression. I definatelly had problems with self esteem and body picture. A good ammount of my day would be me thinking about my chest. Oooh okay, I was a bit confused for a moment but that does make sense. I am sorry to hear that you have had to deal with self-esteem issues in the past because of this, but I hope with time, and with bracing, you have learned to embrace it/yourself more. Oh, I am feeling great now. Now I can see all of my qualities. Turns out that I am an attractive guy, but I could not see that because of my chest. I am glad that I got rid of it. Well that is great to hear, I am glad you are doing so much better! :) Upper  sternum is most likely due to pectus. Its different for everyone. So yeah get a specialist and good luck.", "Does having Pc make you not gain weight? Does having pc make you not gain weight like a skinny person without it? No impact at all. I have been fat with PC, I have been skinny with PC. Only difference is how visable it is. No, but people who notice it are usually skinny and they notice it, well because they are skinny.", "I think I have pectus carinatum and I was wondering whether getting a brace would be worth it? I struggle with being confident as a result of it. I am currently 16, any help or advice would be amazing   Perhaps a minor case? I mean your sternum looks a bit suspect but it does not protrude at all really, so I am not sure how much good a brace would do ya.", "Pectus carinatum or not? Is this pectus carinatum? \n\n  \n\nLet me know! more angles, less arrows That looks like it might not be a bone. Def not the sternum. I am not a doctor. It is sticking out. Cannot you see the bone? You can definitely see the bone on the right that is sticking out. could i see the other side? Yes it is For real? Yes you do. Its quite hard to see. But from the photo. You have lot sticking out. Best solution is a brace. If you are r 17 or over. bracing may not work or could take ages depending on how flexible your chest is.\n\nUnfortunately you may have to pay quite alot\n\nIr work on building up your chest to mask it. It winter fix it. Just hides it. But..you would have to maintain it...yeah no.\n\nNever get an brace online. It is quite harmful. A specialist would measure your chest to ensure you get correct positions. Unfortunately again specialist braces are expensive but it is the only way forward Man why does everything have to be so expensive. Now that killed my motivation to fix my pc. I agree with you. They make it expensive as its classed as not serious enough and more for looks. But the real story is. Pectus is quite bad and can get worse and can get cause breathing issues. Bracing should really be atleast cheaper.\n\nEven the surgery is expensive It does look like a rib from what I can see. ( I was previously under the impression that PC had to include the sternum. I was wrong. )", "Discord for anyone with PC (", "which pectus ?  Carinatum Which surgery do you think should I prefer I do not know that, I never had one, but if you are under 20 years old you should see if a brace can help you. I am 20 years old I mean, you should always consult with a doctor about it. But, do not be disappointed if it will not work. I do not know much about surgeries, but hopefully someone else does. u/SindraGan2001 is right. Talk to a doctor about it. Braces are less risky than surgery so if it can wokr for u then go for it", "Any female PC people here? ", "Uncomfortable feeling in chest with doing a deep nose breathe?

Boreness-level is 7 out of 10. Spend the day with listening to books, watching Netflix and soccer. Girlfriend came over for a few hours which was very nice. Had the chance to share some feelings. Laying down you have plenty of time to overthink things. The only thing that I regret right now is that I did not did this when I was younger. Missed many things and  dodged situations that I probably did not do if I had not had PC.\n\nBut above all recovery goes well and I am feeling great considering the circumstances. \n\nOh, still did not have the chance to see my chest. Hopefully tomorrow! Good stuff man keep going strong", "Successfully hid PC in 8 months. I have had a relatively minor case compared to many I have seen, but it seemed like I was asked about it every day in high school, and I am finally at a point where I could not show people if I tried. Just needed 25 pounds of muscle.  Your self confidence must be through the roof now. Congratulations!\n\nThere is one thing I would like to ask you though. Can you stay in this sub and try to help people? I successfully braced my Pectus, but I am still here to help people around the brace and exercising. You can help people with exercising. Of course, you do not have to do it, but it would be nice because there is not much information about PC so someone who is experienced with this stuff can help a lot. I cannot even describe the confidence boost, like I have finally ditched a massive weight that is been dragging me down all of my life. And yes, I would love to help out. PC seems to be a good bit more rare than PE, therefore the resources are fewer. I already had one gentleman message me about it, and I was surprised to see my reply quickly turn into a 500 word essay lol. If I can help a single person feel what I feel now, well that is a life worth living. I have talked to probably 20 people already. Looking back at how I got my brace in a foreign country and found all the information all by myself, it was very hard and I would have liked if someone could have guided me. The essay part is relatable lol. I live in a pretty small town, and I got this diagnosed at like 14 (I am 27 now). I could tell they were not super familiar with actually seeing a case in person, and at the time the only option presented to me was surgery. Hearing what that entailed, and my case being as minor as it was, that did not seem like the route for me. I did not find out about the brace until I was too old for it to be effective, unfortunately. I never dreamed of the psychological impact it would have on me in high school, just waiting on someone to ask, watching their eyes keep refocusing on it, it honestly would have been better if I just made a public announcement and got it over with lol. Oddly enough though in my adult life, nobody ever asked, either because it became less noticeable, or people just did not care. I never forgot it was there though, and would wear all kinds of baggy clothes which only made my small frame look smaller. It is so nice to be able to enjoy the summer shirtless with no worries. I wear the tightest shirts I can find to the gym, because while I will always have this condition, it does not have me anymore. Same story with doctors. I was oferred nothing but surgery when I was diagnosed with 13 years of age. Just before I turned 18, I found out abkut the brace on the Internet. I searched for one in my country, Serbia, with no success. Then I realised I will have to travel to abother country. I was ready to go to USA or UK and I contaced a an American doctor who is very successful in treating Pectus Carinatum. A lot of people on social media were recommending him so I contaced him. What a man that doctor is! He talked to me on video calls and explained everything about bracing. I wanted to get an appointment and he even told me that he works in Poland which is much closer to Serbia than USA. I got there snd the rest is history \ud83d\ude42. Best money I have ever spent and one of the best guys I have ever met. I was into working out even before the brace, but I had to lose 10 kg to start bracing. Now I am going strong with my training again. 10.0 kg is 22.03 lbs Congratulatons, i also have pc and it bothers me a lot, i am worried because im starting highschool and afraid that my pc will get worse, here in sweden there is no bracing availeble so i want to start training to cover my pc up.\n\nI have tried but dont seem to gain any muscle, could you please give me some advice. Im 176 cm tal and weigh 65kg and 16 yeats old. Please i need help I am in a Pectus Carinatum Discord group and there is a guy who got a brace in Sweden. He had it shipped from the USA, but he did not have to pay anything. could you please ask him what brace it whas because i looked at a brace from alimed it it semed did not come to sweden I will try to connect you with him through Reddit. If nothing happens until tomorrow, please remind me. This dope as fuck \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe When it comes to gaining muscle, diet is going to be the biggest factor in your success, and also the hardest part. If you are not eating more calories than your body can burn, you cannot grow. You need about a gram of protein per pound of body weight which I believe is roughly 2.2 grams per kilogram per day. I would follow a bulking program online to start, follow it to the letter, and if you are unfamiliar with the movements, please enlist the help of a trainer or coach to show you the ropes. Lifting success comes down to technique, and if you are doing things the wrong way, it is very counterproductive. One thing I believe can help you immediately is the use of a supplement called creatine monohydrate. It is completely natural and found in your diet, but if you take 5 grams a day, everyday, in about a month it will be fully built up in your system and allow your muscles to pull in much more water, making you look bigger, and lift more, which translates to more gains. You need to drink at least a gallon of water anyway, but especially on creatine. It is also believed to be very good for the brain and fights off neurological disease. I appreciate that! Thank you very much i will follow the advice you have given me, i used to cary a bit of fat before but i recently cut heavily eating about 1400 caliries a day wich put of a bit of fat but didnt get me shredded wich i belived it would so now im just skinny fat with pc and i cant even look at myself in the mirror Congrats mate I appreciate that! Another thing I did not mention, is how it is not all entirely muscle that hides it. I think almost all of us end up with pretty bad posture, and within the first month I felt like I was standing up a lot straighter, which makes a world of difference. Pull-ups are your friend in this regard. do you still see it through clothes?  Not at all. I literally cannot even suck in my stomach and see it. I cannot see it if I tried. Hmm\u2026 I am 27, I have tried for most of my life to build chest to hide it, bench press, push ups, chest press, pretty much just have not tried dips \n\nUnfortunately it kind of just has the effect that I am all chest and no chest at the same time, idk if I just need to keep going? Definitely work dips in there. Incline press is huge too for upper chest, and you want to do weighted ab exercises to grow the upper ab muscles where they will be in line with the sternum. Also pull-ups for posture. do you still get a bit bummed out that PC means you have to work way harder on pecs for it to show? or do you think once you pass a certain point it really stops mattering?\n\nI have a decent amount of chest muscle but the sternum still sticks out further, so that is what you see through clothes... when u push the PC in you can see how it would all sit and that the PC basically pushes out the gap between them and stretches them forward and makes them look like they are not there... but at the same time in a baggy T-Shirt it kind of has this effect of like 'he could have pecs, but you cannot really see pecs just this weird round chest that sticks out, so maybe he is got man boobs or something'... all chest and no chest at the same time\n\nidk if this all sounds weird or makes sense\n\nEdit: upper chest might be part of my problem, unfortunately my PC starts pretty high up and I swear just like a few inches on that patch under a person's collarbone can change the way they look so much, most people have this nice flat bit between their shoulders idk In all honesty, with a shirt on I think my PC actually served to make me look bigger once I started building muscle around it. But yeah for the pecs to show we definitely have to put it more work, but it truly only took about 2 months before I started to forget the PC was there. no way that is real bro, yours feels a bit larger than mine but looks like it is completely gone in the second one 100% real, but I am flattered. You can still see the signs if you look hard enough. The ribs are still noticeably sunken under my pecs, but my sternum does not protrude anymore. Did you think the pectus carinatum contributed to poor posture before? I have really bad posture and I do not exercise much which probably contributes to it, but it seems like PC is a main factor. I am guessing building muscle also helps with that? Yeah most of us with PC end up with at least a slight case of scoliosis. When you build your lat muscles (upper back) with pull-ups, it automatically will have a corrective effect on your posture. The first thing anyone noticed before it was obvious I was lifting is that I seemed a little taller. How long did it take to gain 25 lbs of muscle. I have been working out as well. So far for about 6 months. I have gained about 20 pounds, most of it muscle, as my body fat is still around the same as when I started (around 10-11 percent. But after 6 months I only look slightly more muscular than when I started. Also how long did the abs take? I noticed that all my muscles are growing except my abs, as I am having to eat so much I pretty bloated all the time, I cannot really see them. For reference I started off at 140 lbs. I am now 163 at 6 foot 3 inches tall. Also, damn you look like a whole different person. This was at 8 months. 2 months later now and I am at 35 pounds total gained. It is just going to depend on genetics and your metabolism and diet as to how fast you put the weight on, as well as how it looks on you. As far as the abs, I have had them since puberty and never really had to maintain them because of my metabolism. It can be hard to focus on bulking and seeing your abs at the same time, so I would just focus on weighted abs exercises to grow the muscles themselves, as opposed to cutting the fat on top of it. 35 pounds is the same weight as 24.82 'Double sided 60 inch Mermaker Pepparoni Pizza Blankets'. Ive been doing weighted twisting sit ups every other day for abs and obliques. Are there any better excercises? Also does height make a difference in how slow you build muscle? Because I gained a good 20+lbs and I am still really skinny? It is barely noticeable. If you are taller, the weight is going to appear more spread out, so it will not look quite as dramatic as the same weight on someone shorter. It is still more about genetics in general how well your muscles will show. For abs, a wide variety of exercises is usually the best approach. Do a couple every day you work out then switch it up the next time. Hanging leg raises weighted crunches, planks, 6 inches, bicycle kicks are solid ab workouts. Pull-ups ups are great for the core and just muscle building and posture in general. Another thing worth mentioning is that my frame is as small as they come. My ankles and wrists are tiny, making any muscle I put on look that much more prominent. Yah, never really realized how important isolation exercises are. I started working out abs and back months after starting push-ups. Now my chest and arms are developed, and my back and abs are just soft. Gaining weight only makes the difference more noticeable. Appreciate the advice though helps out a lot.", "Chest rash I have gotten back into bracing for about two months now and I have gotten a rash and do not know how to deal with it, anyone have any recommendations?

Dont worry. Everything you have mentioned I had on the first week. Dont push yourself and dont be afraid to loosen. The pains will go. And yes the back I would a Nightmare. Make sure you constantly apply cream. Or if you was given extra padding. I suggest you use it.\n\nIt will gradually ease but slowly. Just be calm. Try bot to think about it. If you get rashes. Dont itch them  like I said they are also normal. Apply cream and they go. Thanks, rashes or itching havent been a problem so far, most of the pain is coming from my bones and \"organs\" i guess you can say, did you have any of that when you started? Not sure by organs. Just the bones were sore. But you can always ask your specialist if you are concerned but its probably nothing. I have 2 braces. One on chest and my lower ribs. My pectus caused rib flaring. And it is best I have them pushed down as it looks like 2 big lumps.\n\nBut I get itches. But like I baerly feel it now. Like.

Well it is quite noticeable to me because I know what to look for.\n\nBut it is still a pretty mild case, if you can get a brace I would advice you to do it.\n\nIt is totally worth trying to fix it now rather than look back later and wish you did something.\n\nI have done two surgeries, and I wish every day I could have worn a brace in my teen instead.

Yours is very minor and I am not just saying that to make u feel better, wish mine was that small. You can easily hide it by working out.. bulk then cut if you want to use time efficiently. Do not focus on just your chest either only work it out 1-2 times a week max then use the rest of the week to focus on different muscle groups, just stay consistent (4 days a week minimum) and compound lift + get at least 8 hours of sleep and eat 500+ more calories then you need to maintain your weight.

Hey! So apparently the brace is uncomfortable but mostly you cannot see it under baggy clothes/layers: \n\n(  It think it varies from person to person and depends on your age, chest flexibility, severity etc.  ^this exactly. Have you talked to a specialized doctor because that is the first step? Yep it hurts just like braces but with actual big bones instead. It is so worth it. You can take it off for 1-2 hours a day - I took it off for practice after school. And lied to everyone said it is a \"back brace\" and that never got questioned I have not yet but I was thinking about it  Thank you this helps a lot  Ooooooh okay... that makes a lot of sense, thank you  I have to wear a suit to school... will it be noticeable underneath the shirt?  Difficult to say again! I cannot imagine it would be completely invisible but with a slightly bigger shirt and a jumper I think it would be hard to see it... Also, you can just say to people it is a back brace to help your spine - who is going to know? I would stop asking questions if someone told me that  literally just posted my comment below without reading this - so pleased the 'back brace' thing worked for you! Yeah it is funny cause of all the things I was self-conscious of, having a huge clunky brace to signify my huge ass chest mountain was the last thing I wanted. But yeah, literally no one so much as questioned it. Back braces are pretty normal I guess, even my friends who called me \"uniboob\" did not connect the dots.\n\nI guess it is where that saying about how little other people actually pay attention to you comes in to play. Even if they knew what the brace was for I wonder why I would have cared? Like why is it weird to have a uniboob brace but not to have a back brace? But hey, whatever calmed my 14 year old mind enough is all that mattered  Is the brace big??  Really it depends on how severe your pectus is, and where you get your brace from. I have severe PC and have been bracing for about 3 months now, the first night is the worst. Extremely painful, it gets better over time. Mine is pretty noticeable, I do not know where you are from but I got my brace from T-Joe Pectus Services (USA). The brace is great but it is not low profile at all.  I also have to wear a suit to school and I can assure you with a blazer on and an undershirt it is not noticeable, I have the brace.", "Can someone tell me if there is any negative effects of the surgery? I want to know if there is any sort of restrictions Which surgery? Of course there is. Look into bracing first. Negatives: (reverse Nuss / Abrahams)\n\nHurt like hell for a couple of weeks.\n\nExpensive.\n\nResults might not be good.  The drainage? It is taken out after a week or two.\n\nI had the surgery twice so I would know lol.  I had the ravitch procedure a few years ago when I was 22. It is an uncomfortable two months recovery, but I am glad I had it done. No restrictions or negatives since. It is possible to develop fibrous non union but it is more likely for those with connective tissue disorders. Feels like you are being stretched when you do pull ups where did u get it done? How long do you think someone should booked off work? (for a non-physical job) Would 2 weeks be enough? I stayed about 10 days in the hospital and had 8 weeks off work (but my work at the time was physical).\n\nI would say about 4 weeks in a non physical work, but it could be individual. after the surgery? what exactly do u mean? After surgery you are given precautions and will not be able to workout or do a lot of other movements for 8 weeks. When I was doing physical therapy on my own, a few workouts hurt the incision point and felt like I was being stretched apart.", "ribs i have pectus carinatum and i build  good chest muscles but my ribs under my chest can be seen going to the letter v how do I hide it?? maybe build some obliques?", "Exercise with Pectus Carinatum Hello everyone, \n\nI have pectus carinatum on my right side of my chest and I am 16. I have made a life change to get stronger and healthier as I am sick of being seen as the skinny one. I have only being working out at home during the lockdown and every second day I do arms. Though the pain on my right side is so discomforting it just makes me want to stop trying to do push ups.  Iv made big progress with going from 5 proper push ups to 20 and doing diamond push ups now, I just feel like the pain afterwards is getting too much. Even after work from dishwashing its just frustrating that I feel this. I talked to my GP and all he says is DO NOT do push ups or chest exercises and have a nurofen if you go and work.\n\nAfter this talk with my GP I have definitely thought about treatment with a chest brace or even surgery. After these treatments will it help with my issue?  Any comments would be great and thanks for reading until the end. Definitely go with a brace and avoid surgery if you can. There is no need to open your chest and break your ribs and sternum when you can get rid of it with a brace. 16 is a good age to do it. I successfully braced when I was 18 years old so if you want to kbow anything, feel free to DM me. When completing your chest brace did you have any pain in your chest after exercise or work? No. Wearimg the brace is uncomfortable, but when you take it off for trsinimg ypu will habe no problems. I would definitely check out the brace. They are very effective for someone your age. Surgery is more of a backup for when we do not have any good bracing options. That being said, you will not really damage anything by exercising even if pain is an issue. Would you be willing to share before and after photos? I understand if that is not something you are comfortable doing, but I am interested in seeing how effective it is. I am too old now for the brace so I would have to get surgery or hide it by gaining muscle at this point. It is mostly for my curiosity as I wonder how it would have been if I had worn a brace when I learned about them when I was 18.", "I am 14 years old. I am worried that I might have pectus carinatum.

It also could get worse during the growing stage around ur age. If you notice the slightest bit of pectus, make sure u get it treated early so it does not cause any problems later in life. I dont see any,but if you ever want to know for sure you sould ask during a doctor's appointment! Thank you! Thanks. maybe share some sideways pics hm i guess the lower part sticks out more than normal, anyways seems pretty mild to me.

Does the cost vary with age or anything like that?", "19 Y/O Struggling with Pectus Carinatum  I do not know what to do, I feel like I might be to old for a brace. Have been lifting for three years and have good powerlifting numbers but I feel like I look like absolute shit due to my rib cage and pectus carinatum. Help You should try a brace imo. I startes at 18 a 2 months old, I posted some pictures of before the brace and 5 momths into the bracing, so check them out. Mine was symetrical. I think it still can work to some extent and can give good results, you will probably probably need to put more effort. I suggest Pectus Services as they are experienced and work with \"older\" patients like you and me. How much are braces and would insurance cover or is it seem as a cosmetic thing? For the insurance, I do not know because I got my brace from Poland, and I am from Serbia so I obviously knew from the very start that I will have to pay. I paid my brace for 1750$, but in UK and USA I heard it is 3500$ for the same brace. I would say that an average brace is betwen 1000$ to 2000$. Yeah US medical prices are a rip off, I will see if I could outsource it or something because the brace looks like it costs $5 to make The thing woth my brace is that the doctor travels from the US just for you and maybe 2 other patients+ a part of the treatment is a massage where he pushes your chest down and males it flat agressivly. He could be the only one in the world that does that. The brace then just holds ot in that position, it does not push like most braces that do not have a massage part. I think it is one of the reasons of successfull results in \"older\" patients. Ah ok gotcha. So does the brace slowly grind down on the extra cartilege or does it just smush it down till it is not noticeable. Would not that affect your lungs or something? \n\nAlso does it expand your rib cage as a side effect? To me that sounds like it makes sense because of the ribs that connect there. Idk may be wrong though. Most of the results woth the massage+brace treatment are there from day 1,it gets better over time s well, but most happens fon day 1. But the catch is that because of that you need to start wearing it for 24 h for five days and after that 23h and 45 min for 6 weeks. Do not worry about the lungs because your ribcage gets reshaped, it gets wider on the sides and flater on the front, with PC you cannot actually use 100% of your lung, so by reshaping the ribs ypu will free that tiny bit of volume that you could not use, you probably will not notice it though, it is that small. How does it reform in one day? I dont really understand that part unless he squishes your chest and immediately puts the brace on and you wear it 24/7 Yup, that is it. He pushes your chest down and immediately puts the brace on (brace is custom btw). The beginning is really rough, vut you have to do it like that otherwise the chest would just pop back. The brace is there to hold it and prevent it from happening. With the massage part, the doctor makes microfractures on your chest, micro cracks you could say, they need to heal and when they heal while your chest is in flat position because the brace holds it like that, your chest hardens making it the natural shape. After that, the brace is worn for 12 h and even less, just to be sure, the treatments last a year or so. Okay gotcha, what is the specific name of the procedure / the doctors that I have to get into contact with to do this Also idk if you workout but would this decrease your bench press (not that I really care tbh). Just wondering because I feel like the current shape of my chest all pushes into one spot (because the angle and pointeness) creating better force generation for bench. If it were flat I think my bench would decrease? Again, I do not really care because the benefits far outweigh a stupid number on bench but I just wanted to ask haha. Pectus Services, Joseph Anthony, I suggest contacting him through Facebook messenger bevause on the mail you will get a bumch of auto replies. Even if you do not go for his brace, he is very helpfull, but you will maybe have to send ypur messages a few times befpre he amswers because he gets tons every day. I do work out. My bench weight went down for 5-10 kg, but I would say that was because I could not train in the period when I wore the brace for long hours. I really did not notice any diferrence in my form, but I cannot be the one to talk because my case was completely symetrical. Gotcha, thanks for your help! feel free to DM me any time ", "18 1/2. Do I have PC (I am thinking it is mild in my case), and is it still fixable via brace?  2nd image is not loading on my end, so here is a link to it in case it broke when uploading.\n\n( If you press down on it and it goes in without much stiffness. Then its fixable. It could easily be fixed ifnit wasnt. But it could take too much time. does not look too noticeable, definitely fixable with a brace Your case is not bad at all, but the brace could be viable still. But, I really suggest to train your abdomen and chest really hard. It makes a huge diferrence. Mine stuck out 1 1/2 inch. Yours is nothing to worry about compared to mine. But I already fixed it Flared ribs yes, but hard to tell if this is PC Dude your case is so mild I do not think you would need a brace and if you do you would only need it for have the time normal cases would", "Is mine severe or mild( more info in comment) thanks  Started losing weight and it became more visible.

And if its severe what other solution i have. I am 28 Its hard to know right now but maybe moderate, congratz on the weight loss keep it up :) Thanks, what can be done to moderate? I am going for the brace (strap) but its mostly efective until age 19 and there is also chest surgery which in my opinion is dangerous and expensive. so you should go see a doctor about the strap and check if it can still work even if not to its full potentional it could maybe improve it I can hardly see the PC.

Have you seen a clinician about this? I definitely would Hey, you are not alone! I (F26) also have dealt with a lot of the same insecurities. \n\nEveryone I have been with says that my PC does not affect their attraction to me, which has been hard to believe after a lifetime of hating my body. For most of my teen years I was so worried that people would realize that me being attractive (to them) was a lie if they were able to see my PC. It is been difficult, but it does help to think of the situation from another perspective. \n\nEveryone has things they are insecure about. My current partner was so worried that I would not like holding his hand because one of his finger joints did not develop. Compared to the endless qualities he has that made me fall in love with him, this insecurity seemed almost laughable! But to him, it was not. \n\nIt can be dangerous to assume that our negative feelings towards something (our bodies, our interests, anything really) are present in another person's reality. Imagine I never got to hold my partner's hand because he was too worried I would be \"grossed out\"? Or if he never got to hold me close, because I was too worried he would realize I am really a deformed monster (a label that only I have given myself) ? \n\nAs for the acting stuff, I have no advice/insight on what casting agents are looking for. But I do know that every director, producer, actor, etc are all just other people with their own insecurities, perspectives and artistic vision. Going into an audition, there is no way to know what they might think about your PC (or if they have any thoughts on it in the first place) but there is also no way to know if you just happen to be exactly what they are looking for. Focus on what you can control (being yourself and giving it your best shot!) \n\nWishing you all the best &lt;3 Thank you! Your message made my day! It is nice to know that I am not the only one who is struggling with this type of thing. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. This has helped me so much and thank you for being so kind!! Covid had slowed things down a bit. I found a doctor that specializes in that kind of stuff but it was a Male and I am sure he is chill but I needed a female doctor to make myself more comfortable. I am going to be getting an appointment very soon though! Good luck! Good doctor is what you need, not a female one. Of course, it can be a female, but that is not the priority. You will just waste your precious time if stuff like that is important to you. You are already 18 so hurry up if you want the brace to be successful. Yeah I know what you mean. I am just going to suck it up and see the Male doctor lol Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a Believe me, they are all professionals. I got my brace at 18 years and 2 months old. My country did not have any trestments so I had to search for treatments in other countries. If I was nitpicking I would probably still have Pectus Carinatum or I would waste additional 2000$ so I could get my bracing done in US rather than Poland.\n\n In this situation, the most important thing is to get things done so YOU can feel better. Others are not important, how you feel is important.\n\nI can share my story about bracing. It is not anything exciting lol. DM me if you are interested. Damn I did not even think of that.

No one actually cares or thinks it is weird, kids just like being mean. But it passes.\n\nIf bracing is possible for you, and something you are interested in, give it a shot. Another option is to start lifting weights, as building muscle can help hide it (not to mention, pectus carinatum can actually make your chest look even more jacked than someone without it).

I have tried to wear it but it hurts like hell and it is hard to breath and digest food with it on. I am 16 and I have no idea what to do. Does it get easier wearing the brace the more you wear it? I have been thinking about getting surgery, but my parents will not let me for some reason. When I get old enough to make my own decisions about surgery and stuff, should I get it?  How long do you need to wear it? I mean what is the timeframe for getting it out? The doctor said 24 hours a day for the next one to two years.  I would suggest to go see the doctor together with your patents to find a good solution og you have tried the brace for some month and its to painfull. It does get better over time. I started bracing a week or two ago and it hurt like hell, I also have bad back pain and the brace contributes to that. I have extreme PC and it has already reduced significantly. I would say, try to wear it non stop for 3-4 days and if you cannot handle it consult your doctor. The older you get the harder your pectus will be to brace because it becomes more stiff.  I have pectus as well, I am 22 years old now and have lived with it since it started around puberty I guess (cannot recall exactly when it was first noticed). I have been extremely self conscious about it in the past and still am to some degree, but keep your head up! It is not the worst thing that can happen to someone. I have learned to live with it and not seek medical treatment, which I feel was the best decision for myself. It is definitely hard to let people know about it, or even find out for themselves, but it will be OKAY. I have a soft spot for all of us, as I feel it is quite debilitating mentally when you are that young (such as being nervous about anyone seeing or finding out you have it). I spent WAY too much time trying to hide it. All of my friends and family that know truly do not care that our chests stick out. We are UNIQUE and we should be happy about that. The shape of our chest does not define the person we are. Hope you can find some relief in reading this!  Damn dude. I am in the exact same situation. It does get a little bit easier when you try to ignore the pain for a while. It is kind of like going into a cold pool. If you ease into it, eventually you will not really notice the pain/discomfort.", "Working out with Pectus Carinatum (PC) I see a lot of questions on r/PectusCarinatum about working out and fitness i general. So I thought that I would share my experience from working out with PC, as I see myself as rather successful in that regard and have made some interesting observations along the way. The rest is of this post is broken up in different section, each with their own headline. Feel free to skip to whatever part that intrigues you.\n\nSome context:\n\n* Male\n* 25 years old\n* 196 cm (6\u00b45\u201d)\n* 96 kg (212 pounds)\n* Been doing strength related workouts 4-6 times a week the past 4,5 years\n* Was above active as a teen (which can play a huge role when it comes to gaining muscle)\n* My PC-severity is about medium or \u201caverage\u201d and I am able to \u201cpush\u201d it somewhat out, as seen (\n* I have not had any corrective surgeries nor worn a so called \u201cbrace\u201d\n\n**Why workout?** \\- Firstly I want to mention that working out is a great way to deal with PC. Not only did it help me with \u201chiding\u201d my PC, but arguably more importantly, it helped me build the confidence I was lacking as teenager. In the end, I believe that I am more confident and self reflected compared to if I did not have PC.\n\n**Lack of symmetry** \\- One of the greatest challenges with my PC is that my upper body is uneven or lacking symmetry in several areas. Although not visible at first, after looking closely it becomes obvious that my shoulders are not aligned, my collarbones protrude differently and the bottom of my ribcage is slightly uneven. This makes it difficult to do exercises where both hands are fixed to the same position, e.g., most exercises that use a barbell. I have found that my hands, and possibly more importantly my shoulders, need to be able to move freely and independent from each other. Therefore I avoid barbell exercises for my upper body and stick to dumbbells. So instead of doing barbell benchpress I do dumbbell benchpress and instead of doing barbell rows I do dumbbell rows. In addition to this, I feel that my \u201cunevenness\u201d makes it difficult to get into a safe and comfortable position when doing scapula retraction on the bench press (and similar exercises). I can clearly feel one of my shoulder blades resting very differently against the bench. To this end, even though dumbbell benchpress is my go to exercise for training chest, the dumbbell benchpress is difficult because of the uneven foundation used when lifting. Because of this I find it useful to supplement with standing cable flys because this allows both shoulders and shoulder blades can move freely and independent of each other.\n\n**Posture corrective exercises** \\- Having a bone that protrudes out of you chest is at first very embarrassing, as many of you probably can relate to. When I was younger I would crouch over in an attempt to hide it. As a result my shoulders had become somewhat rolled forward and my posture resembled someone with a hunchback. In my experience, hunching over just makes it worse. To fix this and I strengthened my upper back by doing a lot of face-pulls. Athlean-X on youtube have good videos demonstrating this exercise for those wondering. I did, and still do, face-pulls at the end of almost every workout. Focusing on training my lats also helped to strengthen my posture.\n\n**Insecurity** \\- Although feeling insecure at the gym is not unique to people with PC, having PC certainly makes you very self conscious about what you do and how you look doing it. To make matters worse, most gym apparel is tight, almost see through and made with light materials. All of this made it difficult to focus on my workouts as I was constantly worrying about how I looked. I even avoided certain exercises because of the vulnerable positions they required. My tips is to just wear a large hoodie or sweater. It is a lot easier to focus on your workout rather than on others when you are safe in knowing that your PC is well hidden. Also, I have been less prone to injuries after I started wearing a hoodie because I am able to keep my joints warm, as well as being able to focus on proper technique instead of a technique that best hide my PC. Finally, I workout early, before school/work when there is less people at the gym.\n\n**Pecs** \\- I personally do not care that chest is my lagging muscle group nor am I obsessed with training chest to hide my PC, but I wanted to share a tip that I got from my chiropractor once regarding training pecs. He said that PC makes it so each pec is positioned slightly differently and so you will feel that certain angles will \u2018hit\u2019 your chest differently. What I got from this is that doing chest exercises at varying angles help avoid muscular imbalance. I do not necessarily change the angle of the bench between every set of benchpress, but make sure to use different angles for my benchpress and flys. As an example, during my first year of working out I mostly did flat benchpress and as a result one pec developed significantly more than the other.\n\n**Blending PC in with abs** \\- I do not have the best genetics for abs, but from what little I have managed to develop I see that it significantly helped with making the PC look like its part of the abs. In my experience doing regular crunches is kind of weird and I am not sure if this is due to PC, but I have found most success doing hanging leg raises.\n\n**Losing weight** \\- I have seen several people discussing weight-loss as means to hide their PC or at least not \u201cmake it worse\u201d. I started off as rather skinny at 78 kg (172 pounds) and maxed out at 107 kg (236 pounds). Both are probably not ideal, but I can for certain say that being skinny did not help in any way. In fact, being skinny just makes the PC more visible. If you are still not convinced, know that being higher in body fat percentage allows you to hold more muscle and thus more mass to hide your PC. So do not starve yourself. It does you no good.\n\nTo finish things off, having PC probably means you will not set any strength related world records or look like the ideal fitness model, but that is completely fine. Generally PC is merely a small obstacle in life. For example, despite my PC, I have served in the army and competed professionally in cross country skiing. Also, at the end of the day, life is about more than you appearance and physical abilities. Finally, my PC has never been an issue when it comes to relationships, whether it be friends, long-term partners, hookups, \u201cfuck-friends\u201d, etc. I have never been rejected nor broken up with, so I feel confident in saying that having PC is not a dealbreaker for others.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need someone to talk to about PC.\n\nTLDR: Do not do barbell benchpress", "Brace problems I just got my brace but everytime I wear it my chest starts burning badly and I do not even know if I have it on right sometimes You are probably wearing it too tight try tightening it slowly over the coarse of a few hours you can also try wearing a polyester stretchy underarmer type shirt underneath the brace When I lay down do I have to tighten it any more? I would not tighten it when you lay down until your start being able to sleep in it more comfortably and you stop noticing it so much while you wear it. The first month is very hard but if i got through it than you can get through it. By the way what kind of brace do you have? Unfortunately a true life Dang I have a truelife too. Try using double sided tape to put rubber foam on the front and the back that is what i did and it made it much more wearable and comfortable.", "Day 22 after surgery (ravitch procedure)  Feeling better? Was bracing not an option? Yeah I feel better bracing was an option I  had one but the brace caused me more pain then pectus did itself Yeah maybe I will just use the brace... If bracing was an option, mind sharing your age? I am 33 and suspect it is too late for a brace. Yeah I am 14 and it did not work for me because it was too painful more painful then the actual pectus was and Usually bracing does not work after puberty because the sternum hardeneds I cannot really tell whether the operation worked out for you because the only thing I see is a scar. Do you have some before and after pics? Are you pleased with the result? The surgery was a wonder I do not have any before photos but my doctor said it was a severe case one day my chest was flat the next it stuck out 2 inches in the time I had it I never took any photos because I felt bad about it and did not want to be reminded 2 inches is about the height of 0.3175 'Toy Cars Sian FKP3 Metal Model Car with Light and Sound Pull Back Toy Cars' lined up Are you feeling any pain or anything? Also are you bed ridden or able to do things? I know you cannot lift anything for a few months. The reason I ask is because I am about to get the surgery myself in a few months. I am 19 and have a pretty severe case Hey I saw your comment and I have just started my mid twenties living with Pectus Carinatum. Since you are 33 could you maybe give me some advice on how the 21-33 years were for you? My self confidence about it has improved a lot now that I have gotten older but my chest has actually gotten more physically uncomfortable and I am interested in what my life will be like living with this in my young adult years. Neither seem very comfortable tbh I had surgery, too. I got a similar scar. One time while wearing a bikini someone asked me if I had a boob job, and I was just like \"....that is not the right location for a boob job.\"\n\nThe scar still is pretty noticable. I do wish it was not there, but it is not the end of the world. I had surgery done, the first time, about 15 years ago. It was brutal the first time. They popped a lung during surgery, I had to be on oxygen for a while. A rib disconnected, and the metal bar shifted, so they had to fix it up. Then about ten years later I got the bar removed. That was way easier.\n\nI remember when I first went back to get the bar removed, a year after having it placed, my surgeon was like \"you know, more studies have been done, it needs to be in there *much* longer.\"\n\nThen he took the metal bar out of me a decade after he put it in. I really appreciate you sharing your story with me thank you but I have a question how long is it before the surgery heals up also got to say 10 years with the bar that is crazy usually there only in there for 2 years one last thing how Bad was your pectus and did your chest become fully flat because I still have some swelling and I am not able to see the full results yet I got to say, bracing is not that bad. Sure the first 3 weeks are horrible and they may hurt very much, but when you get used to the brace, it is pretty easy. The worst thing about the brace is going outside with it, but you do not have to do that since yo can remove the brace. Are you serious?\n\n How on Earth is cutting your chest open better than a brace at the age of 14? Sorry for being rude, but the mindset of you and your parents is very bad. I am literally in shock... I had a severe case of pectus carinatum The brace put me in more pain then the pectus gave me in my chest and back I did not want to look in the mirror every and have to wear a hoodie so it did not stick out and make me look like I had man boobs the mindset of your self is very questionable if you are to that quickly go after me and my parents over a surgery that I chose to have what does. A surgery have to do with anyone\u2019s mindset At the end of the day it is not going to be a scar that kills me it is the surgery that is going to give me back my motivation a Yeah so mine was pretty severe as well stuck out by 2 inches I was able to do basic things on day 6 and I am able to do most things now you just cannot twist you cannot lift over 50 pounds you but you can do things like jogging swimming you can ride bikes the normal things you just cannot put any strain on your chest but keep in mind I am getting really close to the 4 week mark the first few weeks are hard but you can get through it if your tough oh and by the way before your surgery they might ask you to put in a epidural or they might not if they do not ask them because all there going to give you is opioids witch get you feeling crappy and do not work 2 inches is 5.08 cm You did not have to wear hoodies... \n\nI literally told everyone about the brace from day 1. There is no reason to cut your chest open because you are ashamed of something. \n\nAlso, the brace is hard to wear, but the surgery definitely caused more damage to your body. No need for something like that if you had good alternatives.\n\nThe beginning of bracing is one of my most painful experiences. It gets way better over time though. I definitely recommend it before trying surgery, vut you need to commit to it. I am fully aware man bracing works for most people and i did not have the bars put in I just had the cartilages that grow back in a few months I feel happy about the surgery I wish I would have tried bracing more but it just did not work for me I just think going after me and my family was a little to far Maybe try a brace? I am 26 it is working I am 26 brace is working it may not be too late Your attitude is disgusting I had a brace for 2 years and did not do anything I then decided to have surgery and have never looked back, just because you can live with ur pectus does not mean everyone else can everybody has different types of pectus some worse then others, and to blame him and his parents is awful it makes no sense to blame somebody for wanting to change their life for the better, grow up. Discouraging others from getting a brace just because it didin't work for you is very bad. There is no reason to do surgery if you did not confirm that a brace does not work on your body. \n\nYou tried the brace, it did not work, because of that you had a surgery. It worked, that is great. But all of this was an alternative to brace. Brace should always be the first option especially if you are still young. Surgeries are very stressfull for your body, in this case it is literally opening your chest. If you ask me or any sane person, that is a very good reason to try the brace first. Every surgery carries a huge risk. I had the Ravitch too at 21, 8 years ago, never regret it. It was life changing for me. The scars I have are large but I would not change one thing. I honestly would not be who I am today without that surgery. Hope you are happy with your results.", "Exercise advice Hi guys, a mom here, to a teenage son with PC. Are there any particular exercises that will help, and boost confidence? Currently just doing dumbbells. Wondering what is safe to do and what is effective! Thanks! I would have to know how old is he to tell in more details, but I can name a few exercises that are great for any age. Push ups and pull ups are the absolute best exercises for teenagers in my experience. Body weight exercises are the best. \n\nHe should do it 4 sets. Let us say push ups, he can do 10 of them, then he rests 2 or 3 minutes and does another set. He should do as much as he can in every set.\n\nPull uos are way more difficult so he will need to have another approach. If he cannot do a single push up then he needs to jump and hold his head above the bar for 2 seconds. After that he needs to go down very slowly while keeping his muscles tight. He should do this in 4 sets, as much as he can in every set. One day he will be able to do a pull up. If he can do a pull up, then do them in 4 sets just like push ups.\n\nOne more thing. I need you to understand this, exercising will not fix the problem, it can just hide it and it can take a long time to do it. Some cases are also to big to be hidden. He is a teenager so he should be a good candidate for a brace if you can get one. If you need help about the brace or exercising  I am here for you. Get him a quality brace asap...\n\nExercise is good and all, but it can only offer minimal relief. Not doing anything while he is still young is a bad move. I am 19 and now have some resentment for my mother because she did not put up a fuss when I (14 at the time) quit wearing the brace. Even if he hates you for making him wear it, he will never experience the back pain and lack of shoulder mobility that comes in your late teens with this condition. I know this is off topic and I do not know if you are bracing or not, but please consider. Kind Of have to disagree with the statement body weight exercises are the best, they surely should be in his routine, and they are important but with some dumbbells you can easily target back pecs biceps triceps etc, soo if he would like some muscle on his chest he should prob do push ups in combination with dumbbell presses, flies or hell anything that you use chestmuscle with(just need a bench, or mat on floor or just on floor even), for back pull ups definitely best exercise cuz it ises alot of muscles, if more progress wanted also can be supplemented with back exercises with dumbbells, all ofcourse depending on age and other circumstances. Forgot to add one part. Body weight exercises are the best for young teenagers/beginners. Ah yeah can agree on that one more, although for me push ups didnt help too much when i didnt combine them with other methods, but yeah if hed be like 12 r something he should not overtrain and then it might be the best to do almost only bodyweight shit Get a power rack/ half rack or go to a gym. Body weight exercises are great but they are not going to build muscle as well. Bench press, dumbbell bench, peck flys, and other chest workouts help build muscle and make PC not as noticable. I do not know how bad it is. If it is not bad then getting a musclar chest will pretty much completely hide it. But if it is really bad than no amount of muscle will fix it Thanks to all for the replies. He is 14, a brace candidate the doc says, doc also says most teens opt out and that it would be ok, which he does not want to wear a brace. Thoughts? Exercises alone might help some?", "Help us out Having the time of my life with the brace for the last 4 months just 20 to go and I was wondering if it were possible to have a way so the brace will not slide around while I am wearing a shirt without it being ludicrously tight?\nPls let us know when you have the chance You probably need to tighten it a bit, not too much. I do not have a better advice sadly...", "Just need support Hello, I have just discovered this subreddit, I wear a brace for my mild PC, it is really uncomfortable and if someone has got any words to share that might support me please do it.\n\nEdit: M13 what brace do you have? I am not sure, it is custom Search through this forum for past posts you will find plenty of other stories to help you through it. There is a FB group as well, I would look into that as well. Push through if you really want a change man, you would likely regret it as you get older if you fail to do this now. I will, thank you for the support I was in the same boat as you when I got my brace for my mild PC back in November. It hurts like hell at first but you just got to believe in your will power and discipline to look and feel better.

If your putting it on too tight try loosening it and ease into tightening it more and more. Other than that it does get better and you get more used to it the more you wear it. Try and start by wearing it at night, if you can fall asleep with it on you will not have to deal with the pain, and it will allow your body to get used to it. My orthopedist says on week 2 (which I am on) to where it for 2-4 hours but I barely can get 2 That is interesting because if I remember correctly I was supposed to be wearing it a lot longer than 2 hours. On week 3 it is 3-6 hours and then week 4 is 18-20 hours Hi.  I am 14 and last year I had to wear a brace. For the first week or two I remember feeling really bad pain. It hurt most if I tried to laugh or take deep breaths. It does get a lot better and after about a month I remember it stopped hurting. Ifbit starts hurting try massaging the spot while having a little break. That should last you ab 2 more hours. But soon you get pretty used to it.", "Has Anyone Braced at 22 Years Old or Later? For those who have braced at 22 y/o or later, what was your experience like?\n\nHow many hours a day? Did you wear it only at night?

Aiming for 24/7 soon but currently at like 16 hours a day or so. It is tough but it is tougher to live with PC forever I think May I ask where you were able to get a brace at 26? I am that age and was told it was too late :-(. London orthotics in the UK. I am doing mine remotely too as I am in another country. They are really really excellent the dude Sam is top notch and works with adults. Highly recommend. Lmk if u have more questions about it too May I ask how severe your pectus is? Mine is quite high up below my collar bones so I think it may be harder based on the location :-(. That is awesome though, I really hope it works!!! Would love to fix mine I would say it is moderate and it is also asymmetric only right side. I am sure you can try bracing or surgery man. Go get some consults Did you have to go to London for an initial visit? Or was it done all remotely? No 100% remote , including measurements. There is a 3D scan app he has you download that gets an accurate model of your chest and he uses that to build your brace. Pretty efficient so far honestly Woah, I did not know that was possible. I contacted them 6 years ago but they did not have this app then so they wanted me to fly to London for an initial visit. \n\nDoes the brace fit well? Like did the app do a good job? Ah i see. Yes the app did a great job and the brace fits very well. However I did ask him to make an adjustment to the front pad which he is shipping over, but that was more due to miscalculation from us 2 discussing rather than the app. Overall it seems very doable remotely so far How much was the cost? How many hours a day Like $3K usd total ish I would say at least 7 hs a day, still cant sleep with it", "Can I leave it untreated? Hello, I have what is probably a moderate pidgeon chest, maybe a little more than moderate but I am not sure. My question is, can I just leave it be? I do not really care what I look like, but I would treat it if there are any health concerns related to the condition. The only annoyance I have with it is popping of the cartilage under the rib cage, and it is uncomfortable to lay on my stomach. I also have been experience an increased occurrence of diaphragm spasms and acid reflux. My chest seems to still be growing out more over time, even though I am 18 years old. That being said, if this condition is only cosmetic, I would be fine with leaving it be. However, if there is any health concerns over time this condition can bring about I would like to do something about it. Thanks for y'alls help! Tbh I would ask a doctor because I am no expert. as far as I know it is mostly cosmetic. I am glad I got mine done because it was pretty bad but the brace was very annoying sometimes. if you are happy with how it looks that is great and what should really matter. I know that really bad cases can cause a lot of spine issues but it is mostly cosmetic so you do you As I have gotten older and my chest as gotten firmer I am having more issues. Shortness of breath, low endurance, an arrhythmia, and general soreness (I am unsure if my acid reflux is related or if that is from my love of spicy food). I was fitted for a brace at 16 and I kick myself everyday for not wearing it and keeping up with the treatment. Now I am waiting for my insurance to get back to me about covering imaging, so that my doctor and I can discuss if surgical intervention is necessary. \nI am not a doctor and everyone and every case is different. I do not want to scare you. I think you and your doctor should discuss what the right path for you is. Thanks for the help! By the way, how old are you?

I am going to guess it does not have a lot of effect. I am in the forum because my daughter has PC. She is in the 30% for height. The 2 adult men I know are both under 6 ft (5'6\" and 5'10\"). I would say it is different for all. Height probably does not make much of a difference, but I would not be surprised if the stature of someone alters the P.C. Know a guy with fairly broad shoulders, seems normal on him and does not seem bad at all, I am no where near as broad and it is a lot more defined; then again, this depends on how far out it grows too! What makes the difference is the fast growth I would say. I am only 14, but I have it and I am right around 5\u20196 so I would say height does not have a huge impact.  But if you appear skinnier because you are taller it could quite possibly make you have a more severe looking case of PC. 6\u20193\u201d here also Is yours isolated or associated with something like marfans,etc No but I also have Scheuermann\u2019s disease to go along with it..

I am worried I am not wearing it correctly Ouch I had the same problem, I had to stop in the end was just too much.\n\nMaybe just loosen it a bit till it gets easier?", "My PC story (surgery soon) I have been living with pc since I was 4. That is when it started to show up on my body. I never really felt insecure about my body until some friends from school took notice when I was about 8. I thought it was cool up until then and I liked being different, but of course, kids can be mean and changed my opinion of myself quickly. I never felt like I was bullied or was made a laughingstock during school, it was more so realizing that I had an imperfect body and I would not forget it. Living with the mentality that being different is bad as a kid was challenging. I was afraid to take my shirt off swimming, taking my shirt off in front of someone, and it would limit my wardrobe. That is really all it was then.\n\nAs I grew older, it made me afraid to want to join any sports, do any exercise, and it actually affected my breathing. I had little to no confidence during my early teen years and I hated it. I probably beat myself up more about it than others did. I was so fixated with wanting to be \u201cnormal\u201d. I had no desire to get into bracing due to getting my pc noticed more by others. I was pretty good at hiding it by flexing my chest, limiting my posture, and wearing button down shirts. Bracing would ruin this \u2018front\u2019 that I had created to feel normal. \n\nAs years went on, I started to get into fitness. I became more worried about how skinny I was over my deformed chest. I corrected my posture and got really knowledgeable in exercises and dieting. I actually made a pretty big difference in my body and created more confidence in myself.  It was completely unnoticeable with any shirt on and was barely noticeable to others with it off due to the muscle and fluff I had put on. I could finally wear what I wanted, swim however I wanted, and feel better about myself. \n\nAfter graduating high school, some things in my life happened which caused me to feel depressed and I did something that I never thought I would ever do in my life. I joined the military as an infantryman. I figured that since I already have a desire in fitness and I was already depressed, what is the worse that could happen? I would do what I am already doing (crying and working out) and get paid for it. I was way in over my head. For someone that has never done anything physical other than weight lifting, the military was very challenging at the start. It really screwed with how I worked out, how I ate, and how I slept. I was on top of my game before I joined, and now I had no control over it. I became very lean and lost whatever strength I had quickly. And with that, my pc started to become noticeable again.\n\nI mostly just pushed through whatever bs was thrown an me by peers and superiors, but just because I could take it - does not mean that I was not insecure about it. I started to hate myself all over again. I struggled to get my weight up and my strength (and I still kind of do now). I had lost a lot of the motivation that I use to have.

I actually have a surgery date scheduled in 3 weeks and I would be happy to make some posts with before and after pictures and describing everything. I love giving insight in this subreddit, and providing my experience with everyone. If anyone has any questions, let me know!

This along with the other things is making me feel a bit nervous.   \nI feel like it is hard to find information about PC, and I do not know a lot about the possible complications, or if it can get worse. I am not sure if it is possible to get a brace as I am from Denmark, and my doctor does not really know anything about PC, I have heard a brace does not usually work when you are over 18 too, but I feel like PC is becoming a real bother :/\n\nOne of my ribs sticks out quite a bit too, which I think might have to do with PC. I experience pain in that side sometimes and have trouble laying on that side.\n\nI would love some advice, and I am curious about if others have similar problems.  \nThank you in advance \\^\\^ Let me tell you now a brace is definitely not going to work if you are 20. I tried a brace at 16 and it did not work for me. I ended up getting a surgery called the ravitch procedure 11 months ago and I feel that it helped with my breathing and also the overall look of my chest. Recovery hurt a lot tho but I somehow made it through Not true, bracing does not depend on age... you could be 20 and a brace would still be effective if the bone is still flexible Do not listen to the guy above. The brace can work in 20. It depends on ypur bones and cartilage, but it can definately work. I got it with 18 and a half, it works perfectly. Yes, _if_ the bone is still flexible. Usually once you have gone past 17 the bones start to harden and unluckily for me it happened at 16. She can still try it if she wants, but from my experience and what my doctors told me, I doubt it would work. Still, all the best of luck to her I have scheduled an appointment with my doctor next month to see if there is maybe someone she can forward me to who knows more about PC and who can see if a brace could be a possibility for me or not, since two of you are saying it depends on the bones and such maybe there is hope yet \\^\\^ It sounds like the surgery went well and you are happy you went through with it?   \n I am nervous about the idea of a surgery, but if a brace cannot help me and a surgery can improve my problems it is probably something to really consider then \\^\\^ Well that is just through my experience and what my doctors told me and a bunch of other websites I researched beforehand. You would have to have been very very lucky to not have ur bones and cartilage harden by 18 \ud83e\udd23 Not really. My doctor works successfully with so many patients who are 20+. 18 limit is a myth. I highly reccoment Pectus Services. It will not work past 20 you stop growing after like 18 Not true, that is the biggest myth ever. Men grow up until 25,but most happens to 21. Also, braces can give results even without growth, but you must find a provider who manipulates your chest down, basicaly making microfractures by respositioning your bones and cartilage, the brace is there only to hold it down until those fractures fully heal and the new position of bones becomes natural.", "I need help I have a pectus brace that I wear at night and I would wake up with it on and in a but of pain which was successful.

Ive had this for 1 week noe and i am really struggling. I can only use the brace for 4-6 hours before the pain gets the upper hand. I sleep on the side so to sleep with it is also pretty hard. \n\nSo I was wondering do anyone have any tips to share to get through the 6 month of living hell? its get better the longer you wear it, a memory foam mattress helps a lot. maybe try loosening it slightly as well, depending what your doctor said. try keeping it on for as long as possible to get used to it if that is possible. Trust me it becomes unnoticeable after a while. Okay thanks for the response I have had it for a year and a half rn, I would say the first bit while sleeping; so you can sleep on your back, place long pillows or stuffed animals on both sides of you and put your arms on them, so it is like having a memory foam mattress without having to pay 1000$ Ok ill try that I am 16 and can confirm what the guy above says,the brace I have has large ratchets on the side so sleeping on my side is impossible.i can bear sleeping on my back,but I recommend trying to sleep on your belly.it may sound weird but it can be nice on occasion,also dont be afraid to use pillows as supports to find a good sleeping position.also like the person says it gets better with time! Okay thanks for the advice ill try tonight It can make your muscles really tight being in that thing. Like the others said, wear it a long time and you will get used to it. Take time to stretch and deep breathe when not wearing it. \n\nWhere did you get this brace? I got it for free from my doctor. They just used a machine around my body and for it 6 months after.

The surgeon believes that only my six rib needs to be operated on, however I believe more ribs in more ribcage protrude and bother me a lot aesthetically. Unfortunately he is the only pectus surgeon I know of in my state, so i am not sure where to go for a second opinion. Budget is definitely an issue but i have save up for what I need to I guess. Does anyone know of any good pectus surgeons in Australia I could consult with for a 2nd opinion? Or has anyone had a similar experience and we able to perform tests to provide evidence to convince their surgeon? Any advice would be really helpful thanks. Note: the six rib on my right side protrudes slighly more than the left, however I believe multiple ribs on both sides protrude. Why does he want to just operate on the 6th rib? What not more? Did he say why he likes being so conservative? I do remember my surgeon having some initial concerns about operating on my higher ribs. I think this was related to concerns about healing or risk of causing other problems. But if I remember right, they ended up to 2, but only after I was in surgery and they could assess it better. He believes the six rib on the right side is the only rib that is protruding and that the rest are correctly aligned. \n\nI agree that the sixth rib on my right side (which is the pointy bit you can see below my nipple) protrudes the most, but I believe there are more ribs protuding also, the rest of the ribs just happen to be more symmetrical so it is less obvious perhaps. I feel like it is clear from a side view. Sorry what do you mean by \"ended up to 2\"? Did they only operate on 2 ribs or on multiple rips up to the 2nd rib?\n\nInteresting, sounds a bit risky to rely on them make last minute changes. Thanks for sharing, hopefully my surgeon will consider what I have to say. He is wrong. If he manipulates only one rib, the protrusion will come back because all the other ribs are still protruding or slightly protruding. The other ribs will force that one rib into its original deformed position. \n\nI would get a reverse miss if i were you. I agree, the issue is that he does not believe any other ribs are protruding so he will not operate on them. I also have trouble breathing which I believe is due to the PC, and for that reason as well I think multiple ribs need to be operated on. I am going to try get a second opinion but there is not really any experienced pectus surgeons in my city. I might try consulting remoting for now though. Thanks for the reply. Sorry! Meant multiple ribs and ended up going up as high as the second rib.\n\nI felt very confident in my surgeon and that she would do everything she could to improve my situation without taking any unnecessary risk.

So this was a huge conflict when I was is 8th grade. My parents were very understanding and worked to fight our insurance company for over a year. This involved things like getting a scoliosis diagnosis (which was too mild to matter) among other things. I do not remember much cause it was so long ago. I do remember that in the end we did get our insurance company to cover it. However, about a month before my surgery was scheduled, we found out about the brace. \n\nMy suggestion: GET A BRACE. For some reason this was covered by insurance without question... Even though it cures the same issue as the surgery.. Again I do not remember much but my chest was an enormous self-confidence destroyer and I was determined to get the surgery. The brace ended up being way easier. We had to drive to Virgina a couple of times and it took about a year of wearing 23 hours a day. I took it off when playing sports and told people it was a back brace if they noticed.

If so, does someone know how much does a brace cost in Spain? Thanks. I was 18 and 2 months old when I started bracing, I need to wear it for a year. In my opinion, it is worth it and you should try. Where did you buy your brace? From Pectus Services. They work in US, UK and Poland (maybe even more locations, I do not know). I got mine from Poland. How much was it? Im 16 and from my experience it was terrible, it is incredibly difficult to breathe because it prevents your chest from expanding, it also causes a lot of pain.

I am currently 26-years-old and, when I brought PC up to my doctor 10 years ago, there was little-to-no information shared by people with PC that I could use to inform my decision to go through with surgery. \n\nPC was emotionally taxing on me. Only now, after having lived abroad for many years and finally returning to the US, have I decided to dig up the medical files on my condition and share my story. Based on my medical exams from 10 years ago, I had chest deformity involving the sternum from the 4th to 7th rib. There was a carinatum deformity of the right costal cartilages and an excavatum deformity of the left costal cartilages with minimal \"saucering.\" There was sternal torsion. Basically what that means is I had asymmetrical pectus carinatum. It was labeled as \"extreme,\" but honestly, I think it was just moderate (though, as a teenager it seemed extreme). \n\nI regret having surgery  to correct my PC. The operation failed--the nuss bar was removed one year after it was inserted and my chest looked worse than it did before the operation. While I was unhappy with it at the time, I have been able to live a happy and fulfilled life. I am a skinny guy and the PC/scars are visible to people. It is even visible when I am wearing a shirt. However, none of this has stopped me from being confident while shirtless or naked. I have had meaningful, intimate relationships with people who did not make me feel like I was ugly or deformed. If anything, they respected me for being authentic and owning it. My best advice to anyone out there dealing wth PC is just own it. Surgery should be your LAST option. ", "Popping In Chest?

For the past few months I have been experiencing painless popping sensations under my rib cage when I move a certain way or breathe in deeply.

Do not get me wrong my current brace is hard but miles easier.\n\nI would recommend contacting this place \n\n(\n\nAt least try a consultation, I would not give up on the brace approach your at the perfect age. Be careful, you are very young! I still think the brace is better, but I cannot change your mind. Your age is perfect for a brace, and as the guy bellow said, contact that clinic. They use the same brace as mine, and you can see the results in my post history.", "Doctor Said its nothing nur i\u2018m Not so sure ", "Is it too late for me I am 26 y/o male, I feel like pectus carinatum has robbed me of confidence throughout my life.\n\nI wear baggy clothes to try and hide it, its not even the worst case. I have tried to exercise to build muscle around it but I always find myself unsatisfied with the fact that my ribcage makes my sides look thin, I look like I have love handles even when I am very skinny. From the side the chest makes my shoulders and arms looks tiny.\n\nI feel like at 26 it is getting towards the last chance I have for ever being able to take my shirt off around other people. I want to go to the beach and feel comfortable. \n\nMy chest is pretty rigid, I understand it is most likely much too late for a brace. But is it too late for surgery? Has anyone had good results from surgery at this age, and is it worth the pain? I can relate to the way you have described your body, especially the love handles whilst being lean. I am 28 but I am planning to have surgery to correct my PC. From what I have read I do not think any age is too late for surgery, at 26 you could definitely still have a great surgery outcome No ,it is not late to receive surgery,I suggest you consider Abramson minimally invasive procedure,And I think sure it is worth! It is never late for surgery I think. Brace has a likit though. Who do you know that is good at the Abramson surgery? Dr Mustafa Y\u00fcksel in Turkey,\nDr Hyung Joo Park in S.Korea,\nDr Wang Wenlin in China.\nI know these doctors. In addition,If you have complex deformity I suggest you consult with Dr Wang Wenlin to figuring out which type of surgery is suitable for you. I am 26 as well and I am going to be starting bracing in about a month with the London Orthotics consultancy. And I am going to be doing it all remote! Which will be interesting. However my chest is fairly flexible so I think it is going to work on me fairly well if I stick to it (which I will!). So I think if yours is rigid it may be harder to accomplish but I will say I have heard of people in mid 20s still get it done with bracing even with rigid chests. Surgery is very serious and also expensive and super painful, so it might be worth exploring bracing or at least have the convo with some good clinics before pulling the trigger on surgery. I actually visited one of the docs another person mentioned in this post, Dr. Park in Korea, about potentially doing Reverse Nuss and his immediate reaction was I should not do it bc 1) my pectus is not super bad and 2) he thought bracing should be my first line of attack. \n\nBasically you can always try bracing and then quit and do surgery, but you can basically never do surgery and then \u2018reverse\u2019 that. Just some food for thought Did the surgery 8 months ago. I am 39 now. Best choice ever. Good luck! Nice to hear that you are a candidate at 26. It will be hard, that is what I can say. Brace is a bitch, especially in the beginning. Yeah I know... I am sure I will be back here to ask you guys for advice which surgery? and how was the recovery? Modified Ravitch. They cut 8 ribs (4x2) to remove the excessive cartilage. Recovery was pretty intens.\nThe first 6 weeks was severe but after that 6 weeks things were getting better very fast. Now 8 months later I am very pleased with the result. I go to the gym 4 times a week and that works out really great. Muscles are developing in a way that I never experienced my entire live. Looking forward to the summer of 2021. For the first time of my live. Very helpful, thanks. I already contacted Joo Park long time ago and he said my chest is very complex and tough. That kind of turned me away from doing this but I will also consult the other two. \n\nDo you know anyone else? Any U.S surgeons that are good at the Reverse Nuss? \n\nI had a Ravitch for PC. It did not work well and I ended up with PC + PE (asymmetrical). I do not know any doctor in the U.S,But for complex deformity Doctor Wang might be a better choice,You can check his WeChat Channel : wangwenlinyishi\nAnd contact him How are you doing this remotely? Did you have to visit them in-person at any point? \n\nWould I be able to do get there services without ever visiting them in-person? How bad is the scar you get from it? I have got a 3 inch (8 cm) vertical scare in the center of my sternum. Not bad at all. Thought it would be worse. I can sense a slight numb feeling around the scare but that is not bothering me at all.", "Is this PectusCarinatum? If so, how severe is it?  Yes,very mild but as you get older it will get worse. Assymetrical right? I would say it is not that big and not that small, somewhere in the middle. But, our opinion does not really matter, if it bothers you our opinions will not change much. How old are you? Right, I am 15 years old. Would you say that it is noticeable? It does cause me some insecurities, and I would rather fix it. Would working out more make it less noticeable? Look, we \"pectus people\" have an eye for this, but normal people probably would not notice that much. Your picture higlighted your chest as well so it looks more noticable than it actually is.\n\nI think you can benefit from working out a lot, but do not expect it to change ypur bone structure, it will only add muscle for cover up. If you can, I suggest gettimg a brace, it helped me so much at the age of 18. You are only 15 years old so you are probably a good candidate. But that is just my suggestion. One more question. Do you have scoliosis? You can check that by seeing if one of your shpulders is lower than the other one. As far as I can tell I do not. Is pectus usually accompanied by scoliosis or vice versa? How much does a brace cost and what type of doctor did you talk to? Asymmetrical pectus is often followed by scoliosis. I just wanted to give you some advice on exercise if you had  scoliosis, but nice to hesr that you do not. \n\nBraces can go from 250$ to 3500$ from what I have seen, Ibought mine for 1750$. Doctors in my country do not know anything about pectus so I went online and got an appointment in another country. Okay, thank you for the insight. I have talked with my parents about this and will be seeing a doctor about it soon. If I end up with a brace, how long would you say it takes to see results?\nHow long typically do people with a similar case to mine have to where it for the change to be permanent? What were the results like for you? Brace treatment usually last 1 year, but can be up to 2 years. My brace treatment had a massge to agressivly put my chest down immediately and the results were immediate because of that, but I had to wear the brace 24/7 un the beginning (wearimg time lowers over time) because of that, if I did not, it would pop back. In my case, brace just HOLDS the chest. Some other braces do not have that massage part and the braces actually PUSH the chest, with those you start with shorter wear time and work you way to longer wesr time, and then you go down again.\n\nP. S. I made a post with 2 pictures, 1 before the brace, 1 5 months into bracing. It was in july i think. I looked at your progress, your chest has improved a lot! I can see the difference, and can you feel a difference in your back? Like, if you had any back pain before bracing has it gotten better? I think my pectus is definitely related to my poor posture, I have been working on that as well. I actually have a spine condition called Scheurmann's Kyphosis (stuctural Kyphosis). Some of my vertebrae are wider on the back side and create a curve bigger than normal. There is no proven connection betwen Pectus and spine deformities, but my brace provider say that they go together very often. My spine condition is not that bad in my opinion, especially now that I gained additional 7 kg from that picture and more muscle. I never had back pain, but I think my posture got better because I can proudly show my chest. Before I wpuld slouch over and hide it.", "18 y/o, do I have pectus carinatum, and how bad? Thanks!  honestly its not even bad at all, just try packing some muscle and it wont be visible That is really not that bad at all, start doing push ups and sit ups and it will prolly be unnoticeable. if you do it is not really that noticeable, in the picture at least Very mild, some bracing and it would look perfect imo since you have it symmetrical. Mine looks the same as yours tbh , not really noticeable", "Im guessing it is, but is this PC? if so, how can I treat it or make it go away? ", " Is it something to worry about? How can I hide it?

Here is what I will say. If you are posting about your anxiety, fix your anxiety to best way that you can. Get a brace, brace often and overnight. Start lifting ASAP. However, do not just do chest exercises. I made this mistake initially and had terrible shoulder problems coupled with PC. I will tell you what: it is not a great combo. Anyway, there are millions of workout and dieting programs on the internet. Find one that works for you and follow it closely and carefully. Always remember to stretch and work on mobility. Strengthening your upper back, rear deltoids, etc will be the best thing you can do for your pectus.\n\nAnyway, your case is not as bad as others, so do not get too bugged out by it. All I am saying is that if you want to life live to the fullest, you will do anything it takes to dominate this chest wall deformity. Please reach out to me with any questions. Completely agree with you, I had the same mindset when I first heard about the brace. I took a lot of risks in my way to getting s brace from a foreign country (Poland) because my country did not have any options, I worked for all of the money, I even risked being locked in Poland for weeks because of the virus (the world was just about to announce a global pamdemic). But I know one thing, amd it is that it was the only way I could ever be satisfied. I was 18 so if I did not go then, the virus would probably destroy my chances of brace working on my chest. \n\nNow I am half way into bracing, the results are awesome and I recommend it to everyone. As I am someone with experience now, I can help as well, so OP, contact me if you have any questions.", "Which pectus help me please ", "Does anybody else here have PC that looks similar?

Doctors told me only way is to hide it is to workout. I started to workout seriously recently but I am really disappointed how my chest is forming out. My left side is a lot prominent and smaller. I started to look into other options to deal with the PC and the brace is looking like a good option. I am 19 but sure Honestly, I do not see what is the problem? I am literally trying to see if you have a deformity at all, I cannot see anything wrong.\n\nEven if there is something I cannot see, noone but ypu notices it and it can be fixed with training your chest harder. I would not get the brace if i were you. Think about it, pectus carinatum is an overgrown sternum right? So if you get a brace, you are pushing all of that overgrown bone into your chest. Im 13 and focusing on building my pecs or getting a 6 pack because itl look like a top ab. Im close to a 6 pack Nah trust me bro it is, in person you can tell. The more I workout the more prominent it is and my left pec is way more uneven. So I am thinking maybe brace is good for now then workout after Yea but as you get older you get more grow sprouts making the PC more prominent Lol i hope i get growth spurts xD Im 4'11, my mum is 4'10 and my dad is 5'5 \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I did notice that you left pec is a bit smaller after looking at those pictures for a long time, but that is quite common. Try getting a brace if you think you need it, but if not, maybe find a trainer who can help you out with muscle imbalances. Just please do not do surgery, I do not think it is worth it in your case. But, at the end of the day, it is your own decision.\n\n Good luck! Yea lol I am not getting surgery ik it is not that severe but I think at least a brace could help out I am 5\u201911 lol but yea ur still 13 so who knows I have a brace. My chest was severe. It is almost flat now. All it does is push it to where it should normally be. I would get one if your tryna flatten in out some more. Looks like u got a very mild case like myself so it should work quite fast and quite well if u did get a brace. Just started nine roughly abt a few months back and the changes have been good. Really where did you get your brace and how long did you start to see results?? BTW, I went through bracing, I started at 18 years and 2 months old. It was successfull. If you want to ask me anything related to bracing feel free to DM me. Can i dm you mybrother", "Is pectus carinatum related to posture and muscle mass? Hi guys, I just turned 15 and i have mild asymetric PC on the left side of my rib cage. I have fairly poor posture and was wondering if my PC could be affected by it. I am still growing and have a pretty flexible rib cage so if i trained my upper body could i stop it from deteriorating? Working out is a very good idea to regain a strong and healthy posture. There is also the possibility that  it prevent the worsening of the PC but it is not guaranteed. I do not really know your physique but I think it is unlikely that it is getting worse. All in all, I recommend to start working out with your own body weight and switch to weight lifting when you are 16 or 17 to avoid blocking of growth hormones. Ok, Thanks PC is more noticeable if you have low body fat/low weight. As far as the posture, sometimes that comes from trying to hide the PC, a lot of people have bad posture/kyphosis from too much screen time on phones and such. My son is a competitive athlete with PC is being treated with a brace and has really good posture which seems to make it stick out even more.

Yes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo anyone else? I do not think so. Not that much... it can be worse... Probably would not be noticeable even a little if you did some pectoral work outs. Harder for us thinner dudes to hide it with body mass but building chest muscle around the area has worked for many people.  Slightly. The average person probably wont see it.

Brace only really fixed the part of the chest that protrudes out most Never seen it affect the collar bone, but just about everything else.

I am getting this after a few days starting bracing and am thinking maybe it is from bracing too hard but then I do not know if this is necessarily normal. Will ask my clinician but just curious if others here have advice - if you have experienced this can you tell me how you dealt with it? That happens to me a lot when bracing for a long period of time. What I did that really helps is I bought this stuff called \u201ccotton cast padding\u201d on Amazon and it is realllly helping, like no more acne or red blemishes, I can still sometimes get a minor rash but that is really it tho. I know how you feel bracing with that shit on ur chest is damn near impossible. I have also been using this acne body wash as well and I think that is helping a bit aswell For sure thanks man ima look into the cotton cast padding. You put it directly over the chest and under the brace? Yeah just underneath my shirt on my bare skin, under the brace. It actually helps so much my skin looks way more clear Nice ima try this thanks! Okay so I had a problem with a red rash on my sides and chest that did not hurt too much but I went and got my brace readjusted and it help a tiny bit but not a lot.

He hates the way his chest looks, it is come on so suddenly and the doctor was baffled when I showed her a picture of him a few weeks back when his chest was much more regularly shaped.\n\nHis sternum is very prominent, very noticeable through a t-shirt, but they said it will go away as he gets older and grows more? He is interested in having bracing treatment, but we are in the UK and I am not sure how we go about being referred since the hospital do not think he needs to be under anybody? Hey, I would definitely follow that up rather than leaving it. Well done noticing it so early, having a good head start will definitely make great much easier. I do not much about the health system in the UK but perhaps try looking for specialists on pectus.com or try posting in some of the Facebook pectus support groups like Pectus Strong. It is just bullshit that it goes away by getting older,\nYour son is on its best age to being treated by braces,\nDo not compromise on this issue,Now you can fix this easily but in the future if you lose the time he might needs surgery for his chest to be fixed. Look up London Orthotic consultancy. They do free consult for bracing which your son should do Now is the best time for your son to get treated. His bones will be extremely flexible and will get a faster result. If he leaves it until say 15. He will still be able to get it fixed but now is the best time. Anytime over 16 can be a problem as sometimes the bones get extremely solid and it will be extremely hard to treat.\nLook up London orthotics consultantcy \"It goes away.\"... Like we all did not hear that... It actually gets worse. Those doctors should get sued, why do they talk about something that they do not know?

I have recently been denied any surgical option by 2 surgeons, so i am working to accept myself and my body. It is definitely noticeable through a shirt but not super severe. I have been working out and working on my posture a lot since i got the news. \n\nThe point of my post: I would accept advice on the mental side regarding how to accept it, but i am curious about how i should talk about it to people; eg if someone mentions it, if i ever hang with a girl and take my shirt off, what should i say? What words specifically? I assume acting cool and like it does not affect me is the best option and is the start of \u201cfake it til you make it\u201d, but i am not quite sure how to talk about it.\n\nCheers,\nHope Have you looked into bracing. Depending on your age between 15-16 is most effective. But adults can get one..depends on the flexibility. Perhaps you could like not get it 100% fixed but it could reduce the severity. \n\nAlso, yes it would seem difficult to talk to a girl about it. If they would love or like you that much. They wouldnt stop seeing you or dislike you due to a deformity that cant be helped.  Otherwise they are awful.\n\nIt is hard to talk to people, ik since I have talked to people about it. i am just wondering why they would deny you surgery?, it is okay if you do not want to answer. I am 23. Hit puberty a little late and babyfaced look around 19 but still. And it is asymmetric so one side is pectus excavatum. Mostly trying to know how to respond to casual remarks. Intimate 1 on 1 conversations are more straightforward and honesty is more important than casual remarks. Thanks for the reply It is asymmetric, my haller index is not bad, my heart and lungs are fine, there is slight pain but surgery would most likely not help the aesthetics much at all and would likely just cause more pain. Just not worth it, they say. So i trust them, i guess. I am happy to talk about it here. It is nice, everyone is in the same boat. The only place i really feel completely free to talk about (probably) my biggest insecurity. &lt;3 damm i am sorry mate, i think i also have asymmetrical pc. I doubt i will be able to have the surgery, anytime soon at least either, because i live in a small ass country. I have asymmetrical as well it is the worst kind cus at least if you are symmetrical you can cover it up a bit with muscle but asymmetrical retains the ugly imbalance no matter what. \n\nI am currently bracing but I feel you on the communication part. I think I never said anything explicit to any girls or people who saw me shirtless. I am sure many noticed but nobody said anything, maybe a few odd looks but that is about it. I think a few people like my ex gf and close friends I have told straight up but they really do not care or say it is nothing etc. my parents also struggle to understand why I care so much/ why I am going to the lengths of bracing to fix it. \n\nso I guess at the end of the day we have to realize it is mostly just in our heads and in like 99% of social situations nobody is noticing or thinking about your PC, so you kind of just need to let yourself chill out about it. I am sure aside from growing to accept yourself you can get fit to help with body acceptance. \n\nKind Of weird too but recently I have even had the thought of tattooing over the bump / deformed part. Like if I had a sick tattoo all over my chest that visually covered it then I am sure I would feel more confident about showing my chest off. Or at least that is what I think. But idk really lol. Ima see how bracing goes for me and in the end will prob just work out a lot first to look better Hi I am 17 would I still be able to get a brace? Ideally yes..it just depends on the flexibility of the chest. If you can press down the carinatum bump so it goes flat with ease. Then you can get bracing easily. Oh thank you I can push it down to a certain point but I feel it getting harder to do over time as I have done this for awhile,,does the brace need to be tight? If its getting harder from what you described. Your chest is getting less flexible was your chest wall is maturing. \n\nThis means you need a brace asap. The brace will.be tight. But it will be monitored if you go down the recommended specialist treatment. Bracing made by doctors. Otherwise. It may be hard My dad just told me we do not have medical aid nor the money so idk\ud83e\udd37 I noticed that you made a post talking about using a homemade brace. I have added some guidance and suggestions in the comments on it Thank you so much,,I am very demotivated right now\ud83d\ude46 No problem. If you are struggling to find a fix. Build chest muscle. Get cheap weights or even do press ups. \n\nSurgery could also be even more expensive aswell. so options are unfair. Hope you get something solved out. Good luck Thank you very much it helps having someone that knows something about it Sorry for the delay but in my experience, build muscles and even if its noticeable girls wont really care, at least my ex didnt Yes, man! Love this news. I have been working out a lot recently; even if the chest is a little off, being ripped is attractive on any guy. And my current impression is that girls are often as happy with my body as i am, so getting in shape helps double-y idk if that is a word lol.

Thx for the help, rlly appreciate ur input He is right,I wear the brace the entire day except when I am asleep.it is uncomfortable but not to bad.and you dont want to miss the window for bracing. how do you get put onto the brace? is it just a consultation with your doctor who may take an x ray and discuss the options? First I went to a family doctor so he can refer me to someone who knows what he is doing, it took many appointments and different doctors for me to find one that knew about pectus. For me he took x-ray and I had to do a blood test. Now I am just waiting for someone to call that my family doctor referred for me.", "Pectus surgeon here. I made a similar thread in the excavatum subreddit, but I figured there not be a lot of crossover between the subs. So AMA! We do not operate on these most of the time, but I am happy to answer any questions you may have about how we treat these.  Do you do anything or can you with the actual ribs if they are pushed out because orlf the costal cartilage growth? More detail, i have pectus carinatum  on left ribs on all the ones connected to sternum, seems to have caused a could of the ribs under my nipple area to push out all the way arouns to my arm. There are 2 main options for treating pectus carinatum: bracing and surgery. To be a good candidate for bracing, the part sticking out needs to be below the second rib (around the upper limits or your armpits). Rib flare can also be treated with compression.  \n\nIf the rib cartilage is in the wrong spot for bracing or the patient has too much pain when the brace is applied, then it usually needs surgery to fix. The surgery is called a Ravitch procedure, and we resect all the abnormal costal cartilages. We also often have to remove a wedge of the sternum to straighten it out.  This also requires that a bar be placed behind the sternum to support it. We do not usually take out parts of the true ribs (the bony part).\n\nHope that helps. Do the ttue ribs ever shift back into the proper place after removing the abnormal cartilage? Or are you or have you been able to adjust the true ribs? Also im 33. Can anything be done for fibrous non union after a ravitch procedure? When you remove the carilage you leave the outer layer, called perichondrium.  The cartilage will grow back from this in a normal configuration within a few months. More details are required, but if there is a segment that grows back abnormally it can be revised if needed. I do not operate on anyone over 25 (I am a pediatric surgeon) so I do not have as much insight into the healing patterns of people older than that for this particular procedure. It is my son.  He is 23 and had the procedure done 2 years ago.  The first time one of the plates broke and so it was removed but nothing was put in to replace it.  Since then he is had constant pain, clicking and popping.  They are possibly going to revise it again but say \u201conly if there is enough tissue\u201d. That type of repair is pretty patient specific. Were the plates made of titanium or were they absorbable? I have never seen a metal strut break before, so I am curious about how that happened. The plates were titanium.  2 on the sternum 1 across the front of the ribs.  The OR report stated that the bar broke but the surgeon told us a pin came out and knocked the bar out of place.  You could see a pin poking at the skin from underneath (this was as soon as he woke up in recovery the first time).  So it was removed a month later and he is had awful problems ever since.  Since the surgeon told him \u201cif there is enough tissue\u201d he is been really worried he might be in pain forever. How many surgeries have you performed on patients with Pectus Carinatum? I am an 18 year old male and my sternum is still flexible, is it too late for me to wear a brace? Also does the bracing method work just as good as the surgery? It is not too late, but older patients may need to wear the brace for a longer period to get the results they are looking for. The results are usually very good, and if it does not work you can always get surgery later. Maybe a half dozen total. Honestly the bracing works so well that it does not come up very often. It is usually for people with carinatum defects up towards the collarbone, too much pain with bracing, or people with a combined defect (arcuatum). We have an entire clinic just for bracing and adjustments run by the nurse practitioner. If they need me then they have got something pretty severe. Repair for something like that would definitely be an ordeal. Would likely have to take out all of the old hardware and look at the old areas of cartilage resection and possibly revise them. Then you have to think about putting new plates in and what could happen to those. Again I am sort of backseat driving here, but I definitely understand their reluctance. The hardware in the sternum is apparently fine (according to the surgeon).  Hopefully they can do something, the pain is bad enough he is taking opioids to deal with it.  Just waiting for a date now, COVID put lots of surgeries back (as I am sure you know).  He has said another plate might have to go in and will not be able to be removed ever.  As long as it stabilizes things and helps with the pain he is happy for it to stay in.  Thanks for your replies.  That sounds like a lot to be going through. Best of luck. I am glad you have made this post! I am 19 yrs old with pectus carinatum (likely caused by my ehlers-danlos syndrome). I have been unable to find a doctor who even knows what pectus carinatum is really. My doctor said it was probably \"barrel chest\", but after some research, it is obviously pectus carinatum. After about a year of trying to find a thoracic surgeon that treats pectus, I finally found one that is within Texas and in my insurance (Scott Reznik if you are curious). They want for me to get a chest CT  scan with contrast \"to see whether or not Dr. Reznik can treat me\". I originally had my CT scan scheduled for tomorrow, but I cancelled it after I reassessed my condition, and I am now unsure whether or not I really need to treat my pectus. My pectus is more significant than many of the photos that I see on this sub I would say. The most annoying part is that I have rib flare as well, which sticks out to the point that it is rather uncomfortable (especially when laying flat on my back). My question to you: is it ok to leave this condition untreated? I cannot find a definite answer online. Most sites say that pectus carinatum very rarely causes adverse health effects, but I also hear that it can possibly cause some cardiopulmonary abnormalities. I am also concerned that it could interfere with CPR, since it widens the gap between your sternum and your heart. Personally, after my pectus developed more, I have had muscle spasms in the chest area, strange popping (probably the cartilage) and palpations every so often (could be unrelated). I do not want to expose myself to the contrast and radiation that goes along with a chest CT scan, or spend possibly thousands of dollars on a brace or surgery if I really do not need to. Also, my pectus is asymmetrical so I am not sure if bracing would work. I have really worried about this for over a year now, so any information or advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! EDS patients are very difficult to treat. They do not heal wounds well. Their bones are sort of elastic, so multiple bars, struts, etc. Are required to approximate the defect. If it is in the right location, PC in these people can still be braced. The duration is usually longer and the risk of recurrence is higher. Not sure how much the CT really helps with treatment, since either you are bracing or just cutting them out. Most PC patients are asymmetric and bracing works just fine. I would seek out a place with experience in both EDS patients and chest wall anomalies. Let me know if there is anything else I can help with. Thank you for your reply! I should have maybe left the EDS bit out, since it has not been officially diagnosed. I had a genetic test done, and it did find that I had a variant in connective tissue but it is a variant of unknown significance. My doctor just thinks it is hypermobile eds based on my physical characteristics and hypermobility. That being said, skin issues should not be a problem. Unfortunately, since I am over the age of 18, the thoracic surgeon I mentioned above was the only one I could find that could treat me (in accordance with insurance). I am just wondering if you had any thoughts as to whether or not it is ok to leave PC alone. I find that many people just get the bracing treatment done to make their appearance look better, but I am not self-conscious about my PC. This is probably a better way to phrase my question: Based on what you know, is PC purely cosmetic in most cases? Honestly, if I knew that it was purely cosmetic and did not cause any adverse health effects, I would leave it alone. I know it is probably impossible for you to give me a straight answer because every case is different, but any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks again! Most likely, nothing bad is going to happen to you as a result of having PC. The most common presenting complaint is pain, either from the joint or from putting pressure on the skin. Although it is still possible to develop that later, if you feel fine right now there is no reason to rush out and get treated if the appearance does not bother you.  Hope that helps. Yes that does, thank you. I am a 20 year old currently struggling with bracing( it hurts sooooooo bad.) Do you perform surgeries on people who cannot brace because of pain? Or simply because surgery is a better option for some cases? And what hospital/university do you work at? I have been self bracing for a while now. Started doing it at 16. Got my chest in a normal position. But recently at 20 years old it is started popping back out again. I have been getting more persistent with the bracing, but it is getting harder to push back in, and it starts popping out right away. Is it to late to fix? Also is there always a risk of it popping back out after bracing? If I wear the brace for half the recommended time by the doctor, will there be any correction? Trying to keep things relatively anonymous here, but I am happy to give some details via PM. I mentioned in the PE thread that I am not here to drum up business - I noticed that there was a lot of misinformation floating around I saw an opportunity to help everyone learn more about the condition.\n\nAnd to answer your question, intolerable pain with bracing is an indication to proceed with surgical repair.  The technique is called a Ravitch procedure. It is hard to gauge whether continued bracing would be helpful or not. In our clinic we measure the amount of pressure required to push the defect back in. If the pressure is excessive it is likely to result in significant pain and a poor result. The surgical repair can be done at anytime, but nothing bad will happen to you by waiting. The time we usually recommend bracing starts off at a few hours a day and goes up to 10 or 12 depending on the severity of the defect. I cannot tell you how well the brace will work with less time, just that it will not work as well as it would otherwise. Since the process can take a year or two, seems like it would be worth it to give it your best shot. Great. Thanks for the response homie. It does hurt pretty bad, and it is been causing skin issues, but its definitely still doable. I am just worried that even if I get it in a normal position if it will just pop back out sometime in the future. It stays in a relatively normal position for maybe 8-9 hours. But after that it gets noticeably worse. I have been wearing it just to sleep, so for 9-10 hours a day. And It is been staying in longer, and popping out less throughout the day, the more consistent I wear it at night. But is there always a risk of it popping out in the future? And at this point should I be bracing more than just 9-10 hours seeing as it does pop out (a little) during the day? I think you should try and get a real assessment with measurement of pressures with custom brace fitting. It is hard to determine whether your brace is really doing its job without making sure it fits properly. If it hurts too much at the required pressure that is a reason to pursue repair. Well it works, as in it puts my chest in a completely normal position. It just slowly pops out (a little) within maybe 6-7 hours when I take it off. I am just wondering if I should be wearing it longer. And how long I should wear it for. Just do not know how the bracing process works. I understand that your supposed to wear it in increments. Like first 24 hours, then 23, etc etc. I do not know what point I am at in that process. I would say that if you are still trying to brace after 4 years without lasting results it would probably be worth having someone take a look and making sure there is not something that would be a better fit for you. Can i have pectus carinatum surgery at 25  ? Yes you can. 100%. Just make sure it is someone who knows what they are doing. &gt;Yes you can. 100%. Just make sure it is someone who knows what they are doing.\n\nI do not know how can i make sure of that. I am from Egypt so its kind of hard to find a good doctor i guess i only have seen 2 that makes this surgery. Thanks for offering to answer questions in this community.\n\nI was wondering why you were saying that if Pectus Carinatum occurs at the second rib, then surgery is the only option. Is that because it is hard to wear a brace and put enough force at such a high point in the chest?\n\nHere is mine, I am 31yo, my Pectus is at the second rib, you can see a sharp angle where I annotated with the red arrow:\n\n(\n\nThanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc The braces normally have a strap that goes around your torso to provide opposing force to compress the carinatum. There are some workarounds but it is not as effective once you get above armpit level. Also being in your 30s means that more of you is bone, so more force is required to push the parasternal cartilage back. We check the amount of force required to push back and determine if someone is able to wear a brace accordingly. Sometimes with too much force you get pain and skin breakdown issues. Would see if there is anywhere available to check it out nearby for a full evaluation, since I do not normally treat patients over 25. I went to a thoracic surgeon a few years ago to ask about surgery, what he told me made me not want surgery but he mentioned bracing but said by then, I was 19 I was way passed that point, but having just discovered this subreddit and having learned that you can still get bracing if you are chest is flexible I am very frustrated by the fact the surgeon had not even bothered to check my chest\u2019s flexibility. I am going to a doctor this week to get a referral to see a specialist about bracing. I am 23 now but my chest is still flexible and I can push it down to about normal (what is really frustrating is that it was even more flexible 4 years ago when I saw that surgeon). Anyways, what should I tell the specialist this time if they are like the previous surgeon who said it was to late to brace without even checking my chest\u2019s flexibility? I feel like at 23 the window for bracing is likely closing rapidly and I want to make sure I get the chance, thank you! Hi Dr. we recently noticed our 2 year old boy has this condition (carinatum).. he has no other health conditions and is very active. As I researched this I noticed that this usually it is discovered when boys reach puberty. For babies can the condition get better or worse as they grow?  \n\nWe took him to his pediatrician and he is having blood work done to see if he has any type of vitamin/calcium difficiencies, but did not recommend surgery or the brace to correct it at this point. We will be following up with him after the blood work results come back.\n\nThank you for your guidance. Usually it is very rare to have to do anything to fix the condition in yound children. You risk causing problems with the rib growth in their chest if you do. Usually these kids are able to play and do normal activities without any trouble. One they reach teenage years if the defect is causing pain or the way it looks is affecting them, we usually evaluate for bracing at that time. Meanwhile your child will likely have a normal life without any impediments.  Hope that helps. I would look into whether they will measure the amount of force required to displace the defect backward. If the amount is too high the brace could result in significant pain or skin breakdown. If you are not a candidate for bracing, then surgery is an option depending on your symptoms and the effect it is appearance is having on you. There are lots of good pain control options for surgery, so it does not necessarily have to be a miserable experience. Thank you so much for the quick response.. this is really helpful \ud83d\udc4f Thank you so much for your answer! I am able to push my chest pretty much flat with one hand without much effort, do you think that means my chest is probably flexible enough for bracing? Sounds worth getting looked at. Our recommendations start at about 2 hours a day and gradually advance to around 12, so depends on ability to tolerate for that long. hello! thank you so much for doing this\n\ni was just recently diagnosed with pectus arcuatum at the mayo clinic after being misdiagnosed with pectus excavatum. \n\ni am very excited to finally get it corrected once it is my turn on the waitlist! \n\nfrom the studies i have read (and very possibly misinterpreted) i understand with this condition there is usually elongation of the 2nd and 3rd/4th/5th rib? depending on the patient of course. is this also common with other types of pectus? \nto me elongation makes it sound like the surgeon has to go towards the back of my rib cage to remove the access cartilage. is this accurate? (i know you cannot see my scans/access my case) \n\nmy pectus is also compressing my heart. i have a very hard time breathing but from my understanding it is not like i have ribs going into my lungs or anything. i am sure the compression of my heart plays a big role in my breathing issues, but what other effects, if any, can pectus arcuatum have on breathing? \n\nthank you so much i know i asked a lot The thing about the combined defects is that they are all unique. Symptoms are usually from compression from the excavatum component, although pain can be caused by either. In the end, the abnormal cartilage gets resected and you have to cut the sternum in order to straighten it. Good luck with your repair! I am late to the game here but here is my crazy quesion. I am an otherwise healthy 37 yo transgender woman and my Pectus causes me a lot of self esteem and body image issues to the point where it is depressing that I will never be able to have normal looking breasts because my pectus causes my breast tissue to form outward from my chest at a really weird angle to the point where bras are essentially useless. My nipples point out at about a 45\u00b0 angle from my chest. My pectus is not severe, I would say it is on the mild side but it made my self conscious as a man, and as a woman now it is constant frustration and sadness that I wont be able to have a reasonable expectation even with breast augmentation.\n\nMy question- what are my options to fix this? Is it possible to use a brace at my age? If not, Is there any the surgery could be seen as medically necessary due to it causing me emotional distress? If not, is it possible to pay out of pocket to have the corrective surgery done as an \"elective\" procedure? \n\nThanks for doing this AMA btw, it is really cool of you to give info like this. Btw, if you want to see my chest, it is actually easily visible in my profile photo, it is a bit nsfw tho. That photo was pre-hormones and the breast tissue that has since formed has pushed my nipples out significantly farther at this point. I am not sure what the rules are for people your age, but in younger patients psychological distress is significant when seeking approval. A brace is not likely to be effective unless the defect is minimal. The incision, number of cartilages needing resection, and sternotomy all depend on your specific anatomy. Usually ends up being an incision along the lower crease of the breast tissue/pectoral muscles with dissection up to remove cartilages.  Hope that helps. I am not too well versed in the different insurance/self pay options for adults. I am really glad to find this thread and thanks so much for doing this.\nMy son is 11 with a pectus Carinatum and we decided to go for a brace.\nAfter an appointment at the specialist we got 2 options \n1. Trulife brace purchased online for under 300$\n2. Custom made order at the office for 4000$\n\nWe chose the trulife brace only to find out it was huge on my petite kid.\nThe clinic says they will not let us use any other braces purchased elsewhere other than the 4000$ one from their office.\n\nAre there other options out there? The other bracing system we use is the Dynamic Compressor System. Our NPs  handle most of that so I could not really tell you about cost for them vs the Trulife. I would recommend a fitted brace, since every carinatum is different in location and the amount of force required to push in the defect. I do not know whether costs would be better elsewhere or how to pursue insurance coverage for it. Thanks. I think the higher end option we were provided was this Dynamic Compression brace. The design, although better than trulife, still looked bulky on my petite son. His Carinatum is under 2 and on his right side.\nAfter some research, I found Pectus emBrace that one of our local clinics provides. It seems like the best option for our case. We have an appointment coming up for the fitting and hoping it will work out.\nThanks again for getting back. No problem. I hope it works! Hi doc! I have read all your comments on this post (thanks btw, extremely informative), and saw you treat patients until 25, i am 22, athletic and with a mildly noticeable chest bump, but it has affected my respiration, cannot do sports as well as my peers, so: Can i still use the brace? , I noticed i had this thing like 3 months ago. Also, do the brace repairs the respiration problem, or just the aesthetic? Thanks again doctor, this thread's been very helpful. It is not clear how much the brace will help with your breathing, unless you are having trouble because of pain around the rib. I would find a specialist familiar with the condition, since they should be able to measure the amount of pressure required to push it back in and make sure you are a good candidate for the brace.  If too much force is required, you can end up with pressure ulcers or irritation from compressing the skin with too much force. Hope that helps. Perfect, thanks!! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04 How familiar are surgeons with braces? I went to a thoracic surgeon when I was 16 and he said he almost never operates on PC and if he does he uses only one procedure which he uses on PE. He never even mentioned a brace. Looking back I am mad as hell. I will soon be looking for a surgeon for my case, do you have any tips/suggestions? I am from central Europe (Slovenia) and my case is pretty asymmetric since it is pretty much only on the right side. Sorry you have had so much trouble getting treated.  I am not sure how familiar most general surgeons are with the condition, since it is relatively rare and does not often require urgent treatment. The braces can be effective if the force required is not too great and the anatomy is cooperative. Otherwise surgery is a better option. I would just try to figure out the physicians track record with treating carinatum and their familiarity with different types of braces. Wish you the best of luck. Thank you! Do you maybe know what are the prices for surgeries in Europe? Like a rough estimate? I have no idea. I barely know what our prices are. The equipment costs are around $3000, not including the bars (most of that is for the cryo).", "14F brace advice I went to a doctor about pectus carinatum and they confirmed it and said that it was mild to moderate. The doctor said to come back next year and if it gets a lot worse I could get a brace. I know it is not completely necessary, but I want to get a brace soon, so I do not regret it only. He also mentioned that he does not require patients to wear braces during the day, only at night. Any advice? I dont have an bad case of PC,but I can tell you that wearing a brace at night is no fun.now i dont know if being a female needs a different kind of brace or not.but with that said it IS totaly possible and I have done it on several occasions,just not fun at all.i find it easier to sleep with pillows around the brace supporting my body so no pressure is put on the brace.i wear my brace when possible/when needed during the day and have been for around 4 years.(I only wear my brace when needed and has been this way for somewhere around 8 months)sorry for the long message It is better to start young, most people's pc get worse aroundd 15 to 16 so you should probably get it as soon as possible. It is no fun as the person before me said, but worth it. I would wear it even through day a bit.", "do you think there is pectus ?  Looks like a mild case of Pectus Excavatum...  a sunken chest. But I am no doctor. It looks like pectus excavatum."]
