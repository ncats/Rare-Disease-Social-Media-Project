["How do you get tested for TMAU? Most doctors do not even know it exists. I do not think the lab in Colorado is doing it anymore. Is there a way to get tested.\n\nI am tired of assuming I have it and would love to know for sure. I have not gotten checked either. I was a medical technologist student - but was bullied by professor and students. It is hard to believe that they would not see it as a disorder but hygienic problem.\n\nMany wrote about doctors saying they do not smell anything but itch their nose when talking to us. An article said to find a geneticist since they are more attune to rare disorders. The thing is I do not think we are rare. We were mostly either not taken seriously or not able to find specialists for us. The procedure is that they give us a choline drink and test the urine (please ask for a blood test because there were some who had false negative with urine because they took certain meds/ diets that can interfere)\n\n ", "Considering full body detox  God damn \ud83d\ude02", "Anyone in Cincinnati Ohio have tmau ?

You just type in FM03 in the search bar, I think. Hold on, I will see if I still have my pdf saved\n\nedit: I found it, I have 2 copies of rs2266782. There are more rs codes, but this is the only one in my report. - I am pretty confused about it. I typed in FMO3 and there is loads of different rs codes on the list. Are they all genetic mutations, then? I have  rs2266782 but there is only 1, does it need to show twice? No idea, I am definitely not knowledgeable on what it all means. I just know that there are lots of rs numbers for the FMO3 gene. I would try to find a geneticist or someone who is well read on genome reports. I did a 23andMe test too. There are multiple relevant RS codes. You are not looking if you HAVE the RS code, cos everyone has the same RS codes. You need to look at the letters like G&gt;A or T&gt;T. That is where you will find the differences. \n\nWhat type of smell do you have? \n\nI have an interview tomorrow so am busy prepping fir that, but sometime tomorrow evening I can send you my letters for the various FMO3 RS codes. Please message me to remind me :) Does there need to be a difference after the RS code e.g G&gt;A for it to be TMAU? I actually cannot smell it myself, that is what makes it so tricky to draw any conclusions, but sometimes when I sweat loads after a workout, especially day after eaten fish, my mates will tell me it stinks or someone makes a passing comment like \u2018smells like fish\u2019, but like they do not realise it is actually me. Its weird how it comes and goes. \nThanks for messaging about it - Best of luck in your interview Thank you :) \n\nFor each RS code, there will be a \u2018normal\u2019 arrangement of the letters that most people in the world have. If we have a very rare arrangement of the letter then it could be that gene responsible for/ contributing to TMAU. \n\nSo maybe for a made up example, for RS12345, 99% of the population have T&gt;A, but we could have A&gt;T, which would imply we have a fault in that gene. \n\nThe letter arrangement is not the same for every RS. So to continue the above example, RS2468, 60% of people might have TT, 39% of people might have AA, but only 1% of people have AT. \n\nSo it is a case of doing research:\n\n(1) which RS codes are relevant to TMAU?\n\n(2) what are the \u2018normal\u2019 letter arrangements for those RS codes that most people have  \n\n(3) what do we have compared to the normal letters \n\nI hope this helps Also I think I get fecal only, and only twice I can think of I MAYBE smelt of fish but not even sure I did.

Litwin Family Centre in Genetic Medicine at the University\r\nHealth Network (UHN; Toronto, Ontario, Canada), a retrospective on 54 patients who came in seeking a diagnosis of tmau. Only 2 of them were found to actually have tmau, ~80% were deemed likely to have ORS:\n\n\n\n\nThe abstract: \"Olfactory reference syndrome (ORS) is a rarely diagnosed psychiatric disorder in which individuals falsely believe that they emit an offensive body odor. This retrospective cohort study characterizes the clinical and demographic features of 54 individuals who presented to a Canadian genetics clinic for query trimethylaminuria (TMAU), an inherited disorder in which a pungent fishy odor is produced. The majority (83%) were found to have a likely diagnosis of ORS and a high rate (73.3%) of concomitant psychiatric disorders; only two patients were diagnosed with TMAU. This study highlights the genetics clinic as an unexpected and major ascertainment point for ORS, and shows that ORS can be differentiated from TMAU by age of onset (~28 years), odor characterization (refuse-related), and the presence of associated comorbid psychiatric diagnoses. There is a low diagnostic rate of ORS, attesting to the need for improved education and awareness. \"\n\nIt is behind a paywall but you can find it on scihub if you want to read.

It is definitely worth taking to a psychologist anyway, as TMAU and associated disorders go hand in hand with anxiety disorders, paranoia and panic attacks. It is good to have someone to help you develop resilience and coping strategies. That said, I think its probable that a person could develop symptoms akin to ORS even if they do have TMAU - just that constant paranoia is bad enough. I think on a good diet the smell is not nearly as present as we think it is, and that is something we can work on.\n\nOne of the big takeaways from the study: \"The major-\r\nity of individuals in our ORS cohort self-detected their odor (56%) and perceived that the indirect comments and actions of others were in reference to their odors (68.9%; Fig. 2A). In contrast, only 13.3% of ORS patients reported that others had confirmed that they detected the purported odor through direct comments or when questioned\"\n\nThere is a big difference between direct confirmation and indirectly assuming from people's actions.\n\nI think it is best to have a buddy system, where someone you trust can tell you if you are smelling that day. A friend, a family member, a work colleague in the know. If you cannot find anyone who can honestly tell you that you smell, it probably means that you do not. I thought I had ORS and started antidepressant treatment for it, but then had people asking me if I had just farted anyway. And my urine still smelled strongly fishy. I have never detected a body odor myself, just people say I smell like fart, or when I am sweaty, fishy. It is probably not the worst thing in the world to have some psych sessions and antidepressants for a bit anyway, they can help frame things for you and develop coping strategies better than randoms on the internet. I have done it myself on and off as well.\n\nI know I went through an extended period thinking every smell that someone could smell was mine, which caused me to worry and stress sweat and actually starting to smell for real. Fair enough, antidepressants are useful for some. I did focus less on how people perceived my smell. But, I was mentally foggy and tired all the time, as many antidepressants are sedating.

How does it work out in terms of working with people and having an odor issue? Would really like to hear experiences as I am trying to figure out what kind of job I should try to get after I move with my partner. I work in dental lab. Chemicals and dusty. I would pray what work to do. That is how I found my job. Optical shop, a lot of close 1 on 1 interactions. Could be a lot better I work overnights so thankfully not many custoners I work in an office. Mostly everyone is on a cubicle. My officemates are the WORST! God tell me about it. How bad are yours? Anything new happen lately? I am so excited to be free the end of this month. Pretty bad... I get called stink on a regular basis and now someone sprays perfume in my office every time I open my mouth, I am not exaggerating. I have allergies. One day someone kept spraying all day and my eyes got watery, I was sneezing, felt nauseous from the obnoxious spraying. \n\nThe air conditioner is turned down to arctic cold about 10-15 minutes after I arrive in the mornings even during the cold winter months. No wants to sit next to me in meetings. People sit in any seat that is not next to me. I feel bad for the ones who are late to meetings. I have seen people stand instead of taking a seat next to me. \n\nThe emotional distress of it all is a nightmare. I am an older adult and I feel like I am working with middle school aged children. The passive aggressiveness  and the disrespect is despicable. It is baffling how people can laugh at a person with this condition. I am the one that has to live with this thing and the insults from strangers etc., yet I empathize with them. I do not want anyone to have to work in an office that smells like shit. How does one concentrate? I just wish the same sympathy and consideration could be given to me. It is not easy to sit there listening to people be mean, rude, down right disrespectful and cannot fight for fear of losing your job.   \n\nI have stood up to he bully before but most times it does not work. \n\nI have had people sniff as they walk behind me or past me. I have had a team member say loudly it smells like shit over here several times. I overheard one coworker say anyone who smells like the should be fired. I could go in and on. The behavior is the same in every office. What kind of work do you do? This is why instead of possibly going into accounting or even trying my hand at data science, I work entry level healthcare jobs where smells are not as noticeable.

Cannot do that anymore. \n\nI think this should be considered a sort of disability and that disabled people should come first when it comes to selecting employees for remote jobs. \n\nI am a younger woman and think the odor is almost excused a bit more because of the fact, and I fear how it will be received once I am older. We are in every way robbed of our personhood, made to feel bad for taking up space, and what is worse is we can only feel guilt and shame for our illness and remorse for those who have to be near us. I cannot think of anything more degrading. This truly is a miserable existence. \n\nI am so sorry you have to go through this. Do you have a partner who understands? I do and hope everyone with this problem can find at least one person to be on their side. We really need someone to make us feel human again. Tomorrow\u2019s Friday thankfully. Happy Friday!!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83d\ude2c\n\nThank you for the sympathy. I appreciate it. I agree this condition should be classified as a disability. No, I do not have a partner but I am so happy to know that you and others have a significant other that is supportive. My immediate family do not smell anything. They are supportive but to a certain extent. It is hard to empathize with someone when you do not see proof of what they are saying is true. Did that make sense? LOL LOL Anyway, I am not going to disclose what I do because the forum is public. I will say that the field that I am in the work is based primarily in an office setting and there is a lot of meetings and team interaction involved. It sucks and affects all areas of life. I agree. This should be considered a disability and it deserves more recognition. People who have this should not have to fear of losing their job. People who also have this should be allowed to file complaints against those who say rude comments. It really needs to be addressed more to the public.

Do you think he has this disease? Should I explain this to him in case no one else ever has? Nah. He probably knows. Honestly, for me at least, I would want to hear it. Yes, he probably knows, but hearing from someone who is sympathetic about it with no malicious intent sounds like heaven to me right now. I feel like you including the fact that you know he takes care of himself and he could not control it is 1000000 times reassuring. I would love to hear from someone saying they know it is not my fault. I hate when people tell me I need to shower, especially knowing that I never leave the house without having done so. You are such an angel. Thanks for not being rude about it :). But if I know he cannot control or change it, what would be the point in telling him I wonder?

People being mean to you must be so immature. That is their problem not yours. They are the ones with issues. Not you. I would love someone to be honest with me and offer to help me figure it out.

It is not something I knew about until it personally affected me and that is why I try no to get so mad at everyone else. I am glad you are mature enough to realize that. I do not want to get to know him. Not for that reason, but for other reasons, I am just not interested. But, should I let him know for the future? You should let him know, and the fact that you even know what TMAU is is HUGE.

What did he smell like?", "Trimethylaminuria and Dating. Trimethylaminuria is.a genetic condition that causes the body not to metabolize choline properly. A secondary variant which is not genetic also exists. The condition has debilitating pyschological effects. One of these effects is the destruction of the social aspect of sufferers' lives. That creates a major problem since humans are social beings. Sufferers tend to shy away from interaction with others because they are afraid or ashamed of the people's reactions to their malodor. This is a challenge that members of the trimethylaminuria community have pointed out. The quality of life of sufferers is thus adversely affected. TMAU not only affects the social and psychological aspects of sufferers lives but also the economic aspect.\n\nTrimethylaminuria sufferers find it hard to date. The malodor that accompanies the condition is repulsive to non-sufferers and this is a turn off to them. The dating pool of sufferers threfore shrinks and they are limited to dating other sufferers. However this does not apply to all sufferers. Some in the TMAU community have had success while dating non-sufferers. The ones who tend to find it challenging to date are usually teenagers and early twenty year olds. Sufferers can and should try date anosmics since they can not smell the sufferers odor. It is not just the smell itself.\n\nI have found occasionally that can I attract someone, but then the thing is they will not want you anywhere near their friends or family which is pretty humiliating.\n\nOther potential love interests will think you are diseased and will catch something off you. As a Tmau confirmed type 1 (parents concerned about me as a baby, lots of tests as a young child, genetic confirmation ~9 y/o), I have been in several long term relationships, two ~ 4 years, been married for 6 years - all of them have been, from what I can tell, normal relationships with normal people. I have also had several fairly short term things in my late 20s.\n\nGet your diet right and your hygiene right and it is not as big of an issue as it seems. A strict no fish no eggs no offal has carried me through most of it. Limited dairy sometimes. I eat all the rest of it, but would maybe limit red meat, soy, legumes and brassica veges if it were getting out of hand.\n\nI guess I am lucky in that I have almost always known, so I have not gone through adolescence not knowing what was wrong? Also being able to explain on a 2nd date that \"I am sort of allergic to fish\" and elaborating from there. My partners have been somewhat instrumental in keeping me aware of how I am going with my diets - full disclosure on if I am flaring up, etc. It is probably not the most romantic thing but once it is discussed it rarely comes up as a topic again, apart from food choices.", "Having TMAU and any chronic body odor issue is such an isolating existence.  I just discovered that certain fruits mask odor created from food. Peels from certain fruits like peach is sometimes used in tea for the aroma. I think the peels in the fruits help neutralize odors.

I have a doctor appointment next week but beyond that...if they dont have any suggestions for me idk what im going to do There is a solution to TMAU type 2. I am posting this in every fricking tmau post because I want everyone to know!!!!!! I spent a long time dealing with this crap and would not have found a solution was not it because I spent countless hours looking fora solution on the internet. I cannot even believe that this is not talked about that much. Kombucha or other probiotic foods like kefir (not those shitty probiotic pills your buy at the store), can help you cure your TMAU and it did for me. I used to suffer so much because of this, and you can solve it very easily if you take what I just told you. Pm me if you want to know more. There is hope for you. I promise you can be happy again. I am lactose intolerant. What other probiotic stuff can I get?? To be honest I do not know. I do not even know if that can be solved. I am ignorant in that topic.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that I am not really lactose intolerant, but I still avoid milk cause that shit is terrible for my body. When I drink it, I get huge pimples - which is enough of a reason to avoid it for me.\n\nMy take is to just avoid it. Shit that gives you pimples cannot be good I guess. (I wish i knew more, but all i can tell you is that in my experience, that shit did not do any good to my body)\n\nI told my gf about milk causing pimples, and when she tried removing it, her face cleared up and she had less than half the pimples she had before. The guy does not really know what he is talking about. He says in other threads that he \"homegrows\" his own kombucha and kefir. \n\nHe does not, because home-growing/brewing requires research and if he actually did research, he would know that kefir is *99% lactose-free*. This is because bacteria in kefir consumes lactose. There are also other options such as ( if you want to go that route.\n\nAlso, there has been a ( stating that kefir can indeed help with lactose tolerance and digestion.\n\nIn any case, feel free to give kefir and kombucha a shot. Yet, also make sure you do your due diligence and proper research in methods that you try. Kefir definitely made things worse for me. I need to stay away from foods which are high in choline and Kefir, lactose or not is rammed with the stuff. terrible mistake.  Kefir is outstanding in producting new bacteria colonies, Yeah it has conline but poison was the cure for me then.  It works. I would not back down from drinking kefir at all.  you have terrible gut bacteria,  where do you think Tma comes from? watch my videos and educate yourself.  I am here to help.  I one of the few people on earth that have cured themselves and have the proof.", "I am healed from TMAU (a matter of faith)   \n\nI am healed from TMAU\n\nI was a teacher at a local high school. All of a sudden, like the mist that comes up from a body of water, or the heavy smoke that comes out of the pipes of a cargo ship or those of a factory, out of my body (my armpits, my torso) came out a nasty smell like rotten eggs, or like putrefied fish. I was in front of the class and my students started to cover their frowned faces in disgust. Teenagers are honest in their display of emotions, so I felt terribly embarrassed. I did not know what to say, I just continued to teach despite the circumstances. This happened repeatedly, to the point that my brain dreaded to be in a classroom with students. Sometimes the smell was worse than others. I had to keep my arms glued to the sides of my body as if protecting my armpits from releasing that outpouring of stuff coming out like a fountain of gas. I made an urgent appointment to see my PCP. He could not come up with a diagnosis, so he prescribed a soap bar. I was so disappointed that I just walked out of his office and took off. The problem persisted, and I could not see myself quitting my job. So, my immediate action was to take a couple of extra blouses of similar color to the one I wore every morning to work so that I would change every so often. In the meantime, I would engage in a frantic search for an answer. I visited other doctors and nurse practitioners, but no one could help me. No one knew about this. I prayed to God for a diagnosis and a treatment, and I kept reading to find an answer. I found out that complex carbohydrates worsened this condition, so I started to eat only simple carbs, and as a consequence I lost a lot of weight. For a petit woman that was detrimental. Then I learned that enzymes may help. So I bought the strongest kind, and treated myself starting with two capsules per meal. It worked wonders. No more offensive odors in the classroom. But with time, my body developed resistance to that dose, and I had to increase it to three per meal. This became a cycle, and I ended up increasing the dose more and more while my budget was affected. I came to the point that I was taking 26 capsules with each meal. That was 78 capsules daily, and 546 a week. when I went out to eat, I had to excuse myself before the meal to go to the bathroom and take that amount of capsules with tap water. I was afraid that when I had to travel, I would have to use a suitcase only for the enormous amount of bottles of enzymes in it, and afraid that it may be confiscated at customs. I decided to see specialists: the endocrinologist, the gastroenterologist, etc., to no avail. In time came in the mail a brochure from a program from my medical insurance called \u201cAdvanced Medical\u201d saying that if I am not satisfied with the services of my providers, I can participate in a program to take steps further to find out about my condition, and that is what I did. I was matched to a scientist in California (I am in Florida) who knew about TMAU, the founder and president of the Institute of Human Biomolecular Investigation. My urine was tested in his lab, and he wrote a couple of reports on this disease, what seemed to be a genetic mutation: Trimethylaminuria. I learned that the lack of FMO3 enzyme caused the nasty odor. It was like the waste management truck not collecting the trash of a whole office building for a day. Obviously, the trash would start rotting and smelling. Having a diagnosis helped me research about this disease and the population in the planet who suffered with this condition (condition, disease?). I learned that I had to live in isolation, and I found a group support on the web. I learned that many people around the world suffered what I had. One day, I heard a lady at church say that whatever disease we may have, we have to accept it if that was what God allowed us to have. I disagreed with that thought and walked out and went home to pray. I threw myself on the floor and started to pray:\n\n**\u201cHow can it be that the God who flung the stars in the vast universe with just speaking could not heal me? Nothing is impossible for You, God! Papa, I cannot take this any longer. I cannot have this disease and serve You as a teacher or anything at the same time. This odor is too offensive to people around me, and I cannot provide them a healthy environment being like this. In Jesus\u2019s name, heal me from this disease\u201d.**\n\nAnd I stayed crumpled on my knees until I had an answer. And I did. I was impressed in my heart with a gentle voice saying: \u201cTrust in God, and get up.\u201d The next day, as usual, I rushed out at 6:00 am to work. When I was at my desk, before 7:00 am, ready to have breakfast, I suddenly remembered that I did not have my enzymes. I knew I had three choices: go home and get them, would not eat the whole day, or trust in God and eat and work. I chose the third one and prayed:\n\n**\u201cDear Papa, have mercy on me. Cleanse my body.** \n\n**I want to fully depend on You.** **May this food be a blessing to my body. In Jesus\u2019s name.**\n\n**Amen\u201d.**\n\nAnd I ate, and taught the whole morning with a clean body. I was so happy. When lunch time came, I had a small conversation with God:\n\n**\u201cPapa, are You doing this for me today only because I do not have the enzymes, or are You healing me for good?**\n\nAnd the answer I got was:\n\n**\u201cMay it be done according to your faith\u201d.**\n\nSo I ate my lunch, and the rest of my meals everyday without an enzyme. I was healed. I had promised the Lord the night before never again to eat sugar in exchange for His healing. And that is what I have done since 2012. The Lord is faithful and good, and he can clean you, too. Sounds like you had the intestinal form of TMAU rather than the genetic variant. Congrats on the healing. Is there an intestinal form? Can you explain the difference TMAU1 is genetic you are born without the FMO3 enzyme that cannot metablize the TMA molecule there is no cure but you can reduce symptoms with a low choline diet and activated charcoal tablets ...secondary tmau or TMAU2 can be caused by a bad bacterial overgrowth in the gut producing too much TMA from the gut flora but can be cured through dieting and probiotics to replace the bad bacteria in your gut Thank you so much for your reply. Do you know if there is a test for the intestinal kind? And is it treated the way candida/SIBO is treated? (For example, Anti fungals or antibiotics, with diet and probiotics) Yes, TMAU 1 is genetic, TMAU 2 is the intestinal variant. Meboblog.com will tell you everything you need to know. Thank you Yeab I actually suffer from TMAU2 ive had fecal Body odor for the past 2 years only now seeing a specialist about it now ...im having a GI360 gut test to see what is going on ...I have had 3 TMAU tests all were negative but apparently its not great for showing TMAU2 from the gut ...il can send you the results they will not be back for over a month ...but the specialist im seeing is confident that a combination of strong probiotics such as kefir and a strict healthy diet can get the gut healthy with diverse bacteria....I think my gut microbiome was destroyed in my early 20\"s with very bad diet and high alcohol intake ...hope this helps \ud83d\ude4f I think that a candida overgrowth can cause the same as its a bad bacterial overgrowth of the gut too much bad bacteria can produce excess amounts of TMA that overwhelms your system and it gets released through your skin ....you should watch \"The Gut War\" videos on YouTube if you have those problem its a whole channel about this topic from a guy who had the same issue it has so much good info on TMAU2 ,dieting,  ect Beep.

If your liver is not able to process choline and other amines in your diet, even \"normal\" levels will give you malodor. This is why a severely reduced choline and low protein diet is one of the few ways to find relief, and even that is not 100% effective. \n\nTMAU2, I am not well versed on that form since I do not have it, but from what I have seen, modern urine testing is not effective for TMAU2 either.", "I just wish I could smell myself!I have been dealing with what I think is TMAU since I was 8/9 years old.

How are you dealing? When I sit in front of a fan, I smell it. Or, when I take a hot shower.. I smell it. It is not overwhelming, but light oddly enough.. I just try to put it in the back of my head. Starting a new diet today so hopefully that helps but will see try making our own kefir i assume u have tmau1 scince u started at a young age Thanks! What exactly does it do?  yea it worked my reactions went down alot  only had it for 2-3 months i am 14 so quite young  yea i have type 2 got it from eating shit. its bad i feel you man  boost your microbiome and helps reduce odor also cut out junk food fruit only diet have high chlorophyll foods and take some time to work on ur self Will store bought kefir work the same? yea but its better to grow your own as it is cheaper and you get stronger bacteria I am sorry what is tmau type 1 and 2 what is the difference?  What do you mean sit in front of a fan. You facing the fan and it is blowing in the direction behind you? Or does your back face the fan. Just wondering of the air flow. Genetic blood test? I live in LA thank you When I sit in front of it, with it on 3. Or, the highest setting. But is your face in the direction of the fan or the opposite. My face is in front of the fan. I will also add, I was not able to do this before and notice it. However, for some time I have been able to notice it. \n\nI will just turn the fan on, and sit in front of it. You just would pay attention, to if there are any off putting smells. For me it is fishy. Even after a shower, I still smell it. It is not overpowering, but it is enough for me to notice it. Interesting. May have to try that. I notice my smell when the wind blows very hard. I never really notice it any other time. Have you noticed any improvements? Do not feel alone... you are not. On the regular I cannot sh3ell myself , last only about 5 to 6 tonnes throughout the year lasting no more than a couple of seconds could I smell myself. Today I smelled myself for the first time in many months, I had some beans the other day... Forgetting I should not eat them.... All hell broke los loose with this smell. Since I cannot smell regular... I usually can tell that I smell by reactions I get... It has not failed so far. This will make you grow thick skin eventually...

You can simply comment mentioning tmau in jopes of his team sees it enough times.", "A while ago I got tested to see if I had TMAU and the result came back negative. My question is if it was negative for type 1 or for both types? I am still struggling with a horrible odor and was actually excited about the test because I was finally going to get help but the result came back negative. After that I just did not contact the doctors who did the test since I had lost hope. I made a recent appointment to see my doctor to explain to her that the odor has not lessened or gone away. I am glad my doctor was the only one who had believed me and tried to help me out by sending me with the geneticist to get tested. I was going to ask her to check my gut now to see if there are not any problems going on there and was going to ask her for a nutritionist as well to help me when it comes to eliminating choline. I just want to know really though if there is still a chance I have TMAU. The TMAU urine test is fairly poor at detecting TMAU. It only seems to detect the very very strongest cases. Most people come up normal on the TMAU urine test despite debilitating odor. \n\nIf the test worked well, it would pick up both type 1 and type 2. That Is because it is testing how much TMA your body is converting to TMAO as a percentage. Generally, Type 1 means that your body is not converting TMA well because of genetics and Type 2 means your body is not converting TMA well because of bacterial overload. \n\nEither way, the test should pick up TMAU type 1 and 2 because the symptoms are believed to be the same So what should I tell my doctor? I mean I know there is not a cure for it but I would go at least see if I can reduce the odor. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0fwhat else is there to tell them? I do not know. If they do not believe you smell then tell them very specific times and situations when people have said you smell.

If you do get a general practitioner that does not smell you, attempt to find another doctor who does. If they can not smell you, they may not be able to help you. They may think you are crazy. Be sure to let them know of your experiences, and etc. You can also ask if another nurse, can enter the room to see if they notice it. If they deny you, tell them to note it into your chart.

You need a reliable Internet Connection and educate yourself vie YouTube, Books etc. That is a really good investment / tip. It is a gamble, but as long as we are not putting an amount we might need in 5 years or whole stakes. It would be beneficial. I agree. Although I am Bullish at the moment with everything going on with certain stocks. I am trying to learn as much as I can and see where this takes me. TMAU is and has been simply awful, and unbelievable, but I have to say that through it my focus has increased by the grace of God and I realize I can do more than I thought I could.

I worked at an office prior to this pandemic and it is really hard for me to deal with people everyday. The stress that I am getting with my daily commute to the office is really unbearable sometimes plus the people at work. I am losing a lot of opportunities because of this condition and also because of my personality lol. I really cannot work with people and I have been messing up a lot.

I did my research and the first thing was I thought I had tmau. I changed up my diet cut out all the unnecessary food that tmau fed off. Worked out 4 times a week. Drank probiotic kefier.... and still the smell would be there.\n\nI did more research all over reddit and found out that nizoral 2%anti dandruff shampo help me out sooo much. I did not have tmau . I had a fungus yeast in my scalp / hair.\n\nTLDR: I thought I had tmau. smell came from scape / face from fungus . sweat would feed of it and would cause the smell. nizoral 2% anti dandruff has helped me !! That is great! I am happy for you !\n\nWas it prescription or over the counter ? over the counter What did the yeast make you smell like? And, what were the symptoms, besides smelling bad, that the yeast gave you? Dude I was the same. I knew my hair smelled but I did not know it projected that well. \nHas it completely fixed the issue? \nIt is still a light smell for me. What smell did you had? Yay! I am happy for you! What smell was it? the smell was from my sweat reacting with the bacteria / fungal from the scalp / hair ! even the smell from my face has gone ! Wow this is great news! I am happy for you i could just smell the odour around my face area, now imagine what my colleague would smell lol. I would just sit in the sun for about 5 minutes, go wash my face and the amount of oil and smell the of the odour is noticeable. \n\nCrazy that the sweat/fungus/bacteria from my scalp would spread to my face area as well. All this time I thought it was a overall body smell &gt; then i would notice my face would smell &gt; now it all makes sense the bacteria / fungus on my head would sweat down to my face causing both my head and face to smell, \n\nI have gone through hell to find out the pin point. But everyone is all different this was just my experience of dealing with this issue for over 5 years There would be days where I would place the palm of my hand on the middle of the head and leave it there for couples of seconds and the amount of oil and the smell of my palm was mouldy smell that would drip down to my face that would cause my face to smell too Still on day 3, will keep updated. smell has drastically dropped Did you  also notice the smell most in the morning? I would wake up and that was the only time I could smell it without rubbing my scalp lol I had always a mouldy dense smell from my head. Metallic smell from washing my face. There would be days where I would just move my head up to give myself a whiff of how i smell and yup, i can smell it just on my head area. have u gone to sleep with ur hair wet ? Happy for you! do you patm as well? Did you have a weird build up on your scalp as well? yes many build ups especially oil . try nizoral 2% the small red bottle . does not hurt try . many positive reviews of nizoral for fungus / bacteria . leave it on the scalp for a good 5-10 minutes Omg so happy it did not get in your eyes or anything! That is dope that you curved the smell. I feel like this maybe what I have. For the past 2 months the oil on my face has reeked. Almost like an oily sulfur smell. Super pungent.

There is a woman sighing right now as I am sitting maybe 5 feet from her and I cannot feel anything anymore. I want to quit my job immediately and work from home and stop caring. Even coworkers who are nice to me will make jokes about it while I am not around and even while I am in front of them because they think I am stupid because I do not talk because I am self conscious about my breath too. It is really bad now and only getting worse. I started skipping breakfast. I 'm thinking of skipping dinner as well. It must seem super anorexic, but there are some cultures that eat only lunch. I think eating efficiently will allow my body to process nutrients better. Also, there will be less choline. Get in touch with other sufferers like myself. You/we are not alone :) I totally understand and relate. I am sorry that you are going through this too. Yes, it is hell on earth. I am not proud of it but i turned to drugs (Meth is my drug of choice) to numb the emotional torment we have to go through everyday. It does help tbh but causes an array of other problems. I binge on shit foods that make it worse but when the alternative is still smelling horrible but being deprived then I am not too motivated to stick to any sort of diet. I totally feel for you and get your apathy. When i went to docotr about it the docotr thought i was just to shy to ask for a aids blood check beacuse tmau is also a blood check. She said i didnt smell to bad. Desribed smell as unwashed. Hey man, do not let it bug you. Those people are clearly immature and cannot understand that some people have a medical condition that can cause bad odour. I am not sure if I have it, but I have heard comments and seen reactions. Maybe try explaining it to people. Maybe even crack jokes about it and yourself and maybe then less people will say something. I have the mindset and attitude that if you do not like it, then too bad, hold your breath, lol. I just learned about this problem from a book I read (believe it or not, TMAU was the villain\u2019s motivation in a murder mystery.) As someone completely unfamiliar with what you have to go through, I can tell you:\n\n1. Human being make jokes about people they love for a number of reasons.\n\n2. If someone is being an asshole about this, it says more about them than you.\n\n3. Human beings get used to different odors once familiarized with them.\n\n4. What other people think of you is none of your business.\n\n5. If eating makes it worse, maybe IF or OMAD will help? I know it *really* sucks but,  do not limit yourself.\n\nI think you should  treat it like something that you cannot control but want to change.\n\nIf the worst thing people have to say about you is the way you smell (which you can try &amp; explain to them that you **are** hygienic &amp; have a condition) then you are doing pretty well. Do not let TMAU control how you navigate the world because you might not be  able to control how the world necessarily handles it (&amp; you never know) but you can control yourself. (Also, there are people who will look past what you smell like so please, do not let it limit you) I feel it too.  People are not nice about it.  Every committee I join is followed by everyone quitting.  People discount my opinions and recommendations or adopt them and attribute them to someone else because obviously the smelly person can not be smart.  Even my own family.  A masters degree and years of experience and getting things right seem to not count for anything.  Even the people at church will not sit next.  They actively encourage me not to participate.  I thought maybe it was my personality so I tried a few on and always the same.  Finally a therapist and the people at a temp job (accounting and project management) told me, and not in a nice way.  I am afraid to attend a group again, like a church, as I do not want to offend anyone and I just cannot take being shunned anymore.  \n\nSo now I eat vegan, gluten free, legume and nut free.  Basically fruit, squash, olives, root vegetables, some rice and spices.  I took up long distance hiking as being smelly is part of the package and because it entails a lot of sweating it out and has the bonus of keeping me in somewhat good physical condition.  And I swim twice a week to also sweat it out and clear the pores.  I work for myself as a photographer now so I can plan my own schedule and not eat or sweat it out as needed.   The working environment is physically more open and I do not need to be as physically close to people for any length of time.  Also, creative people are more accepting and I find that people are more accepting of the quirks of creative people.\n\nLooking back I now realize that I always smelled bad and it had been the last 10 years or so that most people judged me for it ( my mil was actively and openly against me from day one though it took me years to understand why).  I was a successful CPA in both public and private practice, a successful project manager and quality assurance specialist for software development for years.  People were never overly friendly, but not down right rude like they are now.  I was in Germany this summer and lots of people smelled.  So maybe it is a cultural thing.

Laxatives can cause lots of gas. This might be what they are reacting to. And if you have been constipated for a while it can take more than one trip to be totally flushed out.

Like itchy skin in the morning or you feel like hot flashes when the odor is worse? why did my font change, weird I have hyperhidrosis so I sweat a lot from my feet, hands, underarms, and pretty sure my downstairs area too lol. Oh I have definitely had people hold their breath around me \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d The hot flashes can be a whole body feeling or in random parts of my skin at any given time. If I leave a part of my body pressed against something for a few minutes or longer, say my palm pressed on the bed, when I remove it it feels like I can feel a large vapor release. I feel like hot flashing is like a warning sign to me smelling bad", "How I cured my trimethylaminuria (TMAU) type 2. Every TMAU 2 sufferer needs to know this. I used to smell fine. I could go to the gym and smell like I had just taken a shower. Until I got TMAU type 2.\n\nIt happened because I took way too high of an amount of choline supplements. One day, after taking a bunch of choline, I just smelled terrible and was sweating like crazy. A fish-like smell was being irradiated from my body and my brother told me \"you smell like shit.\"\n\nThe smell did not go away, and you all know how it goes. It was psychologically exhausting.\n\n6 months in, and I had found about activated charcoal and chlorophyll. These changed the game. They almost completely masked the odor. But I still had it, even if was just mild. I still had to avoid fish and caffeine because they made me sweat like crazyyy.\n\nAfter researching for like 10000 hours I read an article that said kombucha and probiotics could help because it was a microbiome problem.\n\nI got the kombucha, drank it religiously, and I am now 99% free of symptoms. (or maybe 100%? I do not know. But I have not smelled like fish in weeks)\n\nIt really works. If you are suffering from TMAU type 2, give it a go. And if you think you are suffering from type 1 (the genetic version) but are not sure, I suggest you try it. Maybe you actually have type 2 and just do not know it.\n\nThe cure for trimethylaminuria type II = probiotics. But beware, store bought probiotics did not work for me. Only Kombucha did.\n\nI hope this helps somebody. It saved my life.\n\nFeel free to pm me, I would love to know your story. Did you make your own kombucha or buy bottled kombucha?\n\nI have read the probiotic yield is potentially greater from homegrown rather than bottle or manufactured versions.\n\nIn any case, how often did you drink kombucha? What other lifestyle changes\u2014aside from avoiding choline and caffeine\u2014did you make, if any at all? Do you have tmau? Is it type 2 or are you unsure?\n\nI made homegrown kombucha and to be honest I would not rely on manufactured kombucha because you cannot be 100% sure it will work. \n\nI drank (and still drink) 2 BIG glasses a day. The more I drank, the faster my symptoms went away. At first I drank like 1 glass every 2-3 days, and it was not enough but helped. It was when I upped my dose when it finally worked.\n\nIf you need a quick relief from odor try activated charcoal or chlorophyll. They are bandaids, not a cure. But they REALLY helped when I had tmau. They reduced my smell by about 90%. Definitely try them if you are desperate. I am pretty sure they will eliminate or at least reduce symptoms for you. Interesting. Please explain your routine process of making kombucha without looking it up in Google. You can try riboflavin (B2) too. A strict diet that limits choline and L carnitine consumption and probiotics really helps. I know that limiting choline helps, but that is a pain in the ass. After taking kombucha I can eat as much choline as I want and I do not get an odor. It is kind of a lengthy answer. Could you please just use Google? You will get an answer in less than a minute. Here is a video where I talk about this  (  (  Here is a Video explaining how to win the Gut War and Beat TMAU I am having the same issue and it is ruining my life.

Anyway... I went to my annual doctor's appointment and told my doctor about TMAU and why I think I have it. She just listened to what I had to say and asked me reasonable questions. She said that she did not specialize in stuff like this and contacted some genetic doctor even though I told her I believed I had type 2 and not type 1. I guess I have a bunch of appointments set and a counselor now. I have heard countless doctor stories and how they call you crazy and whatnot. I consider myself lucky to not have experienced that. I encourage anyone who thinks they have TMAU to discuss it with their doctor because this way, more and more people will start coming out about it and medical professionals will have no choice but to do research on it and recognize it as an actual condition. TMAU needs more awareness and especially TMAU2. TMAU2 might just be a blessing in disguise to get us to eat healthier. That is what I am going to treat it as. Bruh if its in my country they going to send you straight to mental hospital lol That sucks. Maybe if people like me who live in the U.S. help spread awareness, it will also spread to other countries like yours. I hate being called crazy for this. We never going to spread enough awareness about this it is called a rare condition for a reason\nThere is very few people who have it so most doctors will never even hear about it good luck told my doctor i think i have it he blamed it on nerve damage due \nto covid That is interesting. I believe I have it because of an alteration of my hormones (puberty) and eating high-choline foods. They gaslight to get rid of you. It is criminal and abusive to be called crazy and sent to psychiatrists when what we need is a cure so we can live like everybody else. I sit at home yet again while my husband and daughter went to the movies, restaurant and grad party.  My husband also will not discuss it and gets angry. He sent me to psychiatrist too! He gaslights all the experiences and reactions I told him about and explains them away. All I can do is teach VIPKID and now that is going to end. I have no life and have to hide. I cannot do anything. I cannot even talk to people outside. It is hopeless and cruel that doctors and scientists won\u2019 t help. Because of the weird social dynamic no one will have a discussion about it, not even doctors. Our lives do not matter and are not worth the effort to find  a cure. No one can get past the wall of bad smells to even know us. I do not feel like a human. The daily pain is unbearable. lol wtf country u live in I live in thailand third world country with a shitty government I completely understand what you are going through. What I do suggest is finding some legit work at home groups on Facebook. They will have work at home job listing. I have worked at home for a long time and I finally found a field that I can make a living in and try to build a life for myself. I wish you all the best. What you have just described is what a lot of us experience day after day and it wears us down. I suggest taking care of your mental health. May we all one day find a cure or at least the ability to overcome these transgressions that people cause us to suffer. Thank you. I work teaching English to Chinese children. I love it.

Seems like a good supplement it have to help the GI bowels and absorb some excess impurities/nutrients.\n\nHas anyone tried this as part of their regiment successfully? I have actually had some success with husk. I warm up some water and put a serving of the husk and heat it to the point where it jells up, let cool down a little and drink it quickly while it warm. Psyllium Husk is an effective bulk forming laxative, which means it is good at making stools bigger, softer and easier to pass. It can help you evacuate your bowels properly rather than having an incomplete movement. If you do not like the taste of the powder form then you can take it in capsules like I do. Remember to drink plenty of water when you take Psyllium Husk because if you do not, it will make your constipation worse rather than better\n\nPsyllium Husk is not known for absorbing impurities or nutrients. Activated charcoal is known for doing that. Ah I see. I assumed the fiber itself had some sort of affinity for nutrients to an extent.\n\nYou think charcoal absorbs longer oil molecules?

How difficult is it? If so, what tips might you give me. Nope So there is no hope what so ever in having a relationship then. I think there is hope. Maybe you can find a girlfriend who is vegan and anti animal abuse. It is difficult to be a woman with this condition. By the way I am a heterosexual woman. \nVegan Men... \ud83d\ude05 Wow!

We met online via a blogging website unrelated to TMAU and hit it off I guess. I mean there were ups and downs ofc but it was fine. We met 4 years ago and have been living together ever since and he does not care about the odor. I remember easing him into it while it was still long distance and we had not met yet, saying I think I have a stomach issue that causes \u201cstale\u201d breath, and he responded \u201cIt is not your fault\u201d.  He smells a bit too actually, but it is a close to the skin smell, sort of yeasty, like cradle cap. But his does not fill up an entire room so he is able to work without problems unlike myself. Any questions and I am all ears! I got this condition a few years into a relationship, and hes never been able to detect the odor off me. His family is kind of the same way, the only ones who could were the ones who rarely visited us.\n\nDates are really difficult because of the fear of being around other ppl.... but not impossible.

According to a study \"Individuals Reporting Idiopathic Malodor Production:\r\nDemographics and Incidence of Trimethylaminuria\"  (behind a paywall, use scihub to get access, or buy it) they test 353 people who were malodorous, and found 118 with TMAU.\n\nOf those 118 people:\n\n\"Before choline challenge, experimenters noted a mild fish odor on the palms of the hand for approximately 5% of the trimethylaminuria-positive patients, but no malodor noticeable at social distances. \n\nAfter consumption of choline, fishy odor was noticeable at social distances for approximately 10% of positive patients.\"\n\nIn the \"normal\" predosing situation, only 5% of people actually had a smell present, and only if the experimenters went in for a deep sniff. After ingesting  5 g of choline bitartrate, that went up to 10%, in people that have TMAU. It is not a high chance, even after dosing. \n\nIt is posited that this is why sometimes visiting the doctors office will result in a negative, because the smell is not always noticeable. \n\nIt is an older study and no genetic testing was done, but it is interesting none the less. \n\nSays a bit about how much we probably catasophize it in our own heads as well. I wonder how much of it is driven by insecurity created by one fucking arsehole in our lives. I wish this was the case for me. But I have been threatened to be fired or fired from literally every public facing job I have had in the past because of the symptoms. It is not in my head. I still do not know if I have it and likely will not for a long time. But what I can say about my experience is that it is not constant. I can hang out with friends and family and things can be normal for minutes or hours at a time, almost as if it comes and goes. No. Sorry. Not like that for me. It IS terrible. I am not thinking it is worse than it us. I am shocked it is as bad as it is. It is horrifying. This disease is disabling. We are not paranoid because if one jerk. It is all social situations for me.

This for me basically started about 8 years ago. I was just out of college when it started to come on. Every few months for a day I would smell like rubbish, for no reason I could figure out. It drove me crazy trying to figure out what was going on.\nI would think it was my feet, so replaced all my shoes. Then thought it was the washing machine making my clothes smelly, so I replaced that. Then thought it could be my clothes dryer so stopped using it. Nothing helped so I figured it must be me.\nI went to see a doctor about a year later as by that time it was pretty much  daily that the smell followed me. They had no idea what I was talking about and could not smell anything at the time. I explained it is sporadic nature but they gave me antidepressants and offered counselling. I knew it was not in my head so did not take him up on that. Since then I have gone to see a doctor a couple more times but with similar experiences.\nThe odour I have smells like damp or like fusty old bus seats, so people do not think it is coming from a person, which is a bit lucky sometimes. I get comments like: oh god it smells damp in here or do not you think it smells funny in here Wherever I am. But people do not really assume it is me. Busses, trains, airplanes, cinemas, offices tend to be where it is at it is worst. At home seems to be where it happens the least. On a bad day I can fill the office with the smell of rubbish. \nIt is always good in the morning then starts to ramp up after dinner gradually getting worse all day. Socially it is a massive burden and mentally it has an impact.\nI am trying to limit my diet to basically carrots and rice. Cut out all meat and am just seeing how that plays out. Its the second day of the new diet but the smell is in full force right now. I had to try changing my diet because I have been moved to a new office and I really do not want it to be bad there.\nIt is an odd thing really.. Some people can definitely smell it but others cannot. My gf does not smell anything on me, neither does my desk buddy at work, but others (including myself) can smell it as strong as anything.\nDogs seem to know somethings different with me as they always smell me for ages and not others.\nSo here is my story. I think some of you will have had similar experiences to me.", "Those of you that were able to stop or minimize the odor from your body, how did you clean up your house and car, and things you have left a stink on? I have a plan to reduce my odor and it seems to be working so far. To sum it up, diet change, workout then sauna at night. No dairy, low choline, reduced fats, healthy protein, reduced starch.\n\nUnfortunately I have stunk up a lot of the things in my house. Clothes, ok, I have found oxyclean works pretty well, but mostly because they can be rinsed and I only wear cotton. Poly and nylon retain odors FYI if you didnt know \n\nNow I have a different issue, my car especially. \n\nFor some reason, the sun or the outside air allows me to be desensitized to my odor, or changes it enough to where I can smell it, whether that be my skin or something I am wearing, to my seat or car, steering wheel etc.\n\nSo I know it is still there. How do I remove it? Or better to ask how do you remove your stink from items?\n\nHVAC system would be cool to know if you have done it for this as well? YOOO, that is hella great you found your routine! If you want to clean your car using regular items,  - or just febreeze helps.\n\nHVAC is good but if you are use to clean air / everything is sanitized: your immune system can become compromised. I use to be in a phase where I would Lysol everything and etc. Lysol does not really remove odors. I do not care for sanitizing things anymore to be honest, they just seem to go hand in hand for a lot of products.\n\nIt is moreso odor removal stuff that does not cover it up.\n\nBut I do like febreeze and think it does a good job of covering it up well enough to dissapears and possibly removing the odor although nothing in it has odor removing chemicals IMO. Oh yo I used lysol before in my sanitizing phase not for removing smells. Febreeze removes odors because of cyclodextrin, but in removing chemicals you are right. Hmm cyclodextrin is more of a deodorizer sort of encapsulating molecules.\n\nThat I did not know it had! I will look for febreeze that has that. It may work for certain odors as I know it can bind certain oils and other molecules... Can even make certain oils soluble or emulsify them allowing them to be rinsed.\n\nYou may be on to something, I have looked at all the compounds across the universe for deodorizing but never read on that one.i greatly appreciate it.", "How is everyone is bowel movements?

I have personally tried what he said and noticed drastic differences with my body. And am still experimenting with it but there are others who claimed this cured them. Check it out if you have not heard of this before I assume by drastic, you mean good changes? If so, I am so happy for you!! Please elaborate on changes I have struggled with this for too long. And have tried many different methods to help get rid of the smell and had not really found anything that really worked before. I found josh's channel . Ate low choline as he recommended, no dairy. Cut out coffee. And started drinking 1-2 bottles a day of drinking kefir. By the second day, I smelled so horrible...worse than before I started drinking it (which he said would happen) and I knew something was changing inside me. Because the smell was so strong, I could not even stand it. I kept showering. My stomach was having a lot of movement and I was pooping like crazy. Everyday. This went on for about a few days. After day 5, I woke up....no smell. I thought it was my imagination. I asked my mom. She said no smell. I worked out and came back and asked her if she smelled anything and she said nope. I usually can smell myself after a workout and I smelled nothing. But to say that my problem was completely gone then, is not true. If I went some days without drinking kefir, the odor would come back. The key is to stay consistent of periods of months. The kefir works by reestablishing a colony of healthy bacteria in your gut to eat at this stuff. Homemade kefir works even better than store bought but in my experience, they both work. But store bought is about 20 billion CFU while homemade can be over a trillion in one cup. Which is amazing. If you purchase a supplental probiotic for that amount, it would be very expensive. Also, about 10 minutes after posting about this, someone messaged me saying they knew of josh and followed his advice. Ate low choline and drank kefir and have also experienced a significant change for the good. I should also mention that there is a discord full of advice for this!

But I am not sure my house smells weird when I am in it.\n\nIt is like anything in my house can be smelled once I remove it from my house if that makes sense? Like a hidden smell latches on then becomes known once it is in the open air/different environment.\n\nWhat else do you have? The febreeze plug in is a cover up, works well for visitors though. Buy the cheap cone air fresheners (solid gel like product, $1 or less) in a non obnoxious scent like fresh linen and place one in every room and all closets and in vehicle.  Or buy cheap fragrance oil in bulk from newdirectiinsaromatics.com or.ca and place the product in pretty glasses with kebab sticks as a reed diffuser or leave scented fabric softener sheets around.  Charcoal deodorant bags bags work so, so.  Get fresh air into your place once a week or as often as you can to air out.  You can also look into commercial air sanitizer units for hospitals, morgue etc. that deodorize the air but they are pricey.  Hydrogen peroxide or commercial hospital disinfectant surface and fabric spray or enzyme cleaning sprays will work as well.  If you really want to detox you can use 1 tsp or 1 tbsp of food-grade diatomaceous earth mixed with an equal amount of psyllium powder mixed into any beverage.  Drink immediately before it gels.  You must drink a lot of water throughout the day with this or it will not work.  Take two hours before or after meds or any supplements to avoid interactions.  Do this once daily or three times a week.  Also look into taking cascara sagrada capsules and chanca piedra capsules.  They are cheap if you go to myppints.com and then use that portal to go through vitacost.comor iherb.  You can also use rakuten.com.  You can also make your own silver spray for pennies as silver is anti bacterial.", "Just putting some thoughts to words This condition has caused hardship to many aspects of my life. How long can someone carry on like this. So many years were spent wasted on the hope of meeting someone, as the years gone by always alone. Symptoms of anxiety and nervousness anticipating having to leave the house for anything most of the time, random cruelty getting into  my business and humiliating, This is a life of desperation, discrimination.  As for romantic relationships, I would say it is similar to a never ending silent treatment. I am guessing that is why I am now open to the possibility of a relationship with various adults like  MTF transgender, woman/man couples, even a really good looking man. I dont know because I never actually had any romantic relationship with anyone other than straight women. Could we make a tmau dating server / app? What is the correlation between tmau and your sudden interest in being open to dating other gender specific people? Just curious. Ok, maybe I did not explain the correlation well, I thought it might have been just known by the circumstances. I will explain, for a man to have TMAU means that no opportunities to be with women will come your way, you will be ignored mocked, shamed, ridiculed,.... and then left to die. So I made the decision to make MTF transgender people an option to consider, and actually by doing that I learned that I actually like and enjoy the company of transgender people more than I do someone who is not transgender. Actually I like them so much I want to be one. What makes you think a transgender person would treat you any differently?   Interesting, Never thought about it that way. Can you explain what you mean by borderline Trans? ", "Doc needed Need a doctor that knows about tmau in Berlin?\nAny idea? I would recommend a geneticist, and a dietician Yeah but which, I have had this only for 3 months, I am strong willed enough to follow any diet. \nI need one that helps with treatment but I do not think this is genetic.\n\nSo I have already ate for Tmau 3 weeks I do not think is working but is easy enough so I will keep doing it. A medical geneticist, and a clinical dietician. I  believe. You may need a referral. Given our differences in location, I am not sure how it would work where you are. However seeing that you only had it for 3 weeks.. that may not be necessary. If you have had it for 3 weeks, then most likely it is type 2. You may need to just repopulate your good bacteria in your gut by eating probiotic foods/ eating clean. However, I also know that other things can cause foul orders to emit from our bodies (candida, ibs, hyperthyroidism, bromhidrosis, kidney/ liver disease, a slow digestion process/ not evacuating properly, and etc.) The thing about the diet is, is that you have got to be careful. If you do not have TMAU (not saying you do not), it can cause major issues such as muscle damage, liver damage, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD or hepatosteatosis) . So, I truly hope you are not restricting too much in regards to choline. You can not have too much of it, but you can not have too less of it either. There needs to be a balance. Judging from the fact that the diet is not working, it may be something else. However, then again.. it may just be something else you are eating..that is causing your issue to trigger. Sugar, gluten... etc. What is your odor? Can you smell yourself? \n\nI reek of really bad tuna. Or rotting fish. I have gone to gynecologists, and etc. my current doctor can not smell me, and so that is awesome. Not really, because I need her to get to the geneticist \ud83d\ude44. \n\nSome helpful things may be using a soap that has a ph balance of 5.5-6.5, and not using scented stuff. I use Seabamed fragrance free soap, and lotion. I also use a fragrance free deodorant. I would suggest something more natural. Exercising, and using a sauna... drinking more water also help. Another thing I recommend is probiotic foods kimchi, kombucha, sauerkraut, and etc. Another thing is, where does the smell come from? Your scalp? Your groin? Your pores, and or your breath? Also, if you are interested there is a group on Facebook called MEBO PATM/ TMAU. There you will find many members,from everywhere that suffer from TMAU.. PATM.. and etc.", "I have a notebook where I write down: trigger foods or foods that work, trials (how long I have taken certain things and reactions), test results X-ray of teeth show no decay - to cross out periodontal, and considered other possibilities.

If you have questions of clarity on some writings let me know", "AM I WRONG??? So my aunt is hosting a barbeque today and she invited me and my father. I politely declined because I just do not have the energy, and I am not in the headspace to fake a smile and pretend everything's okay. The main reason I avoided my family is because of this tmau thing, and the last time I attended a gathering, people asked me invasive questions like do I have a boyfriend, when am I going to have children, my career choice blah blah blah, only for them to one up me with their kids accomplishments or their accomplishments when they were my age. And they talked hella shit about me when I they thought I was out of earshot. One of my aunts also threw a jab at my mother and I stood up and said that NOBODY is going to disrespect my mother in my presence no matter who it is or how old they are, family or not. So there is some tension there....Another reason I keep contact to a minimum is because out of my whole family, I was closest to my mother, my grandparents, three aunts and a few cousins. They have all passed on and the vibe just does not feel right and atp the gatherings are only done to \"uphold traditons\". I tried to express my feelings to my dad and he guilt tripped me about how family is so important and I should not skip out on them. I stood my ground and calmly told him I should not have to sacrifice my comfort for people who mistreat me in the first place, and brought up the fact that he is missed several important events and I never complained to him about it. (he missed my birth on purpose bc he and my mom were not on good terms, my graduation dinner bc he did not \"feel up to it\", two thanksgivings, 1 christmas, and a few birthdays) He got upset and said \"whatever, you are grown, do what you want\" and left. I feel guilty about it. Am I being selfish?? Sounds like he respected your choice to not go, he probably understands. Reading deep into the situation though, he may have  just wanted you his family there with him especially since he is going it with no wife now. As for feeling guilty, why blame yourself for having a difficult problem to deal with. He was literally mad, he pouted and slammed the door as he left. By now, if I am being honest, I let it go. He will be okay. I am done sacrificing my peace to accommodate everyone else. And he and my mom were never married. Your feedback is appreciated. no big deal, you skipped a family bbq, no reason to be feeling guilty about that.", ". Update Hi! Hey guys I was sick last year and had TMAU most probably was genetical predisposed but got cured and has sticked.\n I was having digestive/liver problems that got healed with stupid industrial quantities of Antibiotics. Around 90 days of three dif. ones, but two small courses of others too. I will not go in detail bc I am not a doctor and they were controlled meds. \nAnyway for TMAU I tried probiotics, chlorophyll, activated coal, all the rec. soaps, different washing soaps, the expensive room odor gel thingy, the diet low in meats, only white meat 6 months, only certain vegs Kombucha too. The thing that worked was the B2 pills in a bigger dose that the one recommended in the studies. Like it took some months at first it stick for a day then more days but after 6 months or so it just stayed. So that, is a cheap treatment, there is actual peer reviewed studies of it, its just vits if it does not work it wont harm you.\nMaybe it can help someone. \nI tried to get genetic conseil but Corona did not helped and my other differents docs. just ignored me.", "I think its TMAU? I have been reading some other people's symptoms and it makes me question whether or not I have this particular disease? Because of this, I have a few questions.\n\nFor starters, is it self diagnosed or were you guys diagnosed by medical professionals? I am self diagnosing right now and do not think I will be able to go to the doctor or a certain specialist anytime soon due to COVID-19 so that blows. Moving on.\n\nI have had this-whatever it is- for as long as I can remember, only it has not started affecting me until very recently, sometime late last year to be more precise (I am 17, by the way.) I remember when I was very young, there would be this really pungent smell and everyone would make remarks but I never paid attention to it because I did not think it was me. My first active recollection of these occurrences is early middle school, but it was not until highschool that I realized it was serious. My paranoia, stress, anxiety, and depression heightened after this one day in particular when I was working and hanging out with my co-workers. One of them asked what that smell was. I could not for the life of me smell a damn thing but my other co-worker responded to him by pointing at me and saying it was me. Still, did not think much of it until I went to my cousins house and I flopped on her bed, and he friend literally flinched sooo bad. Later, my cousin and I went down stairs, and she had asked me if I would farted. I had not, nor could I even smell anything. From that day on, I have literally progressively ruined my life by not going to school, quitting my job (I found another one shortly thereafter, but I find myself calling out or trying not to often) and just avoiding personal relationships altogether. I have pushed away friends, love interests, and completely isolated myself because I could not figure out what was wrong with me.\n\nAnyways, that is a little about me. I do not want to get excessive and tell my whole life story, and that information is probably redundant anyway but I guess it was just something to see if I shared it with someone. One thing about it is I have never smelt it on my clothes-yet. I rarely smell it, but on the rare occasions I do, it smells like straight up sh!t. Poop. Boo-boo. Cat, dog, baby, you take your pick. Another symptom I noticed is frequent bad breath and a white tongue. I remember I literally brushed my teeth for 15 minutes trying to scrape it all off, had brushed my tongue so hard to the point that it bleeds and damn near deep-throated a toothbrush for fresh breath, but not even 30 minutes later, my breathe tastes bad again. \n\nI really hope someone responds to this, I am kind of desperate. Im also wanting to make a friend that potentially suffers the same thing I do, someone to vent with and someone who understands. :) \n\nThanks for reading. Hey man. Thank you for your story. In 2 months I will be 17 years old aswell. I had the EXACT same problems in the past 4 years. Please dm me or text me on discord traderi#5229. I am \u201ecured\u201c and dont stink anymore. I can share a way to get yourself symptom-free or even cured. Hmu Look at some of my posts for info and some TMAU links.", "What is wrong with me Hello,\n\nI need some help/advice on if there is anything wrong with me smell wise. For the last few months I have been extremely insecure about the way I smell. Although I have never directly been told I stink, there have been occasional jokey comments or gestures that suggest I smell like feces. I have extremely good hygiene and cannot see how I would possibly smell bad. I have had issues with my gut and digestion (nothing majorly just inconsistent bowels) but this should not affect my scent as I always clean.\n\nMy recent thoughts have been that I have some sort of internal issue, TMAU possibly. If I did have TMAU would a lot more people complain? And if it is not TMAU then what other issues could possibly cause the smell. As I said I am not 100% certain I smell bad but I would like any advice that could help towards me clearing my paranoia about this.  I know I could always just ask someone but I am not particularly comfortable doing that. Thanks Tmau is not a fecal smell, it is a rotten fish smell - \n\nIf it is fecal, and you have made it this far, it is somewhat likely (~80%) to be ORS  which is paranoia about smelling rather than actually smelling. Without having direct confirmation, that increases those odds.\n\n1. Speak to friends / family to see if you can get some direct confirmation. \n2. Go see a doctor, they will be able to do checks to see if anything is wrong internally / blood based, you may have bowel/kidney/liver issues. Fecal smells on the breath may indicate gastrointestinal problems. Here is a decent rundown of potentials ( if you can identify what odor / location the smell is coming from. To do that you will probably need some assistance though.\n3. If they do not detect anything, speaking to a psychologist to work with the anxiety and paranoia is basically the final step of treatment.\n\nThere is not really another way, sorry, unless you see self isolation based on paranoia as a way. I disagree there have been many people whom said they have been told to their face or talked about and maybe it is not TMAU but another health issue. Agreed! I am tired of people thinking this issue is all in the mind because it is not. There is not really any point of getting a TMAU diagnosis anyway because there is no (medical) treatment for it.\n\nWe all know treatment options better than any doctor (charcoal, chrolphyl, kefir, acidic body wash, no gluten, no dairy etc etc)", "How would you de-stigmatize living with a malodor condition? So I am currently in the throws of a mental health crisis (again) from having this condition for over a decade, and on my journey to try and find some reprieve, I found a video where a woman was discussing coping methods for isolation. \n\nShe talked about how expressing your loneliness and learning how to effectively express that part of your humanity to others is immensely helpful, and this made me think about the people in my past that have been supportive, but **my** discomfort to *their* coping methods (when they have chosen to positively interact despite my symptoms) put me off of further interactions out of shame, embarrassment and stigma. **I did not want them to be obviously negatively impacted by and having to deal with my symptoms.**\n\nI thought I would ask you all this question, since you would be the most experienced with our circumstances. How would you de-stigmatize and de-shame living with a malodor condition? How would you disconnect and disassociate the coping methods of others (sniffing, nose rubbing, mouth-breathing, gasping, turning away to breathe, walking ahead of you, keeping a far distance, backing away when you approach, etc) from internalized feelings of shame, rejection, embarrassment and humiliation? It hurts me each and every time. This is a good question.   \n\n\nAs far as destigmatizing goes, when I find a group of people that I need to interact with regularly (co-workers, roommates, potential friends), I try and explain at some point that I have a strange metabolic disorder that doctors have been unable to solve, but which I do my best to control with a specialized diet. If they are very curious, I might even tell them the name of what I think I have, but I will never say that it makes me smell bad outright (that seems to be too weird for most people to handle).\n\n If they are compassionate people, just the knowledge that I am aware of the problem, and have been trying to fix it, is enough for them to accept me. If they are assholes, there is nothing I can do generally, and avoiding them is the best rout. As far as internalizing feelings go, I try and reframe things like this- \n\n1. This is not my fault I was born this way \n2. I am doing everything in my power to fix it every day\n3. I have tried to get help from professionals and authority figures and they have all failed \n\nTherefore, I have no reason to feel guilty or embarrassed. If anything I should be proud that I am brave enough to still attempt a normal life with all of the rejection I get from others.", "ZINC Hi! I am newbie here. I want to ask if anyone here take ZINC ? What is the side effects when taking the zinc? Because last month i take zinc and BOOM! My smell get worst. :( Try Zinc+ Kelp What about chlorophyll ? And how many times will intake? I know there some side effects if you take to much so I would look them up, and escpaicly with anything else you plan on taking. I am cured of it! I had it for two years. I prayed to God and he answered my prayers. After going to 9 doctors and having this condition cause an issue at work and social environments, I can say I am finally healed.\nI went to a doctor who told me I had e-coli that was causing the rotten smell. The doctor said that it would take about 3 months for me to be healed. I started taking antibiotics for 2 weeks, completed a diet with mostly sauerkraut, kefir milk(it is sour), probiotics, ginger tea, hardly any sugar, prayed about it so much, had worst days then better ones, tried to eat only the items listed above so that it could have the best effect and, thank God, the smell is completely gone. Today I have been 3 days without a case. I have eaten eggs, beef and other foods and I have no odor. I smell clean. I did this for approximately 3 weeks. I pray that you are healed, too. \n\n-I drank Kefir milk from Lifeway/Maple Hill- it is supposed to taste sour. (2-3 bottles/day)\n-saurkraut about 11oz a day (this helped dramatically)\n-probiotics for bv and e-coli( 1 week each -never take them together)\n-ginger and lemon tea \n-probiotic and oregano oil capsules \n-plenty\n-one regular meal a day\n\n-I brush my teeth with Tom\u2019s fennel tooth paste to remove the sour milk smell from my breath. This works better than mint. \n\nI started on this on 8/3/20 and am on 8/26/20 without symptoms. I have been 3 days (give and take some hours) without them.\n\n-Prayer and trust in God was so helpful in this time. Do not forget about God so that He heals you.\n\n\nBlessings to you!!!", "Would an operation fix it? I read there are operations to completely stop sweating from your armpits, which is the only part of body that smells in my case.\n\nIf I go through an operation that makes my armpits incapable of producing sweat. Would it fix it? No It would potentially fix hyperhidrosis, if that is the issue. There are a few options - eg  Seems pretty legit.\n\nDefinitely something you would want to get medical advice for, plus it are not cheap.\n\nIt will not 'fix' tmau, as it comes out elsewhere (other swear glands, breath, urine) and is a gut/digestion issue, but it would maybe reduce effect. I agree with Brutalar. \n\n(Laser) Surgery to destroy some of the sweat glands in the armpit would likely reduce the amount you SWEAT under your arm. \n\nHowever, surgery would not help anywhere else on your body, and if you have TMAU, the smell will come through your skin, breath, etc. \n\nI think you should sit and think about what your issue is: excessive armpit sweat or metabolic body odor condition. If it is a BO condition, surgery will not help much at all. If it is excessive sweating from one place, then do your research on the operation Do not do it. It transfers the sweat to other areas of your body. Big no If you have bromhidrosis and not tmau I believe it could. They would also remove your apocrine sweat glands which is responsible for the smell. I read about a recent study where they did this and it worked for all of the participants. I had sweaty and smelly armpits in my early 20s. I used an antiperspirant called Degree. The only thing is that after my pits stopped sweating my feet started to sweat. I have not been able to fix that yet. It could be hormones. I even had Botox injections which were no help at all.", "Anyone have any luck with zinc and kelp? please share your experiences Zinc picolinate in high doses divided throughout the day.  Kelp may be an issue, try liquid chlorophyll (look for brands that have low sodium and high chlorophyll amounts per 1 tablespoon or 1 teaspoon instead.  Milk thistle seeds that you grind yourself and TUDCA will work better. could you share your experience? At this point I am willing to try anything.  But I would still like to understand.  I had not tried zinc supplementation and would like ask more about that.  A quick google search suggests that zinc picolinate is not actually absorbed and is not recommended for supplementation.  So my question is why use zinc picolinate vs other types of zinc?  ( \n\nDried cascara sagrada made into a tea (can be reused multiple times) or take capsules for the liver and gallbladder and to ensure proper elimination, dried chanca piedra or capsules for the liver and gallbladder, resveratrol capsules (or buy dried Japanese knotweed) and black seed oil capsules (or buy black seeds cheaper from an Indian grocery store or online) also help greatly.

Pets or people in general hates those who stink. I feel offended because I thought I am better now. It seems like I still smell bad. I feel ashamed of it. I have a gf now and she does not like bad smells too. She is always complaining when she smelled something bad and never goes to places that stinked. I do not know how she is been handling me whenever we see each other. It made me overthink more that she might have someone there that smells better since we are ldr. I am really insecure because of this condition. Keep in mind that there is a lot of genetics involved when it comes to smell perception. You will probably detest genetically incompatible people's scent. Or some perception may be influenced by parasites - it is really weird sometimes. Talk to your gf if there is any serious concerns. Mine was a smoker but still would put me in the shower when i came for a visit. There may also be other girls who actually like the scent. I think some do smell you and some do not. I think she does somehow? I have not talked to her about it. She might find me weird. I think her friend do noticed though with some remarks they had before. So I thought they might talked her about it too. Maybe I am just overthinking this too.

Hello all, I suspect of having some form of TMAU, at work i notice this distinct smell and I always think it is me. After work I went to study on campus for an hour did not smell a thing on me, I returned to my office area exactly an hour later and noticed that smell was still there, the area is pretty big (about 100 feet i calculate) and another big lounge area besides it. The smell was still there and now I believe it may be just the smell of the old building, but if not how long do you guys think my smell would linger for? I sit for 8 hours so maybe that could have some effect in how long it stays. 2 to 3 days i believe If you can smell a smell, and the smell is not following you around, then it is most likely not you.

Body wash or bar soaps to use that works for you? Cetaphil non scented or dove. My fave used to be deo Irish spring soap but if I get overheated or not having a good day / it mixes with the smell Ph neutral is best to wash away TMA I have found that bars of soap work best. If u have the dough try out dr sasquatch soap it is not bad. Advice: if you find one that works , stock up on it before they change the formula . Most companies are constantly changing products. For instance summers eve feminine spray worked great until they changed to a 'new improved' version. I can tell you what do not work- Arm and hammer body wash along with their \"natural stick deodorant\" (worst deodorant I eve tried,  disgusting nauseating perfume smell would not even wash off from plastic items that I ran through steam dishwasher, vagisil and near every other  similar brand  of feminine washes in the stores. Like I stated earlier summers eve used to work before tampering with the recipe, strangely right after marketing it to guys in their commercials.  clear glycerine soaps tend to not work, dr bronners liquid and bar actually caused me to gag  that was disgusting, olive oil in soap= gross.  Homemade vinegar deodorant recipes- disgusting, aloe vera for underarms gross, stale and smelly, same with lemons so much for homemade deodorant internet ideas (though lemons may freshen your hands, not for underarms though. Detergents for clothes that do not work- tough guy, most all liquid detergent is horrible especially the perfumed, the ALL free and clear and lots of other unscented ones leave a stale smell of semen in the clothes, and I smelled that with clothes I never worn before or after washing so it is actually the detergent, purex booster eee persil, perfume is too strong, Clorox detergent sanitizer booster ruined my clothes, cant wash out the perfume smell.. So many others , I will let you know if I think of more", "Does it lingers on your clothes or home? Looking to see if I have TMAU or some other issue.\n\nWhat does it actually smell like because I have never smelled anything fishy.\n\nAlso does it linger on your clothes or your items? Or does it evaporate and dissipate when you leave?\n\nTo me, I smell a garbage sewer, waste water type smell. Not rotting fish. Maybe more like rotting plant material I guess. Not like cat urine either nor ammonia.\n\nI am not sure. It may be environmental odors lingering in my house, or it may be me since it is heavily intermittent and mostly noticable when very humid. It lingers on fabrics for me, the body oil secretions Honestly your best bet is try to be as perfect as you can but understand it will always be bad no matter what you do. Avoid thinking about it as much as you can because it will always be there regardless of what you do.\n\nI just focus on other priorities. This lingering odor from secretions, does it smell differently than when you sweat and that odor? I sometimes smell something similar but I have also heard someone say that it smells like eggs or boiled eggs. Stay strong g. It would depend if I am in a humid area or even in air conditioned places, I would say it smells musty if I sweat a lot. I do use baking powder, unscented soap and a lot of other things. Later on the day I just smell and if I sweat it spreads I am just like you then, wow. \n\nIt will collect on me, then when I hit humidity or room environment change it suddenly just emerges..\n\nIt smells like rot though for me.\n\nHave you tried any probiotics? I am looking but all I see is a bunch of the same lactobacillus and the other type. Nothing different worth trying... The lactobacillus is only one strain of probiotics that is promoted a lot like in Yakut. I still smell but lessened it with kefir water it has 40 different strains of probiotics. It is cheaper to make your own from grains. I drink it twice a day on an empty stomach in the morning and night. \n\nYou can lessen the smell apparently with type 2 people, it is just a lot of work and I got lazy. I tried a lot of things before like apple cider vinegar, juices, not eating (which will make us smell worse if we starve), driclor to prevent sweating, baking soda etc. it will not work if it is not clockwork or like a well oil machine to work out the cleanse.\n\nFinding one that works for you takes a lot of trial and error.\n\nFor mine Before: \n\n- Morning workout or at least make yourself sweat a lot (sauna suit) this helps out with cleansing \n- Cup of kefir water, avocado toast bread or rice with chicken\n- after eating I would take riboflavin \n\n&gt; brush with baking soda mixed with water to make a paste mixed with regular tooth paste and gargle \n&gt; I use to gargle with 3% hydrogen peroxide (nothing higher) \n\n- have mini snacks and water throughout the day. Like cucumber because my breath stinks\n- when I get home I wash up \n\nAnd febreeze odor eliminator helps spraying sometimes (it was embarrassing before all that I use to carry fabric softener but it would mix with my smell. So it was like a flowery trash can musk) Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it. I will try something similar out. \n\nIs the kefir name brand probiotic smoothie drink the same you think? I smell like sewer too...i am sure that my house/car/clothes smell like me too \ud83d\ude05 Is it you or your environment that is the cause? Me.. The odour get worst when i eat sugar and fat foods I ate a bunch of whipped cream from the can the other day. I am pretty sure folks were looking at me for the smell the following day.\n\nI think fatty food and oils cause me the odor as well.\n\nNot sure about sugar but I am sure it does not help.\n\nHave you tried coconut oil as an alternative in cooking or as a supplement? I have been thinking of cooking a lot with it for a week and see if it gets better, if so, I can try it with an unhealthy diet. My goal is to eat a normal diet because I love food.\n\nI know certain fatty acids can inhibit the enzymes that cause issues while other fatty acids cause bad byproducts or promote certain enzyme that cause issues.\n\nThere is a specific case of Lorenzos oil, a man discovered that certain fatty acid combination inhibited the production of the enzyme that made the damaging fatty acids. This was for a specific deadly disease though. Never tried It...The things that help me a little, at least i think, is eat a little bit of pineaple and drink some Orange juice one/twice at a day..Im not sure too, because i cannot smell anything since i used Cefalexin to treat pimples that appears in my scalp right after eat sugar/fatty food...\n\nI am not sure 100% but when i was ingesting the cefalexin i think the smell get Very better, people around me stopped to sneeze and cough There is a wheel of odor that may help you identify your smell, but I am not sure:  Yes it does. I have gone on trips and go through all my clean clothes very fast even changing outfits throughout the day if it is hot. It is really annoying only getting 1 wear out of clothes and having to wash them I feel like clothes wear out quickly washing them all the time. Idk if that is normal to wear something for a few hours and have the clothes smell absolutely horrible and get worse the longer clothes sit. How do you clean your walls or reduce the smell coming from your body? Drink lots of water, vitamins ect.", "Essential Oils/Food Hello, so up until 2 yrs ago I didnt know about TMAU. I have never come across anyone suffering from this or heard of this. Now I live it. It is very depressing to live with but I am learning to deal. I quit my job because I could not take it anymore. Hearing people talk about me, making fun. I decided to go back to school. I am only taking two courses and they are about an hour and a half long. During the week I try not to eat as much to keep the odor from being insanely overwhelming to others. I myself cant smell it, but sometimes when it is bad i do catch whiffs here and there. I am wondering if anybody has recipes, I am also wondering if using essential oils help with the odor inside the house. Like I said, i dont smell it but I am sure my house does. I have gone to the doctor but he thinks I am insane. He prescribed me metamucil lol.  I use mint spray at work sometimes when I can tell it is bad, which is nearly always. It is gotten so bad that my last day is the 28th now. What is your diet like?", "Do you get this odor? Hi lately I been smelling like raw meat! \ud83d\ude14 You ever drive past a meatpacking place?

Antibiotics dosent work for some people  I have the same smell problem and antibiotics works Fine to me What antibiotics do you use?

I am looking for someone to partner up with me to write a blog. The purpose of the blog is to narrate our experiences as trimethylaminuria sufferers. I have noticed that TMAU blogs are quite few.\n\n\nIdeally,you should be aged between 20 to 40 years. That way,we will be able to relate.\n\n\nWe will use a free platform like Blogger or Medium to publish our essays and articles. \n\n\nI do not know what to call the blog so I am open to any ideas.\n\n\nFeel free to comment below or private message me if you are interested in this initiative.\n\n\n\nCheers.\n\n\nKlaeye. I would like to join you, I will message you on my day off", "Here are things i have learned from researching tmau. Foods to avoid : Eggs, Dairy, Red meats, Soy, Wheat, Sulfurous vegetables (cabbage family), Spicy foods, Beans (coffee, green beans, soybeans,) Peanuts, Seafood\nCurrently these are all the foods that have been a major trigger, but it is different for everyone. Some may react Extremely bad to some of these and other may not. \nOther things that may trigger an odor are \nEnergy drinks, (monster,red bull, Celsius), gatorade, juices, sugar, chocolate, chips, spices like turmeric, cumin, red chilli, pepper, onions, and garlic.\n\nIf your pregnant or underweight I do not recommend removing these foods from your diet. \n\nIt can be hard finding foods that are okay to eat. Here are some that I recommend.\nBoneless Chicken Breast, White Rice, Carrots, Celery, Bell peppers, zucchini, ginger, lettuce, eggplant, fruits (papaya, berries, kiwi, avocado, gluten free bread, probiotic yogurt, kombucha\n\nAlso use low ph soaps and moisturizers.\n\nSome reader has recommends taking activated charcoal tablets and vitamin b2 (not b12)\nothers have recommended taking oregano oil tablets, milk thistle, and black tea\nDo not take all these thing all at once, experiment and see how your body reacts,\n\nI think most of odors from out body have to do with our gut micro biome, try and work on a diet to detoxify all the bad stuff. Once you have done that see how your body reacts to it and if it is working or not. If you see a change maybe then start eating other foods like the ones we have to avoid and see if your odor is worse or not as bad.\n\nSome people might think they have tmau and can actually be another condition like (smelly scalp, tonsil stones, fungus, sibo, ibs, etc) \nBest thing to do is to go to your doctor or even a gastroenterologist (it could be something in you gut or intestines causing an odor)\nI am not trying to give false hope or implying a cure. \nI AM NOT A DOCTOR ALL THIS IS JUST INFO FROM WHAT IVE RESEARCHED ON TMAU.", "Confused My neighbours says it smells all the time. I confronted one of them today and asked if it is me, she said \u201dno, it is the couple on the top floor\u201d. Apparently their apartment reeks of cat pee and garbage. Honestly, I have never smell cat pee or garbage. Maybe I have a bad sense of smell or she lied to me. But why go through the trouble of blaming someone else if I am the one who smells bad? I am confused. Another thing that is confusing is, whenever I am around people they cough. Sometimes they cover their noses and keep a distance. It does not matters if I just showered or not, the reactions are still the same. I mean, I MUST smell bad. This cannot be in my head..? And where do I start to figure out where is the smell is coming from...There is many reasons for why someone would smell bad.. When your neighbor said no it was not you - did they seem genuine, or like they had to blame it on someone else on the spot?\n\nA lot of us have gone to many doctors, dentists, etc to ask them point blank about the odor and get told no most of the time. \n\nThe only ones who swore they would be honest with me on it were my therapist and psychiatrist. They are expensive af ngl, but they are probably the most likely to be honest on this. Because if they lie to you about it and you find out about it - they are afraid you would stop coming in to them, stop trusting them, and might hurt yourself or something.\n\nAnd I think they would know more than anyone else how distressing this is for all of us.\n\n ORS is a real thing, but so is anxiety/panic attack induced sweating. Ppl react badly to even just regular sweat smells so it could even be something as simple as regular sweat odor. It seemed like she meant it. She did not just blame someone right away, it was more of a  \u201dit is the couple on the top floor. it reeks of cat pee. i do not get it, I have a cat myself and it does not smell. and they throw trash on the balcony\u201d. Still, I cannot shake the feeling that it was a lie. I mean, this couple is almost never at home. How can it smell?? Unless they leave their cat alone and the litter box gets filthy, but why would they?  \n\nMy therpahist actually say I do not smell. Same with my family. I just have a hard time to believe it because of this That is good! If she thought an odor was coming from you you would be able to see like a panic in her face to blame it on someone else. \n\nIf they are throwing trash out on the balcony instead of throwing it out, maybe they are hoarding more trash inside? Seems weird they do not just put the bags in the dumpster. Cat pee is so strong smelling though it is a definite possibility they are not changing the litter. Like literally tear inducing after a while.\n\nThat is good that your therapist was honest with you! It does take a lot of courage to ask someone that. I totally understand that fear too when ppl cough near you. If your therapist says there is no odor - maybe some perfume or scent is too strong (but still good smelling) from your clothes? Watch what they do. HHAHAHAHA \nMY NEIGHBOURS SAID THE SAME WHEN WE ASK!!!\nLiteral cat excuse!\nIt is you bro dont doubt yourself makes, this thing worse. Omg! You know what? I believe you. I went to the top floor yesterday. As I was about to knock on the couples door, I saw this huge sign. \u201dWarning. Dog!\u201d LOL. They have a freaking dog. This lady DID lie to me. I was upset for a second, then I went and knocked on her door. She did not open. Okay, I thought. I rang the door bell twice, she still did not open. THEN her cat meowed and she said; \u201dShh, quiet\u201d. LOL. I called the landlord afterwards. She said she is aware of the problem, however when I mentioned cat pee and garbage she said; \u201dWhat? I am aware of a bad smell, but cat pee and garbage? What are you talking about?\u201d. \n\nUrgh, this is really stressig me out. Because now I know it is me but not how to fix the problem. \u201dSee a doctor, that is what I would do\u201d. Someone said this a while ago. Firstly, doctors do not do much. As smellythraway9 said earlier; \u201dA lot of us have gone to many doctors, dentists, etc to ask them point blank about the odor and get told no most of the time\u201d. \n\nI have been told (countless of times) I do not smell. A female doctor said; \u201dYou do not smell bad, those who is saying you smell are bullies\u201d. Another one said; \u201dYou do not smell. Have you seen a theraphist regarding this?\u201d\nYes, and she claims I do not smell either, as mentioned earlier.\n\nSo what am I supposed to do? Take a gut test? Change deoderant? Detox my body? Change diet? Inject botox in my pits? All of it?? Well might as well do all of it LOL Its stressful being isolated and not knowing what to do. It is best to find other things to obsess over. Eat good, workout, shower lots and keep good posture breathe deeply. \n\nLol everyone is a little bitch and 99% of adults wont have the balls to tell u to ur face. If someone does record it for sanity.\n\nAlso dont take it personally if people cant tell you that you smell. It is not healthy. Try to empathize with them, they are probably not bad people. \n\nMan as long as your kind genuine and loving people will still enjoy you. They will eat with you, go out with u, and be positive  with you. Dont let thought of you smelling bad stop you.", "Anyone with certain family members or friends who cannot detect a smell? Hi I am in high school and have had this odor since 8th grade. 16F\n\nOnly until today was when I discovered what I have might be tmau, and was so relieved that I am not the only person in the world like this. I cannot sit near other people for the life of me.\n\nso I was wondering if anyone else had certain people in your life where they could not smell it at all? \n\nI am pretty sure it is not OARS because other random people while out shopping and stuff have told me that I have a smell\u2026 :( \n\nIt usually smells something like or resembling urine for me, sometimes changes to spoiled milk/rotten eggs/(amonia?) and strangely enough, popcorn at one point. It is 24/7 with large radius and pungent. I can constantly hear people sniffling and saying how there is a smell around, anyone know what I can do? :(", "Tmau discord support group Hello everyone! \u263a\ufe0f I created a support group for my fellow tmau buddies on discord recently.

Feel free to join. \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc9c\n\n The link does not work", "I always smell like feces and it is affecting my self esteem ", "Please talk and listen to people A lot of comments here talk about overhearing people comment about their smell, reactions to it, etc. Very few comments about people telling them directly that they can identify your smell.\n\nPlease, please please talk to people you trust to see if it is you. There is a lot of paranoia about smelling, I have it, you have it, if you cannot smell it then you need an external reference point. Have a friend or college tell you when you smell.\n\nEg:\n\"I am sorry, this is a little little gross, but I am concerned I might have a problem with BO, specifically rotten fish / fecal/ etc. I cannot smell it. I believe I have TMAU. Would you be able to tell me if im smelling, so I can keep my distance / open a window / go shower / change my clothes?\" \n\nWithout clear confirmation, there is a lot of concern about people coughing, sniffing around you, without any proof. There are a lot of other reasons people sniff and cough, a lot of other things that smell - allergies, covid, hayfever, someone stepped in dog poo.\n\nThere is shame in having the conversation. There is also shame in staying silent and having people talk about it and make up their own minds about -why- you smell. It is 100% better to rip off the bandaid. Sometimes I find it is easiest to ask a stranger. \"This is odd but is there a weird smell in here?\" Less likely to give white lies in fear of possibly offending you. If they say yes I just excuse it with \"oh damn maybe I stepped in something\"\n\nBut feedback from strangers/coworkers/etc is soooo much more mentally reassuring than doctors and family. &gt;There is also shame in staying silent and having people talk about it and make up their own minds about -why- you smell. It is 100% better to rip off the bandaid.\n\nAny tips on how to approach passive aggressive people? Especially the ones who are audible/verbal reacters, will lie to your face and claim there is not an issue, then go back to being audible/verbal reacters with a smirk. That is maybe easier, but not best. It is identifying that there is a smell, but it is not necessarily you, nor your smell. Lots of other things smell.\n\nDoctors and family are key, in my opinion. If you stank with regular BO, they would tell you without hesitation. If it is super BO, then they are going to let you know. If you stepped in dog poo, and brought it into the house, family would notice and say something. Do they let you know when they smell your farts when you let a stinky one rip, or when they have to use the bathroom after you?\n\nIf doctors and family cannot smell anything, I do not think they are lying. If they consistently say that they smell nothing, are happy to be in the same room as you then theres likely no smell. \n\nYou could test them out if you really wanted - get something that smells bad - go buy some fish, leave it in the sun in a tupperware container a few days, then leave it open on the kitchen top. See how long it takes them to notice. Or get some aged blue cheese and ask them if it smells, or some other stinky thing (I would say get some poo but that might be going a bit far). Test a reaction to another smell and see if they are robots or actually respond to bad smells. I would probably would not bother telling people that are actively hostile, bullying or awful, it is not worth giving them more ammunition. Unless you have got something diagnosed, in which case you can give them the whole 'genetic unfixable issue' or something.\n\nThat said, if you have talking to someone who can smell something bad, you offer up yourself as a cause and they say no, then there is probably something else that smells. That or they sniffing or coughing or 'reacting' because they are sick, have hayfever or something else. People fart 5-15 times a day, maybe they are trying to covering up their own smells. If they are nasty people, why would not they take the chance to tell you that you smell at any opportunity directly? Why would they bother to lie?\n\nIf you have had the chat with them, you have basically given them the green light to come up to you and let you know if they think you do smell at a later point. This is good as I reckon you can operate on the assumption that if no one says anything to you, then it is not you, because why would not they just say so if you have had the chat?\n\nI think it is best to ask someone you trust to tell you if you are smelling, so you can rely on solid information.  If you then notice reactions, it is either reactions to something else, paranoia or a somewhat less effective form of bullying, as you can feel confident that it is untrue. No if you hear it more than average person you probably have tmau. Going around asking is embarassing. How do you know how much the average person hears it?\n\nGoing around smelling is embarrassing. Asking for a friend or trusted person check is reassuring.\n\nI know, working with people I know and trust, that I now  only smell maybe a day every 2-4 weeks. I know through my family that my diet is working, and I can eliminate triggering foods based on bad reactions. It is super helpful to engage the people around you. If you hear people everyday around you mentioning smells you know.\n\nGood stuff your making progress. No, I am not willing to accept that. \n\nThere are a thousand reasons people could smell something. It is mostly paranoia, living in your own head. You can do things to minimize it and live a normal life if you get help. No one will tell you. No one. It is another maddening aspect of this torture. Do you have TMAU? There is no covering it up. Nothing helps. And there is no living a normal life.  This disease is social devastation. This is not paranoia. Doctors lie to get rid of you. No one will tell you. In fact they will swear they do not smell you to your face. Unless you have lived this hell you really do not understand. I have tmau type 1, I have done the genetic testing, i participated in flagyl trials with a research group in Australia, got called fish boy all through high school. I maintained social and close friendships and relationships with people throughout.\n\nYou can minimise it. My partner can smell it and she let us me know when I smell. It is not often, maybe once every 2-4 weeks. It is also not room clearing, it is usually fairly subtle. My parents can smell it, they are the ones that got me tested as a child. They let me know when I smelt. \n\nControlling it is all about diet, and you need to be able to get reliable feedback to know if what you are eating is triggering it. If you believe no one will ever tell you, what could anyone possibly say to you to make you believe them that they do not smell you? Doctors do not lie about shit like this. They will happily stick fingers up your arse or lance a rancid boil, they are not concerned about a smell.\n\nA unusual smell is indicative of poor hygiene or a medical condition, in both instances a doctor will tell you, as both of those things can lead to serious health issues. If you smell they would let you know. Do you have TMAU? I know from years of observation and living this pain. I am not going to argue with you and too tired to explain it to you. If you have this  disorder you would not be asking this. Why are you even on here? Do you have symptoms of TMAU? If you truly understood what this torture was like, you would not be on here trying to convince us we do not know our experiences. I have tmau and people tell me. Doctors diagnosed me. \n\nIt is not constant. When I wake up in the morning and shower and change my clothes, I do not smell. If I ate something high in choline I might start smelling early in the day, maybe later in the day if I have a stressful day and sweat a bit. It does not go away until I shower and change my clothes. It is not every day as I do not usually eat high choline foods. It is usually only once every few weeks and I know because people tell me. \n\nIt might be you went to a doctor on a good day when you were not smelling. I am not saying you do not smell, but that you might not be smelling all the time. It is not constant unless you are eating a bad tmau diet like omelettes every breakfast and fish for dinner. People complain all the time how horrible and fishy I smell all the time. I can make entire buildings smell. I went to 2 different doctors and they both told me they could not smell anything and one of them said I might just be too paranoid. My family at home always complain about the smell and people in public have been upset with me before.\n\nI felt like the doctors just did not want to deal with it.", "My Story/ Seeking Help I have been dealing with tmau since the start of 7th grade and up till now in college which has put other lives and mine in utter turmoil everyday. I still find it weird some days that I have not ended my life from how , but I am proud of others and myself for not going to such lengths to get rid of the mental, emotional, and physical overbearing stress. Moreover, I want to at least be able to decrease my odor, yet it would be great, if anyone could drop some info or whatever you think may help please. I hope you all keep finding the strength and willpower to keep going because we all deserve to be happy with ourselves and life. Sorry for any grammar issues! :) Try kefir or Kombucha. And, stop eating things with soy. Also, maybe think about getting earplugs so you do not have to listen to people. And, here is a link to a discord for a tmau group chat ( Thank you and I will most definitely will soon. What are you studying?", "Bleh Went out for the first time in a long time yesterday to pick up some presents. It was a smallish store in a small town. Could over hear multiple people comment on how I smell. One women got to the counter and said \"I am glad I am done shopping so I do not have to smell him any more\". Thanks. It is frustrating how much trouble I go through to be clean then to have people just tear me apart. What happened to pretending I do not exist? That is the best. Side note; I drank kombucha for about 6 weeks ever day and have been drinking water kefir for the last month. Still zero progress. I am so sorry to hear that this happened to you.

So I came across some old posts in the leaky gas subreddit. And there were a few people who were formally diagnosed with having pelvic floor issues, and that being their source of the smell. Literally in anxious situations gas would slip out and they could not smell what ppl were reacting to. \n\nAnother interesting thing they mentioned having almost no reactions on days where they were almost 100% emptied out (enemas, high fiber, laxatives)\n\n\nWhat do you all think though? Maybe this could be a possibility for some? i dont know what to think i have tmau with a urine/ fecal odor i remember i starting of as a urine smell rhe developed into a fecal smell but when i need to fart i usaly hold it in untill im out side but when i do that that is when i get comments and reactions i remember falling down the stairs once and hurting my pelvic area then about a week later my tmau started i would like to know if any one else had a simular problem I have fecal body odor. I also have post void dribble, which pelvic floor exercises are recommended for. I do not know much about pelvic floor though or interest honestly.\n\nI also do not know much about the leaky gas idea. I never looked into it. The leaky gas idea seems different from the TMAU idea where there is something wrong in our intestines, liver, or kidneys and an accumulation of odorants in our skin/body. That idea makes more sense to me. The leaky gas idea seems to be more about a problem more local to the butt.\n\nI guess the \"gas\" of leaky gas is from literal poop in the colon or flatulence. Yet if i fart on purpose, i do not think I would get an increase in reaction much. You would also think that if i pooped in a public restroom, there is be an intensification of reaction due to the supposed source of the odor being out, but i do not think so.\n\nBut maybe there is a structural problem in my case. Overeating makes my poop smell horrible. I had one such poop a few days ago. Before pooping, my body odor intensified, and remained elevated for at least the next day after. I do not think TMAu ideas explain such a quick rise in body odor. I am not sure it is possible but I believe my problem comes from body hair any hair even scalp hair and it is stronger when I over heat up I am naturally always hot any ways I live in sweaty Florida Have you tried doing Kegels? I started to do them but not long enough to have an effect.\n\nYesterday I did not flush with enemas and my coworker was saying how bad the area smelled. Luckily she blamed it on something else but. I have been working with her for long periods for a few months and this was the first time she mentioned the odor.\n\nThe only problem with enemas is if everything is not 100% out ppl will react like crazy. So it is pretty time consuming.\n\nDoing it everyday sucks but it seems to be the only thing working for me atm. Are you doing enemas every day? I do not think that is safe. Yes unfortunately... I wish I did not need to but if I do not the smell is horrendous. I use tap water though , not the saline solution. Saline ones would def be unsafe to use like that. The enema bulb does not get the water far enough that it will disrupt colon bacteria too. I do not know what you think \"leaky gut\" means but it is not that your anus is leaking any gases or materials.\n\nIt is not really a well accepted official term, just a hypothesis.\n\nIt means the lining inside your intestines may be allowing more toxins and things through to the bloodstream or deeper layer of the intestines. Causing issues like inflammation and autoimmune diseases.\n\nAlthough, inflamed intestines may cause bad fecal material and in turn smell worse.\n\n\n\nPlease be careful on enemas and certain cleanses, you can cause some damage that may be hard to reverse.\n\nPeople who have incontinence, fecal or urine, may slip some waste out and that being the cause of their odor. That is not a leaky gut issue though, that is an incontinence issue which pelvic floor muscles control. I have leaky gas .. I figured it was from years of straining due to constipation or ibs? I bought an anal probe for my ems hopefully it will help the problem. Whenever I do an enema .. I have urges for like a good hour..trying to figure out if that is normal? Like more still needs to come out? Yeah that happens with me too. It is such a pain but it helps to do the first flushes 2 or 3 hours ahead of time. And that way if it feels like there is more there is time to release before leaving.\n\nUsually if there is more that needs to come out it feels like gurgles near the stomach or gas. Sometimes it is just mucus tho.", "Anyone here using a Ozone Generator in their home? Has anyone noticed a reduction of the odor in the room, after you have left it running for a bit?  Yes but you have to leave the room for hours after you have turned it off which is inconvenient.  You cannot be in the same room whilst it is running.  It may harm some plants. Yeah, that would definitely be an inconvenience. I am just, I am curious because the neighbors can smell me outside of my home. I just want to find a way to reduce the smell. Also, I understand. why not just buy fans and open the window? lol The problem with this approach is that, it will spread the odor/bother the neighbors that notice the smell. This will result in more comments/complaints, and etc. You can be sued for having an offensive odor.. especially if it seeps into someone else\u2019s home. I am not staying alone atm, and this will not only affect me. I have got family here in this home, and I do not want them having issues because of me. Mildronate found on amazon.ca will reduce the TMAU but it raises the heart rate.  You have to avoid your food triggers though when taking it.  It will take around a month or six weeks to arrive.  It works for TMAU1 or 2. This one? GRINDEX Mildronate 500mg 60 Cap \n\nYou have experience with it? Yes it works great but if you eat your triggers you will smell weird.  Be careful, you may want to try half a capsule or use it every other day.   Check with your doctor. Dang sorry you are going through that, if you try the thing off amazon can you post an update?  I would order it myself but I dont have a reliable shipping address right now It is okay. It is what it is, and of course. I am a little reluctant to try it, but if I decide to give it a go I will let you know. I completely understand. Could you really be sued by a neighbor when you have an odor? I hope that you could get a doctor\u2019s note explaining a offensive odor. I am currently dealing with this same sort of situation. I cannot sleep because my upstairs neighbor is constantly audibly complaining and stomping around. I am fucking miserable! All sorts of things can happen, and I am working on it. The only issue is, my current GP does not smell me. I am going to push her so that I can get tested. That way, if anything happens no one can really do anything. I am so sorry that you have to deal with that, some people are absolutely evil. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. I am sure you are. Were you able to get some documentation? Honestly, I would file a complaint. Hopefully, they will tire out, and move soon. Have you tried the Ozone generator? What is your diet like? When I was younger my parents said that they had me tested but I do not think they really did. I guess it would be a good idea to try. Do you know how much it costs? I have been vegan for about 8 years. I have been trying to add in extra greens with smoothies and lists of plain coconut yogurt. I recently read that red grapes have a compound that helps with the smell so I am going to try that.  The article said to take grape seed extract supplements as well. I had an ozone generator a while back but realized it was not safe to have it running while I was home. I have an air purifier but it does not cut it. I hope they move because I bought the unit I live in!!! I understand. The cost, can vary. I know Lab Corp does testing. They only test for TMAO though. The TMAU test test for TMA, and TMAO. This test is 59 bucks, I think. \n\nThese are other options. You may have to get on insurance first, if you do not have any. If you do get a general practitioner that does not smell you, attempt to find another doctor who does. If they can not smell you, they may not be able to help you. They may think you are crazy. Be sure to let them know of your experiences, and etc. You can also ask if another nurse, can enter the room to see if they notice it. If they deny you, tell them to note it into your chart. If they still wont budge, you must find someone else who can help you.\n\nAnyway, here are other locations:\n\n\r1.) (\n\nBlood, Cell Culture, DNA, Fresh Tissue, and etc are the accepted specimen types. \r  \n\r  \n2.) (\n\nLook on the side for test descriptions. They test your blood, and saliva. \r  \n\r  \n3.) (\n\nCan not see the pricing with this one, and so I sent them a message.  I will let you know what they say. They test using blood samples. \n\n4. Children's Hospital, in Colorado. Present this form to your General Practitioner. Copy, and paste it into your browser, and download it.  This is a urine test, but I would recommend a blood test to ensure you get a proper diagnosis. \n\n I hope so too. I mean you have to have a place to lay your head. Let me know if the grapeseed, and etc helps. I have a doctors appointment coming up, and I will also let you know how that goes. Thank you! This is extremely helpful! So far the grape seed has not made any difference. Yw! Ahh, I am so sorry that the grape seed oil is not working. What other things have you tried? How is your diet, and idk if I asked yet.. but what smell do you exude? So fulgent genetics charges 540 for self pay, but they do take insurance. You have to have it ordered by your gp. Clean the surfaces with peroxide, or test out a small wall or corner first.\n\nPeroxide is supposed to oxidize and degrade compounds with oxygen. \n\nOzone does a similar thing with oxygen.\n\nI would stay away from chlorinated products because when you oxidize with chlorine, they can smell way worse. \n\nEither way, whatever you do you may have to air out the place though. You cannot just have things staying stagnant to begin with. How close are your houses?", "Possible reason there is no cure. If you have not heard already the military in certain countries and even certain local state or city law enforcement agencies around the world use a behavior modification device that smells really bad. It is called the \"skunk weapon\" . As reported it is sprayed on unruly crowds, drives up streets and sprays houses so that they stink like vomit or rotting meat. So my conclusion is that there is no cure, because they use TMAU just like this skunk weapon, as a torture behavior modification tool. Could it be coincidental how near every form of media feels it is ok to harass people that have odor problems. I see it in movies, talk shows, radio, internet, everywhere you go its ok to humiliate people that have hygienic problems. Its almost like they have this knowing that certain people have this (while at the same time denying it as not showering and deserve to be treated badly) and that it has been cleared legally to embarrass everyone who has TMAU. I agree that society finds it OK to ridicule smelly people. That is most likely because bad smell is associated with laziness and poor hygiene rather than medical illness. \n\nHowever I do not really understand your conclusion that some powers use bad smells to dissipate crowds. I have not heard of it happened. I have only heard of water cannons and rarely sirens for that purpose. \n\nWhether these smell weapons are used or not, I still don t understand how the existence of stink bombs suggests TMAU is incurable? \n\nTMAU 1 caused by faulty genes is surely incurable. TMAU 2 caused by overloads of bacteria is hopefully curable. The part about 'skunk weapon\" being used to humiliate and antagonize people is not my conclusion, it is fact according to information publicly available, just search for more information on that. There is news, wikipedia, official reports of branches of American law enforcement purchasing it from a foreign defense company that makes it.   Now for  My conclusion-  the people in positions of power and influence flat out ignore any illness even exists, swept under the rug so to speak, therefore leading me to believe if there was a cure it would be hidden from public knowledge. If they can dismiss that people are experiencing these problems in such an ignorant uncaring irrational way, then there has got to be more to the problem. Medical technology talks of gene altering therapy, lab made bacterias exist also. There is a possibility that symptoms of TMAU are a bioweapon, or experiment of some kind. And another thing, ask yourself why \"smelly people\" are associated with laziness and poor hygiene rather than medical illness. You just might realize that it is that way because of the influence of media, and the rulers. Media controls the way the masses view a topic. Is there any effort at all that educates people on the issue?  I believe that they want smelly people ridiculed, shamed and abused. So you think that TMAU is a cutting edge bio weapon used by US government bodies bought from a foreign defence company, used to humiliate and antagonise people, and the US Gov/ media makes the general public think that smelly people are lazy/dirty to hide the fact that TMAU is a bio weapon? no, the 'skunk weapon'  is a weapon that is and has been sold to law enforcement agencies around the world. As far as  the facts of TMAU being a similar type of weapon, (being it is odor related) is still yet to be known. The media and people in power are not making it any easier figuring anything out by  whitewashing the whole theory of TMAU being a medical condition, along with various forms of entertainment mocking people with said problems. Sorry but I do not really understand how the fact that there is a skunk weapon being bought and sold between global law enforcement agencies means that TMAU is incurable. Because both TMAU and the skunk bomb both smell bad? \n\nI think it is normal to assume a smelly person is lazy or dirty. Probably 95%+ of smelly people are just dirty. Body odor caused by medical conditions is incredibly rare. That is why it is so embarrassing and painful. Even more rare than that, is people who have learned how to think, and question why things are a certain way. \ud83d\ude02", "Results of FBO poll 20 people replied to my poll. \n\n85% of people with Fecal BO that replied to the poll have constipation and/or incomplete bowel movements. \n\nThis is really interesting. \n\nThe main issue now - causation or correlation?", "Hi I just wanted to say hello.

During this time I had taken antibiotics for a kidney infection, doctor never told me to take probiotics afterwards. Then I think I started getting bowel issues (severe constipation) from working in an extremely stressful environment. I am not sure which one set it off for me.\n\nIt used to happen only at work when I got stressed. I could still take long plane rides and go out in restaurants during this time with no reactions.

Fasting. Just exactly the same! antibiotics, bowel problems only in stressful situations. And some time after that the reactions and comments started It is crazy how so many of us got this after antibiotics! I almost want to go back to my doctor and ask if antibiotics are known to cause these symptoms, but I feel their answer will be the same. \"Take probiotics for a month and see if there is any improvement\". \n\nBut after trying so many brands and strains, I feel like the probiotics actually make it worse.", "I am 15 and feel lost and sad a complete failure I have no clue what I am going to do after high school I am not smart and do not have any hobbies my mom has cancer and I just do not see a future for myself.

That is how my day\u2019s been going, what about yours? I returned to the office after being out for a week. First, someone sprayed perfume.

Creates a fecal scent.", "Got accepted into a good college, not sure if I should go Found this sub and wanted to make an account to post this. I just recently was accepted into a pretty good college but, for obvious reasons, I am having second thoughts about even going. Has anyone here finished an undergraduate program while suffering from TMAU? How was it? I want to believe I can power through it for 4 semesters and be done. I already have my associate\u2019s degree so I will only be at this university for 2 years. Ideally I would take as many online classes as I can and then just hope for the best in regards to the in-person classes. I would most likely be living alone in a studio apartment so that takes the pressure of having roommates off. I will also probably be following the low choline diet while I am there. I have for sure noticed in the past that watching my diet and not eating any sugar or carbs has helped with how strong the smell is, so I am hoping I can recapture that. Lately I have fallen off. \n\nI am sure I do not have to explain to the people of this sub how devastating this condition can be. I guess I just wanted to know what you guys think. I have been accepted for the Spring 2022 semester, so I have to make a decision relatively quickly. I am nervous. Have other people commented on your scent? Whether directly or indirectly, a common experience of having TMAU is overhearing people around you comment on odors, and the most common ones in TMAU are fecal, fishy, ammonia, and acrid. Yeasty, burnt rubber and armpit odors are fairly common too. \n\nDo you have a way to reach everyone at once, like a group email or slack? Discord? I would let your instructor and classmates know ahead of time that you have a metabolic condition that prevents your liver from processing sulfurous compounds from the food you eat. Let them know that IT IS NOT A HYGIENE ISSUE, sulfurous compounds circulate in your blood. If you like, I can mail you cards to pass out to let people know about it. \n\nDo not let TMAU limit your education opportunities. There will be assholes for sure, but there will be more people who are understanding than problematic. A tough decision. We relate to you. \n\nIf I were you, I would try to accept the place. I smelled fecal strongly, all through high school, and did not smell at all at college. I do not know why. When I moved home again I started smelling again. \n\nNo one can take your education away from you and it can grant you more opportunity in the future. Maybe even a better job that will let you work from home and not around others\u2026 \n\nDo you smell only fecal? What are your symptoms GI issues? I have the EXACT same. People can smell shit but I go to the toilet and wipe and there is absolutely nothing there. Not a speck. Doctors also tell me i do not smell and that other patients with constipation do not smell Just go \nIf you dont you will regret it for life and consider ur self as a failure  also try water fasting and drinking lots of homemade kefir  I have most definitely been informed, both directly and indirectly, that I smell.  \n\nI do like your idea but I am also not sure I want to be as overt as emailing everyone in the class to tell them \u201chey I stink, my bad guys.\u201d Maybe I should though, I do not know. I would rather just get through it and if anyone asks, then I can tell them. Having printed cards is a smart idea, I appreciate the offer Do you smell like shit or what It is nice to know there is people who can relate. On the other hand I am sorry that you know what it is like. \n\nIt is for sure interesting that you stopped smelling after leaving home, and then started again when you got back. You have probably already considered stuff like this but is it possible there is an environmental cause for you? Like maybe there is mold in your house that is sticking to you or something is seeping into the water through the plumbing ? I had not considered that myself but I will be sure to take note if something changes after I move away. \n\nGetting a degree is probably best for me so I will not be stuck in manual labor jobs and I figure if I am going to be out in public like this, I may as well be doing something productive like going to school. \n\nAs for the GI issues, I have a structural birth defect  related to the colon. I had surgery to correct it as a baby, which is supposed to be a lifelong fix. Up until I turned 15, I did not have any severe symptoms/ side effects and I definitely did not smell like this all the time. Since it can smell like shit, the obvious connection to make is that it is related to this GI issue but I brought that up with all the doctors I have seen and they tell me it is just not likely and that I need to fix my anxiety. I thought okay maybe I am having accidents and just not realizing it somehow so I approached it with that in mind but it did not seem to help. Especially since I can be totally clean, showered, teeth brushed and wearing deodorant and clean clothes, and I can still get reactions from people. I absolutely refuse to leave the house without doing all those hygienic things as a bare minimum (in addition to whatever else sanitary products I think might help) so it is extremely frustrating when people tell me to take a shower. \n\nI was not convinced entirely that the issue is TMAU but it is very very strange to me that you have somewhat similar experiences. Is water fasting safe ? How many days can you realistically do that Yeah man I do not think it is a great idea to suggest to people of this sub that this voice to skull thing is the cause. This condition causes enough anxiety and paranoia as it is and it sounds like maybe all that anxiety is manifesting for you as an entirely different delusion. I mean that in the nicest way possible. I know you were not replying to me directly but seeing that kind of worried me and I hope you are okay.  I went through college all fine, it was fun. Highly recommended.\n\nFecal smells are not a TMAU symptom, so a low choline diet will not help. TMAU is an inability to process trimethylamine (TMA) and TMA smells like rotten fish(and at high concentration, ammonia, but once it reaches that point it basically causes necrosis  not like other things like sulphur, fecal, rubber. If you read the science articles on the disorder none of them reference fecal smells as a symptom, only weird 'health' sites.\n\nA choline diet is to specifically reduce the TMA compond in your system, if it is not a fish smell a low choline diet may be actively be worse for you.\n\nIt may be something else like SIBO or something, but it might be ORS if doctors cannot smell it / it might have been a smell at one stage but is not around any more.

It only made the bad breath turn into fecal body odor that filled entire rooms.  \n\n\nAt that point my entire personality changed drastically and I became severely depressed and angry with everyone. I leaned on my beliefs (raised in church) when it was convinient because that was all I knew and trusted.  \n\n\nI quickly realized the only thing I could do was become valuable in this world in a way that would allow or force others to accept me for example excelling in school, in sports, or excelling in a career.

Around age 21 I came to the end of myself and considered joining the Navy and then actually joined.   \n\n\nI was told everyone was given a fair chance to prove themselves in the military and make something of themselves there but of course the odor ruined that opportunity too and I was kicked out before even finishing training.  \n\n\nThis is where I am now.  \n\n\nThe feeling of complete failure in every significant I attempt is overwhelming.   \n\n\nI keep hearing stuff like \"This (the military failure) does not define you or what you can do with your life\".  \n\n\nI started a relationship with a girl I met on insta.

Pretty sure I have/had TMAU2. I do plan to get the genetic test to check, but because my symptoms started rather suddenly circa 2013 after a few years of bad diet, binge drinking, smoking cigarettes and doing drugs\u2026 I am pretty sure I developed TMAU2. \n\nThis is where I am confused though- over the years, the only person who has tried to help me is my naturopath. She does not know about TMAU (who does) but we have mostly been treating my gut disbiosis, candida, and more recently SIBO! \n\nI have tested twice over the past few years, and both times my breath test numbers where off the charts. I suspect I have SIBO from stress\u2026 but anyway\u2026 one of the things that can make SIBO worse is probiotics! Ie. The kefir that gut war says can help TMAU. SIBO is an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine, causing painful bloating, constipation or diarrhea. I get really constipated, but have it mostly under control. I just went through a 3 month herbal protocol to kill the overgrowth. I will be focusing on motility with pro kinetics, to make sure my gut is moving. Reading more about TMAU2, and thinking that my SIBO is a secondary illness caused by the stress of TMAU2. \n\nMy question is this: How can I treat the TMAU2 with kefir/probiotics without risking SIBO again?\n\nHas anyone dealt with SIBO and TMAU2? How how you safely integrated probiotics? \n\nSending strength and love to fellow sufferers of this cruel disease. This is a really good topic to be aware of. A few years back another Tmau sufferer wrote about getting SIBO from kefir on YouTube comments, during that time I did not particularly care because I just wanted a cure.\n\nWhat you said coincided with what happened to them, excess of a good thing can become bad. In this case lead to another thing. He / she wrote that they cleansed again. Removed kefir and slowly introduced probiotic capsules because they have less strains than Kefir. They also took fiber. I will try to look for it - and link it here. You bringing this up, made me think. I got rid of my body odor, but now I have really bad breath and trouble breathing. \n\n\nEdit: could not find the exact comment but found a video that shares the story of what they did. The cleanse they took the antibiotic rifaximin (they had a doctor prescribe the antibiotics after taking a test), then aftercare  (I will not write down the medication because I do not know everything and I do not want to appear like a know it all, sorry -_-)  Yes, I think sibo and the constipation causes the bad breath and body odour. The gut bacteria is out of balance and in the wrong place. I think my binge eating and poor diet in the past caused it. Below is my journey and approach. \n\nIm not cured but have been in past. No snacking between meals and chewing well has helped before. Intermittent fasting and lots of sweaty exercise too. \n\nI also think SIBO is the underlying cause. I tested positive for methane in a breath test and tried rifaximin and neomycin course. It did not seem to help. I have tried kefir and kombucha which did not help much either. \n\nI am more focussed on intermittent fasting, chewing well, relaxed eating etc. Plus an organic plant based diet. Low fat too, including low \u2018healthy \u2019 fats. I read even excessive coconut oil is bad for the microbiome. I think Prebiotics can feed good bacteria and crowd out the bad. So I am focussed on fibre and resistant starches. \n\nSo yeah, SIBO is probably the issue but I think mindful eating of a clean vegan diet with help. A diverse plant based diet with resistant starches will crowd out the bad bacteria while feeding the good ones. Do you have patm as well Hey mate I took. A sbo test to, I would like to compare results , honestly I think you should try home made probiotics and give it it a try , it helped me a lot , I am currently off them , have been for a while, but they cured my inflamed bowels and chronic constipation , as of this moment I am not on any protocol I am being lazy , but wanting to get back on one I am just learning about this\u2026 I mean, yes, obviously with this condition I have felt and noticed people reacting to me. Rubbing their noses, giving me looks, making comments.. Not everyone seems to notice or react (especially now that I feel things are under control).\n\nIs PATM and official thing? Is it based on anything other than what we perceive as reactions, but are not sure because we never get full confirmation from the ppl we see reacting? Sometimes I feel like I have symptoms around certain ppl, and I have wondered if my gut bacteria is somehow reacting to whatever they have got going on\u2026 or maybe I am just stressed out by them, causing my body to raise cortisol, etc. \n\nAnyway, so confusing\u2026. Yep I am going to introduce them slowly and cautiously\u2026 Thanks for the advice, I think my past binge eating was definitely a contributing factor too. I have taken two rounds of rifaxamin over the years, but I am not sure if it helped. The herbal protocol, diet changes, and reducing stress seem to help the most. I will keep focusing on those and yeah, hopefully it will add up to crowd out there bad bacteria like you said. I just need to make sure I keep focusing on motility, to keep things moving. SIBO can affect the vagus nerve, stomach emptying, and motility overall, so I really have to attack this thing from multiple sides at once. Hey thanks so much. Yes I totally agree, and that is similar to me. I had TMAU2 symptoms for several years, which I was able to improve with diet and candida herbal protocols with my naturopath. Things were looking good, and I continued to take probiotics religiously. However, after life started to get stressful again, and after one weekend of stupidly drinking shots of whiskey and beer with friends, I woke up one morning with my stomach in a knot and I believe that is when my SIBO symptoms started. I am now on the tail end of treated the SIBO, and feeling good\u2026 I think I just need to be really careful about bringing probiotics back in, which strains to focus on, and how to keep my gut in check (low stress, continue healthy diet). My naturopath plans to start me on soil based probiotics soon, once she feels we are in the clear wit SIBO. Saccharomyces boulardii is a popular one with the SIBO folk, and I think I will focus more on prebiotics, resistant starches, etc, rather than just taking mouthfuls of indiscriminate probiotics capsules of mostly lactobaccilus.  I once tried a tiny shot glass of kefir, and it felt like I had been stabbed in the stomach\u2026 not sure if my gut was just not ready, or if I was having an insane herx reaction, but I have been scared of kefir since, as I think it contributed to me developing SIBO. Beep. Boop. I am a robot.\nHere is a copy of \n\n###( \n\nWas I a good bot? | ( | (  Yes. Keeping things moving through the gut is key.

Hi,\n\nSo I have have a serious fecal odor problem for about 10 years now.  I know that I have this odor because people cough, turn their heads away, and put their hands up to their noses when they approach me.  My coworkers mock me for being unsanitary and because they think I do not shower or wipe after using the bathroom.  When I was in school, other students used to engage in similar behavior.  \n\nNot only do I actually wipe myself, but I use baby wipes to make sure everything down there is *really* clean.  I also shower every day with soap and warm water, so this is definitely not a hygeine problem.\n\nThe intensity of the odor seems to vary depending on what is going on inside my body.  The odor seems to be diminished when I have just recently had a bowel movement.  As soon as I feel movement in my bowels start to brew, that is when the reactions from people start.  When I start to feel gassy, that is when it gets really bad, even if I am not actually farting (I do not fart in public, lol).  My guess as to what is going on is that the odor inside of my colon is so strong that it escapes my anus and people can smell it from outside of my body.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any advice or help with this; I have had no social life for 10 years, I am becoming more and more depressed about my future and I just do not know what else to do at this point.\n\nThanks very much. Watch all of the videos from \u201eThe gut war\u201c on youtube and join the discord, i cured my tmau which i had for 4 years I second traderi's comment. I had this for years too and kombucha and kefir seemed to get everything back to normal. I changed my diet a lot too, eating more salads but most importantly making sure I get the daily recommended fiber.\n\nI think a lot of the fecal odor is coming from being chronically constipated. When you mentioned feeling the churning in your stomach and internal gas - I had this a lot too.\n\n I really do believe if you are constipated enough the odor can come out of your pores and sweat. Please help. I will go out and buy whatever is needed to help myself. What herbs and foods etc should I eat that will help that you ate to heal yourself? I really am tired  \u2639\ufe0f Please help. I will go out and buy whatever is needed to help myself. What herbs and foods etc should I eat that will help that you ate to heal yourself? I really am tired  \u2639\ufe0f I hear you. There is several things I was doing at the same time that i think made it stop.\n\n1) up your fiber daily. Everyday. It really does take a lot of effort to do esp ppl like us who tend to starve ourselves in fear of smelling bad. But a few hours before I go to bed - I eat a high fiber cereal like Kashi or raisin bran. This usually will make me feel the urge to go right as I wake up so everything is gone before I need to leave the house.\n\nThis is a super important step. A lot of ppl with FBO are badly chronically constipated.\n\nWith the fiber you have to drink lots of water too or else things will not move quick enough.\n\n2) really work up a sweat with exercise. Help get all those bad smells out sooner rather than in public. This will speed up your digestion too.\n\n3) Homemade kefir and kombucha. Bought my kefir grains from amazon. Kefir and kombucha promote good bacteria in you. Idk if my gut bacteria was all out of whack but just fiber was not enough for me when I was experimenting with ways to get rid of the odor. \n\n4) low ph level body wash. Along with everything else - when my odor was around I did not realize it but the body washes I was using were all cheap and high ph levels. It made my skin levels alkaline - this helps bad bacteria to colonize your skin. Lower ph levels are acidic which make it harder for bad bacteria to thrive. \n\nThere might be a list online of all the body washes that have low ph. They should be the same cost as the regular ones. But looking up specifically \"low ph soap\" on somewhere like amazon brings up a lot of expensive options.\n\n5) I started seeing a therapist for the anxiety... Not only did they prescribe anti anxiety meds (which really helped me stop sweating so much in public!!) But they were totally honest when I was having an odor, and then when it stopped! These are the people you can absolutely trust to be honest with you on the odor. Seeing one was such a relief to know what was working, and what was not.\n\n6) Be patient with how long it takes to get cured. It took me over 2 months with these methods before people stopped reacting to me. There was a week or two when I just started the kefir that they were reacting worse than usual! \n\n\nTiny note:  I did not mention food specifically besides high fiber cereal because for the most part I am eating what I was before. But with more salads. I tried lots of very strict diets before this and none of them worked and they were hard to stick to!\n\nAnyway I hope this all helps. join the discord server which you will find in the description of all the youtube videos from \"the gut war\" YOU WANT TO READ THIS....   Sooooo I thought I had TMAU for a couple years because my lab results for various tests came back negative or normal and I did not have any other symptoms other than a foul, putrid, sweet smell that sometimes smelled like maple syrup and sometimes like ammonia. However- and this is a big \u201chowever\u201d- I found out I actually had e coli bacteria in my system. E coli has a strange smells to it. It is usually described as RANCID, PUTRID, FOUL, SWEET and like AMMONIA. It varied according to what foods I would eat or how stressed I was. If you are experiencing these smells and your blood tests have come back normal, I strongly suggest that you do an e coli culture test. I smelled horrible for 2 years! Usually e coli in the system can cause sepsis and death if it goes untreated so I am surprised that I dealt with it for so long but I am finally receiving treatment for it and the smell is finally subsiding. I was praying for a healing for a long time. Then I read that this one guy fasted for 21 days and took probiotics tablets the entire time until he was able to cleanse his gut out and then his symptoms went away. I believe that when he fasted he starved the e coli bacteria in his gut. As for me, I am currently taking Cephalexin 500 MG capsules 3 times a day, fasting and continuing with prayer and it is working. Also, you may want to see if you have BV (females) if you have not done so already. BV produces a FISHY odor. I was informed by my doctor that both could take up to 3 treatments over the span of 3 months to get rid of completely because the treatments only kill up to 70% of the bacteria each time. Both the E coli and BV treatments are not to be taken at the same time. So you would go one week with one treatment and another week or two with the other. Let me just say that Dr. Diana Yan in Gaithersburg, MD, USA was the only doctor out of the 9 doctors I met with over the past two years to inform me in detail what my treatment was, what caused the rotten smell that my body was producing and how the different bacteria react to their treatments. I am so thankful for her. What if TMAU is just e coli in people with strong immune systems? I hope you all find this information to be helpful.\n\nFYI, the smell is almost completely gone and I am only half way through my first treatment. Instead of a 10 I would say that I am at about a 4 right now. Yesterday I was at about a 7 on the smellometer (self diagnosis..lol) I noticed that the smell improves overnight. \n\nThank GOD!!!

And whenever I go it feels like not everything is out 100% Do you use anything to help move your bowels? If you do does it help with the smell? I have always had a connection with the number 8 and it is my number. I like the way you made that connection with eating too much because these days it feels like I have a hard time backing away from the table and think about food way more than I should. I also think that it is just sitting in my stomach somewhere causing this nasty smell. Another question. Has anyone been diagnosed with having GERD? Me.. What meds are you taking? Mine is pantoprazole 40mg. And is your odor intermittent? Yes originally when I was not taking anything and constantly had either constipation or incomplete movements -- the odor was very strong and far reaching.  I have definitely seen an improvement with getting everything out before leaving the house. It is not 100% a cure though because some days there is gas no matter what... It is hard taking all these steps to not smell and some days it sucks but it is just going to happen.\n\nI was taking Metamucil everyday but just now switched to Benefiber (ppl said Metamucil caused too much gas for them). If I get near 30g of fiber 9-12 hours before, it usually gets me to go in the morning. If it does not feel like it is going to happen then a coffee fixes that.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot smell the odor on myself so I have to rely on other ppls reactions. I only know my last method worked because my new coworker made a comment on it smelling terrible. That day was the only day I did not do this routine before work.

There is not much of an excuse for grown adults to carry on in such immature ways. It is one thing if someone is genuinely offended and sensitive to odors, and they do what they can to avoid smells, but to blatantly shame, abuse and be hurtfully rude is just not right. It is no different then mocking a crippled person, or someone who has any other sickness. There is no excuse for an adult to act in such a way unless they are retarded or something. We got to use better word than retarded when we mean disabled\u2728 lol but I hear you there is absolutely no excuse for it and I have encountered some of the most vile evil beings because of it, but the truth is most of those people are so miserable, they could have lived their wildest dreams but ppl who go out of their way to be that cruel are miserable on the inside...and nothing will fill them..like a literal abyss. They are just not good people. The thing that is very concerning is how fake they are. For instance, if someone with TMAU  rescued one of these people or even saved their life, these people would probably thank them by broadcasting to the world that the person who saved them was smelly. They are shit on my heal low. Not sure what you mean by that. An affliction from God, or people who are guided to act a certain way by otherworldly beings, or a coven of worshippers working together to ruin s person? I really do not know , I only look at the facts, so thinking something like that would have to be based on some  kind of evidence. An affliction from God because of past behavior sometimes I feel cursed in hope I am wrong thought", "When do you start smelling? Do you get an odor immediately after eating? Or does it take a few hours or a day?  I am not sure if I have TMAU. I have been told I smell like rotten eggs/sewage. It intensifies immediately after eating/drinking certain things, for example, alcoholic drinks, ice cream, beans. Also, when I have a cold or virus, the smell is the absolute worst - it can be smelled from across a room. I have been tested for pretty much everything except for tmau. I am negative for celiac, h pylori, sibo, lactose intolerance. My teeth are in great health also - i get dental cleanings twice a year and never have any problems. \n\nSo do you smell immediately after eating/drinking? And for you smell worst when you have a cold?\nThanks in advance for any feedback. This is incredibly socially crippling. There are plenty of papers that scientifically test this. The short answer to your question is that maximum TMA expression occurs approximately 24 hours after consumption of a precursor ie choline, carnitine, trimethylamine-N-oxide. The TMA expression levels subside to normal levels approximately 48 hours after consumption. For more info let me know and I will dig out some papers. Yes, I have had an odor after eating foods (cheese, alcohol, eggs, coffee, sodas, energy drinks, spicy or pungent foods). I have heard that I smell like I am rotting and that I smell like shit. Thank you for the response. In my situation it happens immediately, like 2 minutes after consuming the food. And anything like alcoholic drinks and beans, the smell stays with me for about a day or two. So maybe I do have TMAU. I am having a real hard time finding a way to get tested. Yeah, same with me. My confidence level is at zero most days of my life. Normal things like going to work and socializing are real challenges. Does the odor start immediately? Like a few minutes after consuming those foods? For me it does. TMA production is 100% microbial. When you eat something it can take 30 mins for the food to be passed through your stomach before it hits your lower intestine where TMA production and absorption occurs. If it occurs instantly, it is unlikely to be TMAU. Liquids and ice cream are really the only two things that cause an instant odor. Could it be that they digest faster maybe? Wow! I am sorry I totally missed your post. Yes, the smell kicks in right away, especially when I eat cheese, drink alcohol and soda like beverages. aw no worries. Yes, same with me. Cheese and especially alcohol I wish I could narrow my odor down to something more definitive. My teeth are great as well but I do have bad breath from time to time. I do not think I have TMAU. I think it is a digestive issue and has to deal with my bowel movements. Honestly, I just do not know. Trying to heal and figure out what this condition is exhausting and it is like looking for a needle in a hay stack at times. \n\nGood luck! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc exactly! It is all so mind boggling. And it is so frustrating because my doctors are useless and it is all up to me to figure it out. \nGood luck to you as well. I am here if you ever want to toss around ideas, or just need to vent. Thank you. I am here for you too.\ud83d\ude0a", "I am TIRED of being \"strong\" Here is my story. It is a LONG one, but I just needed to vent. I have been strung with fecal/fishy body odor on and off for two years. I started working as an event staff at the Eagles stadium on September 27th, 2018. Despite minimum wage, having anxiety, occasionally de-escalating arguments and confiscating weapons/drugs, my job was pretty cool.  \n\nOne day while I was working at a college football game, I bumped into my algebra 1 teacher (Let us call her Ms. C) and her husband, who was also my geometry teacher. They were excited to see me. I was one of their favorite students from my class. I turned off my radio and rushed over to hug them and we had small talk. I noticed their vibe changed almost immediately and it was super awkward. They asked me what I was up to, future aspirations, etc. I noticed while we were talking that they occasionally rub their temples, fidget and wipe their noses. \n\nTwo women who I am guessing were their friends came over to us and as soon as they were within 5 ft of me their smiles dropped. I awkwardly introduced myself and extended my hand. One of them shook my hand and subtly wiped her hand on the side of her pants, and the other just looked at me and told Ms. C \"I will wait for you guys in the car\" and the two women left. I was confused and embarrassed, and I made up a lousy excuse so I could go excuse myself.\n\nOver the next few months, I noticed whenever I was out in public, people gave me dirty looks, pointed at me or avoided coming near me altogether. I tried switching soaps, unscented deodorants, men's deodorants, Epsom salt baths, and even showering four times a day. I still live at home, so I told my father about my problem and asked him to drive me to the doctor. He brushed me off, saying it is not that serious, I just need to change my diet and get a stronger deodorant. He went on a rant about how doctors capitalize off of us by giving us drugs when we could find a solution at home, and that I was too young to take pills.....I was 20 years old at the time, and I told him illnesses do not discriminate. We can fall ill at any given time.\n\n He said he had an odor issue himself when he was young but it was a peanut allergy. (??????) He bought me some crystal deodorant bullshit and after two weeks with no change, I tossed it. We know our bodies and we know when something is not right. I made an appointment anyway and my best friend went with me to the doctor. I explained my problem and they looked at me like I was crazy. They prescribed me a clinical extra strength deodorant and not to my surprise, it did not work. \n\nIt was like the scent that  emanated from my body mixed with the scent from the deodorant and created this unnatural pungent odor. People would cough and tell me I smell like shit. My mother would not sit near me or be in the same room with me. Whenever I left the room to go to the bathroom, she would spray the area I sat in with perfume and mumble under her breath. My dad would turn up his nose and avoid contact with me. Sometimes he got angry and insulted me, blaming my smell on my lack of hygiene......even though HE IS THE REASON I AM LIKE THIS. My managers and coworkers talked shit about me and called me names behind my back.\n\n But still, I went to work and thugged it out. eventually I reached my breaking point. I was working at the Gold Cup soccer game, on the field when one of the players threw a cup of juice in my direction and it hit me, messing up my uniform. I am not sure if it was out of frustration because their team was losing, or because he could smell me. Either way I was too mortified to do anything.\n\n After the game, I clocked out, called a cab, and never came back. My dad noticed I have not worked for over two weeks but he did not question me about it. One day my friend came over to keep me company, and when my dad thought I was out of ear shot, he asked my best friend why I have not been to work and if I had gotten fired. She politely told him that she felt uncomfortable saying anything and that he should ask me himself. He told her that he does not care what happened, that if I do not get a job soon I will have to find somewhere else to go. I came out a few moments later and I asked my friend to come back another time because I did not have the energy to be around anyone anymore. \n\nI was at my wits end and made a post on Facebook about not wanting to live anymore. My family seen it and called my parents and my father called my grandfather. My father came home from work early and scolded me for \"making the family look bad\" and that I should keep from posting certain things online because they could report me and put me away. My grandfather called and talked to me, telling me that I scared him to death and that he loves me (which is bullshit because since I was a younger he would criticize me, call me names and make fun of my depression) I just replied \"okay\" and walked away.  He must have thought I gave the phone back to my dad, not knowing he was on speaker phone. He said \"see I told you that girl was crazy. I know when she was a baby. She is a mistake.\"\n\nOn the 4 of July, my grandfather was hospitalized with stomach cancer. It was a shock to all of us. I dreaded going to visit him, because even on his death bed he found a way to embarrass me. Sitting through the funeral was humiliating. People covered their noses and kept switching places. Eventually there was a large gap on both sides of me in my pew. At the repast, I was not allowed to get my own food, and I sat.in the corner alone while my aunts and cousins repeatedly made remarks about someone smelling like a dead fish, someone not washing up, and other embarrassing things. My parents pretended not to hear anything. \n\nI went to the clinic for the third and final time, and they did blood work. The only abnormalities were high tryglygerides and too much LDL., or HDL, I do not remember which, so I never got diagnosed with tmau, but I still believe I have it. My paternal grandmother also had a fishy smell to her as well.\n I switched to a plant based diet, took a walk twice a day, and exercised vigorously for 90 minutes, twice a  day whenever I was home alone. I lost 40 lbs and noticed I was not getting that many reactions. After about 6 months, life slowly seemed to be getting back to normal until my father announced that he was keeping my grandparents house and moving us there. I did not approve because it just felt like pouring salt into an old wound. But he just said \"that is life you do not always get what you want. You have to adjust to change. When you pay bills you will have a say.\"\n\n A little over a month after we moved in, my symptoms came back 10 times worse. I overhear my neighbors talking about me, my father is disgusted and frustrated with me, and he sprays air freshener by my door whenever he walks by. His dog, which belonged to my grandfather, HATES me now. He can smell me when I come downstairs and he goes into attack mode. My dad says maybe he \"forgot you\" but I know the reason he tries to attack is because of my smell. Going out to the laundromat is a nightmare. \n\nThe clerk locks herself behind the glass whenever I come in, and she wipes down everything I touch. People provoke me and even encourage their kids to make fun of me. Sometimes they even take photos of me. I am tired of having to defend myself everywhere I go, and calling my mom for emotional support only for her to call me a crybaby and to \"be the bigger person\". I am tired of being dependent on my parents and feeling like a burden while my friends are building their lives. I am tired of my parents forcing me to go places but acting too embarrassed to be with me in public. I am tired of missing birthdays and holidays, and being guilt tripped because I choose to stay at home. I am tired of feeling weak but being \"strong\". I am tired of existing. I do not know how much longer I can take this. \n\nA few years ago, I wanted to start up a YouTube channel for entertainment, as a hobby, but I have been thinking of starting it up again to bring awareness to this disease and honesty because I need the extra money. I am just terrified for obvious reasons, and because I do not want it to seem like I am somehow exploiting us. I do not know what to do. \ud83d\ude14 Please do. I am having this issue as well. I am military. I have a foul fecal body odor. For the last 7 years. I have thought about killing myself soo many time I daydream about. I never go through with it. I have been experiencing ill treatment from others so long I am emotionally exhausted. My military doctor told me it was all in my head and to be strong and face the world. Colonoscopy found nothing. I had ONE good friend who was actively trying to help me figure out what the hell was happening to me. Green diet made everything 1000 times bad. Red meat 100 times bad. I stay away from dairy and fast food. I am currently on the FODMAP diet. It helps with stomach pain and reduces the smell to just my proximity and not an entire first floor of a building. I really wish doctors would listen to me and help instead of being indifferent about the situation because they have never heard of it so it is impossible to exist. Hey watch \"The Gut War\" Videos on YouTube Military? Wow, first of all, thank you for your service. Secondly, your feelings are valid, and you are NOT crazy. I am just learning to accept my condition, but I am not claiming it if that makes sense. This condition is cruel and it feels like a curse. I am only 22 and I am honestly tired of living, but there is a part of me that feels like there is still hope for us. Someone on a different post suggested a castor oil pack and it worked for them. Their condition was not genetic though, came after childbirth. But still maybe you could give it a try? You can order it on Amazon or you can go to a Walgreens to purchase the castor oil and make a homemade one. Thank you! That would be a great idea to bring more awareness to people like us! You should start it. Muster up the courage that a lot of us do not have. \n\nBeen dealing with this for 4 years now. I work in food labs and people are always close by while in the lab. No one ever wants to work with me if it was not my boyfriend then I would of ended it in the first few years because of how bad I was harassed at work. \n\nThis illness is emotional exhausting especially when NO ONE believes you or supports you. video is great idea I feel your pain everyone.  Whether you were born with it or acquired it.  I made lists of some things to look into plus I have new stuff that may help.  If you want the links I can post them here or you can PM me. I am glad you are still here, and I admire you for sticking it out! This *really* hit home for me.\n\nFirst I will say that I am also in the Philly area and I know how isolating this can be. Message me if you ever need somebody to talk to/ hang out with.\n\nThat said, your story could have been mine. Last year in March this came on literally overnight with no explanation. For a few months I was honestly oblivious to it until I went on vacation and could hear people talking about me. I started looking back and realized that for months people were avoiding me.\n\nI have also had the people being outright rude and taking pictures of me. I try to do things like grocery shopping and going to the laundromat at night when there is less people just to avoid these situations.\n\nIt is incredibly hard and nobody really understands, they either think you are crazy or just belittle you. I am also living with my family and I am so sorry to hear about how your family\u2019s acts towards you, I have been lucky enough to have a supportive family through this all but I want to work and get my own place. I dread going back to work though, I have had one job since this started and it was a pretty bad experience due to the smell. Yeah this sucks, I know. Sounds like you beat it before, so maybe you can again. Are you binge eating or snacking too much? Those make it worse for me. \n\nSome things to try if you have not already:. \n\nGut war videos, homemade kefir and kombucha. Diverse Plant based. Medium medium program. Organic food. Read labels, Watch for natural flavours, preservatives, fake sugars etc. Try green drinks of juice barley grass juice powder and water. Do not eat before bed. Exercise lots, get sweaty. Chew your food well. Vit b and zinc supplements. Lots of fruits and veggies. Hope that helps! Hi! No need to apologize, you are not a bother. Yeah people from Philly are a different breed... teenagers are the worst. Sometimes I want to smack the shit of of them but they are not worth the trouble. Hopefully there is a cure in the making, or the right person makes a non invasive treatment that actually WORKS and is suitable for all of us. Yes, I have a love hate relationship with food. I grew up on a standard American diet and I am African American so soul food was pretty much what we ate most of the time. Working at the stadium gave me an ego boost (I was always in a situation where I had to be dependent on my parents. They always sabotaged my chances), and finally having a job gave me a feeling of independence. I was eating a lot of salmon and red meat and potatoes and junk food every night, and it backfired.... So now I cut out red meat (beef and pork, I do not like lamb or veal), broccoli, cabbage, seafood, soda, milk, eggs,pastas, etc. And added more fruits and veggies. I asked my mom to order me the zinc and b 12 vitamins but she does not want me taking pills. \ud83d\ude44 So my friend offered  to get it for me. How are you making out? I am making out ok. It is up and down. I am into green drinks now. Seems to help. I really need to watch the over eating. That is the worse for me. \n\nI also like the medical medium program. I am trying celery juice and lowering my fat content. I was eating too much nut butters and oils. Healthy oils but they are\u2019s still fat. Hi just curious to know, how does castor oil help? Thanks I am so sorry you are going through this! \ud83d\ude2d I am also going through the same thing, I left my job due to this illness. I was perfectly fine and all of a sudden I started noticing my body odour had changed. I hardly go out anywhere but if I do I go when I know the place will not be busy. Have you tried kefir? Hey man, have you always had it? Try daily chlorella and probiotics(kefir ect) \nHello! You have made the mistake of writing \"ect\" instead of \"etc!\"\n\n\"Ect\" is a common misspelling of \"etc,\" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase \"et cetera.\" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as \"et\" to \"and\" + \"cetera\" to \"the rest;\" a literal translation to \"and the rest\" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. \n\n(\n\n^(I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Message me for bug reports.) ", "I Got Selected For Jury Duty So three days ago I got a jury duty summons and a questionnaire in the mail. I have managed to evade them since I have had this condition (almost 3 years now), but I  think my time is up. They specified if I do not return the questionnaire or if I am a no show without having been properly excused (disability, illness, financial crises with proof) I could face a $500 fine and/or 10 days in jail. So I filled out the questionnaire and listed my \"hardships\". I briefly explained that my condition induces anxiety, is psychologically challenging and I am limited financially and in other areas of my life. But TMAU, and bromhidrosis is so rare I doubt they will excuse me and think I am bull shitting. I have never been diagnosed with tmau but I have officially been diagnosed with bromhidrosis and hyperhidrosis so that is all the proof that I have. Fuck this disease and fuck the system for forcing people to waste our precious time playing God and judging folks for shit that is not even our business. Land of the free my ass. I had the same issue and I ended up roughing it out. Hopefully you just end not being selected for the whole process. My jury got extended to a whole week! I ended not sitting next to anyone and not really talking. Ended up letting someone be the leader and handle gathering everyone is opinion to help determine our verdict. \n\nI notice a lot that older folk do not to care or smell anything and I got lucky that there were so many older people you may be lucky too! Beep. Boop. I am a robot.\nHere is a copy of \n\n###( \n\nWas I a good bot? | ( | ( This is my nightmare. Hopefully I will be able to get out of the inevitable jury duty call too. I feel if you have a psychiatric phobia diagnosis documented it might help along with the paperwork for bromhidrosis. Being honest and up front with your fellow jurors is possibly the best way - like when you are sitting around doing introductions, an 'Apologies in advance, I have a genetic disorder which means my gut cannot process certain proteins, which occasionally comes out my pores and smells a bit like rotten fish. These proteins are basically in all foods so there is not a lot I can do about it.' \n\nThat way you have flipped it, the other jurors will not be wondering and whispering, you can just have frank conversations about it. And after x weeks you walk away from 11 strangers you will never see again.\n\nPlus then you can make the jokes - \"something about the prosecution smells rotten and I do not think it is me\". I Just had to wait and then we were all dismissed. chill bruh, just right on the qustionare \"i WILL show up to the court smelling like shit, so pick me or not, the chioce is up to you\" oof, did u get chosen? i dont know if u watch BOS but he vloged himsef (has tmau) going to jury duty, but in the end he ended up not gettn chosen, probly cuz he stunk so bad. the judge must have been like \"i should sentence this guy to take a bath\" lol \n\n( Shut the fuck up you troll No. We were all dismissed. The trial was dismissed so we were never questioned. Just had to sit around in a big cafeteria type room.  I had Jury duty 20 yrs ago and was chosen. No issues but I did not have TMAU then. Well I do not remember reactions back then. I had no idea what TMAU was. I wish I could go back to that time. I want to be free.  :/ Nah you chill. And I was already excused so there is that.", "Question/tmau experience Did anyone else have a teacher that picked on you because of tmau? I know I had a few. So tmau for me got bad before I started high school. My sophomore year, I had this chemistry teacher. She was so mean to me. I was not a bad student btw. Anyways, I was at my lowest point and was in the process of scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist. So there was around 2 times I left that class early. Idk if she took it as me not liking that class. She would treat me differently, there was another girl who was absent sometimes and she would always give her the work she missed before she could even ask for it. I literally had to ask her for it every time. She would make a lot of comments about a smell. One being \u201cI rather smell that instead of the stinky kid who never showers.\u201d I remember hearing that and it felt like the last straw for me. I held everything in until I got home. I literally had a panic attack+mental breakdown. My mom was very concerned, I just kept saying \u201cI cannot do this anymore\u201d. Literally felt like I was dying. This happened one more other time, but I cannot remember what she said that time. Anyways I think its ridiculous and immature that she was picking on/humiliating a minor. It was pretty traumatizing for me. If I ever run into her in the future and she approaches me, I am not going to be nice. Explain it to her. And tell a supervisor you trust about the abuse while working on your condition. I am no longer in high school, just sharing an experience. I actually did report that she was being mean to me back then, they did not really do much. So I had to deal with it. Well at least you tried. We all got to deal either way. Yes in middleschool I had a teacher making comments. I actually was weird and did not know what was going in and would walk around airing out my armpits. She commented on that.  And would always taking about taking a shower. In hindsight it is a little funny. Kind Of devastating. Just got to get past it. I hope you are in a better place. What a shame! When I was about 14/ 15 some teachers were nice (but accidentally horrible) and pulled me over and asked if I was OK/ needed to go to the toilet. One made a new seating plan that sat me on the other side of the room from him. Another asked me what a wet floor sign means and said \u2018looks like a man has had an accident does not it.\u2019 And laughed to herself. I relate to how it was. Sorry this happened to you. I had to study for medical technology board, I went to a high passing review center. Everyday I felt anxiety seeing the building. I had one specific  passive aggressive lecturer  (whom unfortunately everyone liked and was heralded as one of the best in the center), she was a downright bully. I am near sighted and one time forgot my glasses and had to sit next to the board\u2026 she stopped asked if there was any space in the back. Then she mostly blocked the side of the board I needed to see. Comically other people moved to the other side of the room to see better, I stayed at my spot\u2026ashamed.\n\nShe would talk about smells like if someone had a smelly lunch, did not bathe or asked if I wanted to sit outside. I traveled very far so I can attend everyday and go back home, when I took the exam - I went to a wrong room and the people who remembered me whispered how they would not be able to focus. \n\n\nI have improved my smell, but those days I wondered how I made it alive mentally. Stress from reviewing, travel, hearing people who do not understand this disorder put us down and exams. I could not take the exams without being high.", "Wayward musings. Rhumba music is one of the interests I seem to have picked up recently. I used to loathe rhumba,but I do not know what made me make such a drastic change. How the tables turn. Now rhumba is one of my favourite music genres. I now normally listen to rhumba on local radio stations and have downloaded some mixes from YouTube.\n\nTrimethylaminuria has a severe effect on self esteem. My self esteem is pretty low. I generally regard myself as a 'sad sack of shit'. Those are some choice words right there. The mental mess that accompanies trimethylaminuria is hard on the soul. I used to habitually think of suicide. Suicide seems like an interesting solution to a rather 'interesting' problem. The pychiatrist put me on antidepressants and antipsychotics. These medications got rid off suicidal ideation completely. One disappointing side effect of these head meds is weight gain. I used to weigh around 60 kg but now I am close to 100 kg. Thanks to the head meds,I\"m out of shape.\n\nAnother effect of trimethylaminuria is limited career choices. I do a bit of farming currently. I have been considering going back to campus. I dropped out of uni from my economics course. I will try to bring my disorder to a manageable level before I can apply to be admitted back to college. I will the better part of 2023 doing that. I have been practicing my writing skilks in preparation to become a freelance writer. Computer programming is also another career path that has attracted my attention.\n\nTrimethylaminuria has also made me undateable. I do not know if I will ever have a girlfriend with the way things stand. My attempts at finding a fellow trimethylaminuria sufferer to date have been unfruitful. I do not know if I will ever have kids. Would it be wise,seeing that I could end up passing this horrid condition to them? That is a nagging thought at the back of my mind when I contemplate the future.", "Does anyone has other symptoms beside the smell, i have hot flashes and crazy heat sensitivity and i sweat like crazy all the time. I have not diagnosed yet because doctors in europe doesnt know what tmau is and how to test it ", "Has anyone here followed gut wars (Youtube channel/discord) and been cured? ", "I have lost all hope Hi guys, I have had severe body odour since I was 12. I was always hopeful that I would find a solution and things would get better when I was younger but I am about to be twenty and I have lost all hope. I have tried everything under the sun to get rid of it, if I listed all the things I have tried I would be typing until tomorrow. Nothing works, and nothing will ever work. I cannot explain how painful and exhausting it is living like this, this is pure torture. I ask myself everyday why this happened to me. People think I am dirty even though I shower twice a day. It is so frustrating because I try so hard. Sometimes people spray deodorant and perfume on me and make cruel jokes. I feel so guilty when someone has to be near me and has to smell me. I wish I could tell them I cannot help it, everyone makes it obvious that they hate me or are annoyed by me. But I cannot blame them because I would have probably thought the same. The reality is starting to sink in that I am not going to be able to get a job or get married and have children. I am not going to be able to support myself and I will spend all my life in solitary. I am dominated by anxiety and depression every day, I truly have not felt happy in 10 years. When people say there is no point they are usually wrong, but I honestly believe that there is no point for me. Sometimes I think I would be doing the world a favour if I committed suicide because then people would not have to put up with my awful body odour. I am so sorry. You are young still. Please hang in there. I know how you feel. \u2764\ufe0f Look into trans resveratrol on Amazon.ca or regular resveratrol or alternatively take Japanese knotweed a.k.a.

Take 1-3 tbsp daily, more than that and it will detox the liver too quickly.  \n\nMildronate found on amazon.ca will stop odour but it raises the heart rate so be careful.  Do not take when you eat your food triggers.  \n\nLook into the Monash University FODMAP diet app to determine food triggers. \n\nEnsure you are eliminating at least once a day so that the  bad bacteria will not have a chance to build up in your gut and come out in your feces.

I am 19 and it is the 4th year since I had this unknown body odor problem (not TMAU). I felt extremely lonely before I met my online friend. This may sound discouraging but because of this odor, the only way to make friends without anyone feeling uncomfortable is through the Internet. It also helps talking to people with the same issue. Make me feel much less alone. \n\nI am also in a pretty active discord group where people who have this problem talk about their new remedies, tips and advices. It feels good to have a community of people to back each other up. DM me if you want to. Honestly OP, I suggest working on your mental health. I use a topical vitamin D cream and a leaky gut powder and it improved my anxiety and depression by a ton. I am 33 and its only now that I am coming to terms with this. I started standing up for myself. I own up to the fact that I smell. No more running, hiding or being shamed. It is the shame that is killing us. I feel liberated and honestly happier than I have felt in a long time. I went to a naturopath and he put me on a very strict diet. I fell off, but once I finish all the testing he ordered, I am getting back on it. I do not know if I will ever figure out this problem 100%, but I am going to keep going and trying my best. I am not giving up. You are young and the possibilities are endless. Rest and take a little while to rejuvenate, but live to fight another day. I want a great comeback story and I know I will get it. You can have yours too. could you share the discord? Dmed you First you need to stop doubting yourself. Idc how long you have had this condition but there is nothing you cannot overcome, you got this brother and I will pray for you. I am battling the same thing too so you are not alone Been had this body odor issue since I was 14, I am not sure if it is TMAU though. Maybe. I do not know. But all I know is that  it would not go away after heavy showers.  I am 21 now and still has not changed. Been through the same bullshit as you. It is tough Ik but I learned that I just need to keep pushing through. You got to keep going too. Someday we will all be cured from this I am sure of it. I know this Post is a little old but I am 34 and I to just started to stop caring and just live my life.

Also, after some extensive research I have been contemplating saving up to get a miraDRY procedure to stop the excessive sweating and maybe alleviate the strong smell from my pits. Most patients have reported up to 80% of sweat and odor reduced after the procedure. Any thoughts? How is everyone else feeling today? I did the miraDry in 2019 it did not work!!

Hi,\n\nI am trying my best to cope with the fact that I smell like doodoo. I wish I can pin point exactly why I smell the way I do but I am not sure if its due to actually having TMAU or from microbiome issues. I use to never smell so terrible but I happen to recognize where I picked up this odor from. I use to go to a gym and there was an autistic guy who comes in to use the machines and he smells exactly how i smell now. This one individual gave off this fecal-smelling odor and the entire gym use to avoid him. I remember one day I was sitting down on the Tricep Push-down machine, and I could already tell that he had been using it. ever since that day I came home with a foul smell not knowing that his bacteria might have transferred over to me and now my body is producing the smell of his bacteria.\n\nI am desperately seeking advice to move forward and get back to normal. I do not want to smell like this because it makes basic activities difficult to do as nobody wants to be around someone who constantly smells like a pile of crap.\n\nI have a fit lifestyle and good eating habits but having bad odor can be so damaging as it makes me want to stay away from the gym for the sake of others which could eventually lead to a decline in my own physical activity. (sweating can make things worse)\n\nI shower twice daily, with benzoyl peroxide (antibacterial soap) and apply antiperspirant deodorant after my showers and supplement with 'body mint' (chlorophyll) but I still feel as if i am waking up to the smell of filth, please help! Yeah. I have this too. I think it is a gut issue. I highly doubt you got it from some else. \n\nAre you constipated? That could cause it. Otherwise I would focus on really cleaning up your diet. Go organic plant based vegan. Intermittent fast. Chew your food well. Cut out nasty oils like canola oil and deep fried foods. Avoid processed foods, sugar, corn syrup, natural and artificial flavours etc etc. Keep working out. Sweating helps detox. \n\nWatch the gut war videos on YouTube. You might have ibs, I am deal with a similar situation myself and going on a FODMAP definitely helped. Try seeing a gi doctor as you might have a parasite or some other issue related to your digestive system. Hope this helps. \n\nYou can ask the ibs community on Reddit if you have more questions or to check and see if your symptoms are similar. I wonder if benzoyl peroxide is a great choice for FBO.  hey, thank you for the advice. I definitely think its a good idea to seek professional help for my condition. Did you solve It? I have the same problem... could be a parasite", "What other symptoms do you experience? And do you feel like the odor is constant or only comes out with stress, sweat, trigger foods, etc?

(i cannot eat for like an hour between each capsule) then after i am done with all 3 which is around 4, i then make sure to eat + taking my probiotics 3 hours later cause taking it right after would not give it any effect. i then eat sauerkraut and drink kefir right before going to bed. how does that sound to you? any changes u think i should make? i dont eat meat at all. only chicken, and that is only a mini treat i allow myself to eat on top of quinoa sometimes, so i think i will be good on that aspect. That sounds like it will work let me know how everything goes after treatment we all know antibiotics like to throw our system off and possible the cause of getting TMAU out of nowhere so I know how u feel I think your on the right path with everything Yes I notice my odor changed when I went vegan I do still have it but it is more of a musky smell then the garbage or fecal smell it really helps our condition Meat is just not good for us and I to eat things that is not vegan  every now and then Have chicken or seafood but very little do u think yours fills up rooms? idk, i feel like nobody has anything to say when i am around. like i can never tell if i smell or not and sometimes i feel like everybody\u2019s staring at me bc i do in fact smell Mines can when I am nervous it can fill a room  but if I am not nervous u can smell it if your close to me but when I used to smell like garbage or fecal I could not smell my odor but everybody else could now I can smell my odor it is  musky/ or like urine sometimes light sometimes  really strong what did U do to reduce the odor besides going vegan ? if u feel comfortable sharing of course I do not think I have reduced it i think I changed the smell I still have and odor wish I was In The clear lol but I am not I still smell it is just the musk odor but I went vegan ,kefir maybe for 3 weeks I did take probiotics as well Saccharomyces Boulardii (10 Billion CFU Per Serving) also the women probiotics as well both at the same time I also did the yogurt and coconut mixed on my skin in areas for like 3days and I take omega 3 2000mg and vitamin D mix I did not see a change into like the 3rd week of being vegan and taking the supplements and doing the yogurt thing oh and I do drink apple cider ginger and eat cilantro with almost very meal great benefit antibiotics would reduce tmau symptoms (certainly in the short term, at least), not increase them, so there is nothing to worry about. they do however have other less positive effects aside from that, that make them a poor long-term TMAU solution but people have used antibiotics as a short term fix for the problem. so long story short i would not worry too much abit", "Did tmau1 randomly start when puberty started for anyone ? I am wondering because I want to see if I have tmau 1 I did not smell at all back then but randomly during puberty I started smelling bad, I was just wondering if you guys can comment back and tell me if you guys are similar.

Alot worse. It skipped two generations and hit me. My grandma, brothers, cousins and aunties do not have it. It is strange but I do not have uncles. Only great uncles on both sides. Which are my mom and dad uncles. There funny but old. A 20 year old is a young adult, right? Yes. Younger Not around puberty, but it started in my teens.

( **This post was copied and Pasted links to original post and poster are provided.** \n\n\\-  u/chandlabing123 \n\n\"I can help you with this, I developed this problem for about a year and it was BAD. I know exactly what caused it and I fixed it 100% in 2 months. And it is gone for good. I know exactly how you feel, the comments, the faces people make, always wondering if you really Do smell bad, or if you are just crazy. Over analyzing everything whenever you leave the house, freaking out whenever somebody mentions the word \"smell\". It is an absolutely cruel thing to have to go through, and I would not wish it upon my worst enemy. but the good news is, it is completely beatable, as long as you are willing to do whatever it takes with complete and total dedication. Because unfortunately, you cannot half-ass this. You either want to smell normal again and would do anything you had to, or you are content with smelling like shit for the rest of your life. You are going to have to go on the most difficult, strict diet/lifestyle you can imagine. I am going to outline it for you in every single detail, why? Because I have experienced this pain and suffering, and I told myself that when I was cured, I would help as many people as possible to do the same. Please, trust what I am about to tell you, I guarantee you that if you do exactly what I say, you will be normal again. I spent hundreds of hours learning about this in order to fix myself, I consider myself an expert on this topic.\n\nThe problem-You have either Candida or Leaky Gut. Or you may have both at the same time which is very likely. Candida is an overgrowth of bad bacteria in your body. Leaky gut is a condition where the lining of your gut becomes damaged and \"leaks\". Normally, your gut lining is like a filter or net. It has small openings that allow good things to come through, but bad things to stay out. When the lining is damaged, the holes become bigger, allowing toxins, bacteria, and undigested food particles into your bloodstream, which you then sweat out. Bacteria and toxins, in large amounts, will mimic the smell of shit, or even garbage, acid, basically, any terrible odor..an overgrowth of candida is often what causes a leaky gut, because the bacteria essentially are drilling holes Into your gut lining, looking for food to stay alive.\n\nWhat causes candida? Lots of things, mostly, a SAD diet(standard American diet). This diet is high in sugar, carbohydrates, and processed foods. Antibiotics can also cause a candida overgrowth because they will destroy good bacteria along with the bad, and it can cause an imbalance that will eventually become more severe. Drinking alcohol regularly can also be the culprit.\n\nThe cure- there is no pill that you can take that will fix this unfortunately. Do not believe what anybody tells you, even if it helps for the first week or two, it will not last, because it will not address the root problem. The cure is complete and total dedication to a diet and lifestyle for a long enough period of time that you allow your body to heal. And even after you heal, you will need to treat your body right, in order to make sure that it does not happen again. I want to stress that there are ZERO cheat meals allowed on this diet, even one bite, will set back your progress. It is not going to be fun or easy.\n\nHere is the diet-\n\nNO SUGAR whatsoever. You are going to have to read the label and ingredients on every single thing you eat. You cannot have sugar in any form. Not even fruit. Sugar is what is feeding your candida, keeping it alive. You probably have noticed that you smell much worse after eating something high in sugar, it is because you are giving the bacteria a surplus of food to keep reproducing and growing. Read every single nutrition label and ingredients, sugar is sneaked into just about everything we eat.\n\nNO CARBOHYDRATES whatsoever. Carbs convert into glucose, which is the exact same thing as sugar. Carbs are now your enemy just like sugar. The most obvious forms of carbs are pasta, rice, beans, pizza, tortillas, cereal, oats, wheat, barley, and so much more. Even vegetables have small amounts of carbs, but this is the 1 exception that you can have, only certain vegetables thought.\n\nNO CAFFEINE whatsoever. Caffeine causes adrenal fatigue, it weakens your immune system, and it raises the production of glucose (sugar) in your body. No more morning coffee. Not even decaf because it still has small amounts of caffeine in it. You can have caffeine-free tea only.\n\nNO ALCOHOL whatsoever. Hopefully, this one is obvious, alcohol contains sugar, and beer contains yeast, they will feed candida.\n\nNO NUT PRODUCTS whatsoever- no peanut butter, no almond butter, sunflower butter, cashews. The only type of nut you can have in moderation is macadamia nuts.\n\nNO PROCESSED MEATS- this includes things like deli meats, hot dogs, sausages. The only meat you can have is GRASS-FED MEAT AND WILD CAUGHT FISH.\n\nNO EGGS- unfortunately, eggs cause inflammation, your gut lining is severely inflamed at this point. So eggs as well as any food that can cause inflammation is off the table.\n\nNO DAIRY- this one is huge. Dairy of all kinds is not allowed. It is highly inflammatory. Make sure every single thing u consume is dairy, lactose, and caseine free.\n\nHere is what you CAN eat. And it is what you should eat during this whole period.\n\n\\-grass-fed beef, steaks -wild-caught salmon -Uncured, sugar-free, hormone-free, antibiotics free bacon. -coconut oil, up to 4 tablespoons a day -macadamia nuts, up to 2oz a day -coconut milk, up to 2 cups a day -spinach -kale -asparagus -broccoli -brussels sprouts -salt -pepper -turmeric -garlic -avocado oil -olive oil -bacon fat\n\n* duck fat\n\nThat is basically all you will be able to eat. Which brings me to my next point. You need to put your body into a ketogenic state. It is called a keto diet. Look it up, it is where instead of your body running on sugar and carbs, it runs on fats instead. Since you cannot have sugar in carbs, you will not have any energy and will feel like shit. But if you go into ketosis, you will feel great and energized during this time. You need to be eating 75% fat, 20% protein, and 5% carbs(or about less than 40 grams of carbs a day) download the app \"my fitness pal\" to make sure you are eating enough fat\n\nSupplements you have to take\n\nL glutamine (powdered form)- 80 grams every day for 2 weeks, and then 40 grams a day after that.\n\nOil of oregano\n\nGrapefruit seed extract\n\nPao D'arco tea\n\nReal grass-fed bone broth\n\nFish oil\n\nMagnesium\n\nPotassium\n\nMilk thistle\n\nApple cider vinegar(one-shot mixed into water with every meal)\n\nDigestive enzymes\n\nHigh quality probiotic\n\nFiber supplements\n\nYou want to exercise regularly, to sweat out toxins. Here is the thing. It is going to get worse before it gets better because all of the candida is going to start dying off because you are starving them out. Do not lose hope. Keep going no matter what, I promise you it will work, no matter what stuck to the diet and the smell will start to fade away. There were times when I lost hope, and did not think it was working. But now here I am, only 2 months later and I am free. Since you have had the problem longer, I estimate that if you do this diet flawlessly, it may take you closer to 4 months. But would you rather do whatever it takes for 4 months, to become a happier healthier person? Or give up and smell terrible for the rest of your life? The answer is easy\n\nMessage me if you have any questions at all I will help\" \n\n- u/chandlabing123 This is more applicable to type 2, the non genetic type. \n\nIf you have faulty gene, FMO3, rs72549326 (T,T,) then your body just cannot digest the substance. However many do not have the faulty gene ( anyone can test with 23me, Ancestry ), they are type 2 and as we do not yet know what causes this, then a diet as above MAY help and is worth a shot. yes Anyone have success doing this?

I am so sorry you are going through this, stay strong Maybe try some USP or BP or food grade boric acid powder.  It is an old school antibacterial powder used for cuts, scrapes, stinky shoes, intimate area cleansing etc.  Order online or ask a pharmacist to order.  It is around $6 for a 125 gram bottle but cheaper online.  After showering add a tiny bit to a damp washcloth and rub on skin.  Also look into trans-resveratrol powder or look into Japanese knotweed a.k.a. itadori tea, or regular resveratrol, TUDCA powder or capsules, milk thistle seeds either chew very, very thoroughly or buy pre-ground or grind yourself or buy capsules - start slow with the milk thistle like 1 tsp per day, chances piedra, cascara sagrada capsules - cheap if you go to mypoints.com then from there go to vitacost.com, calcium d-glucorate, zinc picolinate and vitamin B2.  There is a med called Mildronate that will very effectively stop the odour but it also raise the heart rate, so be very, very careful.  It is pricy, on Amazon.ca.  You have to avoid your food triggers while taking it.  May not need to take it every day. I am sorry too dude. It is tough, I know. I never let it affect my life decisions. Just show up and try to live life as normal. Most people are very inner focused and do not really care about others. Otherwise really try to clean up your diet. Stop sugar, gluten, dairy and processed food. Exercise. Just eat simple clean diet. Fruits and veggies. Do not over eat. Check out he gut war videos on YouTube and the Medical Medium. You can fix this. 100%. DM if you want to talk further. Try to avoid food that makes odor worse ( check out which food is high in choline). Start eating probiotic food like kefir.\nAdd some supplements, like zinc, B2 and activated charcoal. Charcoal should be taken apart from supplements. AirPods so you cannot hear remarks.

I am trying to pinpoint where the smell is coming from. Mine I think is my face &amp; hair interesting, i think all of mine is coming from my butt. What smells do you give off? Whenever I rub my face it smells just like my butt but not as strong. And I can scrub my butt for five minutes straight and it still stinks when I get out of the shower. So I think my smell comes from butt, face, and scalp. Same thing here, I take extra time on my butt and when I get out I still smell something musty coming off between my legs which i assume is my butt. So tired of it I think it is from all my pores... What smell do you give off? Is it an all day thing? Fecal smell....Yes, all day long. When i eat sugar and some other foods the smell gets alot worst i am sorry to hear that, have you tried drinking kombucha? I also recommend taking Garden of life RAW Kombucha pills, i am currently taking 2 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon and I believe the may be helping a bit. Not yet, but i am hearing a Lot of people having good results with kombucha, i will try It too...I am using Kefir, It is helping a little bit. But the thing that is really helping is mapping the foods that i need to avoid. When i follow the diet for 1 week or 2 the smell reduce a lot. Fruit salad helps too What are your meals looking like? I have been practically starving myself and it is helping me, but i know I have to eat. sweat glans anywhere that is warm smells bad Do not do that, i did It too and lost almost 10kg, and now will be Very hard to gain that again My armpits seem to be the problem. Before switching to non scented products, I used to give off a fecal or sometimes sickly sweet odor, now I smell like dried sweat. I also sweat A LOT. I cannot walk more than 3 blocks without my face, hands and underarms soaked in sweat. So I think I have hyperhidrosis. Whenever I am sorting out the laundry, I notice faint pit stains on my shirts so I put a bit of detergent over those areas and rub it in to ensure they smell fresh after the wash.

Keep a log of what you eat and your reactions and any bloating / cramping / diarrhea so you can see what foods are causing your symptoms.   \n\n\nEasy low-choline diet:  \nBreakfast: Oatmeal with brown sugar, some butter  \nSnack: Flour tortilla and banana  \nLunch: Sandwich with lettuce, tomato, butter, sliced turkey\n\nDinner: Pasta with tomato sauce, ground turkey, salad with vinegar and olive oil", "Is Tmau2 the same as SIBO? Are they the same thing?? TMAU is a metabolic disorder, even genetic. SIBO is literally just as the name says, it is a bacterial overgrowth. I am not sure how these got mixed up but It seems there is a whole community of people who believe they are one in the same. It is kind of scary the misinformation being spread. IMO if having hope is more important then facts, I suggest you go join a religion. Yeah I agree, you cannot believe everything you read on the internet. But....is not secondary tmau caused by gut bacteria? If that were the case a simple bacteria analysis of the gut would prove this. I have not seen anything. Personally I have had my gut checked on multiple occasions and everything was normal. Though mine may be genetic or I just may not have TMAU. It is all very confusing to me especially since my doctor does not support it. From what I have seen it is all hearsay. I think with SIBO one may not always have breath or body odour.  With TMAU2 there would definitely be an odour.  GERD, SIFO (fungal), hernias, lower esophageal sphincter issues, incomplete evacuation, intestinal permeability, gastroparesis etc. can also play a part as well. Sibo can cause TMAU2 I have a small hiatal hernia. It is hard for me to believe that it is the sole cause though. I do not have normal \"bad breath.\" I can have an odor that can be room filling and described as sewage or rotten eggs. I have yet to come across someone with a hiatal hernia and this symptom. Yeah same....every time I have brought up having an odor to a doctor, they did not really take it seriously. I feel like i am on my own with this. I wish testing was easy, I am having a hard time trying to figure out how to get tested.\n\nYou said you had your gut checked. Have you ever had an endoscopy? A small hiatal hernia was found on mine but there is no way that it could be causing all this odor. I had a colonoscopy years ago. Nothing came of it. I have seen two gastros as well. The last one sent me to a psychiatrist cause I broke down in her office. Only thing they have found from testing is I have an unexplained fatty liver. Probably genetic but they do not know. Hi you mentioned that you started smelling immediately after consuming food. I sometimes have the same. In the past coffee, alcohol and bread made me smell instantly. Now its only peanuts, dairy and drinks like kombucha. I wonder too what the hell this can be?! yes pretty much same with me. Kombucha and kefir make me smell immediately. I do not drink coffee, but caffeinated tea makes me smell immediately. It is really frustrating and a self-esteem killer. Sometimes I do not even want to leave home because of it. I have a hiatal hernia, so I am thinking it is that. But...there are plenty of other people who have one that do not have this horrendous side effect. Sorry to read that. Maybe it is the dimethyl sulfide?  thank you for the articles. Definitely gave me some insight on what this could possibly be. I am glad it gave you some insight, after all I know exactly what it feels like being desperate to know the cause. I also found this link yesterday:  and that confused me even more because for me, the problem started after taking phospatidylserine and now I wonder if it has something to do with the lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) that supposedly this darapladib drug inhibits. It is not really clear what it is that causes the bad side effect from this drug:  what do you think? I find biochemistry kind of difficult and it makes me angry that I need to try to figure out this crap myself because its just my luck to have something that doesnt seem to have been studied much at all , however it could have been something worse ... lots of people have illnesses there is not even a cure of money for treatment for... things like that makes me so depressed about life and why I want to take supplements to be less depressed but with this kind of inconvenience I can take nothing without starting to smell like a skunk again. Thiugh otherwise everyone is coughing around me as well anyway as exaggerated as if they are in a sewer or something so what does it matter but now at least I cannot smell it myself. Sorry for the rant, everyone here seems to be in the same boat, it sucks! But on the other hand, you need to think positively about life otherwise you will go crazy so I will try. You are right, there are others who are in worse situations. And I feel the same - it is something we have to figure out on our own. Telling doctors is useless (I have tried). There possibilities are endless and that is what is confusing the most. I have had several tests and the only thing that seems like it can be causing it is my hiatal hernia. Gut dysbiosis can cause TMAU2 literally the same that happens to me. everything u said matches to what happens to me. what i noticed helped me reduce patm recionts was to intermediate fast till the end of the day, and also hold in bowel movements for at least 2 days but not more than that. I took l carnitine (very low dose) and I got the symptoms again, but only for two dats fortunately.\nSo it was the l carnitine ! That I took in a way higher dose previously. I am so glad I found out because it probably means I have the gene for (hopefully transient) trimethylaminuria same, I, when I take protein shakes it makes it worse, its like workout supplements are what cause tmau. Yes is it very annoying :( hiw much di you take do you have this problem with lower dosages as well? Do they have l carnitine in them? Or just protein?", "Methyl B ? Has anyone in here tried methyl b or any other supplement that helps breakdown trimethylamine ?", "Please fill out this short survey. ", "My dad Sorry if this is the wrong sub idk where to post. But my dad has this smell from time to time... and idk how to describe it but it smells like old people. (He isnt that old btw). It smells strong and kind of bad. Sometimes it takes up the entire apartment (small), and I worry I smell like it too. Define 'old people smell'. TMAU is autosomally recessive. Your mother would also have to carry an inactivating genetic mutation for FMO3 for you to have it. There are other conditions that cause body odours. Isovaleric Acidemia etc. Sorry I did not think this was the right sub but i have no idea where to go What does the smell remind you of? Like old people, a nursing home /: Bad smells can come from anything. Maybe he has a leaky gut? Best way to go about this is openly tell him, really. It is likely that if you can smell him, he could smell you too. Make sure his and your hygiene and diet is okay and suggest going to a doctor. Oh he knows lol I have told him before. He doesnt care tho. He does have bad digestive stomach issues, probably hietal hernia, and a whole number of other issues. from what I have noticed tmau is not something you can inherit, since it almost always just one person in a family that has it,  the smell may be attaching to your clothes but that would be the most. Dont smells go on your skin and hair too? Like how when you go to a restaurant then you smell like it when you leave? Have him go see his doctor and go with him when he does - to assure the doctor that there is an odor. Most of them will dismiss an odor unless someone else with the patient admits to it.\n\nThis is probably not tmau but it could be some other underlying medical condition. So he needs to see a doctor all the same.", "TMAU: Mental Clarity (Part 7) I need to give you all (and also me) some tough love so I need to be frank and ernest with you all. If you wake up one day and you do not smell bad but you still spend the day ruminating and wondering if you smell bad, did you really have a good day? Now you did not smell bad (or simply did not get reactions) but you still were in a bad mood, you have lost that day to negativity. \n\nI bring this to our attention because we all have this mental baggage that we carry because of TMAU and other aspects in our live, so if you do not eliminate/reduce not only the smell but also the negative emotions towards yourself you are not truly \"healed\". You can try all the recommendations you find on the web but baby you need some personal TLC. You need to enjoy your presence. We all do. \n\nYou can take many steps to help clear yourself mentally and maybe also spiritually. Remember to not approach one as the end all be all but instead incorporate different ones in to your life. \n\nYou can try:\n\n\\*yoga\n\n\\*talking to people\n\n\\*therapy\n\n\\*meditation \n\n\\*reading \n\n* etc..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing creative by making some artistic things like:\n\n\\*writing\n\n\\*Painting/drawing/sculpting\n\n\\*You can create Youtube videos or take on other social media platforms to help yourself and others. \n\n\\*crafts\n\n* etc..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YOU CAN COMMENT THEM BELOW\n\n&amp;#x200B; oh wow, I just read your TMAU (Part 6) post--which is no longer on the subreddit for some reason--and you asked some very similar questions. Mostly about what we would do without TMAU. I made a response about how I would have no idea on how to live without TMAU because of how deeply it has impacted my life. I guess the first step of living a life without TMAU would be learning about self love. Well even if we are still suffering it is still a step we should take.\n\nSorry if I was not suppose to respond to the part 6 post. Maybe you took it off the subreddit? Is that possible or did a mod remove it?", "I am going absolutely crazy. I am a 16 year old girl and I have been suffering with this condition for 4 years now, and it is been horrible. I have not been tested but I am positive I have it. I even tried going to the doctor and he basically laughed it off, he thought I was crazy. Hell, I even thought I was crazy too because the worst part in all of this is that I personally cannot smell it on myself. It is hard living like this, it takes a toll on you mentally and emotionally. I am always anxious and paranoid in public settings, the only place I ever feel at peace is at home. This is the first time I ever tried going on one of these TMAU support groups in the four years of having this. I never reached out to anybody who has this condition and I have been feeling lonely ever since. Everyone I tried opening up to did not understand and thought it was all in my head, but I know what I go through basically everyday, I hear the comments. I am full of shame and guilt everyday. Once I found out what TMAU was and how there was no known cure, I tried to disassociate myself with any blogs, websites, YouTube videos, basically anything that would remind me of how much a struggle it is living with this disease.I am not even sad about it anymore I am just fed up, it is more of a inconvenience than anything else. I need some help, guidance, and just overall talk to anyone who can relate. I am not sure about joining any group chats; I know there is a discord chat, but if anyone wants to message me privately, just to offer each other some support and maybe make a  friend please feel free to, you will be helping me just as much. I am a 15 year old boy I have had it since I was 9ish it really sucks but I try to eat things that have low choline I think its called. Stuff like eggs some meats and certain milks can make it pretty bad I take some pills that are supposed to help I take two chlorophyll 1 charcoal in the morning and same at night. Message if you want to talk Sent you message. Do not feel any pressure to respond though. :-) Hey\nI am currently 16 and had this condition for 4 years already... I know some tricks to get rid of the smell. For sure the low choline diet is great but you have to do somer things.. Just text me if you want to talk! ( Why are we cursed with this bullshit. I will be 15 next week and I believe that I have been suffering from this going as far back as the 5th grade and I understand your pain. It had only gotten worse for me throughout the years. When I finally got up the nerve to tell my mother what was going on she made me seem like I was going crazy so I just let it go. I was mad at her for it although I should not be because I know that she will never understand. It is incredible how similar our stories sound.", "I need help I need to find out whether I smell bad to others Have you seen a doctor for this? I know most of us have not had much luck with doctors admitting that we smell. But they might offer some suggestions for what it could be.\n\nDo you feel any other symptoms? Does your stomach grumble or hurt when this is happening? Have you noticed before getting these reactions if you ate a trigger food like dairy or gluten?\n\nIf it is intermittent it could be gassiness from a nervous stomach. I think this is where my odor comes from too tbh. When it happens I cannot feel the gas leaking out at all. It is crazy.", "I want to be cured, what should i do? My condition began when i was 11 years old. It started when i was at school and people are telling me that my scalp smell bad. Ever since that day i got hard time coping with life. I am 26 year old now. I got  no job, no friends, no relationships, no degree and i am frustrated at my condition. I am living with my parents in 3rd world country. Congrats on beating cancer however long ago that was. I cannot even imagine dealing with that personally. As far as the TMAU I struggle with the usual things everyone else does. All I can say is try and crawl your way out of any mental hold it has on you. Honestly for me what works is to stop caring what people think. That is obviously easier said than done but try and train yourself to give 0 fucks about what anyone else thinks or says or how they act. You will start to enjoy life more the less you care about things you cannot control. Pretend it is not even there. Be patient with it. To maintain it you will have to be strict on a diet for at least several months to see change. \nConsume a lot of fermented foods.\nDrink kefir morning lunch and tea, down it like there is no tomorrow. A komucha a day. Add sauerkraut to one meal a day. Cut out red meat, limit green veges, no dairy, no gluten and definitely no sugar. Again with \"no\" you cannot control everything you eat but just be cautious.\n\nBut the key is kefir. It is a wonder that stuff for this hey,which country are you from Philippines Which is better tho kombucha or kefir? What do you usually eat in a day? I am from Kenya Kefir 100% but kombucha is great to add to the diet like a can or bottle once a day as you will not be drinking soft drink and stuff it replaces that sweetness drink Feel free to dm me and I can chat more about it and stuff", "HELP!! I think I have I have TMAU! Where can I get tested??!! Help! I really think I have TMAu and I need someone is opinion. So I have been suffering with BO issues for 11 years (since 11 y-o) when I hit puberty about 6 months before I got my period. Whenever I got home from school my dad always asked me if I had taken a gym class that day and many times I answered no but my body still reeked. I was always told to shower and change my clothes and undergarments. I did not start to notice it myself until I was 12/13. Teachers and people I sat near in school always made comments like \"Someone needs to use deodorant; we are all old enough to know what that is\" or others rude comments but it was obvious that they were talking about me. Growing up I took 2 showers a day everyday out of habit because my dad's a clean freak but when I started suffered with really  bad BO, 2 if 3 not showers a day was not optional. It was super frustrating because 25-30 minutes after coming out of the shower I would smell sweaty again. I would always take 20-25 minutes showers for fear of what I would smell like before going to school in the morning which was frustrating for the people I had to share the shower with in the morning and I was always reminded with the fact that \"a longer shower is not going to make the smell go away.\" Same always goes with brushing my teeth; I would brush 3/4 times daily but my breath would still smell gross and stale. My parents always attributed my BO to the fact that maybe the shower water was piping hot or that I was not brushing my tongue enough or that I was a very anxious kid or that I was not using the right deodorant but even when I switched deodorant or used men's deodorant nothing seemed to change. My parents were just frustrated that I was suffering and that they did not have the answer. He offered to buy me all the Victoria's Secret or Bath and Body Works sets that I wanted but I told him that it would not help but maybe it would make me \"feel\" clean. My dad would stress that my mom wash my clothes everyday or the sweat smell would forever linger in my clothes and when she did not get a chance to wash them, he would spray a load of Febreze in my clothes the next day. Perfume usually makes it worse as it mixes with the sweat and make the smell 10x stronger. My feet are also pretty bad. I clean my feet (scrub in between my toes, cut my toenails etc.) and if I were to wait 24 hours before my next shower, my feet would smell like cheesy garbage. My dad would barely let us walk around the house with bare feet growing up but for me, it is not even a question. Now here comes the worst... my genital area. When I tell you the smell is so bad, I would not even want to be with me if I were me. I smell like fish, cheese and garbage combined down there, sometimes even 20-30 minutes after getting out of the shower. This has caused the most nose-pinching, sniffing and awkward looks in public places. I cannot even sit down for more than 5 minutes without the smell becoming worse. God forbid I have to sit in a lecture or go to somewhere on a plane because when I stand up after 2+ hours of sitting in class or on a flight in close quarters with others people, my gooooodness there is so much a stink I could compete with a skunk. My OBGYN told me that I do I have bacterial vaginosis, specifically gardnerella, but none of the treatments I was given helped. It is given me so much social anxiety and then the anxiety makes it worse because you sweat when you are anxious. I have had ex-lovers/hook-ups/flings make comments about my breath and BO on a few occasions but they never said anything too serious or too hurtful. I presume that it might be genetic because my mom suffers with very similar symptoms in addition to foul smelling urine. She just uses pantyliners, freshening spray, baby powder and feminine wipes to temporarily cover up the smell for a few hours but at this point she just deals with it as opposed to being anxious and stressed about it all the time. I have tried all those but I want a cure. I am tired of so many trips to the bathroom every hour to change my pantyliner that barely works and dealing with constant social embarrassment. From all the internet research I have done over the past 6 years, it seems like in addition to the FMO3 mutation, TMAu comes from a deeper issue of intestinal dysbiosis, and an overgrowth of bad bacteria in the gut which makes sense because I have also suffered with IBS since I was 8 y-o and severe bloating that makes even my own parents ask if I am pregnant even when they just saw me the day before with a flat stomach. I have been chlorophyll and activated charcoal before. Activated charcoal helped some but the chlorophyll did not help with the odor at all, only with the IBS symptoms. I just want answers or a cure at this point. Please help! What do you all think? I am from NY but currently in GA. Where can I get tested? &gt; My OBGYN told me that I do I have bacterial vaginosis, specifically gardnerella, but none of the treatments I was given helped \n\nIf the medicine she prescribed to you did not work, you **need** to call and tell her that. She will prescribe you another probably stronger type.\n\nThe cheesy odor especially the one you mentioned from your feet is probably athlete's foot or some type of fungus. Antifungals are OTC so your parents would be able to buy some for you. \n\nDo you have any red possibly flaky rashes / looking like eczema almost on your body anywhere? People can also get yeast infections on the skin and they can smell pretty strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly on the stomach bloating - have you tried a food elimination diet? Severe bloating like that can be a sign of gluten intolerance. Try cutting that out for 1 - 2 weeks and see if the bloating continues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry to hear about your symptoms. I hope with the medicine you are able to get rid of the odor! Well as told by my doctors, the medical community still does not have too many answers as to what can be done for bacterial vaginosis; they still do not clearly know where it comes from themselves. There are really only two options: metronidazole, taken orally or clindamycin phosphate, used topically, both of which I have taken. I have tried taking vitamin D which I heard about from someone on YouTube and the smell partially went away but not completely.\nAs for the feet, I was told by a doctor that it was not athletes\u2019 foot, I do not know how they could tell but I am looking into more stronger antifungal OTC products for athletes foot anyways because I cannot deal with the smell anymore. I do not and have never had any red, flaky skin or rashes on my skin but I did suffer with eczema as toddler until early adolescence. And for the stomach issues, I have never gone on a full elimination diet but there have been times I went without eating gluten for a a week or two and still suffered with bloating. I tried cutting out milk even almond milk and it helped with the IBS a lot and it helped with the odor a little bit but not a significant difference in bloating. Even now, I will only eat one meal a day because I am tired of experiencing abdominal pain and brain fog while digesting food, as well as trying to hold in all the gas that comes with it and the severe bloating but I am still bloated, even after drinking a regular 17oz water bottle. It is super frustrating but doctors do not seem to have the answers anymore, do not know what they are doing in school for 8 years but that is beyond me. I will keep trying until I find something. Thanks for the helpful tips! Here is a discord  you can join for tmau suffers Hey how is it goin?\n\nBV is a common bacterial issue for women in general. (reddness, itchness, leakage, smell,  etc). You can have it at least once in your life or it may occur every few years or so. Over the counter treatment is available.\n\nIf you are sexually active with similar symptoms 'chlamydia' then  a smear test is taken and maybe prescription/over the counter products from your dr will be issued.\n\nYou mention IBS. Have you been tested for IBS? You will need to make significant lifestyle changes and a complete overhaul of your diet. If by chance your body smell is the most worrying above all those you have outlined its possible you may have the rare metabolic disorder called TMAU...maybe? While research is being done on this disorder its not exactly recognised by the medical profession. Drink Kefir it cures tmau type 2 This is totally true. I cured my trimethylaminuria (tmau type 2) with kombucha tea. Damn how long did you have tmau Please read the private message I sent you. TMAU type 2 (the one your probably have) has a cure and you can finally be happy again. Do you think you can send it to me too, i have a lot of similarities that she has. 8 months I will just tell you in this comment what solved tmau for me:\n\nProbiotics, but not the ones they sell at stores in capsules. Those did not work for me. The probiotics I am talking about are homegrown ones like KOMBUCHA and KEFIR. I personally homebrewed my own kombucha, and it solved the problem in less than a week. \n\nIf you need quick relief from odor and you are desperate, buy activated charcoal and chlorophyll. They will not completely eliminate the smell as kombucha did, and they are not a cure, but they reduce the odor by about 80-90%.\n\nI beg you to try homebrewing your own kombucha or kefir. It will save your life like it did mine. \n\nAnd please keep me updated once you do it. I will enjoy knowing that you are cured so send me a message.\n\nGood luck! :) :) :) I used to have fishy smell and terrible feet smell as well. It definetely was not athlete's foot because when I cured my gut problems (tmau, IBS) with kombucha, the feet smell went away immediately. \n\nPlease read the other comment I posted in this thread. I explain how I cured my TMAU and IBS with kombucha yeah i saw some people talking about Chlorophyllin pills. I just bought some so i hope they help but then i realized i got ones without copper and i think it is the copper that helps so rip. I am going to try kumbacha but does not it contain alcohol? Would i be able to purchase it or make it if I am under 21. it has like 0.4 percent alcohol. definetely not inhebriating. Get a scoby disk (to make kombucha) on amazon.

I have dealt with anxiety over that time as I have always been nervous about going out because I may need the toilet. Over the last 6 months I have managed to control my gut and symptoms are now minimal and I rarely get anxious anymore. The only problem is I am terrified of the way I possibly smell as there have been a few comments that I smell like \u201cshit\u201d. I cant smell myself and I shower twice a day and wear deodorant and cologne. School is horrible as I hate being close to anyone for even a second. I do not feel like I can make new friends/relationships as I will be judged on how I smell. I have gone to the doctors about the gut issues but nothing has been diagnosed and all appears to be good. This makes me question whether I do smell or it is all in my head (I am fairly sure I do smell bad though). Aswell as this, recently I have noticed that my father occasionally smells bad (the same smell I fear that I have). Of course I never mention this to him as it would be rude and awkward.

I can pick out damn near every ingredient/spice in complicated dishes served to me based off one sniff. I can also frequently even smell when people I know are sick because their smell gets off, usually sweet for bacterial infections and acrid for viruses. So I have actually told people they need to see a doctor based off their smell, but it will be the first time the thing they have will not be curable. That is mostly why I am nervous. We have only been dating a few weeks, which makes me extra nervous.\n\nBut I literally cannot get close enough to kiss her without holding my breath if she is been eating/drinking certain things or it is been too long since she is showered or brushed her teeth.

If so cut back or eliminate for a while.\n\nDoes the odour smell like feces, ammonia, old food, smoke, burning rubber, chemicals etc?\n\nIf you smoke cigs or weed be advised that smoking or vaping reduce an enzyme crucial for digestion.  Eliminate smoking or switch to edibles or cannaoil.\n\nLack of sleep or lack of quality sleep can also cause bad breath and make it worse\n\nYou can play around with the times shown below to suit your schedule.  Do not need to buy everything listed, just get whatever you feel is right.\n\nFirst thing in the morning take the freshly squeezed juice of a lemon or lime mixed in a large glass cold, warm or hot water on an empty stomach.  Bitter things stimulate bile, cleanse the liver and stimulates the bowels.   Do this on an empty stomach and rinse your mouth out with water to prevent tooth damage.\n\nTake your regular multivitamin/mineral supplement as usual if you take them.  Iron, magnesium, potassium are important too.   Take iron at least 2 hours away from meds or other supplements.\n\nEat breakfast, lunch and dinner with 2 capsules of zinc picolinate, 2 riboflavin a.k.a. vitamin B2 capsules (equal to 200 mg)\n\nVitamin B2 is great for overall health and reducing odour.   Your urine will turn yellow which is completely normal.  Any leftover vitamin B you will simply excrete.\n\nTake a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar make sure it has the mother in it (such as Bragg's) with a glass of water as you eat meals.   ACV is great for digestion and does a whole bunch of good for your body such as making it an alkaline environment where bacteria, yeasts and fungi cannot thrive\n\nTake 2 or 3 drops of brown liquid iodine 5% to 15% strength once or twice a day in any beverage.  Iodine is an old school antibacterial, antifungal remedy.  Pure pine oil can also be used instead.  Mix a couple drops of pine oil with a sugar cube or a bit of honey to attract yeasts and fungi so they can be killed by the pine oil.\n\nGet psyllium husks (ground) and food grade diatomaceous earth powder or bentonite powder.  Mix 1 teaspoon of the psyllium with 1 teaspoon of the dia earth or bentonite powder.  Mix it in water or any other beverage of choice and drink it quickly before it gels up.   Drink a ton of water throughout the day with this.  This will scrape off old hardened feces lining your intestinal walls and kill fungi, parasites, yeasts, bacteria.  Take 2 hours away from any supplements or meds.\n\nYou could also buy a parasite tincture, capsules or buy these three things yourself : cloves, black walnut hulls and wormwood (must take all three to kill eggs, larvae and adult parasites)\n\nIf you suspect digestion issues you may also want to add in the following capsules: digestive enzymes, betaine hydrochloride with pepsin, DGL licorice etc. with meals\n\nWait a couple hours or so after eating and taking the above supplements then take a teaspoon of cascara sagrada powder mixed in any beverage or take 1 or 2 cascara capsules instead (it is extremely bitter).  This cleanses the liver and acts as a mild, gentle laxative.\n\nBuy milk thistle capsules or buy whole milk thistle seeds and grind them yourself in a coffee/spice grinder to ensure potency.  Sprinkle the ground seeds in food, mix in a beverage or buy empty 00 capsules and make capsules yourself.  Take milk thistle once or twice a day.  Milk thistle cleans out the liver and gallbladder.  If you prefer you could buy dried chanca piedra or chanca piedra capsules instead which are also great for the liver and gallbladder.\n\nThe supplement TUDCA is great for the liver, cheaper to buy the powder than capsules\n\nGet oil of oregano capsules or tincture or if you prefer just make a tea with dried or fresh oregano and/or thyme leaves and drink 2 to 3 times a day.  These herbs contain carvacol which kills bad bacteria.\n\nIf you can get the supplement trans-resveratrol or regular resveratrol or buy Japanese knotweed as it is really good for odour\n\nAlso to temporarily stop bad breath from the stomach use Pepto Bismol.  The bismuth subgallate in it causes a raft like action that stops the odour coming from the gut temporarily.  You will have to take a double or triple dose though depending on your body.  It only works for a few hours.  Do not take it more than once a day though.  It will harmlessly turn your stools back which will disappear in a few days and may turn your briefly stain your tongue due to the chemical reaction to the bacteria on your tongue.  Since it is also used to stop diarrhea it will constipate you so ensure you drink enough water.  Please note that you cannot take this medicine for longer than two weeks or so as it affects the liver.  Once stopped the liver goes back to normal.  Best to take in emergency situations.  Strong spices, high doses of sugar, dairy etc. anything that triggers your odour you must avoid as it will not be effective.  To save money one can buy bismuth subgallate powder if you can find it.\n\nThere is another over the counter medicine called Gaviscon and Gaviscon Advance which does the same thing as Pepto Bismol.  Unfortunately only the U.K. version has the sodium alginate which produces the raft effect.  Here is a post about how to make a cheaper version:\n\n(\n\nAlso buy a cheap $1 tongue scraper and use a few drops of heavily, heavily diluted food grade hydrogen peroxide  ( (IF YOU BUY UNDILUTED FOOD GRADE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE YOU MUST DILUTE IT IN ORDER TO PREVENT SERIOUS INJURY FROM CHEMICAL BURNS) on your tongue after first flossing then brushing.  This will temporarily clean the mouth of bacteria.  Therabreath is an expensive version of this with peppermint oil and preservatives.  You can buy already diluted food grade hydrogen peroxide online.  Do not use the $1 dollar store stuff in the brown bottle that is not safe.\n\nAlso ensure you are defecating at least 2 to three times a day.  Magnesium powder or capsules will help with this or you can use castor oil.  Castor oil is excellent and useful for the whole body for so many things.  You can also use castor oil packs on your abdomen nightly.\n\nStart soaking in the tub nightly or whenever you can with plain or scented Epsom salt baths.  Stay in for a while to let the magnesium soak in.  magnesium is absorbed transdermally as well and is excellent for many things and most people are deficient in it.\n\nDo a liver flush twice a week with the fresh squeezed juice of one lemon or lime mixed with an equal amount of olive oil.  Drink this right before bed.  This will help to remove liver and gallbladder stones and bile sludge.  It may take a few flushes before you see stones in the toilet when you defecate (they are bright green and look like peas.)  To get even more stones and sludge out use apple cider vinegar or apple juice or better yet malic acid powder in the daytime.  (Do not buy malic acid powder mixed with any other acid powder.  Just mix a 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon of malic acid powder with water and drink.)  The malic acid softens the stones and helps remove them quicker.\n\nAlso look into taking triphala capsules or powder 2 to 3 times a day.  It will take a few weeks to get your correct dosage and for it to work.  It makes your whole digestive system work better and is dirt, dirt cheap if you get it from an Indian food store.  It may be spelled trifla on the package instead of triphala.\n\nBlack seed oil also known as nigella sativa, black caraway, black cumin, kalonji, and black onion seeds can be found dirt cheap in Indian or other ethnic grocery stores it will probably be packaged under one of the names above.\n\nAlso look into MTHFR, histamine intolerance, thyroid issues: ( Sjogren's syndrome and other causes of bad breath\n\nAll the things I mentioned are a lot cheaper when bought in ethnic food stores or online on eBay, Amazon, iherb, vitacost etc.  Use ( rakuten to get discounts if they apply in your country.\n\nYou may find these links helpful even if this issue is not TMAU1 or TMAU2\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nThat is all I can think of for now.

The urine test does not always diagnose the condition very well. \n\nWhat sort of smells do you get?\n\nCoeliac can be diagnosed by a blood test, which can still not be 100% accurate. The most accurate way is to have a biopsy (long tube down your throat). I would recommend cutting out gluten for 2 months. Do this strictly. Check packets. See if you feel better Okay so yes I do experience it worse during menstruation and it is a fishy/garbage smell. I have recently have cut gluten though there have been times where I accidentally eaten things that do contain gluten. I have not been able to tell so well if the smell has lessened since cutting out a lot of foods. My doctor did want me to do a test where it required having a tube go down my throat. I did not know about the urine test not always working so thank you for this. I will talk more with my doctor. If you do have anything else to add though please do because anything helps. I used to struggle with body odor (from constant 24/7 gas leak). I did parasite testing but it came up negative. Did a natural foods parasite cleanse and it reduced the odor to a lower amount permanently. I also eat until I am full now (never starve) because being hungry increased my gas BY A LOT.

I have put together a step-by-step process that \"cured\" my TMAU based on all of the relevant scientific research on the topic and decided to share because I want the best for all you dudes.  \n\n\n* **Reducing Acute TMA Production**\n\nThe first step to inhibiting smell is to stop the immediate production of high levels of TMA, as it is your inability to oxidize it that is the problem. In those without TMAU, levels of TMAO can give us an indicator for what would elevate levels of TMA in TMAU populations.  \n\n\n\\- ( or even other high choline foods such as eggs, liver, milk etc. FWIW, they tested almost 50 different foods that fell under the categories: fruits/veggies/legumes, breads/cereals, meat/poultry, dairy/eggs and seafood. The only non-seafoods that rose levels of TMA above the control (water) baseline were: peas, cauliflower (brassica veggies tend to increase TMA), liver, mushrooms, although none of them hit the mark for statistical significance. (Zhang et al., 1999). Research also shows that, even when eating extremely high doses of TMA precursors (choline; 6 whole eggs), (  \n\n\n**Solution:** Remove ALL fish/seafood (this includes kelp/seaweed) from your diet, if you intend to be in public within the next 24 hours, as they increase ACUTE (immediate) levels of TMA. No other food *needs* to be eliminated to reduce **acute** production, although limiting the quantity of certain high choline foods, as well as those listed above may be useful. Should you consume any of those foods in high doses (e.g. 6+ eggs), ensure it is not within 24 hours of a time you intend to be in public. (i.e. eat a TMA/TMA precursor containing meal by 8 PM Friday, at the latest, if you know you have a date at 8 PM on Saturday. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Reducing Chronic TMA Production**\n\nAfter reducing the levels of acute TMA produced, the second most important thing: controlling the systemic levels of TMA production. Long story short: short of seafood consumption, TMA is produced when we consume things like choline or carnitine. Our gut bacteria break down these compounds and produce TMA as a byproduct. It is important to understand this because WE do not produce TMA, it is merely our gut bacteria that do. Remove the gut bacteria responsible for this and you remove the TMA production. ( because they lack the gut bacteria for it. Simply put, eat a low carnitine diet, the bacteria that consume it to live will die. When those bacteria die off, you can eat the same foods and **you will not produce TMA**. This is something that many people have read before. Stories of people \"curing\" their TMAU by becoming vegan/vegetarian. The problem is it is extremely hard for many people to give up meat.  \n\n\nGood news! ( TMA/TMAO production was equivalent (virtually no TMA/TMAO production) in people who consumed no meat as well as those who consumed poultry. When the groups consumed red meat, levels of systemic TMA/TMAO production skyrocketed, as well as acute TMA/TMAO production even when consuming the same foods. The study also found that a maximum of 4 weeks of removing red meat from the diet was enough to completely change the gut microbiome to inhibit TMA/TMAO production. All groups (vegetarian, chicken, red meat) consumed eggs/dairy as well, so the positive news is that those foods have no effect on chronic TMA/TMAO levels. (Wang et al., 2019)  \n\n\n**Solution:** No need to eat a completely restricted diet to alter gut microbiome and reduce chronic TMA/TMAO production. *Red meat is the only food you will need to remove from your diet*. Eggs, dairy and chicken have no effect on the long-term production. ( so those can act as an alternative, if you are missing red meat. Also, the alteration of your microbiome is not a short-term process. This does not mean you can never eat red meat again. As a matter of fact, eating red meat will result in no increase in TMA/TMAO levels if your gut is not adapted to it. Having red meat once a month or so will be completely fine. Just do not do it consistently or you will begin to produce more TMA producing bacteria.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Improving FMO3 Activity**\n\nHonestly, this might be the biggest thing right here. As, although the focus of the first two was reducing TMA production, the problem that those with TMAU suffer from is not TMA production, but the inability to effectively convert said TMA into TMAO, an action that the FMO3 enzyme is responsible for in \"healthy\" populations. If you increase the activity of the FMO3 gene, you increase the amount of TMA that gets oxidized into the odourless TMAO and thus reduce body odour. The most effective way to do this: Vitamin B^(2) (Riboflavin). Vitamin B^(2) enhances liver function, including that of the FMO3 enzyme. Multiple studies on people suffering from TMAU have shown that Vitamin B^(2) supplementation drastically reduces or even completely eliminates all body odour linked to TMAU, even in the absence of changes to the diet. Populations who were ( as well those who had ( all saw a drastic, or even complete inhibition of their body odour/TMAU due to improved TMA -&gt; TMAO oxidation. The dose seems to be supplementation of approximately 100mg/day, although ranges of 50-200mg have all proved successful. Also, Brassica vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower etc.) may reduce FMO3 activity as well as increase TMA production, so limit/avoid such foods.\n\n**Solution:** Take 100mg of Vitamin B^(2) (Riboflavin) once a day, every day. There is a long-term saturation effect meaning you must take it every day (however do not be OCD, you will not die/set yourself back if you miss a day, of course) and the longer you take it, the better the results will be. i.e. symptoms will be better after 4 weeks on riboflavin than they were after 2 weeks, and so on, with a \"peak\" after 6-12 months or so. Timing does not matter as it has no acute effects (you will not smell better immediately after taking it, it is a cumulative process that takes weeks of consistent supplementation). Take it in the morning, noon, or night, does not matter. Just take it. Also limit/avoid brassicas (cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, brussel sprouts).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Get Rid of TMA on Skin**\n\nThe reason TMAU results in body odour is excess TMA that cannot be converted to odourless TMAO gets excreted, primarily through sweat glands. This means you must wash away/remove TMA from the skin. TMA has very high pH. The problem is most body washes also have a high pH (as higher pH's cut through grease, dirt and skin oils better). In order to optimally break down/remove TMA from the skin, you should add a low pH body wash to your arsenal. This does NOT mean ditch the high pH body washes because, as previously mentioned, they do a great job of removing other, non-TMAU-related odour-causing compounds from the skin. But finishing a shower with a low pH body wash to both wash away TMA as well as lower pH of the skin to reduce the ability of TMA to form on it will be extremely beneficial. Any body-wash that says \"pH skin-balanced\" will work fine. You can Google/Amazon search for low pH body washes. Some are great and extremely low in pH, but most will just destroy your pockets. You are better off going with affordable body washes that are pH skin balanced, as they are still on the acidic side and will get the job done. Nivea &amp; Sanex are probably the easiest ones to get your hands on.\n\n**Solution:** Take a normal shower with regular shower products. Wash hair, face, body etc. After all of that, finish your shower by washing again with a low pH body wash, such as Nivea or Sanex. Nivea also makes pH Balanced 3-in-1 products that you can use for your hair, face and body, if that interests you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*  ***Should you use Chlorophyll/Activated Charcoal?***\n\nShort answer: It may help at times, but is not necessary, provided you did all of the above. Especially not regularly.  \n\n\nI have seen anecdotes of people saying the supplements removed their symptoms, and there is also research proving ( when taken individually (One or the other works. It is not necessary to take both supplements together). The problem with this is both likely have drawbacks. Chlorophyll contains high levels of copper, which can be toxic if taken in excess and activated charcoal absorbs not only TMA, but also important vitamins/minerals from the foods you eat.   \n\n\nFor this reason, I would not recommend taking either supplements daily, BUT should you want to control **acute** TMA production, taking them either independently, or together along with the meal you want to reduce TMA production from, can be a useful tool. E.g. You are out for breakfast with friends and want an omelette, but would prefer not to smell later on in the day as you have important plans. Taking chlorophyll tablets/activated charcoal tablet (one or the other will work, but both in accordance may work better) WITH your meal, will improve symptoms. Use this sparingly, however. And if you do use it often, give yourself a brief detox, at least.  \n\n\nAs stated earlier, however, if you are doing all of the above tips, chlorophyll/charcoal will not be necessary, anyway.  \n\n\n*  ***Should you use antibiotics/probiotics?***\n\nAntibiotics: Fuck no. Antibiotics work to reduce TMA production/TMAU symptoms through the same pathway as dietary red-meat removal. Difference being, removing red meat from your diet will not screw your immune system up, ruin your healthy gut bacteria, give you GI distress, increase likelihood of candida infections and reduce the efficacy of antibiotics in your future. Just remove red meat from your diet. As stated earlier you can still have it on occasion, anyway.  \n\n\nProbiotics: Have not seen enough research to prove it has any effect, positive or negative, on TMAU. I would say only take them for non-TMAU-related reasons.\n\n**TL;DR Summary:**\n\nI highly recommend reading the above because understanding the whys are just as important as understanding the what is, but in case you are too lazy to read:\n\nDo not eat fish/seafood, red meat and brassica vegetables. Do not eat high-choline/carnitine/betaine meals within 24 hours of going out. Take Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) every day. Include pH balanced body washes to your showers. Charcoal/Chlorophyll are unnecessary but may help to control acute TMA production - just use them periodically. Antibiotics are a no-no. Liver castor oil packs helped me with a case of transient tmau. I had it less than 6 months but as soon as I heard the liver connection my mom told me about the castor oil trick she had for rejuvenating her liver. It worked like a charm for me, I know it might not work for or be suitable for everyone, but I wanted to put that out there in case it helps someone. How did you do it? Never heard of a castor oil liver pack before \n\nIts like a warm compress with castor oil. Your liver is on your right side, under your breast area. If you google specifically how to do a liver pack you can see pictures on google for placement. \n\nI do them on my abdomen if I ever have discomfort also, but i have been unable to since Im breastfeeding my little one. Im going to go back to them once I am done.\n\nNote to add: it can get messy, and the oil can stain your clothes, so be careful. Thank you very much for this.\nQ - why can high Betaine foods be problematic? So I cannot eat mushrooms ? You can, as they never rose TMA to statistically significant levels. Just probably do not have a ton of mushrooms within 24h of going out, and, if you do, you may opt to have some chlorophyll. Betaine, just like carnitine &amp; choline is a precursor for TMA.  The Vitamin B2 and removing red meat is the main thing and the effects of that can be seen within 4 weeks, although the longer you use VB2 the better the results. Up until 6 months or so.  kk well just make sure you are taking it daily. if it does not turn your pee fluorescent yellow then you should prob get a different riboflavin supplement. if you decide being vegan is too hard or you feel fatigued (many vegans do), just remember dairy and poultry are fine. even eggs will not raise systemic TMA levels, only acute. Red meat is a nono for frequent consumption, though. Use low pH soaps and you are good I did not look too hard but I didnt see Nivea or Sanex oh balanced washes on my Amazon. I did see other washes claiming 5.5 pH. I think I will just try to wash a few times with vinegar, which has a pH of 2.2, to test out this low pH idea\n\n\nAlso you are saying that lowering the pH of the skin will lower the ability of TMA to form on it. I do not know much about science, but how would that work exactly? I guess your body would excrete TMA some other way, but why will not it just excrete it on the skin anyway even if your skin is more acidic now? It does not stop TMA from forming, it just neutralizes already formed TMA. Similar to if you pour base into an acidic formula. It does not stop you pouring the base in, it simply neutralizes the base once it is already poured in. And most Sanex/Nivea bodywashes are pH balanced, you can check their website to see which ones are, if you are having issues finding it on Amazon   Br? Br? What do you mean? I like most of this, solid advice for the most part. 35 y/o diagnosed 34 years ago with genetic tmau, mostly smell free (maybe a small whiff every 2-4 weeks?) for the last few years.\n\nCut out fish is #1. I think a more vegetarian/vegan diet has worked for me, although it was more coincidence that I did it, rather than doing for tmau reasons. I am not exactly vegan now and eat a reasonable amount of meat, but we have had a few months here and there of mostly vegan foods. What you have said about red meat makes sense and maybe that is why I am doing better.\n\nThings I am not so sure about: cutting out brassica? Broccoli/cauliflower etc are fairly staple veges in my diet. I think eating a lot more spinach helped (natural additional chlorophyll) but in general the more veges and more green you include the less crap you are going to be eating, which can only be good.\n\nAlso, riboflavin has been a 'thing' for 30 years, it makes your pee turn orange but if it worked there would be more concrete studies/ success stories by now. I would maybe recommend a few months of drinkable chlorophyll, it did not hurt when I did it.\n\nThe one thing I would additionally recommend (my own personal conspiracy) is cutting out is whey. For context, my parents noticed my condition as a baby, from odd smelling nappies. No fish, no meat or egg in my diet then, just breast milk. I usually do not have too many issues with dairy, but breast milk is high in whey, and other foods I have had with high whey (icecream, protein powders) do not work well for me. 1. Brassica veggies slow the FMO3 process and tend to increase TMA acutely. Spinach is not brassica (I eat a lot of spinach) but broccoli/cauliflower is, so I eat none of those.\n\n2. There are actually many success stories/studies on Riboflavin for TMA reduction. Believe it or not it is actually one of, if not the most well-studied things regarding TMAU \u201ccures.\u201d I came across at least 3 high quality studies showing multiple people\u2019s TMAU symptoms improved or completely removed due to B2 supplementation.\n\n3. What you said about whey is 100% true. I actually recently cut out whey protein shakes for that reason and switched to vegan shakes. Whey contains high levels if carnitine, the primary culprit for chronically elevated TMA levels.\n\nI have received multiple compliments on how i smell recently which never happened when I was younger and was not doing these things. Removing fish/red meat/brassicas/high whey dairy, taking daily B2 and adding low pH body washes into my showers is basically all I do. Have not taken chlorophyll or charcoal in over a year. Maybe the rest of my diet has been ok enough so I do not notice the brassica effect, I will try to dodge it a bit more and glad it is working / the science looks sound. My partner is super into cauliflower soup though :( \n\nWith her support she is even encouraged me to dabble in eating an occasional bit of fish, which has not had a negative reaction yet. It might be the afformentioned reformed gut bacteria helping out.\n\nWorking from home during this stupid pandemic is kind of great though in that I can experiment a bit as well without the added stress. 100%. The pandemic has been great for my experimentation (even had a few burgers/fish and all that stuff i have cut out \ud83d\ude02). Mind me asking what your diet primarily consists of outside of removing fish?\n\nAlso fwiw Brassica\u2019s seem to be relatively low on the TMA scale, I am just not a big fan of them regardless so cutting them out was not at all a problem for me ahah can you link me the best B2 vitamin please? vitamin B2 is not a very commonly bought/sold item so it is hard to find any specific \u201cgood\u201d one. i just buy anything in stores i can find or check Amazon if there is nothing in stores ok thanks", "Lume deodorant Hi! I do not have trimethylaminuria but I just saw a commercial of a mom who bought it for her daughter who has it and it worked! I thought this could be helpful to people looking for solutions. I have personally used it as a regular deodorant and can vouch that it works well. Hope this is helpful info to someone!\n\n It is on my wishlist! Anyone with TMAU should check what  is in it first, hydrogenated oil is in the ingredients, GROSS! Marketing scheme, I am not wasting my money or time. It was developed by an OBGYN initially for use on women\u2019s private areas, so safety was in mind when creating it. Also, I think the ingredient you are looking at is hydrogenated castor oil, which is used in many natural products and has been proven safe for use on our skin.\n\n If you put stuff like that on your armpits it will get on your clothes and hands and you would have contaminated everything your clothes and hands touch. The ingredients can make it into your food this way, causing digestive issues. Either you are a very determined troll or a very confused individual. Not sure which path to take here lol. Well, I think you do not have TMAU, and you are just here to promote more false promises of 'Lume deodorant' for some reason. For your information people with problems from TMAU and similar conditions, have problems with not only food, but soaps and perfumes, and deodorants that make things worse. I have tried lots of deodorants, and none of them really work well aside from anti perspirants, and the ones that claim to be the most natural ALWAYS make things worse than wearing none at all. If you read my post you would see I stated I do not have it. I saw the commercial and figured there would be a subreddit about the condition, so I found it to post about it because it seemed so life changing for the family. Just trying to be helpful lol. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fSorry that it is been a challenge for you to find products that work with your condition. I cannot imagine how difficult that is.

Hi guys,\n\nI cannot believe this sub exists and I am so happy that it does, however, I am not happy we have this condition. I just figured out I have TMAU after years of denying it and contributing it to \"smelly brown person\". For the longest time I thought people were right and that it was my \"brown\" food. But sorta, until I moved, did not eat any ethnic food and it still persisted. Let me tell you the amount of rude people I encountered at the mall today were just insane. What gives them the right to be so disrespectful? Coughing, sniffing, coming close to me just to smell me and then saying \"ugh\", rubbing their nose, thinking I am dirty. I actually had a guy stop talking to me because he thought my smell was because I was a dirty diseased whore. I feel like everyone knows me now,  I am that paranoid.  Anyways...\n\nSo now I am trying to find the best diet. I cut out all dairy and gluten. I cut out all meats. I bought nutritional yeast, chlorophyll, oregano oil, and I also bought betaine hydrochloride which I wasnt sure if it benefits or hinders this condition.

Tell me what you do? do you wash your clothes in vinegar? do you use vinegar in your hair when you shower?  wake up regret life wash my self w actvated charcole soap put on anti perpsprent go to school water fast till 11pm thn go sleep First off let me say I am sorry about what happened earlier. You do not deserve that. Nobody does. Last week I read an article about a study where vitamin b2 was being used to treat TMAU and it dramatically reduced the odor and the production of TMA in the children who had it. I normally do not go trying out random pills and do not want to influence anyone else to do it either, but at this point I am willing to try, anything to beat this. My daily routine consists of waking up, taking my zinc, showering using a low ph soap and arm and hammer deodorant, and running my errands if I have any for the day.I am African American so I do not have to wash my hair too often, but when I do, I just use Dr. Bronner's peppermint Castile soap. I also make time to get at least 30 minutes of cardio every day. Sometimes I get sad so I either read a book, draw something or play with my cat. He does not mind me too much, as long as I feed and coddle him. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02 Thank you for your reply. I did not have low pH soap or shampoo so I literally washed myself with ACV today. Then rinsed it with water ofc. I dont know if it makes a difference because Ive been at home all day so I havent seen the reactions yet. I have literally stopped eating anything at this point but chlorophyll, ACV, nutritional yeast and oregano oil. How do you deal with reactions may I ask? How do you exactly do a water fast? I do not think washing in apple cider vinegar will help. Normal soaps are better at destroying bacteria because they are designed to do so. They also have a nicer smell. Washing in ACV May cause a vinegary smell just drink till i go sleep Do you still stink with the fasting?

I cannot smell me but I know I have it from comments friends and public reactions. \n\nAnyway, best to focus on your gut health to solve this. Does it seem certain environments cause the reaction moreso than others?\n\nAlso, what makes you conclude the comments are geared towards you specifically?\n\nI know sometimes I have not smelled the best and sometimes comments might have been geared towards me, but I do not know that the smell is apparent all the time. My family and husband used to tell me they could never smell it. The same days I would get reactions lol. I could only catch whiffs of it in the past if I was having an adrenaline rush / anxiety attack and then it was gone.\n\nHave you had any blood tests? Kidney issues can cause a urine body odor. Nasal issues can make one's breath smell strongly like urine too These whiffs are something Ive noticed too. Seems like it is more often after I have not eaten or fasting I am more sensitive to it. Weird that it is moldy but urine like, mind of like the pollen if you know what type I am talking about.\n\nMy liver and kidney panels are completely normal. \n\nIf anything else, it could be my home and it is sticking to my skin but no one has told me if it smells not that I have visitors often. !! A moldy urine smell could be mildew in your clothes or shower towel! Ppl go noseblind to that kind of smell quickly. And it is difficult to get out of clothes once it is in there. It has to either be bleached out or put in a few washes with vinegar and hot water. Maybe that could be it?? I mean that is possible. I have tried the vinegar thing maybe I try it again on the fabric softener cycle.\n\nThe problem is I cannot smell it on my clothes when It comes out the washer or when I first wear them.\n\nI can only smell it once I work up a little sweat and I walk into a certain environment like a more humid room.\n\nI would love to try and test several things but as you said, I am noseblind to the smell,  and I do not even know if that is the only smell that exists or is a real version of what others smell. It is worth a try. With it becoming stronger when your clothes heat up or in a humid room it sounds more and more like it could be mildew in the fabric. I hope that is the case, and that a few more washings can get that odor out permanently. Did you develop tmau before or after meeting your gf?

Here is my story (super long) \nSo I have been depressed since mid 2014 because I suffer through similar symptoms of TMAU. It started to get stronger and stronger and eventually got bad that no one wanted to really be around me. \n\n I was in my junior year of high school and the last month of my junior year my family moved and I ended up in a new school and since I did not know anyone, it was just hard to make any friends so I isolated myself from everyone. I had to drug myself every morning in my senior year with cough medicine to just get through the day. I would use music to escape reality and ended up with MD (Maladaptive Daydreaming) and still do to this day. I suffered with anxiety ever since I was 4 but it was mostly about life but when this happened I got really bad social anxiety and still have this now but not as bad as 2015-2017. I acted so weird honestly. Whenever someone was walking towards me or there were groups of people I would basically get as far away as possible from them or walk very widely around them. I was basically doing social distancing before it was a thing. Well anyone who has this problem basically has. Also I suffered with uncontrollable twitching, stuttering and non-stop trembling. 2015-2016 were the absolute worst years of my entire life. I was so low and I thought about ending my life every single day. I felt like an embarrassment. I felt dirty because since I smelled everyone just assumed I did not shower or anything. \n\n I do not even know how but I graduated in 2016 and felt free. My dad forced me to go to a community college online. I was relieved but for orientation I had to sit in a class for a whole day with others and it was absolute torture. I do not even remember it honestly but I remember entering and having other chuckle or cover their noses. Anyways I was told that even though I could do classes online that I would probably would have to come and take tests in a classroom and somehow everything that I had gone through in school came back to me and I could not take that so a week after just doing online school I quit and luckily they gave my dad his money back. \n\n Fast forward to 2018 and I get a job. A horrible job where I have to watch kids. They of course smell it and make fun of me and again all the memories come back but I cannot quit this time. I wait at least a year until I finally do since it was my first job. I again started to feel low and dirty but I tried to focus on other stuff like exercising, researching what exactly I have and learning new things. During 2018 to 2019 I go to a few doctors and they supposedly do not smell anything. I finally find a doctor who even though does not smell anything still decides to help me and we do a blood test to see if I have TMAU. I do not and it kind of bummed me out because I was hopeful to at least know what I was suffering with. The doctor tells me it is a good thing because TMAU is incurable so I still have a chance. \n\n Let us fast forward to now. This year has probably been my most productive year so far. Since everyone is in quarantine it feels like the world was finally forced understand what I had been going through. Keeping their distance, cleaning excessively, not touching each other, doing FaceTime calls instead of meeting in person and the masks are definitely a bonus for me. I have been able to do so much because of pandemic. I have drawn more, have actually for once been keeping up with my exercises, am eating way more healthier, have been writing in a journal everyday (something that is on my bucket list is to complete a journal, sketchbook, etc. because I have never done that in all my 22 years), learned how to sell online, learned how to do business a little, learned about how money works, was able to read more, learned about minimalism, I have been forcing my family to donate stuff because we have way too much junk and I would really would like to see this house in better shape for them, learned a lot about technology (fixing iPhones but not actually having attempted it yet, how to build a P.C., etc.), have been researching more about the possible condition I could have and am waiting to see when I will be able to do some test, a lot about mental illnesses, and I am sure there is more but I have never been able to do so much and I am proud of myself. Oh and recently I finally decided what type of career I would like to pursue and that is becoming a baker. I really loved learning how to cook for my family since no one really knows how to and I was thinking about becoming a chef but I am picky when it comes to foods and smells (how ironic right) but I absolutely LOVE desserts and am now starting to practice a little bit at home. I do not know if there is be any online schools for that but I am searching. I am just glad I finally found a true passion. This year has honestly been such an eye opener for me. I finally feel like an adult. I do not look like one though but at least I do not feel like a some child who needs to hold her mom\u2019s or dad\u2019s hand all the time. I still struggle in going to places though because of course many people do not respect social distancing rules but I am able to remain calm most of the time and I do not twitch, tremble or stutter unless I get extremely uncomfortable. Something else I struggle with is staying off my phone. I was kind of able to during the beginning of the year but during like July I got super addicted to it again. I now deleted almost all of them to not deal with that but I am addicted to checking the selling sites all the time because I want to just sell as much as possible. I have this horrible habit of spending whenever I earn money. I have spent so much but now I am not going to spend a cent and wait to see how much I am able to sell by the end of this year. (By the way for anyone thinking about selling themselves I would recommend Mercari more to eBay. Selling smaller things on eBay that cost less cause it is safer and selling more expensive stuff on Mercari. Depop is another good option. Just sell to anyone who has good ratings on any of these sites) Yeah I have a bit of money from my job which is why I have been able to spend this year but I am going to stop. Yeah that is my story so far. I want to try and make friends but I am still pretty depressed. I have no energy to actually communicate with anyone at all. I do not really even feel like trying to communicate with anyone because of what I have so we would not ever really be able to meet up unless I ever find an answer and since I feel like I will not ever find an answer I just have no energy to even try. But I want to try to push myself to try and make friends and to stop depending so much on my phone and just not feel bad. If anyone has advice for me on how to not feel so messed up or how to stop using my phone almost the whole day or how to make friends that would be really cool. \n\n Why did I share my story? Incase anyone else went through or is going through problems to just not feel alone. Addictions are hard to break and even harder to break if you are not mentally and physically well. Slowly reduce your phone usage, and try and replace that time with something productive. Make sure you exercise outside, eat well,  and drink mostly water. Also, you need to have a \"schedule\" of things you want and have to do each day. Motivations do not last, it gets you started but it does not last, routine does last.\n\n\\-    ( So, it will not be easy to stop, do it slowly. Thank you so much for the advice!

He has a delusion that his feet smell bad and has tried everything. NOBODY else can smell this. Yet he has tons of stories where people say his feet smell, but most of these seem like he is overly paranoid about miniscule things and interpretting them wrong (i.e. someone changing seats, scratching their nose, or saying something smells).\n\n\n\nHe has mentioned he had this since 7th grade. He claims he had antibiotics at that age and it may be a cause of TMAU -- his most recent \"self-diagnosis\".\n\n\n\nFor years, I have been telling him he has Olfactory Reference Syndrome (a mental disorder of false delusions of smell), and his symptoms line up perfectly: traumatic event that triggered it, almost nobody being able to smell this odor, depression, insistence that it is not mental. Furthermore, he is Korean -- and there is a similar diagnosis called \"jikoshu-kyofu\" which is seemingly culture-bound confined to East Asia.\n\n\nHe refuses to believe me and says I am being unsupportive by calling him crazy. I told him I will go to the psychiatrist with him, but he just gets insulted and tries all these crazy ass techniques to get rid of this imaginary smell - daily footbaths with various oils, overpriced Russian foot creams from eBay, and most recently - making his own Kombucha/Kefir thinking he has TMAU.\n\n\nFurthermore, I have found USC peer reviewed studies that have a very similar case of a man who believed he has TMAU, when it turned out to be Olfactory Reference Syndrome. There are also several cases that document the same thought patterns which were solved via medication.\n\n\nDoes anyone else have any luck with treating Olfactory Reference Syndrome? Or considered they may have it? I suspect many may actually have this. Or just suffer from poor hygiene habits and are unaware. Bad breath for example can send \"waves\" of fecal smell. Most people do not consider these things. Personally I have explored this with my therapist and nothing came of it. My doctor and psych are well aware of what I think and my issues seem to be depression and anxiety associated with being a stinky bastard. I would say if you have never actually had a friend or family member comment then you should be good. It is when strangers start commenting on your stink, and THEY WILL, is when you should be concerned.  I appreciate the reply so much! Thank you. \n\n\nMy friend is also suffering from depression and anxiety, and also had a traumatic childhood. I have smelled his feet and they are fine. In fact, they are impeccable because he takes such care of them -- and funny enough this makes me self-conscious about my own!\n\n\nMy concern is that my friend takes everything the *wrong* way. I fear that what he \"hears\" from strangers and his stories are all just paranoid delusions. Like, he asks a friend if his feet smell, and that friend would say \"yeah, sheesh!\" obviously in a JOKING manner -- but my friend would take that as \"proof\" his feet stink rather than trusting all the people who say he does not smell. Other \"proof\" include: people moving chairs in class, people saying \"what is that smell?\", people opening a window... a bunch of ridiculous stuff that is just people living their lives and not directed at him, which he misinterprets.\n\n\n\nAnother concern is that they might be auditory hallucinations stemming from anxious situations. He claimed he gave a school presentation, and his professor said that his feet stink afterwards. That just seems outlandish, and I have a feeling his intense anxiety during the presentation perhaps had him mishear or misinterpret what the teacher said due to all the stress.\n\n\n\nI cannot trust what he is saying with his stories, because he skews stories as \"proof\" that he smells, when it is really just his anxious thoughts making a big deal of the smallest things... Definitely seems like a psychiatric condition to me. But he refuses to belie me and gets mad at me for not supporting his newly discovered \"TMAU\" disease. I can understand how it would be frustrating and you are a good friend for reaching out. It sounds like he shoud definitely bring this up with his doctor or even a therapist as people do not generally smell your feet from a distance. I have a friend with really bad athletes foot and I have never smelled anything. This does not mean there is no smell and as his friend you may just be used to it. But, that being said it clearly is bugging him and probably very devastating. Tell him he needs to see a doctor. Self diagnosis and treatment can prolong suffering. Even indefinitely. Tell him foot odour is a very treatable thing(as it is). And lastly be supportive. Telling him that it is a delusion will only tear a hole in your relationship and he will no longer trust you or your advice. Be a friend. If it bothers you so much just ignore it. Change the subject. Reinforce the fact that YOU do not smell anything. It will only serve to bring you guys closer and make him feel better. Aside from all that i really hope things work out. Thinking you stink is no fun. Best of luck. I have medically confirmed TMAU and used to suffer from stinky feet. The two things are unrelated. Foot odour comes from bacterial action on the skin surface breaking down molecules in the sweat and releasing isovaleric acid. Importantly, when I had stinky feet, I could smell them. TMAU odour comes from a systemic release of trimethylamine. Importantly, whilst others can smell this, the person with TMAU cannot. That is because the human sense of olfaction is somewhat comparative and therefore the trimethylamine is already in the person's body reference, meaning they themselves cannot smell it. That is why if you see videos of people talking about their experiences, they do not say they eat something and can smell themselves. They will refer to 'reactions' they get from other people getting a whiff of them. For reference to help your other half. He needs to keep his feet dry and clean. By far the best method I found was washing my feet in hibiscrub during my morning shower. That kills off all the bacteria on the feet. No bacteria, no foot odour. sorry for asking but did strangers ever tell you this? Yeah I am actually on disability (PWD) due to depression and anxiety because of all the comments and the way people have treated me over the years. If they are not staring directly at me and coughing or sniffing loudly, it is \"YOU STINK\", \"HE STINKS\" or any manner of comments. I have never once had a stranger calmly tell me I smell bad though. It is always in anger. Like I cannot take care of myself and it is affecting their day. The worst is when they think you are out of ear shot but really you are like 10 feet away and they are speaking loudly. They will just rip in to you.

She was like a fishy hot garbage smell and it smelled up an entire room and wherever she sat it lingered. We dated a long time later and it was like this domineering bdsm thing where she 'owned' me with her smell. It is so hard to find a woman who smells 'terrible' and dominates an entire area with her body.

I also had a coworker jokingly tell me i smelled like s**t. This smell continued for about 2 months until we were sent to work from home due to covid. Upon returning to work 8 months later and 70lbs lighter I noticed that I no longer had this smell. To my surprise I began to smell this once again along with the smell of urine (though the urine smell being very rare) for about 2 months now off and on. I have since asked my direct family and they have stated that they do not smell it , I have also asked my gym buddy and he says he has also never smelled it. I do not notice the smell after intense workouts but do notice it after sitting for long periods of time. I like to think i have impeccable hygiene due to the fear of smelling bad and getting a comment about it but i am still unsure if my problem is TMAU. \n\nAny help is appreciated, I would just like to know if it is indeed TMAU. I will answer any questions! Maybe, most of what you said sounds like what most people with tmau go through. Also, take your family and gym buddy saying that you do not smell with a grain of salt. Many people with tmau repot that when they directly ask someone if they smell they will say they do not even though they get indirect comments that they do. How is your diet? Yea i figured. Any clue why I do not smell myself at the gym after a workout though ? It seems I only smell it after sitting for too long. my diet is pretty clean for the most part, high in protein but i also do not eat much , less than 1400 calories a day. Though this past sunday I did eat very bad and had a few fudge rounds and a bag of hot chips, the next day is when I smelled the fecal odor at an all time high. I now know to cut that off completely. Cut out sugars, refined grains, high fructose corn syrup, processed foods. Eat more vegetables and fruit. Stay hydrated. Will do , thank you for the information! Would you know why I only smell when sitting down for long periods of time and not when I actually sweat from a workout? Poor breathing perhaps. Take some breaks, do some deep belly breathing. Oh wow that would make sense , I sit next to a very attractive coworker that I am normally very nervous around and I do catch myself either holding my breath or keeping my core right for the better part of the 8 hours. Would you say it is likely that what I have is TMAU? I dunno about tmau but poor eating, stress, poor breathing can make your symptoms worse. Try taking riboflavin supplement daily too. 100 mg Will do , I have also ordered Vitamin code raw kombucha pills that I have also had recommended Can you give an example of a meal or 2 of your diet? I pretty much either have grilled chicken or ground beef with pinto beans almost daily. I do not have many vegetables in my diet at this point but will be adding them in.

I thought it had gone away after I would graduated high school but boy I was wrong. Literally at the end of middle school.

Just leave it under the sun soaking in a tub, then wash it. For fabric softener something that would be either antibacterial. Put a small amount of detergent over the armpit areas of your shirts and jackets and rub it in. Do the same for the groin of your pants if you sweat there too.

I am just tired of being constantly paranoid of thinking I smell.\n\nAbout 3-4 hours into my shift I begin to notice a food-like smell around me. Im convinced it is me but I have no evidence. I asked my coworker who sits directly behind me if she notices any smell and she said no, I also explained to her what TMAU is and how I believe I have it. I hoped that in return this would decrease the chances of her lying to me, she still said no and told me she would be the first person to tell me if i smelled (this and the fact that she sits 2 feet away from me and has her mask below her nose the entire day made me feel a bit better.) I have also asked two different coworkers if they notice a smell in our building, one said she noticed a foodlike/dusty type of smell but she believed it was the building. My other coworker said it smelled like chemicals and fuses. I shower every morning and my commute to work is about 10 minutes (no chance that I build up sweat to smell this weird already, right?), once I walk into the building I do notice a small hint of the smell but it is not until hours later that the smell grows, i am not sure if i am just smelling myself? I occasionally walk around the building when i get a big whiff and I can smell it in some areas, but on the way back to my seat following my same path I can no longer smell it. I am not sure if i am the one carrying the smell or if it is truly the building. I have other coworkers that come over to our area for about an 1 throughout the day and they have also said they have never smelled anything. \n\nI am so lost and have no idea what to think and what to do. I would not wish this on my worst enemy, this is mental torture and i am getting very tired. You have asked the people around you and just assume they are telling the truth. Same with me, everyone I asked say I do not smell but then I still get occasional looks and get that felling that I smell. \nI am pretty sure there are a fair amount of us in here that it is all in our heads. Stop stressing yourself out, you may cause other issues &amp; on the off chance you do have TMAU stress/anxiety will not help.\nContinue to be vigilant about your hygiene &amp; diet.

Ever since then I am super paranoid when I smell anything unpleasant, but I have also smelled myself smelling like urine at times. What type of environment do you work in?

You will need to start working out if you arent already because working out releases dopamine which helps with depression (which a lot of us have). Try to work out at least 5 days a week.  \n\n\nNow diet:  \nCUT SUGAR OUT, trust me. Its making you smell. Cut it out of your diet as much as you can (this includes most frutis). if you are not vegan I would say to consider going vegan (if you are healthy and have no medical issues). Just make sure to get a multivitamin and your amino acids in. I would say to research which aminos increase tmau odor before getting any aminos into ur regimen just to be safe.  \n\n\nAlso make sure you are having at least 1 bowel movement per day.  \n\n\nFrom here start fasting a day a week and taking probiotics during your fast and after meals. Preferably a probiotic that has FOS in it (FOS feeds probiotics).  \n\n\nThen begin learning some sort of thing that can make you money but can be done from home. It was suggested to me that I start raising reptiles and sell them online. These are the sorts of ideas that can earn you some cash with out having to deal with people.  \n\n\nThis next suggestion is for those who want to get their college degrees:   \nStart going to school and if you are not smart get a prescription from a doctor for Adderall to help you get good grades. Good grades will help you get scholarships which will get you extra money to try new supplements or move out of your parents house, etc.   \n\n\nThis is my mini guide on how to survive tmau. Once you have all this in place you will see life is much easier and more enjoyable.   \n\n\nA really good cheat guide with the college thing is to move to a really cheap city and do 2 yrs of your degree at a community college and apply for loans. Use those loans to pay for rent or buy a cheap house. I meantion this because i know a lot of us struggle with problematic home situations.   \n\n\nI know in a lot of cities you arent allowed to buy land and put a trailer or rv on it but you CAN buy a house that needs a lot of work and the proceed to place an RV in the backyard or place a small structure like a tiny home.  \n\n\nThere are a lot of ways around things now in days. Just have to look into the laws of the city/county you want to do this in and then proceed if its allowed.  \n\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk :-) The problem is it is hard to find someone with this problem. Its not impossible , i found someone more than once.\n\nThink about it and you will realize that if someone is online dating its probably because they also have exausted their options/cant find someone.

Its really important to be updated on all the groups happenings if you want to thrive through this TMAU thing MEBO is a great Facebook group they bring up research, personal stories and what worked for them I did not join any of the Facebook groups. I prefer more anonymous platforms like Reddit.", "How do you connect with other TMAU sufferers? I have heard of facebook, discord, youtube, and others, but what is the most popular? Do you want to connect with other people that you can relate to? I would much prefer to meet other sufferers to be friends and not make it just about our disease.

", "How do you cope with everyday life?  I was just curious of people's coping mechanism who are currently dealing with this monster of condition. I typically would try to ignore it and act as oblivious as everyone else when those around starts to sneeze, cough, clear their throats and the likes in my presence. However, in places where I would meet the same group of people &amp; where any human-being with the most basic cognitive functioning can eventually put the pieces together and realize I am the cause of people's reactions, I try to avoid these constant settings as much as possible. ie- I am in virtual school, I work from home, and I exercise w/ youtube vids, etc. This is really detrimental to my mental health because I am basically living an isolated life and that ish is not fun. I just avoid people as much as possible, only go out for necessities etc.  I know isolating is not healthy for my mental health as well but being out in public is way worse. I mostly live a normal life. I go out because I have to. School, sports, grocery shopping, etc. are all reasons for going out (I am also young so...). I am really optimistic about a future without this but honestly the only things that would change are my confidence and friend count. I go on as if everything is normal. This is my \"new normal\" now. I work from home and go out for necessities. Honestly, I suggest you buy a vitamin d topical cream and use it. It will improve your mood, plus give you the vitamin D you need because you stay indoors a lot Same way as everyone else, I suppose. Work from home, only go out for necessities, do not speak unless spoken to. \n\nYesterday was rough. I will admit I have been on a food bender for the last week or so, lots of beans, some eggs, plenty of onion and pepper, some beef, all of my favorites. Good food makes me happy, so it is kind of a double-edged sword when the one thing that makes me happy is also what makes my symptoms worse, so that high crashes quickly.\n\nAnnoyance #1: My father did not want to get in the truck with me. He is a terrible communicator, so instead of just saying \"no not today\" so I can move on, he went through the motions of getting ready, then just stayed in the house when I got in the truck. That kind of passive bullshit grinds my nerves like no other.\n\nAnnoyance #2: The new lady at the taco truck decided to rub her nose and stare at her mate as if I, an HSP and an empath, would not catch that. Again, passive bullshit that grinds my nerves.\n\nAnnoyance #3: My car stopped on the side of the road, in the rain. Had to tow it home, and now I do not have a car. You should not be optimistic. It is better to have a plan B than just hope it goes away. The youtube BOS is super healthy but still has TMAU and has had it for 15+ years. But, now I think he is working from home as a front-end developer. Maybe try studying for something that will allow you to work from home. Facts.

How do you guys deal with hotels. I just deal. My advice is do not pay it any mind. Do what you have to do. Think of the pros. You have a roof over your head, and that is all that matters. I stay in hotels, and just mind my own business. I stay to myself. While you are there find a way to distract yourself as well I usually stay in BNBs. But if I am in a hotel I do not let it get to me too much because there is so many people there and it could be anyone. I also would bring plug-ins, candles and air fresheners with me. true good advice, I got a bnb for the first time starting tom to avoid any further smell issues, cost me 2k for 3 dang weeks but whatevs dum have to worry about ppl complaining bout me Yeah that is the downside of bnbs. They can be really expensive. But atleast I am not walking down the halls with other ppl looking at me and seeing what room I am walking into or having to take the elevator with other ppl. Have you tried to airproof the door? You could always buy tape and put it around the edges, this would stop airflow. And, at the bottom try putting a towel/cloth, or maybe buy a draft stopper. (Note, this is assuming the door is the only place that allows airflow from your room to the hallway or any other room.) I have been living in a dorm for the past year, so I have experience with this issue. I have ( on my door and I put up ( around the door as further protection. If you are going to be staying there a while maybe try the weather stripping that way you do not have to keep putting up and removing the tape.\n\n( if you try this just beware while you are putting it on to constantly check that the door will close. If you have to put in a large force to close the door remove the stripping. If you do not you might get locked out of your room because the lock will get jammed. yea I put a towel under the door to try to contain smell but I dont know if it does anything.. well i got an airbnb I am moving into for a few weeks while I find housing so I wont have to deal with anxiety of hotels", "Do you attract bugs? I have notice roaches crawling to where I am? One time inside and twice with no food around\n... Sorry I am also very clean Usually just gnats or flies. Gnats, flies, roaches are attracted to gas or co2. Like you will see them around rotten fruit or decay, they are are attracted to the gas / CO2 released Even with my window closed flies fly around my room sadly... Our bodies are creating hydrogen sulfide to break down the extra triethylaminuria in our bloodstream. This is why you can be smelled outside of your house. 2 gal of water will help dilute the smell. Also a couple tsp of baking soda will help get rid of the gas. Ultimately our digestive system needs to be fix. Exercise a gallon  and a half to 2 gallons water will assist you with your scent. For people with tmau, the tma does not break down, the tma is the smell of tmau (rotten fish). If it is sulfurous, it is something else: see   for a pretty good breakdown of different malodors.\n\nThe diet for the two are very different. For tmau, you are meant to dodge fish, eggs, offal, legumes, red meat.\n\nFor sulphur smells, you might be better dodging something else : \"It is worth remarking that in certain food products, substrates for the production of H2S by bacterial reductases might occur. For example onion, garlic, wine, cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms,nuts, potatoes and dried fruits contain sulfides and sulfites (used as antibacterial and antioxidizing\r\nagents).\"\n\nHaving the wrong diagnosis might just make things worse, or unnecessary.\n\nI have tmau and garlic, onion and potatoes are all good. (Edit: well, not all good, because everything has some precursor of tma in it, but good enough) It is not just fish. It can be at times a fish smell though. I have had about 12 cats that came out of what seemed like nowhere and followed me around because they thought I had fish for them.

I notice it in my early 20\u2019s I am now 30 and mostly from my coworkers and family reactions did not start into about 3 years ago. Ah right. Antibiotics most likely. \n\nMy trigger was in my 20\u2019s during college. Alcohol. Stress. Bad food. Yep I believe so to I wish I would have known back then to take probiotics with the antibiotics doctors should be required to tell there patient\u2019s that. 100%. We really need to be advocates for ourselves it seems. The system lets us down. That is so true 100% Do co-workers or family say the odor is fecal or what type of odor? Well my coworker has said in the past when I worked as a nurse tech I asked my male coworker he said a homeless man lol I guess like I have not showered when I took one before work and I am a women lol one person also indirectly said a gym locker I have changed my diet completely this year I do not eat meat or dairy anymore I went vegan and I am starting coffee Enemas next week it is going to take time to clean my system. I would not recommend coffee enemas, for one coffee is not good for you regarding odors and your colon absorbs it well. \n\nAnd 2. It can cause health issues. Some reports (do not know how prominent), showed it causing colitis. I would do not read it thoroughly but I do not know if it was a permanent or temporary change. Below is the link.\n\n\n\nBut sounds like typical bad odor. Did the diet change do anything?

Yes you just got to live the best way you can with this and yes kefir makes it so much  worst and it is possible we do have the same smell, what have people said about your odor ? Mines depending on what I eat smells I guess musty or like garbage since I have not been consuming meat it is like a musty smell but I rather smell like sweat or musty then the garbage/foul smell I used to give off. it was definitely the keto diet consuming tons of meat and dairy. it is hard being vegan but I would definitely try it for a week if I was u right now I drink ripple (plant base milk) but you can have almond or oat milk I eat a lot of herbs like Cilantro ,parsley with salads I use hemp seeds in salad i eat any fruit and eat walnuts a lot I drink only coffee,tea,water they have a lot of plant-base option to choose for quick meals I look at YouTube a lot for help as well for how to cook certain vegan meals. Keep your negativity to yourself. Just being realistic chill it is the internet Yes. So true as I did this also. Doctors do not want to solve it because there  is no effort to find a cure.

The bismuth subgallate in it causes a raft like action that stops the odour coming from the gut temporarily.  You will have to take a double or triple dose though depending on your body.  It only works for a few hours.  Do not take it more than once a day though.  It will harmlessly turn your stools back which will disappear in a few days and may turn your briefly stain your tongue due to the chemical reaction to the bacteria on your tongue.  Since it is also used to stop diarrhea it will constipate you so ensure you drink enough water.  Please note that you cannot take this medicine for longer than two weeks or so as it affects the liver.  Once stopped the liver goes back to normal.  Best to take in emergency situations.  Strong spices, high doses of sugar, dairy etc. anything that triggers your odour you must avoid as it will not be effective.  To save money one can buy bismuth subgallate powder if you can find it.    \n\nThere is another over the counter medicine called Gaviscon and Gaviscon Advance which does the same thing as Pepto Bismol.  Unfortunately only the U.K. version has the sodium alginate which produces the raft effect.  Here is a post about how to make a cheaper version:\n\n( \n\nAlso buy a cheap $1 tongue scraper and use a few drops of heavily, heavily diluted food grade hydrogen peroxide  ( (IF YOU BUY UNDILUTED FOOD GRADE HYDROGEN PEROXIDE YOU MUST DILUTE IT IN ORDER TO PREVENT SERIOUS INJURY FROM CHEMICAL BURNS) on your tongue after first flossing then brushing.  This will temporarily clean the mouth of bacteria.  Therabreath is an expensive version of this with peppermint oil and preservatives.  You can buy already diluted food grade hydrogen peroxide online.  Do not use the $1 dollar store stuff in the brown bottle that is not safe.\n\nAlso ensure you are defecating at least 2 to three times a day.  Magnesium powder or capsules will help with this or you can use castor oil.  Castor oil is excellent and useful for the whole body for so many things.  You can also use castor oil packs on your abdomen nightly.   \n\nStart soaking in the tub nightly or whenever you can with plain or scented Epsom salt baths.  Stay in for a while to let the magnesium soak in.  magnesium is absorbed transdermally as well and is excellent for many things and most people are deficient in it.  \n\nDo a liver flush twice a week with the fresh squeezed juice of one lemon or lime mixed with an equal amount of olive oil.  Drink this right before bed.  This will help to remove liver and gallbladder stones and bile sludge.  It may take a few flushes before you see stones in the toilet when you defecate (they are bright green and look like peas.)  To get even more stones and sludge out use apple cider vinegar or apple juice or better yet malic acid powder in the daytime.  (Do not buy malic acid powder mixed with any other acid powder.  Just mix a 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon of malic acid powder with water and drink.)  The malic acid softens the stones and helps remove them quicker. \n\nAlso look into taking triphala capsules or powder 2 to 3 times a day.  It will take a few weeks to get your correct dosage and for it to work.  It makes your whole digestive system work better and is dirt, dirt cheap if you get it from an Indian food store.  It may be spelled trifla on the package instead of triphala.  \n\nBlack seed oil also known as nigella sativa, black caraway, black cumin, kalonji, and black onion seeds can be found dirt cheap in Indian or other ethnic grocery stores it will probably be packaged under one of the names above.  \n\nAlso look into MTHFR, histamine intolerance, thyroid issues: ( Sjogren's syndrome and other causes of bad breath \n\nAll the things I mentioned are a lot cheaper when bought in ethnic food stores or online on eBay, Amazon, iherb, vitacost etc.  Use ( rakuten to get discounts if they apply in your country.  \n\nYou may find these links helpful even if this issue is not TMAU1 or TMAU2\n\n ( \n\n ( \n\n ( \n\n ( \n\n ( \n\nThat is all I can think of for now.

Could I have tmau1? Does your dad have it? Get tested. What smell do you get? This is NOT a 100% accurate rule, but I often see people with fish only tend be be more type 1 and people with fecal only or a mix of smells to be type 2. Bear in mind this is not always the case hey, I believe I got this from my mother, but if you get it from just your dad or your mother, that means you have only one gene , and not two carrying genes from both parents. and tmau 1 is diagnosed from having to fauty genes from both parents. ... this would mean your only a carrier. in my mind I think that to be a carreier just means you are mild, or suseecptibale to falling under tmau2 and a mix of tmau 1, with environmental factors playing a role in reducing the enzyme activity , and dietary and gut problems we would of pointed towards an enhanced accumulation of tma to result in tmau 2. \n\nso thus are enzyme can be reduced by a number of things, I believe its androgen hormones what play a major role In the activity of the fm03 enzyme. and also leaky gut/ excess tma/ gut dysbiosis is what produces the tau environment. and you can now see the correlation between falling under each of the bracket, also may point toward the mix of smells everyone gets. with funding and medical research we could absolutely correct this unfortunate condition. we have the tools we have the brain power, we just do not have the money to fund such a thing or bring awareness for anyone to care. but one day we will be out of this mess , trust me I think I also got mine from my dad. Mine also started in puberty. I am in the process of seeing a specialist who can hopefully help. I am told I smell like shit mostly. Sometimes ass and eggs too. A few times cheese or sour cream, usually if I am constipated, which I am usually not. What I smell from myself is shit in windy areas or some indoor places. More often I smell myself of the food tripe(intestines). I do not know what chemical is responsible for the smell of tripe though.\n\nMy shits are also very stinky, and that I can smell.\n\nEdit: I forgot to say that sometimes people have also said I smell like tripe soup. I used to feel tripe smelled urine-y. People frequently tell me I am constipated too, based on the smell, which is not really true. Chicken noodle soup is something I smell sometimes...\nCheese and corn chips.\n\nDefinitely type 2 if that is a real thing\n\nI do not consider TMAU 1 and 2 to be remotely the same condition if the latter is a scientific, 1 is a literally metabolic condition lacking in a very specific way for processing a very important nutrient.\n\n2 can be whatever makes someone smell like shit or random other stuff.

I wanted to see if my problem was hygiene related (which I already knew it was not) or not.

Also bleach your clothes ! It could be the issue. Could be a build up of sweat and stuff in your laundry. Use color safe bleach. If you have done all you can do to remove the smell from your wardrobe and room then the issue might be you. It is hard to accept but I would figure out if you actually have TMAU or PATM, Candida, H.Pylori etc. What do you normally eat and what do you avoid and how often do you get reactions The reaction usually happens within 10 minutes of eating and can last for a while. Avoid choline containing foods to some degree but it is mostly a mitigation game bc choline is in most foods.\n \nI just tend to avoid egg yolks, liver and minimize beans. Other than that, the charcoal and chlorophyll, combined with hygiene techniques allow me to live a fairly normal life. TMAU can have a wide range of severity and fortunately mine is on the milder side, though I am certain the chemical build up from improper cleaning makes it worse. Sooooo I thought I had TMAU for a couple years because my lab results for various tests came back negative or normal and I did not have any other symptoms other than a foul, putrid, sweet smell that sometimes smelled like maple syrup and sometimes like ammonia. However- and this is a big \u201chowever\u201d- I found out I actually had e coli bacteria in my system. E coli has a strange smells to it. It is usually described as RANCID, PUTRID, FOUL, SWEET and like AMMONIA. It varied according to what foods I would eat or how stressed I was. If you are experiencing these smells and your blood tests have come back normal, I strongly suggest that you do an e coli culture test. I smelled horrible for 2 years! Usually e coli in the system can cause sepsis and death if it goes untreated so I am surprised that I dealt with it for so long but I am finally receiving treatment for it and the smell is finally subsiding. I was praying for a healing for a long time. Then I read that this one guy fasted for 21 days and took probiotics tablets the entire time until he was able to cleanse his gut out and then his symptoms went away. I believe that when he fasted he starved the e coli bacteria in his gut. As for me, I am currently taking Cephalexin 500 MG capsules 3 times a day, fasting and continuing with prayer and it is working. Also, you may want to see if you have BV if you have not done so already. BV produces a FISHY odor. I was informed by my doctor that both could take up to 3 treatments over the span of 3 months to get rid of completely because the treatments only kill up to 70% of the bacteria each time. Both the E coli and BV treatments are not to be taken at the same time. So you would go one week with one treatment and another week or two with the other. Let me just say that Dr. Diana Yan in Gaithersburg, MD, USA was the only doctor out of the 9 doctors I met with over the past two years to inform me in detail what my treatment was, what caused the rotten smell that my body was producing and how the different bacteria react to their treatments. I am so thankful for her. What if TMAU is just e coli in people with strong immune systems? I hope you all find this information to be helpful.\n\nFYI, the smell is almost completely gone and I am only half way through my first treatment. I am cured of it! I had it for two years. I prayed to God and he answered my prayers. After going to 9 doctors and having this condition cause an issue at work and social environments, I can say I am finally healed.\nI went to a doctor who told me I had e-coli that was causing the rotten smell. The doctor said that it would take about 3 months for me to be healed. I started taking antibiotics for 2 weeks, completed a diet with mostly sauerkraut, kefir milk(it is sour), probiotics, ginger tea, hardly any sugar, prayed about it so much, had worst days then better ones, tried to eat only the items listed above so that it could have the best effect and, thank God, the smell is completely gone. Today I have been 3 days without a case. I have eaten eggs, beef and other foods and I have no odor. I smell clean. I did this for approximately 3 weeks.

I ate really healthy throughout, but looking back ate a very very low amount of calories for how much I was burning with school and practices and games. By the end of the season my sweat started to smell like urine. It was noticed by a teammate at like the last practice and game. Throughout that year and into summer my sweat would smell like that. Fast forward a few years and the sweat smell is fairly non existent. I do take kelp and zinc and probiotics, but even days I do not take those the pee smell is not there. The thing that happens now is the smell of farts or poop when I drink alcohol. It does not happen anytime else almost ever. But usually about 1 drink into things it happens and people can smell it and so can I. I can also smell it on my breath after a lot of drinks as well. I know there is the option to just give up drinking but I really want to know why it just happens then I do not get any nasty looks otherwise and do not have it as bad as most on here, but I am just wondering if I have TMAU and why the smell just happens when drinking. Tmau is classically a rotten fish smell, caused by unprocessed trimethylamine coming out in sweat (unprocessed due to either genetics, health problems or just eating too many proteins that turn into tma in the stomach). \n\nAlcohol as a trigger is not really a thing I have heard of for tmau. There is not usually a trigger as such, although I think stress makes it worse.\n\nDo not think it is tmau, but definitely sounds like a body odour thing of some sort. \n\nMight be worth speaking to a doctor and get some blood tests to make sure everything is healthy? It is a weird reaction, might be liver or kidney related if alcohol is a trigger? TMAU is not limited to rotten fish smell.  I do not want to gatekeep or diminish but tmau is an expression of unoxydised trimethylamine and trimethylamine as a chemical compound smells like rotten fish.\n\nIf the smell is something else it is likely to be a different condition, with potentially extremely different treatment regimes. A smell of urine after drinking is likely something else, and getting checked out by a doctor is a good start, in case there is something wrong. On point, as always! OP this is sound advice! Please give a blood test a try before thinking this might be a permanent issue. Since you notice the smell worse after beers, it could be good to get tested for celiac as well (this can be done with the same blood test for liver and kidney issues). \n\nCould the urine smell be caused by your breath? Both of my parents get bad allergies and post nasal drip and when it does, their breath and sometimes body smells like urine from all the mucus. Do you get sinus issues or feel a lot of phlegm buildup?\n\nAnother thing to rule out is mildew. Mildew by itself definitely reeks of pee. Do you have any mildew in your house (walls?) Or maybe some have spread in your laundry? This happens a lot if you have clothes that have not dried 100% and it is very easy to go noseblind to. I thought that as well, but I do not really have any of the other symptoms that would be present in a liver or kidney disease. The only symptom I have is a poop smell but I cannot even smell it but everyone else can and I have tried everything", "Does people who has these problems notice the smell? My GF has really bad breath and body odor. I have a hard time describing the smell, but it is extremely 'rich', dehydrated and foul. Like a mix of fecal, sweet (in a sickening way) and fermented smell. Brushing/showering does not help. \n\nAnyway, she does not take me serious when I mention the smell because she does not notice it herself. Is this even possible considering how strongly I notice it?

But yes, it sounds really confusing. I will try to explain: \n\nI started obsessing over my GF smell because I read about partner attraction and it is role in evolution. At this point I never had any issue with her smell. I have some kind of OCD where I keep questioning my relationships. After reading about this partner attraction I started obsessing about her smell, and while doing so it became gradually worse.  I do not know whether this is caused by my obsession, or if her smell had been altered in the meantime. Stress also changes how you 'interpret' smells and even normal smells can become stinky.\n\nTo make things even more confusing, she does not have any close friends, only people she talks to at school. So, noone else has mentioned her smell, but that does not mean she does not smell. \n\nFor all I know she could smell horrible, but noone tells her since they are not close to her. Or, it could simply be my brain/anxiety playing tricks on me. The only thing I do know is that her smell is 100% real to me and that she does not notice the smell.", "TMAU comes and goes Can TMAU smells happen occasionally? My odour is not constant, but it is definitely there on and off. Sometimes I smell of regular sweat, perfume etc, then sometimes it is bad enough even I can smell it, but is not necessarily when I am sweating, hot, on my period etc. It does not seem to be consistent with when I 'should' in theory, be smelly.\n\nThoughts please! Absolutely possible depending on what you ate.

And goesq I feel like it might be stronger sometimes that others but also the environment you are in and state you are in changes how you personally perceive or notice odors.\n\nExample, I notice when I am hungry or fasting, it appears I have a heightened sense of smell,\n\nOr when it is more humid and hot in the room, or when there is a different smell in the room I am in, it triggers me to smell my own body on top of it.\n\nSometimes walking from one room to another I notice it due to the change in the environment.

I tried some cream today and got instant cramping, bloating, and gas. I realized I did not have any of these symptoms when I was not eating dairy. I ran to the store to get some lactose-digesting enzymes, and the cashier gave me a weird reaction.   \nUpon doing a little more research, I discovered that leaky gut can be caused by inflammation from allergies, such as dairy and gluten. Leaky gut can cause odor, by essentially releasing biproducts of partly digested food from the gut into the blood stream. \n\nI do not know if this is my problem, but I will definitely be avoiding dairy from now on. \n\nDoes anyone here have any experience with lactose intolerance, leaky gut, and related odors? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Source:  ( ) Yes.

Interesting. How long did you take it, before you noticed less reactions from people? We are you taking the vegetarian capsules, and or the fish oil capsules with DHA? Also, I completely understand. It was the fish oil capsules with dha and for a about week This study is about mice, not people. It is a nice idea, but a quick google search shows that plenty of people who start taking fish oil start to smell fishy, so it is probably not the greatest.\n\nEven vegetarian fish oil can be quite fishy, see \n\nNot 100% sure on this. Maybe in a limited amount it would work? But dha is a normal part of fish oil, and eating fish is a trigger, so I would assume that the choline / bad stuff in fish overrides any benefit of dha(?)

I overheard one of the girls opening the door saying it needed to air out bc I made it smell. I have quit going to hot yoga... obviously the heat and deep breathing is like the worst thing. I only noticed a fishy smell once I walked into the yoga room and was breathing towards my mat. I had no idea it was coming from me until I put all of it together.

I often question, if I am ever going to live a happy and fulfilling life. I do not really have any friends around me. My family does not believe and whenever I bring it up they seem to think that you can just ignore it and it will all go away. I feel like I am being discriminated from job opportunities. And I just cannot seem muster up enough confidence to talk to women because I smell like feces. Do you think you can become happy, and if so what is your plan? Maybe try and mention it to people. Explain your situation. Crack jokes about your \u201csmelly\u201d self and maybe people will not care. That or maybe people will think you are crazy.

Even co workers say \u201cwe do not smell anything\u201d and I think ppl are just being polite cause they do not want to hurt my feelings. Maybe try and portray confidence and show that what people say does not bother you. I told my family, and I told the supervisors that I have a condition that makes me smell. However, I still have to work around people and it gets me angry that I abstain from food that I want to eat, nevertheless, I still get people holding their breath, or rubbing their noses when they are around me. Do you feel like you are living a fulfilling life? Tbh, no. Having to conform to a strict ass food regime and still getting reactions is a sick joke from God tbh. The diet puts nearly everything off the table for me. Fucks sake. Not a month goes by without me feeling severely suicidal.

There is so many times where I will go a few days on a no food water fast just to completely clear out the intestines, and ppl STILL react to me. My only guess at this point is extreme anxiety of being around other people is causing unfelt leakage of gas. Based on how my family described it to me. And one person sitting behind me once whispered to their friend \"I think it is gas...\" to them. I cannot feel it or smell it though so it drives me crazy, idek it is happening until someone comments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry to ramble honestly I feel like I am going crazy.

Weird I know and I am sorry for the TMI but it is my BO poop and inside my mouth seem to all have similar smell or taste. Have you changed your diet recently? Are you taking antibiotics or any other kind of medication? Sometimes it could be what you are consuming or maybe a change in hormones that may need to be corrected? I do not feel like I have changed my diet too much, and recently got over covid like 2 months ago wich took away my smell completely, then this all the sudden. I know I sound crazy but it is definitely a strong sent that is just out of nowhere. I recently did re start a medication but I had previously taken it with no issues.  I just do not know where to begin family doctor? Stomach doctor? and do you know if this condition can appear at any age? Thanks for your advice I appreciate it. I do not know much about it as I personally do not have it, but it Interested me. From what I read the condition is broken into two types: TMAU 1 which is when the person is born with the condition and it was inherited so for these people it started when they were kids. Then there is TMAU 2 which is when it can be acquired and it can happen due to things like hormonal changes, environmental changes, etc. \n\nI do know that there was a man on YouTube who goes by \u201cGut wars\u201d, I would check it out. He had TMAU 2 and claims to have cured it as well as helping others cure it. He also has a discord community (do not know the name and unfortunately do not have a link. He provides links on his YouTube channel). He stated that he drank things like kefir and kombucha to help with his gut. \n\nI am not sure what doctor you could go to as it could be challenging especially if you are not showing symptoms when you go. I would suggest to go to whoever you can that will listen and try to look up things that can help mitigate the issue. Also look into seeing if there is a possibility that it could be something else as well. It could be a multitude of things causing this issue.

The actual presentation was not that long. We just had great discussions after or during every slide. Surprisingly, he said that he did not even know I smelled and only detected the smell once. I think he is full of shit but who knows. I feel way better. I feel motivated to get help. Our friendship strengthened as a result of the Great Stink (as I call it), because he was kind of lonely at lunch and I had no where else to go to but his table. I am very thankful for him and he said he enjoyed my presentation and the talk.

You will feel so much better after venting rather than letting the truth stay in and rot the inside of your mind. That Is amazing you let that off your chest. And you brought up something interesting - there are other sufferers that say that Some friends and family say they are not able to detect a smell or we get comfortable to not smell if we are nervous.

Sewage, urine, waste water, garbage odor for me it seems. Cheesy or corn chip type smell sometimes.\n\nI feel like after I do some physical work on an empty stomach and \"burning fat\" I am smelling worse. \n\nI know ketosis will cause bad odors and a ton of other aldehydes, ketones, and amines to be released as byproducts. High protein diets can cause ammonia odor from protein breakdown, I believe fat burning can as cause bad odors as well, or keto diets as is documented.\n\nOn top of potential toxins and compounds which fat cells can release upon burning fat. There is a paper on this specifically as well.\n\nThis leads me to believe regular but healthy carb diets work well for TMAU, t1 is proven with low choline, t2 for unknown but various byproducts. Especially considering the bacteria on your skin love to reduce them and process them into other odorous compounds as in the case of nonenal and diacetyl for middle age and older age odors. Lipid peroxidase are the cause for these compounds.\n\nAntioxidants may help in preventing some bacterial reduction of compounds specifically fatty acids that may cause odors, so they may play a vital role. \n\nSo my goal is to lose weight, remove the toxins and compounds my fat cells are holding on and have my body rely on healthy carbs as a normal person should.\n\n**Has anyone experienced better odor after regular exercise and good carb diet?**\n\nIt is hard. It is miserable and I know hormones are released from fat as well when they burn so that makes it harder.\n\nAlso to get some demographics to see if it is a weight/fat related issue? can you guys list your BMI and gender odor type and if you have other major health or gastrointestinal problems like UC or Chrons to get some statistics? \n\nM, BMI is 31. Ezcema, no GI issues really. Minor constipation here and there.\n\nWe can work on this together. Type 2 is not impossible to get better, it is just very unique on the situation per person.\n\nLet us get some data, albeit not the most scientific. Carb heavy diets can cause body odour. Why did not you cite any sources? I appreciate how hard it is as a fellow sufferer. \n\nI do not know if fat burning causes worse smells in the short term but you are likely to be better off in the long term losing some excess weight, and I am just saying that respectfully as a friend. I think it would reduce symptoms a little as it would likely reduce sweating. Lower BMIs are often associated with health gut bacteria too. \n\nIf you feel that exercise makes you smell bad then consider walking or jogging alone outside where you will be away from people. But even better, you do not have to exercise to lose weight and that is a fact. You can lose weight perfectly well from diet alone.\n\nBest of luck Hence, **healthy carb diets**. Utilizing protein and fats as a **main** source seems to cause much odorous problems.\n\nI have emphasis on healthy. Eating a shit ton of carbs is not what I said.\n\nKetogenic diets (high fat, /low carb) is known for bad body odor, this is well documented as ketoacidosis byproduct is ketones, fruity smell (not the good kind, the uncontrolled diabetic kind).\n\nBut here is a generic malodor paper. Sec 3.7 for ketones, high fat odor.\n\n\nHigh protein diets are known for amine odors because proteins byproducts are ammonia.\n\nSame reference, 7.7\n\nNothing specifically on carbs. Carbs are not broken down into odorous compounds.\n\nHowever, a large ingestion of carbs are not good either, if you do not use it, it turns into glycogen, if you store enough it gets converted to fats.\n\n*I am not saying high carb diet. I am merely saying NOT high protein and/or fat diet.*\n\nDo not eliminate protein and fats, this is unhealthy, but do not rely on them as a main source and eliminate carbs...\n\nHave a normal healthy carb diet, that includes less fatty/oily and protein.\n\nOn and here is some links for toxin releasing from fat cells. Seems like there is more on actual hazardous toxins (a more prominent concern) being released from fat cells rather than odorous non hazardous compounds..\n\n\n\nOrganophosphate release from weight loss\n The weight loss journey might cause a temporary bad odor which can be washed after a workout hopefully.\n\nI just noticed when I exercise on an empty stomach and my body is in ketosis, the odor is prominent and much worse.\n\nThe goal is to exercise off the stored fats that may be contributing to the problem as I am going through my day normally. &gt;Carbs are not broken down into odorous compounds\n\nStarch is fermented into SCFAs like butyric acid, which smells. I am actually pretty slim not so sure on the weight or BMI, maybe around 145-152 lbs.

That is a good point, I was mistaken. If you have bacteria that is fermenting starch into butyric acid, that will cause odor.\n\nStill, I do not consider starchy foods good carbs though.. Oh sorry it hear. Sounds like something happened to you specifically that you are unaware of.\n\nWhat does the odor smell like? I have been struggling for 7 years now with an odor. I was told my results for TMAU were negative but I am sure I have type 2 since it did start out of nowhere for me in high school. Anyways I have not been very good at being consistent in diets but have noticed that cutting gluten helps. I have celiac disease so it is important. Sometimes I do eat stuff that has gluten in it and I find the odor worse. I have also noticed if I eat meat it gets worse. Basically junk food makes it worse. I was thinking of trying to eat simply fruits and certain types of vegetables for awhile to see how that goes. I did not know protein makes it bad so I will definitely have to stop though I take a lot of protein since I do weights. I am also trying to lose weight though I am not in bad shape honestly. I was trying to lose fat and gain muscle. I was trying to go vegan but a lot of vegan foods have wheat in them so that is out and any type of nuts makes it worse too. It is honestly hard. I feel like I could find a solution to at least reduce it but I am still struggling here. I get so hungry and binge eat which is my problem I cannot smell it the majority of the time but when I do it varies from kind of sewagey to sweaty bum even tho I already scrubbed and washed like my life depended  on it. I have over heard one person say that it smells like eggs another one said that it smelled like fart and a kid that said it smelled like shit\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude43. When they tested you was it urine test or blood test? Blood test is more accurate. Or it can be an underlying symptom of something else like liver disease -not filtrating You will smell worse because it is similar to releasing a lot of excess toxins. It is good to couple this with low choline diet and activated charcoal. After doing that for a few days, it helps to introduce prebiotic and kefir / probiotics to help facilitate your microbiome. It took a few months but my body odor lessened drastically. Still working on my bad breath. You think the worse smelling part is temporary as in it will wash off after a shower and drying? \n\nMy goal is to workout 4-5 days a week. Break a sweat, go in the sauna and shower at night. \n\nWake up, shower in the morning then hopefully not smell bad for work. I am 28 years old, weighted 45kg = 99 lbs, I dont eat fat and I still smell like sh\\*t. So I think Weight is not a contribute factor to this problem. good fat diet with veggies and fruit made me smell even worse, veggies makes my fart smell extremely bad , fruits have sugar that will feed candida and make me smell worse. SO NO SUGAR at all cost, event if it is from fruits. I see. So what helps you? It seems your odor is related to digestive microbe issues no? \n\nDo probiotics work? \n\nI think my issue is a little different.

I have just started drinking kefir and I stank way worse today -  did you continue to drink it and see improvement? Wondering whether to keep on with it. Yeah I smelled really bad at one point too from it, like someone smelled me 20 feet away. A few days after that I noticed less reactions though. \n\nKefir has a ton of magnesium in it. I wonder if we start smelling worse because its speeding up our bowel movements?? Any improvements? Would you say that you are cured? No I went somewhere recently and got really bad reactions... I was constipated during that time so hopefully that was the cause of the odor? I do not notice much reactions when I am not constipated. No I stopped drinking it, does not agree with my system. Had my doctor even ask me if I had started drinking alcohol again. After a little research I found it is basically just a yeast drink and has very little beneficial bacteria. It even leads to candida overgrowth in some. I have since moved to brewing water kefir and have noticed massive improvements in my digestion. Aside from that though no improvements on smell. How is it? Ultimately any improvement? Nope, still suffering.

Is there anyone else here who is taking antidepressants?\n\n\nI am also looking for friends. I have realised I am kind of lonely lately. I need someone to talk to to. WhatsApp could be a good app for chatting.\n\n\nCheers! Yah same. Trying to stop eating all the carbs and get some more fruit on my diet. I want to switch to fruititarian but I make the best mac and cheese lol A fruitarian diet makes things worse for me. Pretty sure carbs is ok in regards to the smell, rice/wheat/potatoes do not have much of the bad proteins.\n\nIt is just terrible for the waistline \ud83d\ude25\n\nIt is ok though, everyone has lost their sense of smell due to covid,  should we should be fine out there \ud83d\ude00 I can do whatsapp. We really should make a group on there.\n\nI have recently cut out most of the things I love too. No beef, no seafood, no onion, no garlic, no cruciferous veg, no peppers, no eggs. It is so freakin hard when I literally *love* onion and peppers and beef and eggs and... sigh. \n\nIt is been tough. I changed my diet to lots of soups and stew type meals. Just made something I am calling a \"starch bomb\" with potatoes, pasta, peas and chickpeas in a mornay sauce, vegan cheese. It is super yummy but soooooooo carb heavy. \n\nI plan on making a mixed bean soup soon, with split peas, chickpeas and lentils. Might make it like a minestrone or zuppa tuscana. Unfortunately I have also taken up baking cookies, so consuming way more sugar now, compared to when I ate a meat-heavy diet. How was the meat heavy diet? There is a tmau WhatsApp group. Cbd helps some Add me to the group Delicious. I have tmau 1 so diet changes can only do so much to *improve* symptoms, but it can get so so much worse. Protein in general makes symptoms worse. I do they help a great deal but starting to drink an extra gallon of water helps a bit. It takes a day to get the real benefit from it though Me too. It depends on which fruit you eat. Grapefruit works best for me though Does that diet help with reactions? I have TMAU 1, genetic variant. Even if I eat *nothing*, my body still produces choline that my liver cannot oxidize, so in a nutshell, no. What changes is the *severity* of the symptoms, where a meat-heavy diet with all my favorites would be a 10/10 in severity, a diet with low protein and other restrictions brings the severity down to a 5/6 on a good day. How much water do you drink? It varies. Why? Water is a great oxygen source because it does not have to be digested to enter blood stream. Try a gallon of water early before work and you will pee a lot of it out for about two hours. This helps me with reactions. I hope it helps you. I believe that water helps flush choline out of our system and temporarily dilutes the smell from the undigest tmau. It is not a cure but days I drink about two gallons of water I can tell I do not get as many reactions. When I work out though it gets crazy bad Same for me, have you tried riboflavin? No. I genuinely have a hard time believing that a supplement of riboflavin will somehow have an impact when meat itself is loaded with bioavailable riboflavin, leafy greens are loaded with it, *and* fortified grains are loaded with the synthetic type. Couple that with the fact that I am *g r e e d y* and eat enough variety and quantity for 4 people more often than not, it is highly unlikely that I have a deficiency in anything.\n\nThat being said, I notice mild improvement with zinc and significant improvement with high dose zeolite. Concerning Eggs I switch to egg whites. Took a few  months but now I eat egg whites without hesitation .I do not even think of eggs with the yoke anymore. I use egg whites when I cook things too. \nEgg whites help me alot. Something I can enjoy without  smelling.\n\n The problem is coffee. It gets me everytime. I stop drinking it for 6months. Then my spouse walks in the house with Starbucks. And I break. I switch to lightly sweeten teas that are caffeine free. But I am a caffeine addicted so I can only go so long before I go coo coo. I remember two years ago. I tried to cut caffeine out of my life. I went one month and 5 days without. Then I started passing out. Sometimes while I was talking mid sentence. Freak my spouse out and for a while we though Something was wrong health while. But then my memory became dramatically worse. He realized then I was suffering from withdraw. And force me to drink just half a bottle of soda. With just that I was like a bunny on Crack. And I did not  pass out that week.\n  Smh. So once every 4-5 days I enjoy half a bottle of soda. And I  can feel the difference everytime I drink it. But  coffee is officially out. I cannot have both and I want soda.\n -cook egg whites in olive oil. I stop using  veg oil. Long time ago. Oh and if it is been a while since I hit the restroom. Olives, peppermint tea, or  pineapples take care of that. I usually drank my tea in the morning and have pineapple for a snack thru out the day..not the pineapples in a can. Get the whole. Cut it up and enjoy it thru out the week. For some reason the can do not always work for me. \n\nGood luck. There is more that help me.I  will add that later. Do not hesitate to google. If It does not help u, everyone is different and I am sorry.\n\nP.s. I CANNOT eat broccoli. That is something I let go because I had no choice. My body cannot break it down. No matter how much water I drink, Miles I ran, pills I took or anything I could think of. I even took castor oil. Didnt help at all.Save yourself the trouble. Leave it alone.

I automatically believe I am the cause of every odd smell around me and feel extremely guilty. 2 years ago I was told by a coworker that i smelled like \u201csh*t\u201d and I know I 100% did , I smelled like straight feces after sitting down at work for long periods of time. Ever since then i have lived in constant fear of smelling bad. Since those two years I have quit smoking weed ( I noticed I caused a horrible smell the day after smoking weed ) and back then I was getting high 24/7. I have also lost 85lbs and cleaned up my diet, but i still believe i smell something on me. Today I was told by a female coworker that usually works from home but came in today that I smelled really good and another coworker followed up and said that I also wear the best colognes (I do always wear different colognes). This came as a surprise to me because I am always hesitant to walk into their area because i think i smell bad and do not even smell the cologne on myself unless I  put my nose to my clothes. This was a huge sign of relief and helps me loosen up abit over thinking i smell bad all the time. \n\nI really encourage you guys to ask others if you smell bad , this is the only way you will truly know and stop having those constant thoughts in your head if it is truly you that smells bad.

Idk I did not go In public I was to nervous but crazy you comment today I am on another water  fast Will you take supplements?", "TMAU or not?! Hi all! \n\nI have been dealing with this mystery illness for 7 years now, and i am starting to get to the end of my tether.. I am completely at a loss as to whether I have TMAU or not. \n\nI have completed multiple urine tests which come back negative (these have been done after choline loading), I have been dismissed by TMAU specialists in London who do not believe I have the disease, and I have straight up asked my partner if my sweat smelt unusual, to which he said no. And I have had a negative genetic test, to which apparently there was no anomalies, but I want to get a second opinion on that. I have had one borderline 'could be TMAU' urine test come back that said it could be type 1, but i only developed symptoms later in life, so not sure how that works. \n\nHOWEVER! I have been ridiculed by my ex who would tell me I smelt like farts, I have had negative reactions after eating and drinking (the usual 'what is that smell', 'who is farted' etc), and had people literally cover their nose when sat next to me.\n\nIs it possible to only sometimes be omitting odour when sweating? I am talking heavy, post spin class type sweating - apparently I smelt of regular sweat. I only developed symptoms at 21, so could be Type 2. \n\nI am waiting for 2 more urine test results to come back, completed the first and fourth day of my period, after choline loading. I have sinus issues and bad post nasal drip, so wondering if the smell originates from that?! The post nasal drip does taste sometimes, quite repulsive. \n\nGod, I am so fed up wondering what the F is going on, the amount of time, money and most importantly head space that i have invested in finding out what is going on, to no avail. I am fed up of living half a life, I commend everyone else living with this horrendous affliction. \n\nAny thoughts would be SO appreciated, lots of love to all. Please cut out diary and gluten first when you have farty odors. \n\nThis one post and the answers were interesting as well. \n\nWould you say your odor is constant? \nIt could be tmau2 or sibo \n\nStay strong I know how hard it is Sounds more like a bacterial overgrowth if you sometimes smell like farts. Might check whether your odor gets worse when you eat sugars for example. Where is the smell from? Your sweat only or body, urine/ groin area, breath? Unfortunately they have not found a sure fire way to detect TMAU efficiently since urine tests can have false negatives due to other factors like medication or eating certain foods. \n\nThe nasal drip could be SIBO, there are a plethora of guess work to be had since some can be underlying symptoms. I have a web chart made of things to consider (then crossed it out when changing diet/ check ups / etc that do not coincide with the diagnosis). Since you saw tmau specialists and got negative results MULTIPLE tests, I think it is safe to say you do not have tmau. \n\nIt is very possible that if there is an odor from you at all, that it is temporary. Since it seems to happen as you are eating: could it be a nervous stomach? It is totally understandable to feel very stressed in a small restaurant while surrounded by strangers.\n\nWhen these reactions happened, were you with other people who could confirm the reactions or a smell at all?\n\nDid you begin to notice reactions AFTER your ex's ridicule? (Your ex is terrible person for saying that btw !!! )\n\nIf you do end up seeing another doctor my advice is to take a shower early. No matter how embarrassing it might be. If you feel like a certain food is a trigger for the odor, eat some before your appointment. Worst case scenario: deal with temporary discomfort if the doctor detects a bad smell. But then they can finally confirm a malodour. Best case scenario: they tell you they still cannot smell anything. The things you thought were triggers for the smell turned out to not produce an odor after all. Planning on this, will do! Thank you, I will check this out! Odour is not consistent, but definitely there. I am being tested for SIBO and awaiting some more urine test results, taken whilst mensturating and choline loading, will report back.\n\nAppreciate the support, it really is the worst.. Good idea! How would the odour emit if it was a bacterial overgrowth? Is this something that could be treated in theory? I think it is from my breath, but then I have had SUCH severe reactions that I believe it could be emitting from my body/sweat too. Or could bad breath really penetrate that far?\n\nThanks for your input, could you share your web chart?! It is the conflicting symptoms that I am finding most frustrating, nothing is consistent with a single diagnosis.. I would have hoped to say it was not, but the reactions are SO bad that I believe I have it, albeit maybe a milder version at times. I forgot to mention in the original post, that I have once been in a room when someone was like WOW, why does it suddenly smell of fish? I would be in the room for a few minutes. I have also smelt fish on my hands. But then I have had instances where I am sweating buckets and been told I smell of regular sweat? My symptoms are consistent with one diagnosis.. really feel like I am losing my mind.\n\nPeople, aside from my ex, have not directly told me I smell, but their reactions speak 1000 words, moving away from me, covering their noses, whispering, saying 'why does it stink in here' etc etc, unfortunately it is not in my head. It is not a nervous tummy, as much as I wish it was! It is definitely emanating from me somehow, just not that way. \n\nI am waiting for a few tests results to come back (SIBO, 2 x TMAU tests, and I am seeing a halitosis specialist today and I have tried to 'prompt' the odour as much as possible) so will go from there, agreed seeing another doctor after eating/prompting the odour as much as I can is a really good idea, so will try and get that booked in. I just wish there was a single diagnosis so that I could attempt to follow some sort of treatment plan, at the moment it feels like it could be 10 different things!\n\n Appreciate the kind words, my ex really was a sod! Hope you are keeping well. Can TMAU smells happen occasionally? My odour is not constant, but it is definitely there on and off. Sometimes I smell of regular sweat, perfume etc, sometimes it is bad enough even I can smell it, but is not necessarily when I am sweating, hot, on my period etc.\n\nThoughts please! Damn I am so sorry to hear all that has happened. I had my fingers crossed that maybe this was paranoia spurred after your ex's comments. I am sure everyone here can relate to seeing those gestures from other ppl. Know that you are clean, this is purely a medical reason and that you do not deserve to be treated like this from others. \n\nGood luck at your appointment today and keep us posted!! If the doctor is unable to smell you maybe they can ask if other staff noticed anything too? The nurses, reception, etc.\n\nOne other thing that comes to mind if you are a woman - have you been tested for BV? Some ppl get it from actually being too clean down there (even gentle soap can throw the ph off). Over the day the odor can get more intense if there is any discharge. It is not an absolute fix but if the odor is caused by bacteria on your skin, an antibacterial wash like Hibiclens and maybe low ph body soap might help improve things. Tmao on the skin thrives in high alkaline environments, acidic soaps change our skin ph level to be more neutral so they cannot repopulate? as much. \n\nIncluded a link with tips given to a diagnosed tmau patient below\n\n It really is the worst.. you sometimes wish you could shout from the rooftops that it is not your fault! How are you? Have you been formally diagnosed with TMAU?\n\nHalitosis appointment was interesting.. I have tonsil stones which I was never aware of before, which could be part of the issue. After quite a painful examination (not his fault, he did what he needed to do to get the stones!), he asked me to smell one of them which did smell foul, and they can vary in odour. He is taken swabs, a breath test and a spit sample, and I will receive the results at my follow up consultation in 3 weeks, so I will let you know what they come back with. They all had to wear masks so could not judge any reactions, will definitely ask in my follow up appointment. \n\nI will check for BV! That is a good idea!\n\nGreat to chat, helping me to stay sane through all of this..! Woah halitosis specialist! I need to check for that one. How you have been Kefir included? No cause its low in lactose and it heals the gut But I usually dont take it on work days only weekeend I am not sure If I have tmau either even tho I have been told I smelled like a gym locker or homeless even after taking a shower the smell tends to appear when I am stressed under pressure or nervous and sweating so I have been trying to control those things but what I would say is some of us have different conditions that is giving us body odor we associate it with TMAU but it could be another condition I have been doing the yogurt so far so good putting it in my hot spots like underarms, groin, under breast the smell that your ex smelled was not you it was the bacteria on your skin they eat the sweat in those area and they fart and release gas the best thing to do is the plain Greek yogurt mix with coconut oil and use a brush to spread it evenly in those areas and let it dry completely or u can use borax for some reason borax makes your sweat undesirable. Or both and drink a cup of kefir daily, cut meat intake down and eat dairy and sweets in moderation. My odor gets waaay worse when i eat sugar...do you think It could be bacterial?

Or is it like after some time after a shower that it gradually get worse and worse. (I do not want to be disrespectful so sorry if I offended someone with my post I just really need to know) You are not rude for asking. Do you have this or are you just curious?\n\nI think most people with TMAU are plagued by this constantly. Supplements, diet, and excersise can lower the severity of the smell though. But often times supplements start being unaffective after a while and can even make suffers smell worse than to begin with in some situations. Interstingly enough, most people who suffer from this cannot even smell themselves.\n\nActually most people who say they have TMAU do not even know if they have TMAU, they just know they have a strange B.O. issue regardless of their hygene. It is just easier to say you have TMAU than whatever the fuck this is. I am generally curious about it. One of my friends says he had it but I never really noticed if he smelled bad or not. I sometimes randomly just sniff him to be sure and he does not smell. But he keeps insisting that he does and started explaining that he had TMAU. That is kind of why I needed to know if it was all the time or just randomly the smell appears. I have it and barely ever have issues because I restrict my diet to low choline, take supplements daily, and have good hygiene. Maybe once a year someone in my vicinity will mention a fishy smell and I just go take a supplement, wash my hands, put on some deodorant, and it seems to go away.\n\nLiterally the other day my roommate brought up someone is BO remaining on their jacket that was in our apartment, then turned to me and said \u201cYou know what? I have never really noticed any sort of bad smell coming off you, that is kind of weird!\u201d Made my week lol Damn bro. Would you say diet plays the biggest part for reducing the odor? What kind of supplements do you take? Sorry for prodding. Yes diet probably plays the biggest part, because even with the supplements, if I eat fish, eggs, red meat, broccoli, cauliflower, and other triggering foods, I could still smell. Those are for the most part what I avoid. poultry and pork will give me problems if I eat a lot, but as part of one meal a day it is normally under control.\n\nThe only thing I take is copper chlorophyllin. 2x100mg pills in the morning, one at night.\n\nYes I have been tested when I was young and my family and I have been working with a specialist on it for many years now.\n\nYes a fishy smell is the only type of odor I get, aside from normal BO from sweat, etc.\n\nNo worries about prodding! This condition sucks to live with and anything I could say that would help another person with it makes me feel better. Thanks man! I have not been tested but I have all the symptoms. It began last year and it happened suddenly. I am an art teacher and my students and even my boss would say comments about a horrible foul smell. And everyone I came in contact with would hold their breath or rub their nose. I have talked to certain doctors about it and apparently they have not heard of TMAU. So... I have felt strongly with the fact that even my family say to me that I do not smell but their faces and body language and expressions do not speak the same language. I consider myself to be a fashionista and like every woman want to smell good etc. But nothing seems to help. And to make matters worse I live in an tropical island so we do not know what it is to have cold weather so I have to take showers 3 to 4 times daily if I am not working. I have not been tested either but I do believe that I have severe body odor. I am learning from listening to other people that suffer with this condition is that it is intermittent in some people.

Eventually more meats, dairy, and processed foods were introduced, leading me to have terrible constipation. I have tried different eating patterns the last 10 years and it always seems that the less tasty food, the more physical activity, hydration, and the more I could fast, were the times when my social life was doing amazing. If anyone can share their experiences, that would be lovely. I would say my current diet of junk food is doing me 0 favors with the smell, but looking to jump back to a less processed diet.

Alternative means are also high protein so u have to avoid those too like impossible burgers and such. Lots of salads.

It eliminates odors and helps temporarily. \n\n- Also if you sweat a lot driclor does help but it is not like a roll on deodorant. You have to take a bath at night dry your self completely (because it burns like a mother) and apply on the places that sweat the most. I put this on my face because I sweat alot and it stops it. You can read online, but it is a hassle to use it daily since the prep for it.\n\n- if driclor is not available, deo that is unscented. Acrivated charcoal or chlorella I have heard a few ppl had success with taking laxatives / totally emptying themselves out the day before. Def not safe to do everyday because bodies can become too dependent on them. It can take some time for the laxatives to take effect so you may want to take them early.\n\nThere was also a thread on curezone a while back that said their doctor recommended Hibiclens with their shower routine.

That Is when i started researching and come across tmau do you think ive got it? And if so how do i get a doignosis? How is your diet? If you are a heavy meat eater, dairy consumer, or if you eat eggs frequently, the fecal/sulfur odor would be a common symptom of TMAU. \n\nDoes your scent change on a vegan or vegetarian diet after 6 weeks? If you have not tried a diet change yet, go vegan for 6 weeks and report back. Avoid excess cruciferous (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, etc) and excess alliums (onion, garlic, shallots, etc). With body odor sufferers, I found out there are different categories with blurry lines:\n\n- TMAU: The guys that get especially stinky after eating eggs, meat, curry, or fish. The body does not metabolize choline like it should and produces more TMA than the non-odorous TMAO. Sometimes combined with halitosis.\n\n- SIBO/leaky gut: The guys that get worse symptoms after consuming sugars. Might also be some kind of candida issue. Either way, organisms are being fed by the sugars and their metabolic products are stinky. More often than not a fecal scent. The solution for most guys in this category is some kind of keto diet that avoids carbs at all costs - for months. Sometimes combined with halitosis.\n\n- Bromhidrosis: Odorous sweat, also increased sweating. I do not know much about this.\n\nWhat you should do in this case is observe reactions depending on what you eat and drink. Does it gets worse after drinking soda/eating candy or rather after eating broccoli or fish? Not the Best I will try it but with me not being able to smell it makes it difficult I would start there. Cut out processed food. Do not over eat. No fast food. Fruits. Veggies. Lean meats. Whole grains. Cheers i will try it There are a lot of people who suffer with this problem, including me. Please be careful doing research online because there is a huge amount of silly information which can be damaging to your health and waste your money.\n\nIt is a fact that there are multiple possible causes for this problem. Do not listen to someone who says there is one reason, because they only consider themselves. \n\nThis is complicated, and absolutely nobody has \u2018the\u2019 answer to cure this.

Different people have different cures. \n\nIt is good to listen to advice but please think first. \n\nThe best thing to do as step one is to narrow potential causes down:\n\n-Have people only said you smell like feces? Never fish? Never urine? Etc \n\n-do you have other digestive health symptoms like constipation or acid reflux or anything else? \n\n-do you sweat a lot, or only in hot weather/exercising?

I want to know if being open and honest about your condition made people understand or treat you worse ? No one believes me. Not family/doctors/ friends/colleagues... no one. Yet they always complain of a smell when I am near them. Huh. Keep your chin up. Because one of my middle school teachers one said a story about how a bathroom toilet drained the poop to the roots of a nearby tree. She said that area the tree was in stunk, IIRC. But she said it produced some of the best oranges she had tasted because the poop was like manure or nutrients for the tree. We are sort of like that tree. We are going to be something great. We had a group chat for work and I put it up why I smell ( Since hearing side comments, how every time I ran to the elevator - they would close the door or they would wait for the next one, how they cover their noses and inside jokes). They did not respond directly, we had the rare 2 people who could not smell me said that I do not.

And my dad sits away from me, when I talk they turn their face so they do not breath it in This is it. \n\nThey do not believe me, they do not smell you directly, but they sure smell something only when you are around....\n\nIt is like only in the atmosphere does it react and cause an odor after being there for a minute.\n\nWhat do you do for a fucking doctor to believe you? That is the important one.. My husband insists he has it but I dont smell him no matter how hard i try and both my parents say they do not smell him either.\nI have now noticed people grab their nose when i lean over them to look at something they are but i assume its my breath and I am paranoid about myself at this point.. but idk i think he does not have it and is just ruining our lives because I have to do literally everything alone in life including grocery shop. \nI think i am more depressed than him especially constantly making excuses as to why he never does anything with me. Every year it gets worse.\nHe wants to move to another state but i cant because id be so alone i dont think i could live anymore. But he likes to say hes going to go regardless. Idk this smelling business is for the birds.\nIf people want and invite you to be around them just do it. Life is too short. It may help a few of them understand, buy understand there is a hive mind of pack thinking, most people are not going to change their view or stop spreading gossip about your problems if the more is to laugh and mock you.

I am unable to eat breakfast or lunch on days when I am expected to go out, even for simple things like going to school or shopping for groceries. If I am expected to be at some kind of important event I usually spend a day or two fasting and drinking tons of water. I can no longer enjoy food anymore and I am severely underweight. I have always been underweight but when I started experiencing TMAU symptoms I lost 10 pounds and did not have my period for about 4-5 months, I was around 65 pounds. I think stress was also large contributer to my weight loss at the time.\n\nHow often do you guys eat? What is your diet like? Do you feel as if you are missing out on essential nutrients?", "TMAU2 cure story and reputable proof ", "I am a sufferer of Trimethylaminuria, a rare disease which makes my sweat, urine and breath stink I am a 27 year old male, and I have had the disease since I was about 7/8 years old. I could begin to see something was wrong when I went to after school swimming lessons and the other kids in the class would look nauseated at me.\n\nThe smell I have had kind of varied through my life, when I was about 7/8 the smell was musky like. When I reached about 12/13 the smell was very spicy like mixed with the smell of poop and more recently I the smell is like rotten cabbage mixed with the smell of poop.\n\nI would consider myself socially awkward, but probably the more 'normal' of sufferers, at school I was kind of lucky, I had very understanding and supportive friends, many of which I still am friends with now, and I have made many more friends during my college years and again they have been very understanding and supportive, as has my girlfriend.\n\nI have a mundane job as a cleaner in a factory, but the factory stinks so much, (it is a bacon factory) I do not think anyone has really noticed my smell.\n\nThe thing I hate the most is the smell of it on my clothes will not come out, and I feel kind of bad I cannot pass my old clothes on to charities because the smell is permanently in all my clothes I have worn. I can relate. I am pretty sure that I have TAMU, though I have no official diagnosis yet. It affects me more when I eat a heavy protein meal or do a lot of physical labor. It is very acrid and sometimes a little musky. Most of the time my body odor is salty like dry dirt and rotting onions, a few times it is very buttery and like kettle popcorn, at my worst it is like very concentrated cat urine. Does the stink permanently stay in any of your clothes worn? Do your friends know about your condition? Or everyone just pretend everything is normal and do not talk about it? Yes they do, but they just do things with me like everything's normal. How do you tell them about the condition? I do not know when and how to inform people. When I meet anyone new, apart from that we kind of do not talk about it much. I tell anyone new I become friends with or meet to look up the condition on Google and they say nothing else about it. Yes. And it gets reactivated everytime I sweat and is almost impossible to get out. Are most people ok with it? Or you do not hear back from most of them after the first meeting? \n\nMay I know how bad is your smell? Is it room filling? They are, and most I do hear back from after the first meeting. :)\n\nThe smell is room filling, people have been able to smell me from across the road, I was told at college the smells so bad one of the classrooms I used to sit in, they have never been able to remove any of the smell, they have opened the windows, deep cleaned the room and the furniture but the room still holds my stink. This is surprising to hear. \n\nMay I know where do you live? Do you get bad remarks and reactions from strangers? New Jersey. I have not had any noticeable remarks or reactions from strangers. Good for you. Maybe you do not smell very bad anymore. YOU WANT TO READ THIS....   Sooooo I thought I had TMAU for a couple years because my lab results for various tests came back negative or normal and I did not have any other symptoms other than a foul, putrid, sweet smell that sometimes smelled like maple syrup and sometimes like ammonia. However- and this is a big \u201chowever\u201d- I found out I actually had e coli bacteria in my system. E coli has a strange smells to it. It is usually described as RANCID, PUTRID, FOUL, SWEET and like AMMONIA. It varied according to what foods I would eat or how stressed I was. If you are experiencing these smells and your blood tests have come back normal, I strongly suggest that you do an e coli culture test. I smelled horrible for 2 years! Usually e coli in the system can cause sepsis and death if it goes untreated so I am surprised that I dealt with it for so long but I am finally receiving treatment for it and the smell is finally subsiding. I was praying for a healing for a long time. Then I read that this one guy fasted for 21 days and took probiotics tablets the entire time until he was able to cleanse his gut out and then his symptoms went away. I believe that when he fasted he starved the e coli bacteria in his gut. As for me, I am currently taking Cephalexin 500 MG capsules 3 times a day, fasting and continuing with prayer and it is working. Also, you may want to see if you have BV if you have not done so already. BV produces a FISHY odor. I was informed by my doctor that both could take up to 3 treatments over the span of 3 months to get rid of completely because the treatments only kill up to 70% of the bacteria each time. Both the E coli and BV treatments are not to be taken at the same time. So you would go one week with one treatment and another week or two with the other. Let me just say that Dr. Diana Yan in Gaithersburg, MD, USA was the only doctor out of the 9 doctors I met with over the past two years to inform me in detail what my treatment was, what caused the rotten smell that my body was producing and how the different bacteria react to their treatments. I am so thankful for her. What if TMAU is just e coli in people with strong immune systems? I hope you all find this information to be helpful.\n\nFYI, the smell is almost completely gone and I am only half way through my first treatment. Instead of a 10 I would say that I am at about a 4 right now. Yesterday I was at about a 7 on the smellometer (self diagnosis..lol) I noticed that the smell improves overnight. I think I have it as well. Mine is a mixture of onions and a trash dumpster on a summer day. It did not start til I was 30 and has ruined my self confidence. I am cured of it! I had it for two years. I prayed to God and he answered my prayers. After going to 9 doctors and having this condition cause an issue at work and social environments, I can say I am finally healed.\nI went to a doctor who told me I had e-coli that was causing the rotten smell. The doctor said that it would take about 3 months for me to be healed. I started taking antibiotics for 2 weeks, completed a diet with mostly sauerkraut, kefir milk(it is sour), probiotics, ginger tea, hardly any sugar, prayed about it so much, had worst days then better ones, tried to eat only the items listed above so that it could have the best effect and, thank God, the smell is completely gone. Today I have been 3 days without a case. I have eaten eggs, beef and other foods and I have no odor. I smell clean. I did this for approximately 3 weeks. I pray that you are healed, too. \n\n-I drank Kefir milk from Lifeway/Maple Hill- it is supposed to taste sour. (2-3 bottles/day)\n-saurkraut about 11oz a day (this helped dramatically)\n-probiotics for bv and e-coli( 1 week each -never take them together)\n-ginger and lemon tea \n-probiotic and oregano oil capsules \n-plenty\n-one regular meal a day\n\n-I brush my teeth with Tom\u2019s fennel tooth paste to remove the sour milk smell from my breath. This works better than mint. \n\nI started on this on 8/3/20 and am on 8/26/20 without symptoms. I have been 3 days (give and take some hours) without them.\n\n-Prayer and trust in God was so helpful in this time. Do not forget about God so that He heals you.\n\n\nBlessings to you!!!", "Question about medication Anyones odor get worse after medication, specifically like benadryl?

If you smelled bad, they would have been making these jokes already surely? But if they have just started after finding your account and they think it is a bit of a laugh, they may think you are just being paranoid cos you do not actually smell?

This would be amazing. To finally get rid of the stigma, my thoughts are about the pricing. If it is expensive in the states, I will go to Canada buy it cheap and resell it to our fellow sufferers in cheaper price than the cost stateside. What they did to insulin was ridiculous what more for this What about fecal odors? I can see this helping a ton, but when tmau sufferers take drugs/ciggerettes/presciption pills it makes us smell. im guessing this pill will not help for that ? as its only targeting the tma to be produced.  the main cure would be curing the default fm03 enzyme. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut then again would deleting all TMA ,give the fm03 enough efficiency to be able to give us the freedom we want .

I am not sure if I have TMAU because everything I have read says its a genetic disorder youre born with and would notice throughout life.  The fishy smell is usually at the end of a bowel movement, and is bright yellow liquid. Doctors have prescribed me Flagyl antibiotic, I still get the yellow liquid but the smell is not their. I am afraid when the prescriptions gone I am going to be back to a fish smell.  I do not have bad BO or smell fish from my hands/feet.

TMAU2 is the secondary non genetic version does that mean TMAU2 can be cured?  like a bug/virus That I cannot say, everyone is different.  Treatment means avoiding triggers, taking herbs, supplements etc.  Have you joined rareconnect for TMAU or badbreathhalitosis.com? TMAU2 can be related to liver dysfunction, gallbladder issues, IBS, chronic constipation, incomplete evacuation, poor digestion, candida, SIBO or SIFO, a clogged colon etc.  Many people have been able to treat but not cure it meaning if they eat trigger foods or stop taking herbal or medical treatment it can come back.  \n\nI  have lots of ideas for treatment if you want I can share.

Hi, I like others on here have suffered from what I think is TMAU for almost three years now. It all started when I was 16 and still in high school. Nobody was outwardly saying it, however I would overhear small comments. Till this day, I still do not know if those comments were  about me or not, as I have asked some of my closest friends and they all looked at me crazy and said that I do not smell at all. I would like to know if a yeast infection/bacterial vaginosis could cause such a strong odor. I have been dealing with yeast infections/BV since I was a child, and did not see a gynecologist until this year actually. All because of embarrassment. I went and they did a test on me, however they said it was nothing wrong. I can literally smell it, and sometimes its so bad i can smell it just by standing naked alone, which i noticed yesterday right before taking a shower. It is like a moldy, cheesy smell. Could this be the culprit? The only way to know for sure is get tested by your doctor. Like ASAP. get tested for BV/yeast infection again? I do not know much about BV, but try your very best to seek the treatment you want despite embarrassment. Well done for plucking up the courage to go to the doctor. \n\nIt may help if you can work out does the odor come only from the vagina or from all over the body generally. This is probably quite difficult to determine- but if you do discover which way round it is- this would likely help work things out. \n\nOdor issues are very embarrassing and distressing, but hiding from your doctor will not help. Sorry this is generic advice, but stay strong and be proactive in your quest for good health. Doing nothing and praying will get you nowhere. Best of luck! :) im pretty sure the odor is from my vagina. The odor down there is definitely different than my regular BO which is mostly a sweaty smell as I sweat a lot naturally. I will definitely be contacting my doctor again, I cannot go around like this, its unacceptable. If it is definitely from the vagina then it seems less likely to be TMAU, because TMAU smell is excreted through saliva, all skin, breath, sweat and vaginal fluid- essentially everywhere. \n\nSo if you do not get this smell from your skin, mouth etc then it is unlikely to be TMAU in my opinion, based on the above reasoning. That is surely good news Hey if you want, msg in private. I also experience similar symptoms. I never had BV but after sweating down there I could  swear I had it. My underarms sweat smells like regular BO. The back of my head smells like beer, and my Vag smells like beer/bv as well after walking. My breath is dry mouth smell. Ive noticed I smell more the more \"wet\" I am. So If i had just came out of the shower and am I damp, I smell, specially my hair. To me it signals that I am creating a nice lil environment for whatever microbes or fungi. It might not be TMAU but I havent ruled it out. \n\nI am getting tested for SIBO/SIFO. One time I was on antibiotics and the smell of my mouth went away but came back when I stopped treatment. In the meantime,  you can buy boric acid suppositories, insert it, and \"close it\" with a tampon and scented pad. I dont think you have tmau but def some microbial fuckery. Male, similar smell. Might be \"normal\" skin bacteria that causes odor along with diet.\n\nMy close family and friends say I do not smell as well, so it could be you are oversensitive to your own smell because you can recognize it like a bloodhound after they smell someone is clothes.\n\nAnyways, if it is microbes of some kind, there are soaps that *might* help.\n\nSummer's eve might for you. \nVinegar might help remove the smell temporary, dilute it of course.\nCharcoal soap works to some extent for me.\n\nSometimes dry skin can cause irritation and certain bacteria so moisturizing wash in the end might help on your final wash. \n\nHibiclens has active antimicrobials that they use prior to surgery BUT it states to not use on genital area.\n\nLastly, there is nizoral, anti dandruff shampoo that has antifungal active ingredient.\n\nYou might have to try stuff for a week before you notice anything, besides the vinegar, this you can do a quick diluted rinse and it will temporarily remove skin odors, might take a couple of times. I do not recommend long term use of vinegar as it might have issue.\n\nAlso, shaving helps prevent bacteria, odors, and build up of odor compounds that stick to hair But many people cannot smell their own TMAU.  If you had a yeast infection a round if meds would solve it. Do you get reactions from people when you talk? Yes, most people cannot smell their TMAU, so if OP can smell the odor then it is less likely to be TMAU is not it.\n\nI do not get reactions from talking specifically, just from personal proximity. Some people suffer breath worse than body odor and should consider other reasons behind it.\n\nNot sure if you were asking me or OP", "TMAU questions I have. Primarily type 2 people. 1 - can you smell yourself?\nIf you cannot do you notice a smell say after spending a few hours in your room, or when you come home? Is there any distinct smell even if you cannot make it out as feces/fish/urine etc.\n\n2 - are your reactions consistent through all seasons? \n\n3 - are there days where you do not smell? (People get close to you/no faces) \n\n4 - do you have constipation or diarrhea &amp; if you do, do you notice a correlation with treating those symptoms resulting in reduced odor? \n\n5 - can your family/friends smell you?\n\n6 - what was your pre TMAU 2 diet like? I think I am type 2.\nI have never been able to smell myself. If I work out, then I just smell of sweat, which makes sense. My family claims that I do not smell but it could just be lies. I feel like they lie, to not hurt my feelings. But if I am asking, I want to know the truth. I developed this odd condition when I moved to NYC 3 years ago. Even though I walked a shitload, I still drank a lot of alcohol, ate a lot of junk, pizza &amp; fried foods, coffee every morning. So I am sure that is what did me in. Since you cannot smell yourself do you notice days where people do not react at all? Say days where people willingly come into your personal space? \n\nDo you get more reactions in the summer time or is it pretty constant? \n\nMy reactions have been so inconsistent there is days where people will stand shoulder to shoulder with me, sit next to me &amp; others where they will avoid me. \n\nI wish I could smell myself (if I do smell) not being able to detect if what I am doing is working or not is draining. There is probably been a few times out of the month that I do not get any reactions. Like people would come up for hugs, or in stores people would have lengthy conversations with me. \n\nSo in NY the winter time was not bad, the cold weather really helps because people\u2019s noses are usually frozen. Lol But now that I came back home to FL, it is hot all the time. So I sweat quite often. Which sucks... just walking to the car, I am sweating lol so i try to avoid outside events as much as I can.\nI understand you completely, not knowing makes it harder for us. We do not know if anything is working, what is triggering, what exactly do I smell like, etc. like do I smell like musk, poop, gas, fish???. I have no clue. I think alcohol did it to me as well.\n\nIn school I p\\[probably showered once per week and never heard any sort of comments that I smell (and if it is one place you would hear you smell it is school)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt really seemed to have happened when I spent a summer on the Greek Islands. I was eating shit and getting shit faced drunk every night. I have heard that liver damage can cause TMAU2. I think I have damaged my body beyond repair even though I have gotten my liver tested a few times with nothing wrong apparently. 1. I cannot, but, I think I can sometimes randomly but it happens so rarely that I am not sure how or why  \n\n2 . Yes \n\n3.  No \n\n4. Yeah I do have diarrhea, but it is probably because I am lactose intolerant so if I stay off that I am usually fine and no I does not make a difference I think \n\n5. Yes, but they always say they cannot but I for sure know they can \n\n6. A lot processed food and carbs like pasta and bread", "Blocked nose Do any of you also have chronic sinus congestion? I guess from being around tma particles that can irritate nasal airways? \n\nRegards\nStay strong Hmm I am going through that now. Did not think it was tma related. Shit. try oregano oil. look up chronic sinus infection videos with Dr Berg. He will give you all the answers you need. I had it. No idea how since I do not have allergies but... A couple months of a nasal allergy spray (Flonase) cleared it up for me. It has not come back yet. It feels like my breath is a lot better with it gone too Thx Am ;) hope youre doing well Hope you are doing well too! I am alright atm but will be going on a flight in a few weeks against my will... Will be a real test...", "I got ya homie! ", "ORS or TMAU!?! HELP Ok sooo I have been thinking of seeing a doctor about whether I have Tmau or if it is just all in my head. I have noticed sometimes that people put thier finger to thier nose when near me or walking past me or sniffle however there is some people that are near me and seem completely fine!?! I have pretty good hygiene . I shower everyday and brush my teeth two times a day..etc. The thing that has me in denial is that at work people never say anything to me about me smelling or make fun of me or complain about me smelling. My friends never have told me I smelled bad before and some people just talk to me up close without ever touching thier noses or sniffling but then some people react the opposite and sniffle or touch thier noses near me .... I am just so confused. People are usually nice to me and say I am cool and a fun person to be around. I have never have anyone react horribly around me tho  or say mean things about it smelling . Maybe it is all in my head!?! Patm or tmau2 or maybe ORS or maybe extremely mild TMAU It is hard. I am afraid to say a doctor will not help you much in deciding if you have TMAU or ORS. There is not an easily accessible test to my knowledge that diagnoses ORS. The test for TMAU is very poor/ inaccurate. \n\nThe doctor will just have a conversation with you and try to help you decide whether the smell is real or not. Most people with TMAU find that their doctor convinces them there is no smell, because the doctor cannot smell anything in that moment. \n\nAn issue is that odor can be transient. So you may smell at 2pm but not 5pm for example. \n\nThe best thing to do is write down super specific examples of times you have evidence you smell bad and analyse them logically \n\nI am afraid a doctor will not help much here my friend. I sympathise because I k ow for a fact I smell/ have smelled in the past and a senior doctor has told me I am imagining it I do not think that would help my situation either bc someone passes me and maybe sniffles or nose to finger for a sec but the next few minutes ppl seem to not be bothered at all and are friendly and talk to me normally and do not have any reaction at all to me. They do not try to avoid me or walk away quickly . I work at Walmart and I am always around ppl most of my day assisting costumers or doing other tasks and some ppl do not react at all while maybe one or two ppl do when near me .  Definitely sounds more like ORS or PATM I use to be like that but then I realized I use to MUCH deodorant and perfume thinking it will help mask odor ( I thought I had tmau) and everyone will sniffle their noses then I started reducing everything I use for instance swiping deodorant 2-3 times each arm-bit ( before I used to do 6 or more) and perfumes just on my neck and then never had issues with people. My advice will be try using everything less. Hope it work for you. Omg!!! Maybe it is my perfume! I tend to buy high end perfumes like Chanel and Dior and with that being said the scent stays  mostly all day long. I also remember a few days ago my grandma made a comment that sometimes my perfume make her nauseated sometimes and makes her head hurt. She said it in a joking way but I did not ever think of it until now!! I usually spray 5-8times before heading out to work and I carry a small mini perfume and sprayed it a few times throughout the day to see if ppl would stop reacting but omggg maybe it is bc I am using too much perfume LMAOOO Well all the doctor is going to do is ask why you think you smell then for you to give him/her some examples \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Perfume makes the smell worse I use scented powder and teacher just say like why the room smell like musty mix with perfume. I do not know I would keep talking to a doctor about it because mine started off with a few people looking once in a while and a month later it is back happening all the time. I talk to my doctor took stool tests, all came up negative. I am feeling hopeless People touch their noses, cough, and sniff when they feel awkward or uncomfortable. I want to say unless someone gives you a very clear reaction (like telling you to your face you smell, or someone behind you says something &amp; they are not too far away to hear etc) to ignore it. Even though it is really hard. \n\nThe paranoia and want to be reassured if there is an odor can make us misunderstand small gestures.\n\nI am leaning that you do not smell if your friends say you DID in the past and keep inviting you to parties. If they smelled the odor before they can reassure you if it is still present too.\n\nThe only ones who can 100% determine if you have ORS are mental health workers. Omg this is probably it OP! I use Chanel perfume too and the smell from one spray will remain on my coats FOR DAYS... 5 or 8 is way too much! I am really betting this is it. So it is not a bad odor just too much perfume. Even mental health workers are underqualified to deal with this. But I agree mostly. \ud83d\ude09 If people do not say, \"what is that smell or I smell feces/poop/fart/fish/garbage\" whatever, it is likely not you.\n\nIf you hang out with people and they do not say this, then it likely is not you.\n\nEspecially if you have not smelled it yourself.\n\nPATM seems in the realm of pseudoscience and science. It is too abstract and unknown and inconsistent it seems to be a real diagnosis.\n\nIt could just be people are sensitive to certain deodorants or chemical residue around you, IF that is why they are covering their nose or putting their hands in their face for.\n\nAlso, what do you mean putting their finger to their nose, like they are sniffing their finger? Or literally pinching their nose to prevent inhalation of the environment. Usually when people smell u sometimes they pinch their nose with the mask and runaway.", "Were you ever able to smell yourself at first? Maybe i do but I am not sure. I made a thread on another account about how i did not wash myself when I had diarrhea...maybe that is the smell others smelled or maybe it is not. Or maybe the chemical responsible was sort of nose minding you at lower levels but it was not at levels high enough to be noticed by others.\n\nI mean have you actually purchased the chemical indole and noticed whether it smells like your poop? Obviously do not try to smell your poop, you might get it in your nise.\n\nAnyways on an unrelated topic, maybe TMAu is sort of a blessing for others in the times of covid, ie maybe it forces you to sort of socially distance, i do not know. It has downsides obviously i know from personal experience. Also, we is not TMAu most frequent in Blacks? Maybe it is due to the inequality, etc they face. I mean it is either caused by genetic or environmental factors. \n\nMaybe even spiritual or supernatural factors, in my case. I used to have reactions far away but now realized they are voices. I did not hear voices and now i do, i wonder what is next. I am a little scared.\n\nI am a mestizo - dark skinned Hispanic fwd and light skin bed Hispanic mom. Did not the first PATM study come from Japan?  I wonder if PATM is more common among Japanese? Hi my friend, it sounds like you are having a difficult time and I want to help clear things up for you. \n\nNobody knows for sure why we cannot smell ourselves. A good theory is that we are so used to the smell then we cannot smell it anymore. E.g. if you put aftershave on, you stop smelling jt after a few minutes, but people you speak to can notice it strongly. This is just an idea, not proven. \n\nThe two chemicals that make fecal smell in the body are indole and skatole. This is an established biochemical fact. There is no point trying to buy indole to check what it smells like. Further, indole can smell nice in low concentrations and mixed with certain other chemicals. Per Wikipedia. \n\nI have not heard of any scientific study that says black people are more likely to be affected by TMAU. That may or may not be the case, so I will not speculate, but I have not heard anything reliable. Likewise, just because the first PATM study may have come from Japan, it does not necessarily mean Japanese people are more likely to get PATM. In any case, I would forget worrying about race as even if it does have an effect there is nothing you can do. \n\nTMAU can be caused entirely by genes, no matter your lifestyle. This is rare. Or your genes can just make you more likely to get TMAU and your lifestyle gives the final push to give you TMAU. This seems most common. Or your genes can have no effect at all and it is entirely your lifestyles fault. \n\nI am really worried about you hearing voices. This is not a direct TMAU symptom. It is a symptom of mental health issues (which TMAU likely did contribute to). Please speak to a doctor/ therapist as soon as possible about the voices. \n\nGood luck I know about noseblindness. That is what I meant in my first paragraph. I know TMAu 1 is genetic but what about FBO and the other odor diseases. Also i do not think indole and skatole are the only chemicals responsible for poop smell. It is like how dog poo, human poo, horse poo, etc. Mell different. Likewise, poo can be different colors too - brown, black, green, red, etc and shades and hues. One stool sample will have millions of chemicals. Someone else's may have a different assortment of chemicals. I remember the first day I started smelling bad\nI got sick in the summer of 8th grade and felt Terrible I was on the floor and could not barely move\n\nThen when I got well enough to move I noticed I smelled terrible and ever since \n\nI even know it is one part of my body that smells bad Im half Japanese and my ancestors never have this tmau or patm disease im sure mine is from gut disease. Tbh I cant smell myself most of the time the only way to smell is to rub your fingers to your groins and anus area then smell. Or you can just smell ur fingernails it will have a distinct smell from there. You can smell your self by tma passing/cloging up in the nose What? Tma or choline get stuck in the nose and attaches its self to over smells rubbing your nose fixes it tho I do not think you should smell your fingers if they are dirty. Your poop may have diseases or worms which i think may go into your brain if you sniff. Worms may be why I am having hallucinations. No bro I wash my things all the time its clean. The smell is from sweat. Sorry to reply twice, but hered where i heard about Africans and FOS:\n\nA Review of Trimethylaminuria: (Fish Odor Syndrome \n\n\n\n&gt;Cases have been reported from nearly all parts of the world and in both sexes, although it seems that females, particularly those of African descent, may be over-represented.5,6\n\n\nI also noticed many in The Gut War discord and other discords are Black.", "Need help! Thinking about buying Mildronate, my friends mom is in the hospital and I am realizing it will not be long before I have to leave the house. Activated charcoal is made me slightly constipated today. Could someone help me with what the food triggers were when they took it(the mildronate)? I googled Mildronate and it seems to be a performance enhancing drug banned by anti-doping agencies. Why are you thinking of taking this?\n\nCharcoal can cause constipation. Try to drink more water (until your urine is nearly clear) and do not take too much charcoal at once. \n\nHave some high fibre food. 30g of fibre a day. Spread out through the day. If you take 30g of fibre at once it can constipate you. \n\nPersonal advice based on my experience- do not experiment with a new food or supplement before having to leave the house. Concentrate on getting the simple things right like low stress, drinking plenty of water and trying to get a good bowel movement passed Yeah I would not recommend taking unapproved drugs without doctors approval, seems like something that might have adverse side affects. \n\nAccording to the charcoal study, taking charcoal has fairly immediate effects, but does not last long after you stop taking it. Copper chlorophyll has longer lasting effects if you can find it:\n\n\n\nBoth do have other adverse effects on the digestive system though, they both do not just affect tma. So taking charcoal is good if you are going out, but if you are taking a few days at home it might be better to give your gut a rest and let it digest normally?\n\nFrom the best paper:  - \"One of the major drawbacks of sequestering agents is their non-specific mechanism of action, which could result in the capture of other metabolites in addition to the target\u00a0.\"", "Hi Hi I just wanted to share something with you tmau sufferers.

But I wanted to let you know that even though tmau may be temporary in this life, hell is not . I beg you guys to believe in God and believe that Jesus died for your sins so you do not go to hell. I know how hard it is to live with tmau but imagine after you die you go to hell and suffer more forever.

Yes you just have to work on yourself Yes, improve your diet, take activated charcoal and chlorophyll after meals, use dove soap, and use baking soda(not with bleach) in your laundry.

Right now im drinking kombucha and trying a better diet *Fingers crossed* but iknow it will not do much because Nothing f works.. And Showers just seem to make it worse too? haha f*ck this. \ud83d\ude44\n\nWell my prayers goes out to all of you who are dealing with this, Much love you all.\u2764 Which diet are you on? i dont know how you have lived with it for so many years I know its hard.

Mine officially started at 18, and I am 30 now, so we are on the same page. \n\nIf you like, I can send you some cards I made that explain what TMAU is, and you can pass them out at work if you want. Send me a pm if you are interested. Do not give up it is going to take time to improve on diet do not let  the reactions keep u from getting your working it is hard but we just have to just keep pushing stay on a clean diet work out and look into taking burdock root it cleans the blood do your research I am going to start taking it to help condition I am 30 been living with it for a while as well u just keep pushing through people reactions and ignore them Hey OP how did work go? Hope things went better than expected Hey! Yes it went pretty well! But it is my first two days at work and I have been fasting alot..If I have a total bowel cleanse before i go to work it reduce the \"smell\" by alot ... But I got one comment by one of the kids that it smells like shit in the Classroom i pretend just like nothing, Trying to stay positive even tho it hurts. Ok Thanks! I Will let you know in the future if I need them let us hope not! Much love. Chlorella and charcoal makes my stomach go crazy for some reason.. Have you tried kombucha? We live on hope pretty much.. Maybe There is a Light at the end of the tunnel. But yeah trying to not give a fu*k helps alot but it can be Hard. That is great! It is so good that you found a way to lessen the odor. That trick works for me too, the only time it does not work is when I am menstruating for some reason \ud83d\ude14\n\nI hope everything keeps going well for you at work. \n\nOn the classroom, I am sorry that that kid made a rude comment. That sucks to hear especially if the last few days went well. It does not erase your progress though! Maybe some gas escaped at that time?? It does not mean your natural body odor smells like that. If it is your own classroom I wonder if they will let you sneak in an air purifier (and hide under the desk)? It might help give you some peace of mind and anxiety down. No but I did oregano first but its harsh kills everything.\n\nAfter that milk kefir and water kefir.\nBut milk kefir only on weekends because it did make my smell worse.\n\nAll dairy does actually. I have been dealing with this for 2 years and I am thinking about ending my life soon tbh cause nobody can help me Iknow what you mean..

I was on the diet for maybe 2 months then I got depressed and lonely and I have been home ever since, I eat really bad but I am not overweight and I have always had gas problems since I was a baby and i had my stomach pumped when I was 6.        I have also tried wipes, powders, cologne etc but nothing works It started around the same age for me maybe like when i was around 15-16 it is very odd ..Can you smell yourself? I cannot ..never could. And when you was on a diet for 2 months did you notice anything different? \n\nOh yeah trying to mask up the smell with cologne,deo,hair spray/gel, certain shampoos etc makes it worse like it intensefies the smell for me atleast. But If you feel down and need someone to talk to im here for ya maybe we can help each other\ud83d\udc4d Yeah I cannot smell myself either, and when I went on a diet I felt better but people could still smell me. Thanks for replying tho and if you ever need to talk I am here for you too, oh yeah and btw how far could people smell you? Is not it weird how we can smell everything else but not ourselfs? It makes you go crazy.. it is different sometimes they smell or react to me across the Street lol and sometimes they have to be next to me or really close hbu? and thanks! When I was working as a lifeguard at a water park I would be standing about 30 ft away on the other side of the pool and people could still smell me it was insane.

I am tired of treatments that do not work, of barricading myself in my room and watching life pass me by. I cry almost everyday when I think about where I could have been in life, and hearing my neighbors and sometimes my own father talking shit about me to our family over the phone. I am tired of people not believing this condition is real and branding me \"lazy\" because I cannot find work, and \"nasty\" because they just assume that I have terrible hygiene. Whenever I go to the laundromat or the supermarket, the clerk disinfects everything that I touch. People treat me like I have the plague. \n\nMy \"friends\" call me to gossip or brag about how good their life is, how much money they make, what they bought and fun outings but when I need support NOBODY is there. My mother is sick in the hospital with pneumonia and COVID and even though I am worried sick about her, I feel guilty for holding a grudge against her because she was also one of those who told my business to her side of the family and emotionally abused me about this condition, calling me dramatic whenever I reached out for support, and guilt tripped me because I broke our tradition and could not go out to dinner and celebrate Easter with the family (even though I asked her to come by so I can cook her favorite meal but she declined and chose to go into work). \n\nMy father complains that he cannot go on vacations and party and travel, (he wanted to spend last christmas in florida alone but he decided to stay and got called into work so I spent it alone anyway. My mother had to work as well) and he hints that I am the reason why he has to miss out on things. The thing is, I understand why they feel that way, because nobody would be happy if their 22 year old daughter is in her room every day smelling up the house and wasting her life away. I just feel like a burden and a mistake. Sometimes I think about ending it all but the only things stopping me is the fear of the unknown, and what would happen to my cat if I left. He is the only one that still treats me with love. Sorry for the negarive energy but I had to get it out somehow.

Taking some sort of meds like Adderall to help you study and get good grades so you can get your degree is a great idea.\n\nwith Good grades scholarships will come that will allow you to move out if you want to or just use left over school money to try out new things like vitamins, supplements or jsut treat yourself to a movie or something nice every so often.\n\ni have seen some really good suggestions on how to help this condition and i have some of my own so feel free to ask me about them at anytime.\n\nhang in there and remember im always here i literally spend all day on reddit Thank you!! This really means a lot. \u2764 I am definitely in a very similar situation. \n\nDo what is best for YOU. Just double down on what you think is the best way of getting your own place. School or whatever it is.\n\nI did the same thing honestly. I was in my last year of college when this happened to me and I had to try to muscle up the courage to get to class everyday but I just put headphones in and did my studies and graduated. Try to find something you will be able to do remotely that was my mistake. My career path does not offer anything online so I have to force myself to get up for work even tho I get harassed and made fun of. \n\nPlease do not think that you are alone in this. Please message me if you need. You are not alone. We share your suffering. It seems to me though your dad is looking for a scapegoat for his shortcomings. \n\nTake away that power and do you. It is hard and it feels guilty but you can lessen contact (not cut off completely) and focus on you. My mom and dad would have functions where they bring family, they brought my sister and brother - but would leave me. They did a lot of things like take my female cousin over their own child to outings\n\nWhen we have TMAU we try nearly everything that we read online, anything that can help. Apple cider vinegar, baking soda, Eaton certain diets, supplements and etc. But you focus on you. Pick up yoga, working with animals, build dioramas, sew, baking, recycle and turn that into cash.\n\n\nYou build your world up. There are really bad days but it is worse with family or close friends who remind you or add to negatively. So sorry to hear about you getting harrassed at work. I get that it is natural to detest a bad smell but for someone to go out of their way to belittle or insult someone is just doing too much. On a positive note, I am proud of you for persevering and graduating! Your courage is admirable. \u2764 I know I am not alone, I am sorry I sounded selfish. It is one of those days when you feel like all you have is yourself, even if it is not true. Even though my dad refuses to even acknowledge it, I am to blame for not taking care of my health and eating too much junk. I started eating things I did not before, like a lot of beef, salmon, broccoli and potatoes etc. and probably destroyed my microbiome or set off the tmau that was already there. I beat it once and took it for granted....\n\nIt is a shame your family is doing you like that.  There is no way in hell they were unaware of how tactless that shit is. Situations like this always reveal how people really feel about us. Sending you love and light. \u2764 Oh yo you are not selfish. Just wanted you to know we are here for you. All though virtual, please keep living on for your cat and peeps who do care for you. We are def more than our smell. \n\nKeepsafe okay? How did you beat it? I am struggling with my biome too and went back to water kefir Went  to a clinic and they did blood work (I was not comfortable doing a urine sample, it was shark week \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02) the results said I had high triglycerides (sugar) in my blood and LDL.(fat/bad cholesterol) I was advised to change my diet, and get therapy because they did not believe the odor (despite the fact several patients told me I smelled like shit/fish) so I cut out red meat, fried foods, dairy, cabbage, broccoli, sugary snacks/drinks and exercised vigorously for 60 minutes, 2x a day, on the days my parents went to work. I sometimes took a walk early in the morning or at night when I knew not many people would be around. Eventually I lost 40 lbs and still kept up the diet after I noticed people did not react to me anymore. Then my family moved to my grandparents home (they passed away) and I guess the trauma from not grieving properly and then having to be here reliving bad memories set it off again. I used chlorophyll for a while it seemed to work but gave me bad stomach cramps. Going to try out the b2 vitamins tomorrow, and kefir to see how it goes. Yes, agreed it is a little over board to make someone feel less than. \n\nThis illness does not take lightly to ones self esteem. I wish there was a helpline or even a foundation that focused how helping sufferers through this. It really takes a toll ones mental health. \n\nSometimes it is hard to stay strong all the time. Yooo! That is discipline with the food, hella proud of you. It is hard to give up, I could not. Def agree with the workouts helped a ton. \n\n\nI have done workouts,blending veggies and fruits, kefir, and riboflavin. It took 3 months but it lessened dramatically.  Had sinuses so used a homemade netipot out of a sanitized water bottle.\n\nHope you well and good vibes yo! Keepsafe Likewise. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc Do you have it since birth? If you got it later in life home made kefir and kombucha can really really help the condition. Keep us posted. I think chlorophyll always helps. I did not have it since birth. It started in 2018.", "TMAU (Part 2)  Preface: Hello, this is a journey I am going to embark on, this platform will serve as a therapeutic attempt at extrapolating everything on my mind and putting it somewhere, I do not know how many parts I will put out but I will know when I know. Thank you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished high school I knew I wanted to continue my education even after all the torment received through out the years, I did not think my journey was over. Since I did not do too hot on my SATs, I needed to go to community college  in Miami. I entered college and I told myself this will be a new chapter in my life. This is a consistent theme with me, I will pick myself up from all the emotional baggage only to feel defeated, it was a cycle. This one seemed to stick, I managed to maintain 3.8 gpa in college while also doing around 50 voluntary hours and also having some time to enjoy going to local art museums. I wanted to go to medical school, many professors were pleased with me, I immersed my self in every class wether it was philosophy or organic chemistry. I took on the \"languages\" each subject spoke in. Each subject saw the world in a different way. It was a beautiful time. The voice inside my head that constantly spoke \"You stink therefore you cannot enjoy yourself, think of what others are saying\" still creeped up on me but it was less adubile. At the beginning of my college education, I managed to get a job. Not just any job but a job that dealt with scents. This place is famous for environmentally friendly soaps and potions. This place rhymed with Tush. I told myself how could I possibly stink if I managed to get a job were body odor will not be tolerated. That or whatever symptoms I had, had dissipated. I managed to get pass two interviews and two weeks of training and there were NO FUCKING comments, I was on top of the world. I told myself that I will be able to fucking meet my goals and live a painstakingly average live. I longed for an average life. After three weeks of working there the voice in my head got louder and told me I should quit because I do not deserve this job and everyone can still smell me. I quit the job. Life as a college student continued. On the weekends I would visit Miami's art district which was a gentrified warehouse community filled with murals, called Wynwood. I was not restricted by dietary conditions as what TMAU sufferers uphold themselves to but a close friend of mine and me started to submerge ourselves into the vegan diet. We did not want to participate in the cruelty which was the meat and dairy business. We are moral agents after all. I weened myself off cruelty products like milk. Milk before that was a big component in my life as I grew up drinking dark potent coffee with a splash of milk.  Hey if you do not mind me asking, how do you know you have tmau? And do you feel it effected your social life in college?\n\nI know for me it makes life so hard sometines Hey, thank you for your question. I know I have TMAU because over the years I have received the same comments relating the \"fart\" scent and it can not be coincidences. I have gathered that maybe there are periods in my life that the TMAU goes through cycles of \"waxing and waning\" or coming and going. I basically have no social life in college. I feel ya when you say it is hard. Have you found a creative outlet such as reading, painting, writing, sports and etc?? I write a lot and tend to keep myself busy with new hobbies. It is just hard when everyone always gives you the \u201cstink eye\u201d. I just try to ignore it. i cannot help but feel I am losing all the \u201ccollege memories\u201d people seem to have I like that you have hobbies! What type of writing do you appreciate? Also do not adhere to the notion that you need specific memories at certain points in your life, instead live every day with awareness in itself.  I really like poetry as cheesy as it is. \nDo you enjoy writing?  It are not cheesy lol. I do not write habitually but I recently started and I actually enjoy it. I am glad! It helps me sort out how I feel.\n\nI also find cooking to help. It also prevents me from eating junk food which is not good for me", "How tf do I smell this bad My professor literally went around my group and sniffed around me 5 times and used a trashcan to keep the door open wide. Horrible idiotic professor. May be intelligent academically but not in the real world. I know how it feels too. Sending love. Keep searching for a cure, do not give up x I have got a similar story but instead of school, it was work. Manager had to open the door of the tiny conference room all the while saying, \"do ya'll smell that?\" Needless to say, I did not stay one more week in that well paid job. I am sure a cure will come to surface. Try to keep your head up high because it is out of your control. You are not alone. Try the milk kefir route. Get chlorella, activated charcoal for immediate help.\n\nCheck out the gut war on youtube. \nSeek some spiritual strength coz it sure as hell aint easy. I smelled so bad once that this one kid asked to be excused from the class cause he could not handle my smell (he did leave). Forntualy, I think I do not smell that bad anymore. Well, I still smell bad but not as bad as I used to.\n\nYou should start thinking about your future if you cannot get rid of TMAU. Not to bum you out but there are people who have had TMAU for 20+ years (I have only had it for 3 years). Maybe try practicing front-end development (coding) so that you can get a well-paid online job.\n\nThis is what I use.\n\n(\n\n\\#NotSponsored Do the charcoal and chlorella really help? Like, have you seen actual improvements? Yeah it cuts my odor in half if I take it daily", "How can I be sure that I have this disorder? I started noticing a strong urine smell in the past weeks and nothing was able to help me, including 40 minute (!) showers. So I think I might have this disorder. But how can I be sure? The smell is only around my private area, nowhere else. Maybe my hygiene is bad and that is why that place smells like urine. But, again, it does not go away! (I am male, do not know if it matters). Have you been sexually active? No, I am still pretty young. Do you eat lots of asparagus? No, but is not Trimethylaminuria genetic? See a Dr. It could be UTI or something else. I am finding it near impossible to get tested for TMAU. Very few places offer diagnostics. Yes, it can be Thank you, hopefully I do not have TMAU. Fingers crossed! Can also have slight mutations. Does it occur at certain times or with foods? You have to figure If the smell get worse when you eat some foods...For example, when i eat fat foods and sugar my smell get a lot worse", "Olfactory Reference Syndrome vs TMAU I have a friend who thinks he has TMAU and follows some weird Gut War guy on YouTube. My friend is now obsessed with gut bacteria and trying to solve this odor that is clearly in his head.\n\n\nHe suffers from delusions that his feet smell. I have known him since childhood and he has had this issue since he hit puberty. Nobody else smells this odor. Even he cannot smell his odor. But he gets \"reactions\" from people in public and I can tell it causes him insane anxiety. He is tried many different \"rituals\" over the years -- fancy socks, foot washing everyday, weird products.. and most recently, following the weird ass \"Gut War\" guy on YouTube who even claims his videos are bro-science. My friend has been following him like he is a GOD for over a year now and it is annoying.\n\n\nI have offered to take him to a therapist because I am pretty sure he has \"Olfactory Reference Syndrome\", a type of OCD/Anxiety disorder that fits the bill to all of his symptoms. But the weird thing is, he is so against going to look for treatment. He claims the cure is right around the corner and does not want to seek professional help.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone here know about ORS compared to TMAU? I know TMAU is a very rare condition, and I suspect many people who have TMAU just have ORS but for some reason cannot or refuse to connect the dots.. Do you see the reactions? Other than the reactions, why does he think he smells? Tmau is real n , a member of my family has it n it is destroyed their life, as well as mine a couple of years ago I started suffering from it as well. Iono if your friend has or not, but it is possible for neither of you to detect it... n if he does have it you need to keep supporting him or if u cannot talk to his family so that he can get support from them.\n\nDoes anyone at his job complain about him giving off a stench?\n\nAlso is there anyone in his family who is known to stink?\n\nHas he done a gut test?\n\nLactobacillus May cause an odor. He could be crazy, or he could be 100% right. If you want to help that person look into both. If you spend so much time with him how do you know if you do not have  olfactory fatigue?? Can you get someone you trust that has not been around him much to hang out with you and give you an opinion? Thanks for the response. I know that TMAU is a real thing, but to me his symptoms and background are what point to ORS.\n\nNobody at his job complains about his stench. I never see these \"reactions\". Sometimes I am with him, but do not even notice. It feels like he is socially anxious and misinterpreting every little thing.. For example, one time he was moved seats in class from the front to the back of the room -- and his only thought was that it was because he smells. He complains about people rubbing their nose or sniffing and interprets it that his smell is somehow permeating his socks and sneakers and they are smelling it.\n\n\nHis family does not give off any stench. I have known them for a while and even lived with them for a while. I have never noticed any odor between his immediate or extended family.\n\n\nHe has recently done a gut test and has been obsessed about it. Recently he has been obsessed with gut health to the point where it is becoming an unhealthy obsession. For example, eating a choline free diet and drinking so much kefir that he ended up with high cholesterol when we went to the doctor.\n\n\nHis family does not seem to care and it baffles me. For one, he does not talk to them about it much. They know that he imagines this smell, but do not seem to care. \n\n\nWhat frustrates me the most is that he is unwilling to go to a psychiatrist with me, did not trust the doctor when she did not smell anything from him, but he is willing to listen to random people on YouTube.\n\n\nReasons why I think he has ORS.. He has intense social anxiety, which is one of the common traits. He has been through traumatic event as a child which is often common among ORS sufferers. His gut test said he was high in a certain bacteria that is a cause for depression, which is another common symptom. He is Korean and also has genes from Japan -- there is a disorder called \"Taijin kyofusho\" which has very similar traits to social anxiety to ORS and is bound to only Korea and Japan. Besides these reasons, he fits basically the entire portrait of an ORS sufferer.\n\n\nThis is really frustrating because he absolutely refuses any form of professional help, and honestly I am getting tired of \"supporting him\" doing his self diagnosis for over a decade now. I have tried time and time again to even set up his appointments for him and go with him just to try it out, and I do not know what else I can do because honestly I have my own life to live too. He is told me about reactions, but they feel like he is just tripping out of way too anxious. I know he is a very anxious person, especially in public.\n\n\n\nFor example, he said he was once moved from the front of the class to the back, and his theory was that it was because he smells. He is 28 years old and retells this story like he is traumatized from such a miniscule event. He talks about people who scratch their nose or have sniffles at work, and he interprets it as them thinking his feet are smelly. One bizarre one was when he said he gave a speech in front of his class (which he would probably extremely nervous about - his anxiety was probably at an all time high), and afterwards his professor said \"your feet fucking smell\" right to his face. I have a very hard time believing this and it almost seems like he hallucinated that because he was so nervous, I do not know -- imagining a professor saying this to a student in front of the class just seems very unlikely.\n\n\nSometimes I am with him and he would tell me about reactions, but I would not notice anything. Like he would say someone was sniffling and that means his feet smell, but to me I would not even notice. I am like dude.. is nobody allowed to have the sniffles around you? \n\n\nOn top of that, I feel like his mental health is getting worse. He is constantly having mood swings over miniscule things and overly emotional. On top of already being quite OCD and socially anxious. He swears that his sweat is able to permeate his socks and shoes, which to me is physically very unlikely. Many people have smelled his feet and have said they do not smell, including his physician, family, friends, and me. His feet are actually flawless lol. Ok... I hear you now... n everybody needs more solid people like you in their lives... straight up... I salute u...  10 yrs strong on this tip is a long time. N like u said the only thing that he needs to is go see a psychiatrist... maybe setting up a staged event life that he thinks could be life threatening potentially... just to get through to him n at that bring it out to him n that way n seriousness of the situation is the seriousness of the situation you just explained to me... it is a bit extreme but iono what else to suggest I know that is a dear friend of yours. Or just tell \u2018them how u feel honestly not that I think about it... exactly what you told me tell \u2018them be straight up with it. I suffer with this everyday I know someone just like that. Everything someone does she relates to her smell. Impossible to convince them otherwise no mattter what you say. He has also mentioned this. Besides family and friends never being able to smell it, he is gotten his doctor and new girl he is met to smell his feet and they both said there was no odor. In fact, his feet are flawless because he is so OCD about keeping them clean and makes me self-conscious about my own lol. It is really frustrating because I try to get my friend to go to therapy or a psychiatrist with me, but he refuses to even acknowledge that it might be a mental disorder. My friend is convinced it is his \"gut biome\" and is going bonkers with it -- paying hundreds to test his stool, not eating certain foods and avoiding certain ingredients that your body needs, etc. It really frustrates me that he gets insulted at the mention of it being a mental problem. He is been trying to come up with his own self-healing techniques for years and none of them have worked. \n\nI even pulled up several peer reviewed articles about people with the exact symptoms as him who were able to treat it well with medication, but he refuses to even try. I get not wanting to be on meds, but I am trying to help and want him to at least give it a shot. Thanks for the reply. The frustrating part is that he absolutely refuses to go and being extremely stubborn.\n\n\nIt is basically I have to support him HIS WAY. He is obsessed with the \"Gut War\" guy on YouTube and trying everything he does. It makes zero sense to me because that guy is continuing to struggle with it, so it is obviously not a cure or treatment. These pseudo treatments have been going on for over 10 years. First it was foot-baths, trying weird products on his feet, trying different types of socks, trying different types of shoes, buying new sandals every month, etc. Now he is obsessed with making his gut microbiome good, forcing all of his family and me to buy \"gut tests\" which basically seem like scams to me. It is exhausting.\n\n\nI have no idea what to do. I even offered to sign him up for a session and go with him, but he refuses. I mean, what am I supposed to do if someone just refuses help? I have been over it many times but he just gets insulted because he thinks that I am just calling him crazy. He might have ORS now, but he might also really have stinky feet. \n\nAlthough most people try to be polite, some people are blunt and might tell you you stink in your face. \n\nIt is also common for people, even doctors and families, to tell white lies. Sometimes they even react subconsciously when lying. Some people have been diagnosed with TMAU and their doctors and families said they cannot smell anything, but the sufferers' colleagues and strangers have no issue smelling them. I had something similar. How I learned that (at least some of it was in my mind) was by seeing a youtube video of someone rubbing there nose and suddenly feeling really self-conscious and horrible. Then I realized this was a video (playback of something that happened in the past where i was not even there) and it was more of an emotional reaction on my part. I DID have a smell, but I attributed every time someone rubbing their nose to my smell when some of it was there allergies. i would ask him if he suffers from any sort of social consequenses because of the tmau and iff he says yes tell him to show u the proof not because u dont believe him but want to see if its true.  \n\n\nfrom there if its real that he smells but maybe u dont smell it but everyone else does then u could just be supportive of him. Hi there, am reposting my response from another thread - I hope this helps, maybe you can share this post with him - thanks for trying to help him you are a good friend:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIf you have olfactory reference syndrome (ORS), bromidrophobia etc. or are constantly having thoughts about whether or not you smell bad, this is what you have to do (coming from someone who has had it for 10+ years and is just starting to get over it).\n\nYou have to embrace the thoughts - what I mean by that is say to yourself, \"yes, I probably reek right now! XX body part is making everyone uncomfortable\" (you can say it in a silly voice and you may find yourself laughing at the absurdity of the situation). Go one step further and say to yourself, \"I WANT to smell bad. I want people to hate me! I love it!\". Then say to yourself - \"but I also really want to enjoy this present moment\" and refocus.\n\nWhy would you do this, you ask? Because, the *resistance* is what is causing the *persistence* of intrusive thoughts. The more you try to push thoughts of whether or not you smell bad away, the more they will come back with intense frequency.\n\nIt is like, your subconscious brain thinks there is a tiger in the room and your conscious, rational brain is saying 'no there is not' and is ignoring it - causing the subconscious/primal brain to get even worse and continue to scream at you saying \"but there is a TIGER (aka threat) in the ROOM\". Once you tell your primal brain, 'yes, I recognise there is a threat, I see it' your body starts to calm down and you become less anxious. This is in line with overwhelming evidence found from CBT studies that shows exposure/acceptance = lessening of anxiety.\n\nAnother trick you can do is to expose your neck and extend your palms out. This open and vulnerable body posture signals to your brain that there is no threat and you relax. If you tuck your neck and clench your fists, you are triggering your fight or flight response.\n\nIn addition, get yourself an iontophoresis machine (I use DermaDry). This technology has been around since the 80s and is well established, safe-science. The machine stuns the sweat glands in your skin so they stop producing sweat. This move will help lessen your anxiety greatly in the interim while you practice the CBT thoughts explained above.\n\nHaving a list of affirmations on hand on your phone and practicing meditation for 30 minutes a day can also help.\n\nEventually, you want to wean yourself off safety behaviours such as checking clothes, sniffing yourself, asking others etc.\n\nGood luck - I know this condition can be very tough. Just remember to exhale and try not to resist your thoughts but rather, embrace them. (Please upvote this post so people with ORS can see it). I appreciate your comment a lot. One major problem with my friend is that he has been dead sure he has TMAU for like two years now -- I have told him many times about ORS, but he adamantly refuses he has it for some reason. It is really concerning, and to me he is really been showing a lot of signs of mental illness, and the YouTube channels like \"Gut War\" and \"Body Odor Vlog\" are just cementing his false beliefs. He refuses to give any logic a chance, like when I question why he listens to these YouTubers when they obviously have not cured it themselves, he just gets mad and ignores the question. He has put thousands of dollars into a kefir company's stock, convinced that it will skyrocket later. He is obsessed with eating a low choline diet. To me, it is obvious that he has extreme anxiety and OCD. He is constantly fidgeting (picking at his nails, twirling his hair nonstop, shaking his legs) and I always have to tell him as kindly as possible to chill out. He is obsessed with anything in his skin to the point he will make scars on his face/body to remove tiny specs of blackhead or whatever. I am actually in a on and off relationship with him for the past decade and have known him since childhood, so it is not like I am not trying to be supportive of him. I am just saying what I see.\n\n\nThe sad part to me is, I read to him your post in an attempt to help him, and it seems like he basically brushed it all off because he does not believe he has ORS. It is fucking frustrating to get through to him, because he believes he is so right. He knew what a DermaDry machine was too, so I used that as proof that you shared similar experience so he should give your post a chance, but to me it just looked like it went in one ear and out the other.\n\n\nI did force him to do meditation for a month or so earlier this year. This helped me a lot, and I can tell helped him too. Maybe that is one path I can take him down again.\n\n\nI was wondering, did you happen to notice mood swings due to the ORS? I feel like my friend's mental state is getting worse, and he is very unreasonable and just a jerk when we get into any little conflict. The only thing that makes him happy is me affirming his delusional beliefs that drinking kefir will solve all his problems, and I do not feel like that is the right thing to do weirdly. My partner tells me the same and when I have asked for reassurance from family they have gotten tired of giving an answer I did not want to hear. Regardless of what anyone says, I am going to make an excuse such as \"of course I do not smell to them, they have gotten used to my smell or like it\" or \"they are lying to me to protect me\". It is torture especially the sniffling, scrunched up nose, distancing, blinking, looking around, etc. Any body  language that indicates something is unpleasant I automatically assume it is me. There can be a rotten food in the fridge, cat could leave fresh poop in his litter, and the moment someone says \"it stinks\" I automatically think its me. I will gather all the bad smells in the air and assume it is me. One reason I have a hard time letting go is what if I do smell bad and stop doing my rituals to not smell then I will definitely smell. There is no winning. It was way worse before I would shower 2-3 times a day. If I was at work I would freshen up constantly. Always had a change of underwear. Eventually I gradually stopped being excessive about it because it was making it worse the anxiety would build up. But still sometimes I will be okay and other days it will occupy my  mind like the plague. I know, so frustrating when doctors are like its all in your head, I am like bish I am not retarded, I know when people around me think I smell, especially when someone I walk by says that guy smells like shit lol.  Yea but Mr. MD says I am delusional \ud83d\ude12", "Do any of your neighbors complain about the smell? I am not sure if it is paranoia or reality. I think I overheard a week ago my neighbors who live below me complaining about a bad smell coming in through their air conditioning. Now I cannot help but notice they not only bought a new air conditioning unit just for their apartment but now they always have all their windows open.\n\nI just want this nightmare to end holy shit... My roommate also does not smell me, but the rest of the world die every time i approach. \n\nIf there is a way smell could reach neighbours, it is totally the case.", "Smell like popcorn? Hello all I have started to notice a smell that resembles that of buttered popcorn after sitting for about 4 hours of my shift, that lasts for about 3 hours. It usually starts at around 11am and i stop smelling it around 2-2:30ish. I believe it may be because this is around the time people take their lunches and use the microwaves in the kitchen etc. but when i start to notice the smell i head over to to kitchen and do not really smell anything and i do not smell anything upon coming back to my seat up until a few minutes later. Am I going crazy? about two years ago i had a really bad case of body odor smelling like feces but i have not experienced that same smell but since then i think every smell is me.

Use to be a strong urine odour but with a small diet now a fecal odour i recomend trying kefir as that made me smell less do you get it after sitting for long periods of time? is there a reason i only smell it those certain hours of the day? Lol i only noticed a buttered popcorn smell in my feet when they get very sweaty \ud83d\ude13 \ud83d\ude05. Im very surprised this smell got mentioned tbh. Yes, burnt popcorn, urine, fecal I smell like cheese/butter. My feet do sweat but oddly enough, my feet do not smell when I take my shoes off and my socks smell clean. I have asked a very trust worthy person to smell my feet and socks and the answer is, they smell clean. I am not sure if it is the sweat that smell then. That is a mystery I still have to solve.", "WHY if the odor is so bad have some of us not been fired? Most of us live in at-will states And on that note why the hell does it seem like EVERYONE reacts to the smell, but doctors claim there is nothing wrong. Even before they run any tests.\n\nIf I was in the doctor's shoes and someone with a really foul far reaching odor came into my office... My first thought would be: Do they have some form of cancer that is eating away at them? They are possibly dying. No normal person should smell so foul\n\nNone of it makes sense!", "Bog of Eternal Stench My roommate suggested I read up on this condition, which in itself is evidence enough to me of my own order. In my reading I have not come across any mention of the body odor being difficult to shower off. I regularly exit the shower knowing full well my pits still stink, but having given up on scrubbing them further. It seems It is a smell that just refuses to be washed off. If anyone else relates to this, I would love to hear about it. I have definitely felt this way before \nI know for me shaving helps\nAnd constantly reapplying deodorant \nSometimes I will leave soap on before I rinse it\n\nOddly enough staying hydrated helps me immensely.

My mother caught COVID two weeks ago and was hospitalized for 4 days. She was released and hospitalized again for pneumonia, and her health is declining rapidly. There is a chance she will pull through, but I have been preparing for the worst. I have not got to see her yet, truthfully I am too embarrassed because of my Odor. I will have to suck it up and whatever happens, I will keep my spirits high and be thankful for the few people I have in my life. Have a good day everyone!! \u2764 This is true but you cant and should not deny the rage and sadness you felt because of this. Its normal to have difficult days dealing with this. \n\nI would even say I understand and it is almost a normal reaction to get depressed because of it at some point. \n\nBut we should support each other and keep trying. Yeah I did not mean you should not get depressed or repress certain feelings. Anyone dealing with this condition would suffer from depression. My point is that even through suffering, pain and joy can co-exist. Life is too short, we just have to find and appreciate the little things in order to pull through. Agreed", "(NSFL, NSFW)Is it possible for unbelievably bad hygeine to cause fecal body odor? NSFL. NSFW. Not safe for life. Not safe for work. \n\n(NSFL, NSFW)Is it possible for unbelievably bad hygeine to cause fecal body odor? I did not shower for weeks after soiling my pants after diarrhea.\n\nAt the outset, I want to say that most TMAu/BO people have much better hygiene than the average Joe. I know I am the opposite and by saying my story it may sort of make some of you look bad, BUT I am the exception - I am the one in the trillion. I am sorry. I also want to say that I have tried to say my story before and have been accused of lying. I know my story sounds like fiction, but it is true. I really am an idiot. Forgive me.\n\nIt is hard to know when my fbo started since I have always had poor hygeine and have been considered smelly, but I feel there was a point where things changed big time.\n\nI would stay home most of my life and when I would go outside even I could smell poop around me. I wondered if it was other people, but now I know it was me.\n\n1) I have always had frequent and odorous flatulence. This sort of improved a tiny bit around high school with diet change.\n\n2) My bowel movements have been hard to clean and even sticky. I would insufficiently wipe and as a result I would smell like poop.. I\n\nMost of my life I was always indoors except when I had school. When I would go outside sometimes I would smell poop around me and would wonder if it is other people. Now I know it was actually me from poor wiping.\n\nAbout 2 years ago(I am 23), I started to get use baby wipes and be serious about wiping.\n\n3) My pits are abnormally stinky. I avoided deodorant/antiperspirant almost all my life due to laziness, feeling it was ineffective, using low quality ones, and mainly due to being a health nut with concerns over aluminum.\n\n4) I often showered once a week and during vacations from school, sometimes even less. After high school, I was a meet and this sort of became worse. Even if I wanted to shower my mom was sick in the stomach and would make me get out to use it. When I would shower, I would like to take ones that were dozens of minutes long because I felt that removed the dirt better. Since I did not want to be in my mom's way, I showered less than I would have.\n\nWhen I did shower, I usually did not use shampoo or soap because I was a health nut.\n\nAlso in high school I was asked if I washed between my butt cheeks once. The truth is I did not because I felt touching around there would be \"gay\", but eventually I did.\n\n\n*******\n\nThat was me from  about middle school and earlier to about when I was 21 years old. I was so smelly that in high school and maybe middle school PE class they pretty much had a few whole classes telling us about hygeine and deodorant. They did not say it was for me, but that is what people said. People told me I stink too.\n\n\n When I was about 21 years old, I started to shower twice a day if I had work, but at work I got several comments over my smell that stuck with me: 1) \"What is wrong with you?\" 2) A coworker offered me leftovers(fast food job) but recommended I do not eat the broccoli(odorous flatulence producing food).\n\n\nMaybe those comments were about farts or even poor wiping and not fbo.\n\n\nI became homeless at some point and also started to become flatulent, did not have a place to shower, and surely my wiping habit worsened due to a lack of restroom/toilet paper access. At this point, people at work were even holding their nose when working with me. I then quit my job.\n\n\nI did start to use baby wipes and put more effort at this point. I never showered due to being unaware of the charities that offered free showers until too late.\n\n\nThere was a point where something changed, at least in my mind. I had pretty much gone weeks without showering. I do not remember well, but it was earlier this year that I got sick in my stomach. I was vomiting and I had diarrhea. I thought I had gotten better and purchased a large plate from Panda Express. I ate it. I got diarrhea. I did not make it to the restroom\nI soiled my pants all the way down to my left sock. I used at least 20p baby wipes to wipe myself off in a nearby restroom.  I changed with a pair of clothes in my backpack. I still smelled myself. I changed again. \n\n\nAll my life I used to block out what people were saying around me. I would listen to music or would just think it was not related to me. But this time when people said \"someone shit themselves\" or something, I knew it was about me. Eventually everywhere I went I hear comments about the smell that I realized it must be me\n\n\nI never showered after soiling my pants until many weeks later. 4 hour long hot showers did not stop the comments. 20 minute showers after 20 minute ones and no change. It was not daily showers since.i was and still am homeless.\n\n\nAnd now it is over a half a year later and I still smell, or maybe I always smelled and I simply became aware of it.\n\n\nI use plenty of antiperspirant now. I went through a phase of trying out supplemental antimicrobials - oregano oil  berberine, etc for a couple weeks. Ive tried supplements somewhat inconsistently - glycine and Serine. Yet I still hear comments and I cannot smell myself.\n\n\nI used to wonder if the feces incorporated into my skin, yet why has not my body broken it down yet?\n\n\nI have showered with bleach once and Hibiclens once also(I lost my bottle after and I am sort of kicked out of the nearby shower charity). No change. I used to think I got sick in the stomach(food poisoning, I got better without meds) due to eating unwashed broccoli sprouts, or maybe unwashed fruit, or maybe simply due to not washing my hands, maybe due to dumpster diving which I honestly had done though I am not sure if that was soon to before I got sick. I wondered if the bacteria from the sprouts in my feces became a part of my skin. Yet the bleach should have killed it.\n\n\n******\n\n\nAfter shower after shower, I realized hygiene may not be the solution. There seems to be something wrong with me internally. I even wonder if I ingested some sort of poison while dumpster diving.\n\nBut I wonder if I have always smelled this way or if it simply worsened or if I simply became aware of it and paranoid after an extreme case of poor hygeine.\n\nI do not know when it begin because i have always smelled bad, had poor hygeine, and had always been a loner who literally ignored others comments all his life. Gosh that is long. I read part of it but, if you do not clean your skin after pooping well and often, that smell is harder to remove.\n\nThink this. When you have bad BO after a long day, I have had my armpits stink bad.\n\nI have showered, use soap several time in the same shower, still smells like armpit BO.\n\nAfter drying and a second cleaning that same day, it might be better.\n\nBut if you let it simmer enough, it is like your skin soaks in the odors and is more difficult to remove.\n\nBacteria changes based on what compounds you let it feed off, this is why diet is important for normal Flora and probiotics are kind of a scam. It is all about what your intestines actually use as food.\n\nYour skin is the same way. If there is poop for bacteria to feed off on your skin, certain bacteria will grow there.\n\nIt may take a while but I suggest a bidet.

I have to mention though, that those things did make me feel better and made the symptoms alot more manageable.\n\nThe root cause to my problem, after 8 months, turned out to be a parasite in my gut. I decided to start doing simple water enemas and taking Black Walnut, Wormwood, and Clove extracts and after going to war and pooping what seemed to be an entire alien colony living in my intestines with all kinds of eggs and worms coming out. The biggest one that came out was about the size and thickness of my middle finger and let me tell you, it was even more gross than it sounds.\n\nThis was my miracle product, I hope it works for you.

And believe me, my classmates WOULD complain if the smell was still there.\n\nNow, almost 11 years, the smell is still there, although not a fecal odor thank God!\n\nI cannot remember why I started taking iodine back then, I had read some post online most likely where someone had success with it.\n\nWell I am back at the iodine once again, 375 micro grams per day along with 1000 mg vitamin C and soon I will try liquid chlorophyll (cannot seem to find copper chlorophyllin where I live, but the difference is negligable maybe?)\n\nHas anyone had success with iodine? no I did not try it but I will buy it tomorrow! Do you want to know the cure for tmau This guy knows. and I know too. (hint: kefir or kombucha) Yep Hello, I cured Tmau and I too smelled like burnt rubber, fishy, smoke,sewege etc etc Watch my videos and Follow me I will help as many people achieve the cure I was able to attain!  It is Cure time! I have a fecal odor for 20 years. In my case it is caused by physical reactions to stress most of the time. Whenever you have a fight-fligtht response (stress), the blood is driven out of the bowels to vital parts like your heart and lungs to be able to flight or fight. .This causes the sudden fecal odor. When I feel nervous butterflies in my stomach, 100% I immediately start smelling, I noticed this through comments (Did you fart? or You smell awful) , most of the time I do not smell it myself. When I do I want to vanish or die, it is terrible. I have a bipolar disorder which results in anxiety, social fear, fear of failure when I feel depressed. So a lot of stress. Nowadays I feel much happier, I am less insecure and more relaxed. The fecal smell does not occur often anymore. Fear of smelling bad leads to fecal odor, it is a vicious circle.\n\nFind a way to break the circle. Maybe meditation or psycho-therapy to feel better about yourself. Goodluck!", "Do i have this disease , It all started when i was in 8th grade it happened out of nowhere , people would hold their nose and say it stinks when i walked by.(idk if this adds to the story , but whenever someone is sitting down and i walk by them or standing up besides them they do not say anything about me smelling but whenever they are up or like walking with me or sitting down with me i could see the faces they do  )and it is not like it is my underarms because they do not smell like bad at all i take good shower and wash my clothes good  any thoughts or questions? Like how do i know if i where to actually have this does your urine smell what is your diet like? do you have any gut related issues There could be a possibility. When did you start puberty? Did this start before, and or after? Is your diet awful? My urine has a somewhat strong smell , nd my diet i pretty much eat whatever is im the fridge I started when i was around 6th grade stop eating shit ask for kefir water fast dont  eat junk food But like do u think what i got going on as of en is tmau? Also, primary begins at a little before or at around puberty.. if you have it.. you may have type 2. How is your diet, and gut bacteria? Do you have issues with your digestive tract? Do you eat a lot of junk? Did it start after usage of antibiotics? Male To be honest I do not pay attention to my diet  or any of that this just happened day to the next yes probaly I think I have this too. Are you saying that gut issues go hand and hand with this disease or that it could be the cause of the odor? If people coff and sniff around you then maybe you have a problem with your odor...But not necessary tmau... TMAU 1 the original well known official disease smells fishy. It can be genetically tested for.\n\nTMAU 2, which is sort of unofficially a term, which most people might have here, is more of a gut issue it seems. Many sufferers also suffer from stomach diseases such as Chrons or Ulcerative colitis. \n\nIf you have 1, it is a very strong noticable odor. In Trimethylamineuria,  trimethylamine is not being processed properly and comes out in the reduced form. This TMA compound smells literally like fish that has been decaying.\n\nTMAU 2 people usually complain about fecal odor, which is not a TMA issue, or it partially might be but not the same. That is why it is an unofficial disorder, and there is no known exact thing.\n\nThe question is, does your urine smell like fish? If so get tested for a UTI which may also cause this. This is type 1, ask another person to smell, it I know its weird.\n\nType 2, do you have bowel issues, diarrhea very often, daily at least, or are you constipated for several days (5 days) at a time? \n\nIf not then it is neither one. Do you shower daily? Is your house clean or do you have pets that have soiled the place? Does it smell moldy when you go home or has someone commented on a smell in your home? \n\nThere could be tons of other reasons for this, let alone coincidences and paranoid. But I know the feeling of smelling bad Recently I have had diarrhea but not often Then I do not think it is you.. or it is not TMAU", "Is there anyone else on this sub who smells of fish? I just want someone talk to about it /:", "can someone help diagnose? i think i have this bad hi everyone, for pretty much my entire life, i have had to deal with a fish smelling penis and it is honestly been awful. do you think this is the cause? i am very hygienic and shower at least once a day so i am positive it is not a hygiene issue. i have tried using lotions on my balls and dick to make the smell fade but it only works for an hour or so. also, it somewhat comes and goes, it is not always awful, but it does go bad after some time and it seems like a constant cycle. if i have this, do you think i have the incurable type or type 2 where it is based on diet? i definitely am a carb and sugar person but i make sure to exercise often so i do not know! thank you so much! I do not know tbh. If you say you have had it your entire life then it may be type 1. If it is type 2, then it can be cured with diet/ and lifestyles fixes. Low choline diet could help but I recommend food based probiotics (kombucha or milk kefir). The latter cured me of BO/smelly sweat. I would give it try at least. It will take maybe 1-3 months to see if things improve. If not you prolly have type 1. Hope this helps Hi, since the odor is coming from the genital region only I think seeing a Urologist or Dermatologist is going to be your best bet. See your general practitioner about the issue first. They may know what is going on, but if not, they will be able to get you a referral so you can see those specialists quicker.  Is the fishy smell only from the genitals or the whole body? \n\nIs it strong enough that people have made comments ever? Maybe you have a form of bacterial vaginosis. It usually lives on vaginas but it would not surprise me if there was a dick variety of it. BV is a fish smell coming out of your vag that comes and goes in intensity but does require treatment.\n\nI have had bacterial vaginosis before and a few different things work. My favourite treatment (that also completely cured me) was eliminating sugar and carbs from my diet for as long as I could take it. The stronger the cravings, the more you know you are starving the \"bad bacteria\". Eat lots of veggies instead. \n\nIf it is not that, then none of this advice applies. Could not hurt to try though", "My roommate is bullying me I cant take this anymore. She is sooo mean. Every time I come in our small basement suit (I storm to my room when I get in) she makes sure to walk in the areas I have walked and coughs, sniffs, makes ughhh noises. Like it is very calculated. She told me she used to be a high school bully and that she was in gangs, and she still exhibits this behaviour even though she is in the last year of her degree. \n\nI literally avoid the common areas except for the bathroom because I do not want to bother her. I leave the house as much as I can to leave her alone. Im pretty sure I pay a higher rent than her. But shes so fucking mean. I have stopped being in the kitchen because I am trying to be nice to her. \n\nIve noticed every time I cough or sneeze or sniff she comes out of her room near the bathroom (that is close to my door) to make sure she does the same to me as well and makes sure I hear it. As if Im doing it on purpose to piss her off but Im actually sick and stuffy. She is mental and paranoid but is sadly effecting  my mental health. She knows that Im trying to get better but the other day she was like ugh what is that smell? The other day she cooked with garlic and I was stuffy and she heard me sniff so she got paranoid and opened the windows. I said to myself wtf? It is almost as if ppl have bullied her for her smell before and now she makes sure she is doing it to me. \n\nI am so fed up. I cannot move until the end of August but I cant believe I am being bullied so much. I hate her so much man. I have never said a bad thing to her. She is nice to my face but is an absolute bully behind my back. Please help. Could always beat her ass Ive noticed she almost immediately follows me in the bathroom just to make a ugh noise. So tonight i did the same to her when she got out of the bathroom and shes been real quiet since lmfao. Felt good. Find one of my people. We are 1 in 10,000. We are the Congenital Anosmics, or as you will come to know us, super heroes.\n\nWe have never, and most likely will never be able to smell. All you have to do, is detonate a stink bomb in a location with a few hundred people, whoever is not bothered, is your person. \n\nAsk them to swish, pow, and kablam your room mate (we naturally despise those who make a big deal out of this fictional, *smell* conspiracy) and then move in with you instead. Smell all you want, we cannot hear you. \n\nOperation can'tsmell eventually ends with our two peoples uniting, producing a supreme race, who might smell bad, but cannot smell. Its like having the power of fire, but not being able to be burned. They would be living Gods.\n\nAlso, on a more serious note, your room mate is a bitch, is their a viable way for you to get a new onen? Lmfaoooo ok tbh I dont smell THAT bad, it is just strong bread like, VERY strong. But I would appreciate someone who is not a little bitch about it, considering I accept ppl regardless. Weirdly enough I am able to pull dudes. But I also feel bad if I am bothering ppl, but not to a point that I am being bullied. My roommate makes very pungent food and i think her previous roommate bullied her for it. Now everytime I sneeze, sniff, cough or open a window she takes it very personally. I dont know  why Im trying to understand a bully but I leave end of august thankfully but have a hard time dealing with her stupid ass. I wish I knew how to have a thicker skin. Well, it is not long to go now. Maybe spray her in the face with a scent neutraliser. Nahh I want her to smell me real good at this point and have it knock her out. Oh hell yeah. Make her pay for these \"Smell\" lies. I keep trying to tell people, smell is not real. Haha I mean I wish I had more people with no sense of smell around me. Or at least ppl who werent little bitches about it. But our super heroes do not wear capes so I cannot Identify them. Would love to make super smelly babies with no sense of smell at this point and have everyone fear my family. Lmfao think bigger picture. Our entire communities could merge together. Then we would live in a \"Smelly\" society, that they would never come to, but we would never smell it. It would be the perfect defense, to create a little paradise.\n\nAnd nah we do not wear capes lol, but there are ways to *sniff* us out (pretty please pardon the punn). For example, placing poop in our places of residence. I would not know it was there if you placed it in a clever position.\n\nAll the smellers are bitches about all these \"Smells\", blind people do not complain about poor colour usage, and Deaf people do not complain about music they do not like. We are supreme. Lack of senses unite! Haha man I dont know why but your reply really struck a chord with me.  Now I am sitting in a mall laughing while crying in a good way. At least I have a mask to hide my stupid face so no one can see me sob and giggle. You sound like you just do not give a single fuck and I wish I was like that. It made my shitty day a little better thinking about this bs differently even if it is a joke. So thank you kind stranger. \n\nAlso, I would never place poop in someones home. That is something a low-life bully would do. People with lack of senses have the best common sense (was that a pun?). Omg I did not want to make you cry! But if it is a good way, then I am glad my silly words touched you in some way, I was hoping to make you feel better in some capacity.\n\nIn regards to the poop though, I deal with all the poop issues in my home (dogs, cat, humans.....) because the smellers in my home know it does not bother me. I like that. Same way when there is a spider they call me to take it outside, or if we are being burgled they call me first. I like that there are things I was both born with, and have developed over time, that make up for things others are not equipped to deal with.\n\nSo even if you placed poop in my house I would be like \"Well that is not supposed to be there... Hmmm. Well, best deal with it, it does not look great there\" lmao.\n\nAnd yeah I think that did constitute a pun. And no, generally speaking I do not sweat the small stuff, or... any of the stuff. I always defer to Plato:\n\n\"Nothing in the affairs of men is worthy of great anxiety\". \n\nSeriously though, glad I could have a good impact.\n\nEdit: oh and I have read Trimethylaminuria can smell like fish? I absolutely love seafood with quite literally none of the downsides. Like smellers who eat fish still can smell it and not like it, but I eat fish and have no bad things to say about anything fishy, or bready or whatever. For me, yeast and stuff makes good bread, end of. Lmao. Cannot have gumbo without some good fish.\n\nSo even like the idea of fishiness is only good to me.  Say \"Ugh it smells like coochie!!\" After every time she goes to take a piss. That will humble her ass. Smell is VERY REAL dude. I got a whiff of myself earlier and I wanted to choke. My turtle cannot stand to be within 5 ft of me anymore, he gets squirmish and goes in the opposite direction and burrows under his log until I leave the room. No he does not do it to anyone else. Just be happy you are part of the elite species! No smell is a blessing tbh lol.  My ninja, It are not that funny \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 strong bread? so u smell like a bakery? then why is she reacting like u smell like a cow farm?

I am just tired of being constantly paranoid of thinking I smell.\n\nAbout 3-4 hours into my shift I begin to notice a food-like smell around me. Im convinced it is me but I have no evidence. I asked my coworker who sits directly behind me if she notices any smell and she said no, I also explained to her what TMAU is and that I believe I have it in hope to have her tell the truth. She still said no and said she would be the first person to say something if she did smell it (she also has her mask under her nose all day which makes me feel better) I have also asked another coworker and she said she does smell a food/dusty smell and she believes it is just the building we are in. I shower in the morning and my commute to work is about 10 minutes, once I walk into the building I do notice a small hint of the smell but it is not until hours later that the smell grows, i am not sure if i am just smelling myself? I occasionally walk around the building when i get a big whiff and I can smell it in some areas, but on the way back to my seat I can no longer smell it. I am not sure if i am the one carrying the smell or if it is truly the building. I have had another co-worker also describe the smell as a chemical like smell. \n\nI am interested in hearing your thoughts, I am truly confused. If you smell something and only at work when other people around you, maybe its not coming from you but from someone else, do not be over paranoid mate yea perhaps, I have just had other symptoms that make me think it is actually me.", "WHEN do you smell? When do you guys smell, or are told you smell? Is it when you sweat lots working out, in the morning or night etc? \nIve been told I smell like regular sweat when I am working out, but have been told I smell like poop when just sitting still, it makes no sense! My symptoms do not align with TMAU as surely I should stink when I am sweating, but I am so sure I have it. HELP! It used to be only when I was nervous usually sitting down in class. But for 7 years now it has been all the time same here, i workout regularly and i have never been told I smell bad but after sitting at work for about 3-4 hours i begin to notice the smell Have you been formally diagnosed with TMAU? Such a frustrating condition! No i have not, I have an appointment in october to finally get checked out. I have followed a very strict diet for about a week and taking RAW kombucha pills and I have noticed the smell decrease. I agree, it is super frustrating and mentally draining. So glad you are able to get an appointment and hopefully that can provide you with some clarity. It could be something else other than TMAU, so I have my fingers and toes crossed the doctors is able to help you identify the issue! What smell do you think you produce? Thank you! I appreciate the support. At this point i am unsure of what smell i am producing, about 2 years ago I smelled like feces and I could really tell it was me, I also had a coworker tell this to me. Now I just think that any odd smell is me, though the smell i think I give off is a musty smell between my legs. I think I still smell it after deep scrubbing and daily showers. It happens immediately for me if I cannot have a full bowel movement. It smells even worse if I am constipated. \n\nMy sweat smells like normal sweat too. All the time Which kombucha pills? they are called garden of life RAW kombucha pills I have come to think it might be tied to stress sweat rather than regular sweat from exercise: ie  . \n\nI generally stress sweat when I think someone can smell me, which makes me smell more and sort of snowballs my problem. \ud83d\ude11", "I CURED TMAU with kefir ", "Did vitamin b2 help you?

I had a few months where my reactions were VERY minimal and I felt like I would defeated this finally. In 2019 I pretty much gave up coffee, got a RX to adderall and around august I Stopped taking my BC (Nuvaring) and felt like I was on the up and up. Well I have started getting reactions recently. I have been taking too much of my RX at a time, got back on bc in October and have been drinking coffee too. I am a college student so it is hard. I have definitely had some comments audibly made towards me. The sniffing is back. I never changed my diet just maybe reduced stress/cortisol levels and stopped the extra hormones for a bit. I also started taking a supplement called Ashgawanda in April and fell off a few months ago. Maybe it was helping... any input?

Yes, I believe I have tmau as well.. four years ago too lol. The symptoms varies through all of us who suffer me personally when I first got it , I could not smell myself. But, later down the line I now can. The symptoms of tmau is not smelling yourself for many though. The farting/bloating is leaky gut which can be a symptom of TMAU/PATM/SIBO etc depends on the individual... do you have Facebook? I am in several support groups for TMAU , you should most def get it a lot of people in the group share there experiences and some are even cured . Also, what I realized is a lot of people cannot smell you who are close to you or maybe they can but like you said just tryna be nice Yes please can you give me the group\u2019s link Kefir ,water fast,eating less choline is the solution    Tmau does not make you bloated or gassy, the condition is when the body cannot process trimethylamine, and the compound comes out in your breath and urine and sweat, not out the butt. \n\nI am pretty sure people can usually smell their own farts. Can you smell your own poo when you go to the toilet? I would assume if you can smell it, then you should be able to smell something similar as gas escapes.\n\nBloating and gas is more likely IBS or leaky gut? Best to speak to a doctor, a nutritionist, and maybe a university psychologist (to get some more feedback and develop coping strategies - also if your friends say you do not smell, you might be less smelly than you think) - they usually offer free services. Maybe you have leaky gut or bad gas? You said you could not hold in your farts? Do you have sensation where you can feel when you are farting? Can you smell your own poop and farts? Does not sound like TMAU to be, it sounds like you need to get your bowels checked Thank you so much \ud83c\udf38 I tried kefir but it increased my bloating ,, I do not know maybe it is a symptom of healing Does leaky gut cause excessive farting and bad odor ? I searched in google but the sources differ from one another so i am confused,,i want to know is it tmau , or leaky gut Yes i can smell my own poo and fart but when i am i public I cannot smell my farts and i can feel air going out of there but not a loud fart Actually I had a look at leaky gut, sounds a bit like bullshit  . Sorry about mentioning it, it gets thrown around here a bit and I mentioned it as a throwaway. If you have got excessive bloating and flatulence its probably best to go see a doctor. There are a bunch of things it could be ( but not TMAU. **( \n \n &gt;Leaky gut syndrome is a hypothetical, medically unrecognized condition. Unlike the scientific phenomenon of increased intestinal permeability (\"leaky gut\"), claims for the existence of \"leaky gut syndrome\" as a distinct medical condition come mostly from nutritionists and practitioners of alternative medicine. Proponents claim that a \"leaky gut\" causes chronic inflammation throughout the body that results in a wide range of conditions, including chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus,  migraines, multiple sclerosis, and autism. As of 2021, there is little evidence to support this hypothesis.\n \n^(( | )( | )( | )( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5) Desktop version of /u/Brutalar's link: &lt;\n\n --- \n\n ^(( ^(Beep Boop.

Cut out dairy and gluten for a while.  Eat celery and drink laxatives to remove all toxins in the remove step, You can be cured, like i was. \n\nPeople holding their noses is the same what they did to me before, but now i sit next to them lol are you cured now? People dont  hold their noses anymore, i dont smell like feces atleast now its only sweat which is bearable.   \n\n\nI am not cured yet because i keep thinking i am cured and start eating junk food and I can feel my stomach having issue processing food.

Does miralax help or does it make it worse? I know PEG, the main ingredient, can also be used as a carrier for compounds, so I am not sure if it is counter productive in absorbing compounds into the blood and then the skin/sweat.\n\nI am wondering if a stimulant one is better in this situation. I have not used Miralax but Metamucil works great and the taste is not unbearable like most psyllium husk. \n\nStimulant laxatives should only ever be used every once in a blue moon. Because it is easy for our bodies to become dependent on them to \"go\" at all after regular uses. Not fun. Try 1 tsp or 1 tbsp of food-grade diatomaceous earth mixed with an equal amount of psyllium powder or chia mixed into any drink.  Drink immediately before it gels up.  Drink this at least 2 hours before or after meds or supplements.  You must drink a lot of water throughout the day with this or it will not work.  Drink this once daily.  At night take a couple of cascara sagrada capsules.  Buy a toilet plunger.  There will be no pain or urgency plus you get all the benefits of DE and fiber and cascara is excellent for the liver.  All will help with odour. Thanks, will have to try this and the other suggestion.\n\nDepending on which one causes less body odor, I will stick to it.\n\nI unfortunately used laxatives to evacuate my system this time around People with constipation- do you ONLY get fecal smell or also other types? (Like garbage or fish etc) I will have to try this out. Does it help with absorbing oils and fats in the digestion tract? I think I have an excess of these that is causing my body odor. I seem to have a greasy smell that is consistent from my point of view, but garbage and sewage is also how it can come up.\n\nBut it is kind of decaying corn chip as well other times. That is the worst one in my opinion as it is more in your face. Look up Mildronate for TMAU.  Found on Amazon, from Russia.  Very expensive but stops odour but you must avoid your trigger foods.  May increase heart rate so be careful.  Takes around a month or so to arrive.   \n\nLook on how to make homemade Gavisvon Plus.  There are several recipes on Reddit to make for pennies.  This version has sodium alginate which creates a raft to stop odour from the gut.  The North American version does not have this special ingredient only the U.K. does.  \n\nA double dose of Pepto Bismol will stop odour for a few hours but it will temp turn your stool black and increase constipation.  Cannot use too long only a few months.  \n\nYou can also try taking 1/4 tsp (1/8 if you are female) of USP or BP or NF version of boric acid mixed in a half liter or liter of water to stop odour and drink it.  It is over the counter but behind the counter at pharmacies.  It is old school used to disinfect cuts, stop foot and genital odour on skin.  Buy a 125 gram bottle from Walmart pharmacy or online.  Online is cheaper.  Ensure you do not get technical grade.  Take 5 days on, two days off.   Take once daily and stretch Cascara is excellent for the liver and helps greatly with constipation.  \n\nOx bile capsules will help you digest fat.\n\nYou can also try betaine hcl with pepsin.  Instructions on how to take are online. \n\nApple cider vinegar with the mother, a shot glass amount in water before meals may help too.  Use a straw, rinse teeth afterwards, brush teeth 30 minutes later to prevent enamel damage.  \n\nAlso look into TUDCA (powder is better but capsules are far cheaper.  Find the powder on amazon.ca. \n\nYou can also ask a doc to prescribe you UDCA, pharm version.  \n\nMilk thistle is excellent (grind whole seeds yourself as needed in a cheap coffee/spice grinder or chew whole seeds very, very thoroughly or buy capsules.  Start slow only take a tsp at first and then work up to a tbsp or two or more daily.  Take too much at once and you will detox your liver which is great but your smell may increase for a day or two.\n\nTrans-resveratrol is also great for the liver, especially for TMAU but it is  pricey.  Find cheap on amazon.ca.  Regular resveratrol capsules are cheaper.\n\nAlso see if you can get Japanese knotweed which is high in resveratrol.  Make into a tea or tincture.  It can be found in Asian grocery stores or online and called itadori tea.  \n\nIncrease good bacteria with milk or water kefir and kombucha.  There are tons of places online that will either give you the grains or a SCOBY for free or cheap.  \n\nGinger is a natural prokinetic.  Triphala may be spelled trifla (may take a while to get your correct dosage, dirt cheap in Indian grocery stores) is a prokinetic and helps with constipation or diarrhea.", "TMAU Ontario anybody? I am done with feeling sorry for myself. It was hard to accept I have an odour I cant smell. You can only sustain so long before you crave life. It is difficult to socialize with people sometimes and that is ok. I would like to meet others with similar challenges. Plus who has better life stories than people who developed TMAU!!\ud83e\udd23  we can laugh at it,  others cant. I still have a couple friends but I dont feel they understand me or even the perspective I am working with. Also how do TMAU singles meet others or do something simple like having sex? Any men that figured it out?? ... Meeting people and communication gets difficult  at times, so I am turning to the community. TRY KEFIR, KOMBUCHA, AND RIBOFLAVIN! They have been working for me after 5 years of suffering!\n\nI truly feel that I have had TMAU since around 2015. I have been to countless doctors. They have all blown me off. They are not familiar with it and do not know how to treat it so they are disinterested. I moved to a different state and have finally found a Physician's Assistant that is willing to listen. I recently had blood work done for \"body odor\" for the very first time. I have not received the results yet, but I am hoping to find answering as this condition is mentally crippling. \n\nMeanwhile in the past month or so, I have been doing more searcher on the web and on YouTube. I came across an article that said Riboflavin worked for a TMAU patient to reduce odor. So I found  ( on Amazon and it has been amazing. The best part...it was only $15. \n\nI have been depressed, paranoid, and miserable trying to stop the smell. I suffer from the sulfur smell (like broccoli or brussell sprouts coming out of my pores-very pungent!). I am very clean but......\n\nBack to the Riboflavin....I looked back at my patient portal when I had a lab work panel done and B2 was something that I was deficient in but my doctor never mentioned it. He only told me to increase my Vitamin D and Iron. (Mindblowing!!!!) Why could not I have looked closer a few years back. So......after watching YouTube I have starting drinking Kefir (probiotic) (Lifeway brand) from Walmart and I have started fermenting/brewing my own Kombucha tea. I got the idea from a young man that saw results on YouTube. Just type in how TMAU and how to make your own Kombucha (probiotic). I guess store bought tea packets do not have the same benefits. Eventually I will try to make my own Kefir (YouTube).\n\nI have not been noticing any reactions when I walk by. Someone at work even told me I smelled good when I breezed past and this was well into my work day. One more thing I have not been able to find a perfume that has worked in years and I tried one that I bought months ago and it smelled pretty and floral instead of like trash.\n\nIn closing...try Riboflavin, Kefir, and Kombucha! All inexpensive and I have had great progress. I take my clothes off when I get home and when I smell them they do not STINK anymore!!! Yay! I hope this lasts.\n\nLet me know if any of this works in a few weeks! You have to include these things in your daily routine. \n\nBest Wishes on your journey for improvement! Everyone is waiting for advice, but no one has any? \n\nWe are spread out around the globe. Finding a fellow sufferer to meet up for feedback is already a challenge. Finding someone compatible is going to be much harder. Sooooo I thought I had TMAU for a couple years because my lab results for various tests came back negative or normal and I did not have any other symptoms other than a foul, putrid, sweet smell that sometimes smelled like maple syrup and sometimes like ammonia. However- and this is a big \u201chowever\u201d- I found out I actually had e coli bacteria in my system. E coli has a strange smells to it. It is usually described as RANCID, PUTRID, FOUL, SWEET and like AMMONIA. It varies often. If you are experiencing these smells and your blood tests have come back normal, I strongly suggest that you do an e coli culture test. I smelled horrible for 2 years! Usually e coli in the system can cause sepsis and death if it goes untreated so I am surprised that I dealt with it for so long but I am finally receiving treatment for it and the smell is finally subsiding. I was praying for a healing for a long time. Then I read that this one guy fasted for 21 days and took probiotics tablets the entire time until he was able to cleanse his gut out and then his symptoms went away. I believe that when he fasted he starved the e coli bacteria in his gut. As for me, I am currently taking Cephalexin 500 MG capsules 3 times a day, fasting and continuing with prayer and it is working. Also, you may want to see if you have BV if you have not done so already. BV produces a FISHY odor. I was informed by my doctor that both could take up to 3 treatments over the span of 3 months to get rid of completely because the treatments only kill up to 70% of the bacteria each time. Both the E coli and BV treatments are not to be taken at the same time. So you would go one week with one treatment and another week or two with the other. Let me just say that Dr. Diana Yan in Gaithersburg, MD, USA was the only doctor out of the 9 doctors I met with over the past two years to inform me in detail what my treatment was, what caused the rotten smell that my body was producing and how the different bacteria react to their treatments. I am so thankful for her. What if TMAU is just e coli in people with strong immune systems? I hope you all find this information to be helpful.\n\nFYI, the smell is almost completely gone and I am only half way through my first treatment. Manitoba, neighbours lol Hi everyone, were any of you in Canada able to get tested? Either the urine or DNA test? I am tired of not knowing what the cause really is, just want a solid diagnosis! I found several US labs that do DNA tests but I do not know which one is good...\nWish I could talk to someone who is getting adequate help from doctors. My GP is just terrible. I am in Toronto I am cured of it! I had it for two years. I prayed to God and he answered my prayers. After going to more than 8 doctors and having this condition cause an issue at work and social environments, I can say I am finally healed.\nI went to a doctor who told me I had e-coli that was causing the rotten smell. The doctor said that it would take about 3 months for me to be healed. I started taking antibiotics for 2 weeks, completed a diet with mostly sauerkraut, kefir milk(it is sour), probiotics, ginger tea, hardly any sugar, prayed about it so much, had worst days then better ones, tried to eat only the items listed above so that it could have the best effect and, thank God, the smell is completely gone. Today I have been 3 days without a case. I have eaten eggs, beef and other foods and I have no odor. I smell clean. I did this for approximately 3 weeks. I pray that you are healed, too. \n\n-I drank Kefir milk from Lifeway/Maple Hill- it is supposed to taste sour. (2-3 bottles/day)\n-saurkraut about 11oz a day (this helped dramatically)\n-probiotics for bv and e-coli( 1 week each -never take them together)\n-ginger and lemon tea \n-probiotic and oregano oil capsules \n-plenty\n-one regular meal a day\n\n-I brush my teeth with Tom\u2019s fennel tooth paste to remove the sour milk smell from my breath. This works better than mint. \n\nI started on this on 8/3/20 and am on 8/26/20 without symptoms. I have been 3 days (give and take some hours) without them.\n\n-Prayer and trust in God was so helpful in this time. Do not forget about God so that He heals you.\n\n\nBlessings to you!!! My GP tells me everything is fine  and that he does not see an issue. If you find any place in Toronto that can help please share! theres a quite a few of us around. Wow, thank you so much I started consuming kombucha right away. I ordered riboflavin from amazon, I have not gone in to a walmart yet but I will add kefir soon. I also gave up on perfumes and sprays. \n\nI will keep you posted, thank you for sharing with the community. Damn, I guess this is life. Lol beggars, cant be choosers. Elaborate, do you know any safe places to hang out or socialize  what has been easy, and what has been difficult. What is your social circle like?  I got a urine test 6 years ago at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto.  Since labs have different thresholds to test positive, loading choline and doing a urine test may not always be accurate due to the timing of collection, plus there are various opinions on blood testing etc.  Basically things may not be so cut and dry.  Obviously getting a diagnosis of something is key.  Many of us have been fobbed off for years by doctors which is extremely frustrating.   There is a specific liver test that someone mentioned on the MEBO PATM/TMAU Facebook group that referred to testing for how well the liver detoxes in phase I and II that may be of help.  Perhaps ask for a referral to here  ( perhaps through a nurse practitioner or another doctor if possible if your doctor will not refer you. You guys gave me a new fire.

If they say there is not a smell and feel you do not trust them -- you can always ask to see their notes. They will not edit it just to hide it from you.

I have noticed an improvement from the things I have tried below, but lately it has been getting worse and it is soul crushing. I suffered from constant gas/GI issues, that have gotten much better, but not fully resolved which I do think plays a major role. I have a strong hunch the issue has to be bacterial imbalance.

A few of them complained about it to ME before finding out it was me, so I do not believe they are lying. They all described it as if someone kept passing gas. There was enough gaps in between them that it was not a constant odor. And before this these were all the same people who told me it was in my head!!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I am wondering if some of us suffering from fecal body odor are dealing with some kind of leaky gas when we are anxious. Especially if friends and family claim they cannot smell a thing... Maybe we are so comfortable around them that the gas does not come out around them? Same thing for doctors. Yes. I take s bolardii, digestive enzymes and copper chlorophyllin with food. Pretty sure you got leaky gut and not TMAU then. Good news is it can be treated. Bad news is the treatment as you may know it, is a painfully strict diet ruling out gluten and hundreds of other food items you would normally find in at house What a fucking joke Why are we cursed with this fucking bullshit Same i was told i smell like farts maybe cuz i held them in.

I have tried it and sometimes it will not work because you are not getting any fiber to help evacuate any waste. I think salt water cleanse works better but it can be harmful because of the high salt intake. Definitely not something that can be done every few days... maybe once a week at most. And nearly the whole day will be spent in the bathroom.\n\nSo your family reacts to you? Do they admit there is an odor or do they tell you it is all in your head?\n\nDoes the gurgling happen every night? Or do you think there may be a trigger food (like dairy, spicy food) that is causing it? the stomach noises happen everyday/night I notice when sitting/lying down it is like gurgling/growling sometimes sounds like something is leaking...

This thing has ruined my social life like I stay at my room most of the time now or I stay away It sounds like it may be gas escaping. It is easier for gas to release like that when you are relaxed and lying down. Maybe you are backed up / constipated without knowing it? You can be constipated even with a good diet. If it was only once in a while it could have been an unknown food sensitivity like dairy or something. You can see if anything improves after changing your diet a little.

The tales of my stinkiness are everywhere. \nWhen i was 20 years old(2 yrs ago) i got addicted to smoking meth because i was depressed and wanted to try everything and kill myself (that was the plan cant even remember the reason why) One day suddenly i was a stinking piece of shit where everyone was laughing at me i became a social pariah and got depressed again because of how bad i stink.  attempted multiple times but my family just laughed at me too with my so called friends i could even hear them talking about me like im some sort of a homeless stranger. I dont lack hygiene i shower everyday dry cleaned clothes deodorant+antiperspirant. But i still sweat when i get anxious because im thinking i might get stinky then i get stinky for some reason i cant smell myself and when i ask a friend or a family member do i smell bad they would say no but keep on rubbing their noses and making eye contact with each other while smirking grrr makes me so angry i got no one :( probably destroyed my own liver from meth abuse right? Im currently looking for a doctor but i dont know what to say :( im 5\u20194 98-105lbs was only taking meth for 6 months then i got stinky even with deoantiperspirant \nAnd continued to take meth for another 5 months until i isolated myself from people because I could not take all the judgments anymore \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

I started to realizing people smirking and trying to take photos of me aggressively in Summer 2018. I know there is a hate page someone made of me but I cannot find it because I often hear people say that is the girl from online and then they will smirk at me. It is incredibly hard living with this disease. I am severely depressed and traumatized. The worst part is that we are always made out to be the bad person. A situation happened recently that proved that.           I basically found out that I believe my neighbor was behind the hate page because Everytime I left from my home and walked down the stairs, she would rush to her screen and have her phone pointed directly at me. At first I brushed it off but this happened at most 10 times before I started to realize that this was no a coincidence. Also I remember that early on when I was the ridicule of bullying in my town, I had weird experiences with those neighbors. Basically a couple of times when I climbed down the stairs at night, a bright camera flash hit me. I could tell that someone was taking a photo of something. This happened various times but I always dismissed it. It also only happened to me because it never happened to my siblings or parents. I feel your pain because it upsets me that we are treated so badly when we did nothing wrong. This is also happening to me in my neighborhood, the neighbors all give me dirty looks now because the other neighbors went to tell lies when I just indirectly told her to stop taking photos of me. Anyways, it is horrible to deal with smear campaigns and bullying when we do not deserve any of it. It is said how patients with TMAU are often treated so badly compared o those who actually did harm in our society. I SEND ALL MY LOVE TO YOU \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2d What Is worst is i look so damn cute and they hate me for being stinky cause they ugly mofos lmao fuck them!! I just want to see the look in their faces when theyre in their death beds while we out live them all goddamn Maybe you have bromhidrosis and hyperhidrosis instead of TMAU.  You can look into making your own iontophoresis machine, put diluted boric acid powder USP, BP or NF version on your pits, ($5 for 129 gram bottle, found behind the counter at Walmart or other pharmacies or online.  You could also mix a bit of clear iodine with water and apply.  Look up the Monash University's FODMAP diet and get their app to find out which foods increase or lessen the odour.  Sorry you are going through this. Same. Something I noticed about all these people is that they are mostly all fake. They are the type of people who only want to be your friend when things are going well for you but when things go badly for you, they no longer want to talk to you. That is why they hate us without even knowing us because their opinions of others are influenced by gossip and rumours. Basically what I am saying is that they hate anyone with a bad reputation or who is the talk of the town because everyone else does. We should not really let these fake people's opinions of us hurt us because they are not worth it. Also, at the end of the day, we should be at least thankful we are not like them. You said you tried to kill yourself many times. Maybe you did it and now you are in purgatory or something. People have berb telling me im dead. In 2020 i started to feel as if i were being followed by a gang die to bring told to die by strangers in cars. Finally in about July this year the voices got more obvious. I got scared about a crime i committed. In July i started to hear chickens or some sort of birds talking  things. Then the voices were everywhere. I think I died at some point or maybe God pulled me out for being too evil.\n\nI think i might need to see a neurologist. Maybe something happened with .y brain and that is why these bad things are happening Bro the fact that we still feel means were alive Yes I think u got this condition because of over-stress. I have a bad family and life. Worst of all is my nanny she fucking hits me and torture me everyday for 3 years. Physically and mentally hurt by that. Now thank god she is gone but left me with this disease ffs. You have a point. I have been emotionally and physically abused every single day for as long as i can remember as a child by my own family and relatives. It just stopped when i was around 16 when i gained some height. Now they just gaslight me all the time that i am crazy and hearing voices when in fact its their voices talkingg behind my back with their friends and other people about everything that is wrong with and yes including that i stink :( sucks bro Interesting I was on life support when I was 15 guess I was dead for a few days. I sometimes believe I hear people thoughts and when I ask them what did they say they say they did not say anything In my case the voices/people seem to be omniscient but they will not admit it when I tell them. I could probably go to another country and still hear total strangers saying details of my life. The voices have in fact told me they would follow me wherever i go. They told me this is not my home several times and i feel like I am supposed to go to heaven or i guess hell. They have told me to die.\n\nThe fact that you mention 15 may be relevant in my life. I found a strange coincidence of a murder of a 15yo neighbor who had the same exact name had a coworker which i frankly deeply hated. I think i do remember wishing death on him out loud in somewhat of a conversation with a voice. \n\nIt is like hiring a hit man but i do not think i was serious. Proof is i barely came across the news article several months after it happened. Either way, i never sat down with the hitman and never paid. I do not know...\n\nI seem to have found an instagram of someone by the same name as the killer and it seems to contains message for me. In music  It is about how i lied and stole money and how i need to make a change. The voices always seem to want me to be a different person but i do not know how \n\nAnyways, numbers are interesting and i sort of noticed 666 is in my social security number - twice.\n\nAnyways i do not know. I want to get my brain scanned and see what is wrong. Maybe there is a bacteria, virus, or worm hurting me.\n\nIf it is a spiritual problem, it would be hard to fix. My karma is hard to improve. FRA July it is tough enough to wear my face mask and have hygeine for covid, but somehow I am supposed to pay back all the money i stole and then donate to charities and volunteer and do other normal hood things. For sure there is no reparations for killing - earthbound reparations anyway.\n\nWith covid, now every attempt at a good deed seems worth questioning. Ie maybe you do smth good like hold the door for someone open, but in the process you do not social distance and end up spreading disease.\n\nBut maybe you wouldnt have socially distanced anyway so maybe you did better.I mean i think it is good to have good intentions, but maybe it is also important to think about it really well. I tried to return stolen money and it made things worse once.\n\nIt is hard not to do bad things. Maybe i do not get enough sleep or maybe the voices are mean to me or i feel unsatisfied in life in some other way. Then i end up doing bad. For sure the longer i live, the worse things will get unless maybe i go live in a cave though i do not think I will do that.\n\nI sort of realized I am a net negative on society. I am not only lacking skill, intelligence, education, job experience to contribute to society. I even lack basic things like values and compassion, etc. I am a dead weight.\n\nSo i cannot even volunteer. Itd have to be solo because of the voices/body odor. I was thinking of chopping down some dead bushes to prevent one of those fires i keep hearing about here in California. \n\nFrankly i need to focus on myself first with the intention of causing less damage, but everything is so difficult.\n\nOh and people seem not only omniscient, one, but they also seem to predict my future vaguely.\n\nI myself predict things will get worse. My former neighbors are sick and old, and they might die within my lifetime. I rode the subway and saw a guy who had not showered in ages. I saw someone fall down at the mall and get taken away.\n\nI feel like I am living in purgatory or a simulation but somehow bad things are happening to others. It feels like my fault and frankly it is - I have been \"rich\" but have stolen and never helped out the poor. I have seen straight up barefoot homeless walking by broken glass and blood. Maybe it is my fault the lady at the mall fell because i do not always wear my face mask. \n\nAnyways the voices told me to go to the \"pros\" - ie i guess doctors and churches.  The police do not seem to help. One cop after admitting to several felonies that\nwere already on file anyway told me to confess at church and did not arrest me. Maybe it is cu it is California and very lenient on crime, who knows.\n\nI have not gone to church cuz I am so dirty from not showering and have covid symptoms nearly daily(so it would be against the covid rules to go, I am supposed to stay home). You believe your the cause of bad things but the truth is you are because your drawing negative forces in taking a spiritual bath and using a protection crystal while meditating also use sage to cleanse before hand this has helped me a lot especially using Turing fork it is your frequency it is off could be cause of 4G or 5G or the environment but we are all energy. It want help the smell taking tons probiotics and eating a lot of fruit and veggies will help and using antibacterial soap will not make the smell over powering if u develop this condition later in life like me in my 20\u2019s it is because of our lifestyle that takes a while to fix it is going to take longer then a year to fix this body odor thing also removing all body hair helps. more and more I notice some of us have TMAU some have overgrowth of yeast in the gut or skin some have physical overpopulated bacteria on the skin throwing our skin ph off I hope things get better and stop drawing bad things and spirits to you. I had to learn this thing is spiritual and physical fix your frequency look up videos on YouTube", "Just venting I get so tired of having tmau, I am literally so fed up. I cannot stand get treated so rudely anymore. People think I have poor hygiene when that is not the case. I am tired of it all tbh. I cannot go to concerts because of this. I am young, yet cannot enjoy life because of this. Going to the mall? Hell. It is just hell. Living with tmau just feels like hell. I am tired, and my heart hurts. Keep your head up. im going thru the same shit  gets hard just keep your head up and you will make it through At this point, I just get rude right back to them. I tell them \u2018hold your breath til I leave\u2019. These ppl have no idea what we face everyday so what gives them the right to talk to us that way. We cannot let them stop us from living our lives. You got this! Keep your head up, smile through all this bs. This shit takes a lot of patience and tolerance. You will be good. Do research, try implementing and cutting foods out of your diet, vent to people you trust and love, then vent to a physician. Also find some time to do something. Make some good out of TMAU. If you want to talk, just dm me Thank you for your words everyone, I am trying every day. Also working towards changing diets to see what would work for me. Anything to live tmau free. I hope that we can all get through this!", "Emotions Do any of u feel anything else other than sadness and anger sometimes?. I want to vent to my loved ones and just let it all out but its fucking harder than I thought especially being sensitive (or as I like to call it, fragile lol). Whenever I try to open up about this bullshyt I stop and get all kinds of emotions then I close back up again and nothing important gets spoken. If some of u have talked to someone about it, howd it go?. Maybe go to a therapist.. My family and friends are for casual fun time. My wife is who I vent to. It always goes well and I am fragile myself. Do you have a partner? Dont have the dough Nah Ok. Find ways to cope mentally. Get into gaming or some hobby. Try to do a lot of cardio.\n\nGet home made kefir, black tea and chlorella/charcoal for some immediate relief  I speak to my friends to vent about my sweating/odor. They cannot smell me though. I think they smelled me once and that was about it. I have a therapist but I avoid the topic because she cannot smell me either. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It is weird how some of my coworkers and strangers can smell me though. \n\n\nI suggest exercise or a hobby as well. Take care!! I am sad more than angry. I wish I had a support group to go to. Talk to other people that actually understand. My loved ones cannot smell it so they do not understand. If you are really suffering taking a small antidepressant can help I really allowed my mental health to suffer, but now I have decided to stand up for myself. I am going to own this and not run away from it anymore. All people can do is laugh and talk shit. If I am mentally strong enough, I can deal with that. I started taking a gut supplement and it really helped me just feel happier like my old self. Even though I am beefing with people, I am still not even depressed about it. I feel confident and strong and I feel great that they know that I know they talk shit because everytime I open my door, they get scared and quiet...lol...People talk shit because they expect us to shrink and run away. I will stand tall...funky or not. I am taking back my courage.", "Laundry Detergent Ok, so I recently did some research on different laundry detergents. \nIt all started with \"why are red Tide and Persil SO much more expensive?\"\nWell they have enzymes. And as most pet owners know, enzymes really get smells out. \n\nTide has a yellow bottle and a red one.  Only the red one has enzymes, and it costs more than the yellow bottle. Makes sense. \nThe yellow bottle I read is for light/medium stains and no enzymes.  The red original tide has enzymes and is meant for heavy stains. Forget the stain part, ....I am here for the enzymes. \nSo I got Persil and wow, just wow. I do not feel like I need an outfit change by lunch time. And honestly I want to wash EVERYTHING in my closet now. Its driving me insane that only some of my clothes are nice and clean. Always looking for a better detergent. I will try it out! Hmmmm, I have been using Arm and Hammer and Downy Unstoppables. I will check out the tide detergent. Good luck. For Arm and Hammer -the only one that has enzymes is the \"plus oxiClean\" one. Oooh good to know. Thank you. For sure!", "I am sick of getting bullied for this? I have gotten a lot of covert and overt bullying. Lately I have not really felt like I have had tmau because I do not get many reactions but at my last job i got my first overt death threat and at this new job I just got my second death threat, covert, at work.  Am just sick of this. Am sick of people who have no humanity, etc etc etc.  You all already know, I am just complaining.", "A wash that actually helped I shower daily. I have a variety of body washes. I even did low ph level body wash. Bars of soap from the co-op. NOTHING helped, I would get out of the shower smelly. \nI have noticed face washes kind of help. \nBut what has really helped is face wash with benzoyl peroxide in it. You know the kind you put on your face and 30 seconds later its all tingly and if you leave it on for a minute its borderline painful? \nI put the face wash on my face, then under my arms. I wait 30 seconds, rinse my face and then my arm pits. \nI now get out of the shower without smelling like a wild banshee. \nOh and I use babywipes on my arm pits right before I get into the shower. \n\nHugs to you all!  Have you used the soap on your whole body? No, just my underarms. \nI have used other facewash as body wash and I would say that helped a bit. I normally start with face wash all over then use summers eve all over.  I had a similar issue. I swear that is comes from my face. From my cheeks and behind my nose. I just started taking a supplement and it went away completely. I hope it lasts because Ive been dealing with this for 10 years.  Which supplements? Its one supplement. I take it at night and throughout the day after meals. Its a probiotic/enzyme. I could tell the difference right away. You can email me at  and I can send you a couple of them to see if they work for you.  ", "Not sure if I have it but I have heard comments or what sounds like comments about my smell. I wash, use anti-perspirant and cologne. No one directly tells me to my face but I can see it in their reactions. I am pretty sure I have heard people say I stink or smell like shit. Sometimes when I smell my pits it does have a fishy smell to it. When I ask people they say I do not smell but I think they are just lying to me. Every job I have worked I have heard comments. I do not eat a certain diet cause my attitude is if you do not like it, then too bad. But it does make me not interact with people that much, I try to avoid people as much as possible. I never been diagnosed and I do not really want to ask my doctor cause I feel like they are going to just shrug it off. You think I have it? lol", "TMAU /hospital visit  If she said musty in the room, pretend to be texting and laughing on your phone and say cunty. Some nurses have the same attitude as admin/front desk people. Dont nurses clean vomit and wipe asses? Lol that would have been a great reply back but I just got nervous and focus my attention on my baby and yes they clean vomit and wipe ass but a lot of them look down on people it is now day two and the rude ER nurse I had I know longer have to see her so that is good but this other nurse is very sensitive to my scent she is not rude she just rushes in and out barely taking the time to make sure my daughter is cared for lucky the doctors are not rude and they do not seem to care or the respiratory therapist It is almost as if the more educated people are the more understanding. How can you be a nurse and not be able to deal with different types of people. Not all nurses are created equal. I hope your baby is ok and that you have better days. That is so true and thank u for your kind words No worries. Feel free to msg me in private if you feel like you need someone to talk with. This shit can be hard. And yes very difficult to deal with makes life unbearable at times Thank you so much will do  Well, first off, I hope all is well with your baby now. Secondly, unfortunately I have noticed that A LOT of medical professionals are complete assholes with tendencies to assume things ( I work in the medical field so I experience this  pretty often) I can understand how difficult that must have been for you .  It is very hurtful to say the least, and as difficult as it is, try to not allow people to bring you down. All will be okay eventually \u2764 Thank you she is doing better and was release after the 3rd day and yes you are correct about that a lot of them can be assholes I have pretty much accepted that people are going to react and say bad things when we have this condition I have been practicing tuning the world out so people want bring my mood down but thank you.", "Freaks and geeks Have you guys ever watched freaks and geeks episode 8? I have not seen movies or shows that mention tmau before!. I have not but I will have to watch it. Thanks for the info! Which platform do you watch it on? Is it on Netflix? I found it on hulu. Thanks yo! I will check it I watched that and totally missed it. I must go back and watch it. \ud83d\ude03 It was pretty cool how the kid handled the confrontation, positive and honest\u270a.", "Should we ask him questions in regards to Tmau? ", "Can you smell yourself if you have TMAU? Hi, for the past few months I have been extremely insecure about the way I smell. Although no one has ever directly told me i stink, there has been occasional comments or gestures that suggest that I smell bad. I have extremely good hygiene so I cannot see how I would smell bad. My father has a faint odour of feces so I wondering whether it could be a genetic issue. My last thought has come to the question \u2018do I have TMAU\u2019. I was wondering whether I would be able to smell myself if I really did have it. Most people cannot smell themselves, or get a very quick whiff of themselves on rare occasions. \n\nTMAU and other similar body odor conditions are not clear cut as if you can smell yourself then X, but if you cannot smell yourself then Y. \n\nHas your father always had this fecal smell? Does he have other gut issues too like constipation? Do you smell other smells on him like fish, ammonia, urine, burning or garbage for example?  He does not get constipated. I would say the opposite if anything. I had to share a hotel room not long ago and the smell was a lot worse in the morning and evening. I never noticed the smell on him until recently; around about the same time I made an effort to smell better. This had me wondering whether I could not smell him before because I smelt like that aswell and my nose had adapted to it, but now I smell better his fecel smell is more noticable.\n\nI am convinced I smell bad and it is literally crushing my life. I just need to know the truth, but from what I have heard doctors lie and claim they cannot smell anything no matter how bad it is. Could be that your dad is not cleaning his arse properly? There is been one or two horror stories posted here about poor hygiene, sometimes it is hard to tell where good hygiene ends and a medical condition starts. Bit hard to tell unless you notice skid marks in his underwear though I guess. It is worth having that discussion with him so he knows. \n\nIf you have never had direct confirmation of smelling, it is likely in your head. Doctors do not lie, if they tell you you do not smell, then you do not smell at that time.\n\nSmells may be worse on a given day, but a smell will stick with you until you clean yourself and wash your clothes, it will not magically disappear when you walk into  a doctor surgery. \n\nCommunication is key - seems like you are hanging out with your dad a lot, it may be best if you both openly and honestly communicate with each other on this point. Let each other know each day \"am I alright to go out\" or after a particular experience outside, \"am I smelling right now?\" Until you feel confident that it is OK.  Alternatively, if you have anyone you trust, see if you can get them to help you out in identifying it, warning you when they notice it, etc. Sometimes I can and sometimes I cannot. I am horrified when I can.", "Anyone in SoCal/OC? Hi everyone. I am pretty sure I have this and wanted to meet up in person with someone to sniff each other out (lol) and talk about it. It is really putting a strain on my mental health and life. If I had someone to talk to that was going through the same thing it would help immensely. Thanks.  Hi I am in SoCal I am in cypress I know I have trauma forsure I get comments on my smell all the time", "Hello world I need advise Hey you call me Jason. I never thought I would speak out on the internet but here I am. As of right now I am willing to do anything to stop smelling. I want to go on a very long 2-3 week water fast while taking probiotic tablets. Why? Well I read online from a source that one guy with the same condition 18 years old as of right now did the same thing, a 21 day water fast  while taking probiotic tablets which has \"cured him\". Now why am I asking If I should do this? Well the is i am a skinny guy, not alot of muscle and not willing to loose it all from doing a 21 day fast. This is because I am worried about the future of myself and how I will get a job (when I have fish and fecal body odor). I have always been the type to not care, and I still do not but when It comes to making money and being able to live I CARE. Basically saying I do not want my body (muscle/becoming supper skinny/weak af). So now what do you think, should I do it or no? Sorry english not to good You need to go get tested. Without a diagnosis it is difficult to offer advice. There are several conditions that cause body odour. 'Fasting for 21 days whilst consuming probiotics' will do very little to change most of conditions that cause body odour. The best advice I can give is go get tested. A TMAU test in the UK costs \u00a3160-180. Mate, please make sure you get the smell verified by a someone. \n\nDo not assume based on your own nose. Ask someone to describe your smell to you and ask them to be honest.\n\nI would not put yourself through a long fast on the basis of an internet comment. \n \nAlso if you can scrape the money together get a test.\n\nThere are some treatments that have been shown to help, copper  chlorophyllin for example.\n\nBest of luck", "How I cope at work and in times of discomfort I tend to block out people and potential comments and reactions by escaping into my favorite music.

That and trying to focus in on a task and just get lost in the moment sort of thing. I try not to think about this disease and pretend it does not exist, I guess that would make me an avoidist (real word?) or come off as antisocial, but its really just me shielding myself from negativity. It is hard to stay positive sometimes, but we have to. It makes me feel shitty to think that I let other people affect how I feel.

It went on that I am complaining about finding a job and that I am blaming the United States Army for it. The voice also mention that sex work is the only job I can do because no one wants to work with the stinky girl. \r\n\nHere I am\u2026by myself\u2026smelling like hot dog shit.\r\n\nI ignored it because it was not the first time people had attack me like this and I went home. Days later, folks had used that incident to validate their harassment towards me. The students in my class would avoid sitting next to me and whisper rude comments. I had become famous without having any social media accounts. \r\n\nI do not bother anyone and I rarely speak to people. I am always going to smell like roadkill. It is the fact of my life. That night proved to me how desperate everyone is to find validation in their harassment towards me. It is becoming very frustrating to have random strangers talk as if they know the story of my life. Unfortunately, I do not have the time to write a novel. I am going to just sum up my experience in the military because everybody knows Durogene.\r\n\nOn September of 2011, I started my classes at Rhode Island School of Design. By December of that same year, I was given a academic dismissal. I was in financial trouble and knew that I was not going to finish the school year. I returned to New Jersey lost and confused. \r\n\nI come from poverty and my mother is a hoarder. I was not going to return back into that house and got myself a job. The money that I was making was not enough and I found sugar daddy. My arrangement still did not work and I became a Pro-Domme. After that, I enlisted in the Army. I had to wait six months before I could ship out into Basic Training. \r\n\nDuring that time, I realize that enlisting was a mistake. I looked into the mirror and I did not see a solider. I am weird as shit and walk my own path. I express my concerns to my recruiters and they did not take it well. I had made the mistake of sharing my family issues with them. They made me look like a fool in front if my mother and my godfather. When that did not work, they kept on pressing the idea that that the military will help me with my family. \r\n\nMy ship date was nearing and the recruiters had one more trick up their sleeve. I had made another mistake and told them where I was babysitting. I had sat down with them and they mentioned my family again. They reminded me that Christmas is around the corner and that I would be able to get my brothers presents this year. They finally won.\r\n\nBasic training is when I found that I smell like summer balls sack even after a shower. Regardless, halfway through Basic people realize that I just stink. One of my favortie quotes from that time was \u201cShe are not dirty. She just stinks.\u201d\r\nI am at my unit now and my odor pretty much subsided. Things were relatively ok until I had to do their PT and all my fears came true. These folks wanted to do Crossfit and that \u201cstyle\u201d of training is bullshit. What really grinded my nerves was that they were getting mad at me over my style of running. They were complaining that I am not huffing and puffing enough during the runs. \r\n\nAbout two months later, we were getting a new Colonel and I was part of the ceremonial formation. It was my first time in formation in the Texan heat and this Colonel loved to hear his own voice. It did not take long for me to start seeing stars. I looked at the First Sergeant and told him that I need to take a knee. After the ceremony, he instructed me to return with my Platoon Sergeant. He yelled at my sergeant and complained about how I could not handle the heat and that I would not be able to handle Middle Eastern weather. \r\n\nMy sergeant later cursed me out and complained about how undisciplined I am. I was dismissed and I went to my room. I cried and realize that these people want me to injure myself for them. Nope.  I did not join the army for them. I joined for my family and that moment I decided that the Army can suck my dick.\r\n\nI had stopped doing PT and half-assed everything. Every morning on run days, they would scream at my ear that I needed to pick my pace. I ignored it. Every fucking day. I ignored them. \r\n\nI had gotten a new Platoon Sergeant a few months later and I was butting heads with a random Staff Sergeant at the same time. This guy was bitching about me having my boots in front of my barracks door. He believed that my boots would get stolen and I did not agree. All the females for this unit lived on the same floor and we all kept our boots outside. \r\n\nThis dude took my boots and threaten me that if I do not get them with my First-Line Supervisor he will present them to the Regimental Command Sergeant Major\u2019s desk the following morning. Please do not threaten me with a good time. \r\nI did the good thing and showed up. Originally my punishment was going to be an Article 15 but it was downgraded to an essay. Since I am an undisciplined solider; I wrote in my essay that my informing me to not trust my follow soldiers with my boots, you are telling me that I can not trust them with my life. \r\n\nI am barely six months in my unit and I am butting heads with Command. After turning in my essay, I told my sergeants that they need to separate me from the military. I am unfit for service and that my behavior will not change. About a week before this, I had become a US citizen. My new Platoon Sergeant figured that I wanted to be removed because I am a citizen now. He went on about how so many people are trying to enlist and that I am a waste of space. He even called my mother and brought up my family.\r\n\nI said fuck it after that and tuned up my \u201cSuck my dick\u201d to the max. I had gained weight and started to fail my PT tests. Every morning, I would sit with my sergeant and sign a new counseling statement. Each one read \u201cLack of motivation during PT\u201d. \r\n\nAbout fours months later, I finally did it. They sat down with me and told me that I am being recommended for an article 15. I stared them in the eye and said respectfully, \u201cthat I feel nonchalant about the issue and that I will accept my punishment.\u201d\r\n\nI got kicked out of the office. \r\n\nLater that day my Platoon Sergeant showed up with the First Sergeant and chewed me out. I ignored a great deal of what he said but these words steal my view of the military forever. He went on that I am some immigrant that is taking advantage of the Army and that I had stole my citizenship. He wanted me to go AWOL so he can have me jailed. \r\n\nLater that day, I was brought up to the First Sergeant again. He told me that he will forgive if I wrote an essay. It was due the following morning before PT. I had turned in the essay and he loved it. Unfortunately, it was it not 3000 words and the process for my article 15 will begin.\r\n\nDuring that process, I had to speak with the Commander. He saw the sack of counselings and said that I should have received an Article 15 a long time ago. My rank was removed and my Platoon Sergeant said :\u201cNow you cannot send money home\u201d. \r\n\nFuck all of you. I am a single solider and I barely made enough to support my mother and my three brothers. My take home was a little over 600 dollars every two weeks. These folks did not do a single thing to help me with my family. So I smiled as they took my PFC rank off my chest and joked about it with the soldiers in my platoon. \r\n\nWe were slotted to go to Egypt this summer and the platoons were being rearranged. A new Infantry platoon was added to our Troop. Guess where I was sent to. The best part was that it did not take long for me to get my rank back after I was transferred. \r\n\nThere was a promotion ceremony and I was part it. It also became the day everyone learnt my last name. The First Sergeant looked at me shared that my ranked was removed and that I had worked hard to get it back. He asked me to give a speech to motivate the new soldiers. So I gave my speech. \r\n\n\u201cI hate this place and do not try to get kick out. I had tried everything and they will just punish you.\u201d I had shared more but those were the words that I can remember.\r\n\nOnce we gotten into Egypt, one of the females was caught in a male soldier\u2019s room. The First Sergeant and other female sergeant threaten all the girls that everyone will get punish if this occurs again. So what am I to do when male soldiers from my platoon tell me that they do not feel comfortable around a female sergeant. \r\n\nI am going to report it.\r\n\nI informed one of the high ranking female sergeants of the issue and told her that I think one of the sergeants is misbehaving. She asked me who I was thinking about and I told her. The next morning, I was sent to speak with her again. I was attack by both the high ranking sergeant and the one that I had accused. They said that I am spreading rumors about her and that I am trying to ruin her. I am acting like a little 19-year old and that I will lost rank if I continue spreading this \u201clie\u201d. \r\n\nPlease do not threaten me with a good time. \r\n\nI immediately told a high ranking sergeant in my platoon and things started to get a little be fun. In the military, girls are told that they will get rape and the boys are told that they will get accused of rape. Infantryman in my platoon were afraid to have a female. They believed that I would try and fuck one of their boys and cry rape. The thing that I noticed is that the girls are not treated the same way as the boys in the military. It seems that females have the freedom to flirt and to make comments about a male's body without consequence. They have the freedom to sexually express themselves with everyone and have the protection of Sharp (the sexual harassment and assault problem). \r\n\nWhat are you telling the boys? It is ok if the girls flirt with them but they can not flirt back. They also ran the risk that they can be called a bitch if they turn down an offer. What do you tell a soldier if he comes across a female who had slept with many in the unit before him and he believes that he can speak with her? I feel it is annoying that girls want to have the #Metoo movement but also be allowed to mess with coworkers at the same time. \r\n\nI am not trying to underplay the harassment females face in the militray. I have my own stories. Though, if the militray wants to tackle their sexual assault and harassment problems, they need to stop blaming the men. Or a least knowledge that a majority of rape victims have a penis.\n\nHonestly, the part that pissed me off was that ones who took my rank were also the ones acting like a fool overseas.\r\n\nI am finally reached my last year in the military and I was ready to leave. I started my transition early and did everything that I needed to prepare myself for the civilian world. I was transferred to an different troop and was given an NCO (sergeant) position. I went beyond and above with my job. I trained my soldiers in everything they needed to know relating to my work and scheduled mock training exercises for them. I did my job so well that a soldier from a different troop came to me for training. \r\n\nSummer came and so did my odor. I had completely forgotten about it and it scared me. I forgotten to mention that odor is not the only symptom that I experience. Chronic diarrhea and nausea were the battles that I had faced in Basic. I googled my symptoms and Google told me that I am suffering from a protein overload. So I had cut the protein and it did not work. I had tried everything Google told me to do. Google became my God. \r\n\nOf course, others are noticing that I smell like hot roasted dog shit and the comments are rolling in. I shared that this issue is not due to hygiene but no will believe me. Why? Oh, because my roommate is telling everyone that I do not shower. I figured that this is payback for the complaint that I shared of her. So after a couple of months of this, I contacted a sergeant of this issue. I figured that the best thing to do is for us to sit down with both of our NCOs and talk. That did not happen. This sergeant had tried but he later told me to ignore it. \r\n\nAround the same time all of this was happening, my NCO was causing me trouble. I had shared an office with another sergeant and that sergeant had lost an laptop. They framed me to protect him. My NCO, the person who I am supposed to trust with my life, said to my face, \u201cThat I am flirting with all the soldiers and that I am always letting them hang out in my office\u201d. \r\n\nOf course, everyone knew that was a fucking lie but I guess the Higher Ups were fooled. I was threaten that I will lose my terminal leave (vacation) and that they would force me to stay past my ETS date ( last day of contact). It had gotten to the point where I hated walking into the building and I started to hang out in my room. \r\n\nNow back to my roommate. Right before I had contacted a Sergeant, I was having my \u201cnormal\u201d diarrhea shits. As I walked out of the battle harden bathroom, my roommate was talking shit about me to her family. We locked eyes and she was begging me to do something. At that moment, I nearly lost control. I had spar with this girl before and fully aware of her lack of abilities. The sergeant that I had called reminded me that if I touch her, I will lose my honorable status. So i am fuck.\r\n\nOn hand, I have a roommate taking advantage of my condition. On the other, my NCO is looking for shit to ruin me. \r\n\nThis NCO continue to find a reason to write me up. Being a dumbass, I would sign it. After a few write ups, I was told that I will receive Chapter and I will lose my honorable status. I have less than three months left before I would start my terminal leave. I was presented in front of my First Sergeant and I was given the opportunity to explain myself. They ask me if I wanted to go through with this chapter and gave me time to think it over. Another NCO came to me and told me that I should fight it. Unfortunately, my name is Patrissia and I am a very dumb fucking person. \r\n\nI had spoken to three more NCOs about this and I came to a decision. I walked back into the office and I looked over my chain of command, \u201cI will accept this Chapter.\u201d\r\n\nI am not should how to write this but everyone pretty much left me alone afterward.\n\nI understand that I had a habit of talking about the military and I was getting better. I was complaining less often and kept it to personal conversation. The fall of 2018 was when I made the effort to stop. Prior to this harassment on the bus, I had brought up the military in private conversations a total of four times. \r\n\nYou guys just do not want to admit that you have no reason as to why my name is in your mouth. So you want me to kill myself. Jokes on you, cause I am a dumb fuck. Just calm down I know that the shit you have been through is a lot. A lot.. but before going and making rash decisions do some research, there is many other reasons that can make one smell. Maybe you are missing bacteria that eats the smelly bacteria in which case can be fixed by probiotics. You are a strong person I can tell. Focus all that energy tword finding something to help you out. And not going to lie if I had the body, you bet your ass I would be stripping lol. untaxed income? yes please (I normally do not put in my two cents but here I am) I am trying to calm down. I am just tried of people thinking they know my life. I go rock climbing, kayak, and so many things to relax myself. I am just mentality exhausted and wanted to vent. There is a YouTube site name bodyodorsufferers ( Body Odor Sufferers) He is conducting interviews with people like us who have body odors that is unexplainable. Listening to the interviews and his vlogs and Friday night chats have helped me tremendously. The struggle to deal with the hostile reactions, harassment and bullying is real but because of this YouTube channel I refuse to give up and I am dealing with the bullying a lot better. It is still hard but I do not give so much of my energy to it. I KNOW that I do not deserve to be mistreated, disrespected - Neither do you- and I KNOW that I am clean and do my best everyday to be hygienic. Stay strong and hang in there. In addition, there are other YouTube videos on TMAU that have helped all you have to do is search the name in YouTube. Becoming educated about it and talking to others that are going through it is very therapeutic. Good Luck!!! I am sorry to hear that you are going through this experience. It is HELL. Stay strong, sister. This very sad to hear,  I would love to hear an update on your situation. Also do you possibly have IBS?", "Im going to make a poll soon to see what we all have in common. If you have any ideas on good questions plz comment them.

PM me if you want to know more. TMAU type 2 can be cured! I cured mine. Thank you so much!!!! I will definitely give that a try! Yeah i think probiotics and then doing this stupid low fiber diet messed me up, cuz i just read now that the good non smelly bacteria in our colon needs fiber to survive. I prob been starving them out for years!!\n\nThank you for coming back with your cure! Dude, your life is about to turn around completely if you do this. please keep me updated. it makes me happy to see that I am helping somebody, and I swear I am smiling right now because when I became free from this, it was an incredible feeling of joy and freedom and I am glad that it is going to happen to you.

I feel robbed of my life. My daughter is 17 and going to dances and I feel nothing but stress because I will ruin it when she and her boyfriend cone in for pictures. I cannot get to know him and his family. I miss out on all life experiences. Each day is torture. I cannot believe no one will help us. Doctors just say you are crazy. They cannot smell you. What lies. It is criminal and inhumane. We are not counted as people who matter. No one cares to fight for our lives. Why do not our lives matter? No one should have to live this way. Could it possibly be your house? You have pets or kids? Any waste can linger a bad smell on your home, some even have to remove the flooring and repaint to get rid of certain smells.\n\nIf not, maybe the person that previously lived there. No, I am sure it is me. There is a particular smell, that I am said to embody. This is not one of those smells. Yes, it is awful. Do not give up though, have you looked around for other doctors? If I am in front of a fan, I smell the \u201csmell\u201d. It is faint though apparently compared to what others notice. What type of smell is that? Because biological smells come in a variety and can linger in your home. The typical TMAU smell. Rotten fish. Unfortunately, in my case I wish it was other things. However, it is not. So the real TMAU, not the one most people talk about on here, type 2 they call it. Well, at least you know you can do a low choline diet and that should solve the problem. Well, rotting fish, and apparently horse poop. However.. yes, but I would like it documented though. In case anyone, who lives next to me tries to get beside themselves and involve.. you know. Yes, I could do a low choline diet. It is awful though, ive tried it.. it did not do much for me. I was starving myself. After frantic searches for years before I knew what was wrong with me, and thousands of dollars in doctors, dentists gastro ents  bad breath doctors , they all told me the lie that they could not smell anything and were irritated and angry with me for bothering them with my paranoia is what they basically said. No compassion or care. We are throw aways. No one will develop a drug or any real ideas to help. Oh sure, maybe in five more years they might develop something and then two or more years to get it on the market. Meanwhile, I have missed all of my daughters special events or I will go and suffer the pain of humiliation or ruin the event for others. The doctors cannot help. We need real solutions. The recommended diets and supplements  are ridiculous. No one should have to live in fear every day. I am mostly  isolated now.  I hate that my family also suffer because I cannot socialize. it effects every aspect of life. Why is this ignored. This is living torture. We look normal but we have no human rights to live and enjoy ourselves and others. To be deprived of positive human interaction is complete devastation for me. All I can do is suffer. I went to 2 different doctors recently and they both could not smell it and overheard one of them saying I am probably being paranoid. I know the smell is there though due to rude comments I have received. It is so frustrating! So sorry. It is all so maddening. I had no idea there was such a horrible disease and I had this. Looking back it explains so many things when I could not understand why I lost a friendship or if someone acted weird. I had no idea during those times it was because of this curse. I thought I did something wrong. I could never have guessed this horror.

For years I have told him his symptoms are exactly in line with ORS, but he refuses to believe me or go to the psychiatrist with me. I spend a lot of time with him for over 10 years now, and I firmly believe he is delusional in his odors. We have even gotten a doctor to smell his feet and there was nothing.\n\n\nI came across these peer reviewed academic studies, and a lot of them seem to point to many people who believed they had TMAU actually being diagnosed with ORS (83%), which is also in line with anxiety and OCD disorders.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; This retrospective cohort study characterizes the clinical and demographic features of 54 individuals who presented to a Canadian genetics clinic for query trimethylaminuria (TMAU), an inherited disorder in which a pungent fishy odor is produced. The majority (83%) were found to have a likely diagnosis of ORS and a high rate (73.3%) of concomitant psychiatric disorders\n\n\nThere are many case studies of patients who suffered from ORS, mistakenly thinking they have TMAU if you search on Google with NCBI keyword. Some were treated with various medications and were able to live much happier lives, even if they did not get treatment until they were in their 50's.\n\n\nI am hoping this will help some people who are open minded enough to consider they have ORS and seek treatment. Please, if self-treatment at home and listening to the \"Gut War\" guy on YouTube is not helping, at least *try* psychiatric help. It is not like you will have to stick with the medication if you do not like it. \n\n\n&gt;It can be particularly challenging to engage delusional patients in treatment, as they are often doubtful whether psychiatric treatment can really help them. However, even patients who maintain that they have an actual physical problem can agree that they are suffering and have a poor quality of life.\n\n\nThe person I am trying to help refuses to go to the psychiatrist with me, and it breaks my heart because they think I am insulting them for being \"crazy\", when I am trying my dearest to make their life better. I wish you all open mindedness and healing, please do not push away people that are trying to help. Has your friend actually had comments from other people? \n\nI am someone who smells but doctors have never smelt me. It is incredibly frustrating when people try to tell me it is in my head. I know it is not because I remember very clearly many situations where people have made comments about my smell. \n\nI think TMAU or any other smell issue is much more common than ORS.\n\nThe bottom line should be if he can think of an exact few occasion where people have made it clear he smells. If he cannot think of any, then he may have ORS, but if he can list off a series ofpeople that have said something, then my bet is he does have a malodour problem but you cannot smell it Thanks for the reply. The instances of him being told he smells have been few and far between. The only example he is told me about was in college, where he gave a speech and then according to him, his professor told him in front of the class that \"his feet fucking smell\". I hate to frame people as liars, but I really feel like it is very unlikely for this to have happened and part of me wants to believe he imagined this due to his level of anxiety. His anxiety was probably through the roof while giving a speech, I have a hard time believing a professor would say something like that to a student in front of a class, and most importantly, I have no idea how someone would be able to smell his feet from a distance through his socks and shoes. People who are mentally ill hallucinate things all the time. I have even experienced borderline psychosis where I could hear a TV/radio playing, so I know that these things are possible to imagine.\n\n\nOther than that, any time I have been with him and he has gotten reactions, I see it clearly as him being overanxious in public and paranoid. This is coming from someone who hangs out with him almost everyday for the past decade, so I constantly see how he behaves and the extent of his OCD and anxiety. For example, someone touching their nose or sniffling, someone moving away, getting seat rearranged in class, etc. It is all ridiculous to me to analyze every single action as being caused by your feet smelling. And as I mentioned, there is no way that his smell is permeating through his socks and shoes, traveling several feet to someone is nose to the point that they can pinpoint where the odor is coming from. That just sounds absurd to me. People moving away and getting seats rearranged sound like reasonable evidence that there is a bad smell. I agree the professor probably did not say \u2018his feet fucking smell\u2019 but I have had teachers joke I am front of the class \u2018have you eaten too much cheese/fish?\u2019 Randomly on days that I smell. \n\nIt does not sound that unreasonable for the smell of feet to fill a room either. Sorry to say, your link is not the full paper, a little out-dated maybe, relevent yes, among a pethora of other related medical fields of research on this rare disease.\n\nI commend and admire your loyalty, love and care to your friend but I seriouly doubt one research paper constitutes you telling him he has ORS or for that matter you are qualified to advise he needs to see a psychiatrists? Personally I would not like it if any friend were to say I was delusional, crazy or otherwise. No disrespect to you but you maybe complicating the friendship or your 'helping' may be misconstrued?\n\nI do not doubt or question your truefullness. When a suffer has seen many different medical specialists who disbelieve you, who then do you trust or turn? It is complicated enough for us deal with the psychosocial aspects of this disorder let alone find the 'right' medical or social support to find answers? Have other common medical conditions been eliminated e.g Leak Gut, Crohn's...Celiacs, autoimune to name a few etc?\n\nWhen you watch his behaviour in a social setting he demonstrates all the common behaviours of someone with TMAU (also commonly known as Fish Odor Syndrome) I can assure you on another forum site there are 3500 global TMAU members (tested, untested, unsure) who identify with his behaviour and recognise your disbelieving attitude. Anxiety, depression, diet, supplements and social rejection are an extention of this disorder and the 'norm' for us that identify with TMAU1 or TMAU2. Forum sites/subsites like Reddit are few and far between.\n\nTMAU is a rare disease. Please do not use Youtube as a reference. There is/are significant reseach in this area as early as 1976 to current.

Hello, I have been dealing with this situation for years like everyone here and it is very draining mentally, but I honestly do not believe I have TMAU because I was not always like this and I believe the root cause could be something else. I have a question, how many of you have issues with digestion? Pretty sure it is the same for me. I remember it prominently starting when I was around 15 but it could have easily started before without me knowing. I have lots of issues with my stomach and digesting which started around the same time too. Certain foods will make my stomach hurt until I am able to pass it, which is often difficult and abnormal, to put it nicely. The pain and difficult happens at least once every two days for the past 6 years to my counting.\n\nI have not been diagnosed with anything specific, just giving my experience. Yeah I have those same issues as well with certain foods. Have you ever tried cleansing your colon? I have thought about it using some supplements called Dr. Tobias I believe? But I have not done it yet since I was not positive if it was a great idea especially without a professional opinion. I never heard of it but read where if you have a bad diet then over time you will have a lot of build up in your colon which causes constipation and basically releases all those toxins through your skin. most of those who just change their diet and see no results may be able to fix it with cleansing the colon first. Celiac? I am not sure but over time due to the diet most ppl eat most of us have so much build up inside our intestines that the body cannot eliminate on its own so we would need to cleanse. Not saying it will work for everyone but for the ones that it just happened to out nowhere it could be a start if not the cure. How do you cleanse i have been drinking kefir with results and water fasting By colon cleansing. There is a product called magnesium citrate that helps ppl with constipation, you would need to have like 1 or 2 free days because you will stay on the toilet a lot. I am not a doctor so if you think about using it please contact your doctor or do your research before using it. I have definitely had a bad diet since forever (as a result of being poor but also bad decisions) so I am keen to try it. I was just skeptical and wanted a professional opinion first. Yeah I understand, but yeah that would be a start if you could do it and then just go from there if not just doing that alone does not work out at first, but that is only if you truly do not have TMAU though.

Hi everybody,\nI saw a post in another subreddit, from just a couple of hours ago, from a 19-year-old person with TMAU. He/she is seriously considering suicide, and seems to be depressed and has a persistent negative view of themself because of having TMAU. The post is at  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf any of you could message the original poster in this linked post, that would be amazing. Please, if even one or two of you could reach out to this user and offer to talk, share your own experience, or support him/her a little, that would mean a lot. I do not want to see someone believe they are worthless or not every bit as deserving of a good life as everyone else. I do not want this struggling person to kill themself. All of us over on the original post are trying to be supportive, but we do not have the experiential understanding that people with TMAU have. Sidenote: you are all awesome. Everything I have seen on this subreddit in my brief few minutes here has been good people sharing, talking, being a community, and being supportive. I am truly, honest to God (not meaning to offend anyone who is not religious) grateful that each and every one of you is here, and living your life. Thanks for listening. Thanks for your post. I shared my experience on that subreddit. It is a great feeling to know some good can come out of this horrible condition. \n\nTo give hope to others suffering too. Thanks, it really means a lot that you did that. I am sure it meant a lot more to the original poster over there.\nGood on you! It is so great to see good come out of adversity, and giving hope to others is one of the best things anyone can do. People simply knowing that they are not alone is a powerful thing, too. Now, there is a young guy out there who has heard your voice, and knows that you get it. Anyway, I am just super glad that you decided to share your experience. I think you are a great, kind person! Thanks Sooooo I thought I had TMAU for a couple years because my lab results for various tests came back negative or normal and I did not have any other symptoms other than a foul, putrid, sweet smell that sometimes smelled like maple syrup and sometimes like ammonia. However- and this is a big \u201chowever\u201d- I found out I actually had e coli bacteria in my system. E coli has a strange smells to it. It is usually described as RANCID, PUTRID, FOUL, SWEET and like AMMONIA. It varies often. If you are experiencing these smells and your blood tests have come back normal, I strongly suggest that you do an e coli culture test. I smelled horrible for 2 years! Usually e coli in the system can cause sepsis and death if it goes untreated so I am surprised that I dealt with it for so long but I am finally receiving treatment for it and the smell is finally subsiding. I was praying for a healing for a long time. Then I read that this one guy fasted for 21 days and took probiotics tablets the entire time until he was able to cleanse his gut out and then his symptoms went away. I believe that when he fasted he starved the e coli bacteria in his gut. As for me, I am currently taking Cephalexin 500 MG capsules 3 times a day, fasting and continuing with prayer and it is working. Also, you may want to see if you have BV if you have not done so already. BV produces a FISHY odor. I was informed by my doctor that both could take up to 3 treatments over the span of 3 months to get rid of completely because the treatments only kill up to 70% of the bacteria each time. Both the E coli and BV treatments are not to be taken at the same time. So you would go one week with one treatment and another week or two with the other. Let me just say that Dr. Diana Yan in Gaithersburg, MD, USA was the only doctor out of the 9 doctors I met with over the past two years to inform me in detail what my treatment was, what caused the rotten smell that my body was producing and how the different bacteria react to their treatments. I am so thankful for her. What if TMAU is just e coli in people with strong immune systems? I hope you all find this information to be helpful.\n\nFYI, the smell is almost completely gone and I am only half way through my first treatment. I am cured of it! I had it for two years. I prayed to God and he answered my prayers. After going to more than 8 doctors and having this condition cause an issue at work and social environments, I can say I am finally healed.\nI went to a doctor who told me I had e-coli that was causing the rotten smell. The doctor said that it would take about 3 months for me to be healed. I started taking antibiotics for 2 weeks, completed a diet with mostly sauerkraut, kefir milk(it is sour), probiotics, ginger tea, hardly any sugar, prayed about it so much, had worst days then better ones, tried to eat only the items listed above so that it could have the best effect and, thank God, the smell is completely gone. Today I have been 3 days without a case. I have eaten eggs, beef and other foods and I have no odor. I smell clean. I did this for approximately 3 weeks. I pray that you are healed, too. \n\n-I drank Kefir milk from Lifeway/Maple Hill- it is supposed to taste sour. (2-3 bottles/day)\n-saurkraut about 11oz a day (this helped dramatically)\n-probiotics for bv and e-coli( 1 week each -never take them together)\n-ginger and lemon tea \n-probiotic and oregano oil capsules \n-plenty\n-one regular meal a day\n\n-I brush my teeth with Tom\u2019s fennel tooth paste to remove the sour milk smell from my breath. This works better than mint. \n\nI started on this on 8/3/20 and am on 8/26/20 without symptoms. I have been 3 days (give and take some hours) without them.\n\n-Prayer and trust in God was so helpful in this time. Do not forget about God so that He heals you.\n\n\nBlessings to you!!!", "Can you smell yourself and what is the smell like? Once this started (2 years ago) I could kind of and still can smell myself in my groin and pits. To me it does not even smell that bad, like just bad BO, but definitely smells different than I did before I started getting reactions. I also get a taste in my mouth which tastes how my pits and groin smell.\n\nIt is funny because when I smell myself, it never smells bad enough for me to think it is *that* bad but yet, I still fill entire rooms.\n\nJust wondering what others experiences are with their smell and also if you guys also taste your smell in your saliva. Thanks. I cant but people seem to think its a farty/fecal smell. Its not always there tho. \n\nDairy makes it worst followed by eggs for me personally. Fish doesnt seem that bad really. Ugh mine was terrible in the past but no matter how bad it was, for whatever reason I could only get a whiff when having a panic attack. It was like a fecal or sulfur smell.\n\nIt is great that you are able to detect your smell more often. I think that is really going to help you see what things work for curing this thing.\n\nSince yours is a general body odor smell, have you tried Hibiclens?? If your smell is caused by a rogue skin bacteria colony it should help to eliminate it. It is recommended for diagnosed tmau patients since it removes tmao from the skin too. \n\nIf the odor continues even after the Hibiclens it could be your diet. Like too much spices in your food, too much onion or red meat. Def worth a try My smell is musty, fecal, and burning odor. Rarely fish. I can smell it on my underwear. I always wonder why my underwear smells so musty but after I take the manuka honey and collagen drink my underwear never smell again. But i still have nasal bad breath. I have both Manuka honey and Collagen at home..I will try them both Btw i reccomend adding zinc and other vitamins with l-glutathione u can check it out in r/LeakyGutSyndrome there is a picture of that product How long after beginning the drink did you see improvements in your smell? About 1-2 weeks but i have been drinking it for a month and my symptom improve alot like 80% some times in my nose but since it has good curculation it goes away It is better but not completely resolved for me. Superglue mixed with fecal, burning sometimes and meat. \nPlus I grew up in a smoking household so add cigarettes to that as well. \nCurrently I smell fecal, meat and maybe burning. But better compared to before. I can smell it but it is less offensive to me compared to others. I cannot smell it all the time. It is interesting when the body is in a heightened state of stress you can smell it more..I have the same theory for me, except it does not take a panic attack, sometimes just social anxiety along with the insane fear or smelling bad to others. This superglue scent, is it like that of plastic kind of? I am not sure how to answer. When I sweat and it gets on my clothes it smells like superglue. Open some super glue and sniff, that smell is almost exactly one of the odors. I do not know if that counts as plastic or not. This does not happen every time but the longer I sweat the more likely. Then add fecal fart, ammonia plus meat. The ratio changes each day. Again for me it is better compared to 5 years ago but not perfect. How did you managed to solve your smell? Mine's the same too, fecal.. Hey there! I believe mine was solved by major diet changes and relieving chronic constipation issues. \n\nI used to eat a diet heavy in meat and dairy (since it was cheaper than greens) and this itself can cause rotten egg body odor in any person tmau or not. \n\nThen I started taking 20g-30g of fiber every day. I had a lot of difficulty fully eliminating like.. after using the restroom it always felt like more was unable to pass. Starving myself / water fasts made it worse. I do have to occasionally use a reusable enema to fully empty. I think this was the main source of the smell.\n\nI am still nearly always paranoid about smelling again. So I started therapy sessions too. So there would always be a person to let me know if there was a bad odor, or if I was smelling normal. I trust therapists more than my doctor's word on it.\n\nIf you think you may have legit tmau, here is a good link with tips from a diagnosed patient on controlling the odor.  Thanks for this thread, I like to see regular additions to the list of common scents.\n\nMine ranges from sulfur, ammonia, to fishy on the skin and varies by my diet. Scalp is more pungent and mildewy with a sulfur undertone. Groin gets a burnt rubber scent if I eat too much yeast (bread, pizza, pretzels, etc). \n\nI can detect my scalp pretty regularly if I wear my hair loose. If I keep my hair bunned and shampoo with medicated cleanser, I cannot detect my scalp.\n\nI cannot detect while wearing, but after removing clothing, I can detect a sulfurous scent normally. \n\nThe only supplement that helps me is zeolite. Has to be taken on an empty stomach, and lasts for about 8-12 hours. Reduces symptoms by about 60% at a 5 gram dosage. Mine is a musty smell. I could smell it up until last year. I had a really bad infection and after taking a lot of antibiotics, I think it really messed up my stomach and I lost the ability to smell my odor. I cannot smell it anymore. When I take collagen I can get a whiff of it.\n\nI am hoping to start taking a lot of collagen, but now collagen gives me really bad constipation. It never used to in the past, but as I stated, my stomach is now impaired worst than it was in the past. I know for a fact it is because I developed terrible acid reflux, which I have never had in my life. I also developed some autoimmune issues. I am only able to be okay because I found a leaky gut powder and it has helped tremendously.\n\nSomeone lately said I smell like shit, but me and her were in a feud, so maybe she was being honest or just talking shit. Also, I went to get vaccinated at a drive-in test site recently and I barely interacted with the man who gave me the form to fill out and he gave me one of the strongest reactions that I have ever gotten. He even notified the whole damn vaccine test site. When I was in the wait area to be observed, the lady was giving me a $15 coupon and another lady who works there, purposely came over and stated that she is there to help, when I know she only came over there to be nosy and to see if I smelled bad (I saw her touching her nose). \n\nMy brother said I smell like outside, so I hope it is still a musty smell and not something worst, like fecal bo.

I had them done probably a little over a decade ago. I think this may be the issue. I watch this holistic healer and not a quote but essentially said that metal fillings harm the ability to digest food properly. Something about b2 vitamins not absorbing as well anymore.

You cant bro jus work on your self \ud83d\ude22 and try cure it Look for anosmics and parosmics. Impossible. I may be coming from a place of ignorance but, from what I can tell not everyone can detect the odor. I feel like I have this horrible affliction and some react and some do not. I would say pray about it and ask for a cure, understanding, and that person (s) to enter your life. I feel your pain though. THE STRUGGLE IS REAL. true lol truly impossible Honestly Eightsmorethanenough is correct some can smell it some cannot I am dating someone we been together two years and have a child together he is never reacted to it but he does not have a good sense of  smell either he has allergies so maybe that is why but a lot of people can pick it up I would say go on a dating site get to know someone personality first and let them learn you and then explain your condition before meeting them I did that first and we been together two years now after text messaging and phone calls to wheel them in and when it is time to meet let them know Some people lie about smelling it. It is infuriating. Honestly, I am getting married next year. I stink, and it can be horrendous. The point is, the right person will migrate towards you.. and will love you no matter what. Before I was proposed to, I had flings too. Just be you. Do you have type 1, and or 2? How do get along with his family? It is not impossible. There are many sufferers who have partners. I get along with his mom pretty good but have not been around his other family much he does not go around them at all from something that happened in the past concerning his brother I am not sure if I have type 1 or 2 never got the test Not all environments bring out the odor either. Some environments, let us say more humid areas, are more prone to allowing smells to linger or spread.\n\nSome places with an absence of other odors OR the prescence of certain odors bring it out strongly.\n\nSome people just cannot smell It as you stated. I have noticed if they like you they cannot smell you until the person that can smell you tells them like one of their friends or co-workers", "How do I find out I smell I am going insane here do not know who to turn to Most people are not going to comment on it but many of them cannot hide their body language.\n\n-touching their noses, putting a finger beneath their nostril\n-sniffing a lot\n-coughing - if its bad they will start retching (*for coughing in general im starting to feel like most of it is voluntary...like when other ppl enter the area, they start coughing to tell them \"that smell wasnt me\")\n-rubbing their eyes or just playing with their face a lot. Probably to subtly push away the bad air\n-making a weird sound with their nose, like you can hear them push out the air very quickly from their nose. Like when you have some snot and have to blow your nose lol\n-if you see them walking really fast past you and then slow down after they got a good distance away\n-people always leaving a wide distance between you and them. If you get close suddenly a lot of ppl leave\n\n-men will lift their shirt collar over their nose\n-women will take out lotion/lip balm and put it on their wrist, upper lip, whatever and smell it. Or just take out their perfume and spritz it in the air. Wish I could just die already It is hard as hell but do not give up hope. There is a lot of possible reasons behind the smell, it make take some time but you can get cured. Bodyodor777.com has a lot of possible diseases that can cause such odors.\n\nAnd if it is really tmau there is a diet that can lessen the smell. And they are going into human testing for this one cure for it right now. Hey, thanks for that website. I was looking online for a list of possible causes (other than tmau) and this has a lot more than what I found!", "TMAU Cure I am No Fraud.  What is your opinion on water kefir?", "Thanksgiving Family coming over tips to reduce fecal odor? \nIm water fasting I am scared to eat I also get excessive gas even when I eat healthy... Ugh and Ammonia odor Also does anyone else ever feel like there is sweat dripping from their anus? I keep getting that sensation and there is nothing there Probaly paranoid i get that sometimes after a long work out also drink kefir and stay mainly on a veg diet I smell worse when I eat too.. I dun understand why. Activated charcoal worked for me for about 20% of the odor If I can politely offer my personal opinion OP, I would reconsider water fasting. If there is no food going in you then it is unlikely you will be able to poop normally. I think you would feel better eating 30g of fibre over the course of the day and drinking plenty of water so you can have normal poops and feel empty. I always feel more confident having been able to empty my bowel properly\n\nTry to concentrate on easy things that are likely to help such as breathing exercises to reduce stress, focussing intensely on the conversation/ colours you can see at the table / etc to distract you from thinking smell smell smell. You cannot go wrong drinking Lots of water (I do not mean so much that it is a chore to drink, I mean like 2-3litres) \n\nWith the dripping feeling, do you secrete any mucus? Does it feel hot around there too? It is close to Christmas time. Three years ago I ask for a treadmill for Christmas.( spouse bought it for me) best decision I ever made. When I feel like Im back up or had a cheat day to the extreme I drink some strong coffee with no cream. AND do three miles or more. For days after I am good because I sweat it out my pores at home. I take a shower only eat things with no sugar or soy for the next couple days. Hit the movies, store or mall.If u cannot afford a treadmill  there are portable saunas on Amazon. I had this for years before treadmill. But stay hydrated!!\n Oh I use Dove Soap the sensitive bar. I have a reaction to so many other soaps. But that one works. GOOD Luck &amp; Happy Thanksgiving I usually stay to myself. Just not worth the hassle. just make shakes with lots of fruit and veggie", "Foods and their choline contents I noted. Might be helpful. Taken from nutritionvalue.org  Thank you for posting. I am surprised to see that coffee is so low. Eggs, cheese, coffee (probably the sugar and cream) tomatoes (salsa) all make my breath smell horrendous! No problem. The coffee was specifically espresso black coffee, no sugar or milk.

The next pay check, orgasmic food, video games, someone who loves you, people you will never meet but share the same symptoms you do. \n\nThanks for existing I often want to kill myself even though I have so many people who care about me and a family to support.\n\nI do not know what to do besides an extreme diet and I will have to watch my cranky attitude then.\n\nIf I worked at home it might not be bad. But i do not, nor do I work in a completely outdoor environment but not complete office environment. Honestly there are more days like that. Of feeling like a burden or maybe the world would be better with one less smelly person. It really does when trying to explain to anyone, but get hit with the hygiene comments.\n\nYet we got to find things to get up for. We are more than our smell. \n\n\nIt was like a glitch in the matrix for my co workers because on one hand they would not want to be stuck with me in an elevator or enclosed spaces on the other they enjoyed the conversations (at a distance in open spaces) and a different perspective. With what we have, some of us tend to either be more withdrawn and observant.\n\nTrying all the diets and apple cider vinegar / washing with baking soda /hydrogen peroxide- for me it did not work till you find reason for the routine. Like what does it do (not just doing it because it worked for other people). \n\nThis what I changed in my routine (it does not have to be what works for you).\n\nI have to sweat it out because it helps remove toxins. \n\nSecond would be 3 days of low choline diet and activated charcoal (do not take if you take medication, activated charcoal will remove it) at the end of the day.\n\n&gt; Those are to make sure the body removes most of what we have eaten in processed food. We will smell a lot here and before I use to be hella disheartened and wanted comfort food.\n\nAfter 3 days of low choline and activated charcoal, introduced prebiotic with kefir (water or milk kefir - find what works with you). What this does is introduce good gut bacteria, the prebiotic helps facilitate the growth. First time taking it recommend twice a day on an empty stomach.\n\nIt took 2 months for me to be almost normal. I introduced regular food I use to stay away from slowly, but the onions and certain foods really kick my ass. My body odor lessened but my breath still stinks Oh yo here is a site that helped me with low choline diet  It is hard because I do not know what works. A skin probiotic soap I used, I thought made it worse for sure but I cannot always smell it, I can be desensitized.\n\nHumidity makes it noticable for me too.\n\nAlso kefir or kombucha (more than a couple of sips) has seemed to cause some other type of odor for me making it worse. maybe if I stick to it, it might work but it just seems hard when I cannot always consistently smell it neither can my SO.\n\nIt honestly only comes out strong when in public, I am slightly sweaty and somewhat humid environment. This means office rooms when there are more than two people, outdoor when it is humid as heck, in restaraunts, etc.\n\nI have Soo many reasons to find a routine, and I cannot seem to find a good diet one.\n\nTwo months on a specific routing worked for you? How did you know it would work I initially.\n\nAlso, some good bacteria for your body is not always good smelling, but can be better than the ones with terrible smells and are toxic like c diff. And with extra nutrients, even good bacteria can smell bad.\n\nI have always thought of doing a diet change like you did of certain foods then getting a fecal transplant from someone I know has a neutral smell and is healthy.\n\nI might do kefir again just in smaller amounts along with diet change.\n\nI absolutely need to stay away from cream and milk for some reason, especially cream like the topping stuff in the can. \n\nThanks for the advice. I wish you only the best. Probiotic soap made me smell too and the sulfur soap lmao that was bad news. Usually unscented helps. But you are right different things work for different people. Hang in there okay? We are all in this together, bud.\n\n\nI am lactose intolerant, so have to avoid the good stuff for awhile. I did smell with kefir though for the first few weeks, kind of yeasty. I noticed it working when my dad could sit next to me when we eat. He still turns his face away when I talk though. My sister is also blunt and going to stores less reactions (even with a mask my breath smells outwards). \n\n\n\nWhen we sweat or humid it seems like the air is heavier around us, no? Tuna is labeled with 0 choline? Tofu, a bunch of other stuff.  0mg does seems wrong for some of these. Some of these can be mistyped but can help with low choline. I know which are trigger foods for me and tweaked the recipe with another ingredient. The tuna is actually around 25 mg of choline for canned which is less than meat when drained 3 ounces. I just take out the liquid, rinse with water and drain it.  Yeah, humidity will cause odors to come out, skin bacteria to work harder causing more odor, and maybe even allowed people to breathe easier and absorb odors by their nose sensors easily. \n\nNot to say I have not smelled a the odor in very dry conditions, I have. But maybe in these conditions the volatile odorous compounds evaporate and dissipate easily so it is not as noticable.\n\nSweat will make humidity in a room for sure and adding to the issue IMO, aside sweating the actual bad compounds. This is great, thanks. Utterly more disappointing than the other one though, the ones closer to the bottom or middle. But o well, life is life. If I do not want to stink I will stick with it. Ah, I was thinking of tuna and salmon like sushi.\n\nI love raw sushi unfortunately. Off topic but have you been alright during quarantine? Weirdly I feel a bit more better with social distancing and masks, but some people seem more aggressive or tired I have mixed feelings. My odor issue has been an issue before but became worse a year before covid and even worse during, I also changed medication so maybe I am just more aware of it now. It is been bad because the lack of movement and social interaction makes it difficult to know when I smell or how to behave around people if I do smell.\n\nIt is been such a blessing though because without it, I do not know that I would be here from the depression from the interactions from others.\n\nPerfect timing to have an issue like this huh? Also found a position to where when it goes back to norm, I will not be around as many people even though I am around people now it is few and infrequent. Took a  30% pay cut.\n\nI am troubled though because when we go normal, my paranoia will be worse when it does, even with a good diet, any issue will be devastating like someone saying what is that smell or people scooting away. \n\nI am just praying the folks who do not need to be at work for my job can just stay at home forever from now on. These are the folks I would be having meetings with periodically that I am worried about. These folks that can make judgement calls on my career or if I get to keep my job or look down on me for \"bad hygiene.\" We hear you, if you need to vent we gotchu. There are also private  Facebook groups like MEBO so people on your feed will not read the posts- they have a good support system.

Why has Joshua got to flex on us lol", "For those that have tried the low choline diet, how long did it take before you noticed a reduction in your odor?  For me it is not about trying or not trying, it is just one of those things that you have to do. The chemistry for making trimethylamine is known, and choline in one of the main proteins that is direct cause of TMA in the stomach (Google \"tma choline\" for endless papers).\n\nie; from the first paper in my google list \"Abstract: Choline is a water-soluble nutrient essential for human life. Gut microbial metabolism of choline results in the production of trimethylamine (TMA), which, upon absorption by the host is converted into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in the liver.\"\n\nThe bad smell of TMAU is TMA (unabsorbed as we are kind of broken) oozing out your pores. Reducing the amount of choline in your system has a direct relationship with the amount of TMA and thus, smell.\n\nIt is a shame that it is 'essential for human life' :/ I would start off strict for a few months and then start re-introducing some medium choline foods as you are comfortable. I think it taks a while to get the excess TMA out of your system - go get some exercise and get sweaty, try to flush it out in a controlled way.\n\nSorry I cannot be more clear on how long it takes, for the last 20 years I have never not been restricting choline. I have been experimenting with eating some fish occasionally over work from home lockdowns; some are not too bad, but one oceany fish (that was smelly even before cooking) made me flare up bad for a few days. do a parasite cleanse all the way, then do low choline diet with kefir shakes and you will smell way less.

I also notice the smell after about 3 hours of sitting which I do for work, so i will go to my car and spray some more cologne on. How long have you been dealing with this now? with winter coming we at least will be sweating less and hopefully everyone around is has a clogged nose lol Rt every since elementary ig 8 years noticeably if that makes sense reactions from people Honestly, I think it is all in the mind. Whatever you tell yourself, the mind will believe and the body will act accordingly. Say affirmations at night, and in the morning when you wake up . \u201cI am clean on the inside and out.\u201d \u201cI smell fine.\u201d Stuff like that. Ignore what people say because all that matters is what you think of yourself. What you feed will grow so try to think positively about yourself and all aspects of life. You have value, do not let what anybody says impact how you feel. A suggestion I have, is fresh squeezed Celery juice( do your research). It is been working for people with TMAU, and they have been able to live normal comfortable lives. You may also be suffering from anxiety, depression, and a little paranoia so another thing I suggest is magnesium citrate (do your research). You got this. Keep you are head up because things WILL get better for you! what diet are you on? None None Currently  low fodmap low choline only work for a couple  weeks then it comes right back so it is pointless to try and starve myself for something I have no control over This is real not mind over matter I know I am clean having this this disease does not make us dirty ill try to save some money for a juicer but taking the magnesium citrate broke my skin out bad thanks I will Understandable.

People follow me around in stores! Trying to see if I  smell. It such a problem that I do not even talk to my spouse  about it anymore. Because he do not understand or believes me  Says the same B.S that person said in that comment above. Mind over matter. U do not get it. U do not have this issue. U do not wake up every f*cking morning thinking what can I eat that will not make me smell today. U have not had this problem since u were a child. U was not  anorexic for 3 years off and on while in middle school. This person is looking for help.. Asking is there anything she can actually do.. To make things easier.. If she could just make the smell go away.. some how.. Or even for a time. Or take something that would make everyday easier in a way.That would help.. I know because  I have TMAU. And I hit my breaking point years ago.For Years her mind is effect by this shit after all the years of stress and depression  this person goes thru. But mind over matter?! Seriously.

Could you post on here so it could benefit everyone what might not work for me could possibly help someone else I feel your pain. I have been so afraid to get a job because of people. I was thinking of starting my own business but my parents really want me to either study or work. I decided to start going on a strict diet to see if it will help. If you look up the gut war on YouTube it could help. I am starting tomorrow on clean eating and hopefully that helps me out. And yes stress makes it worse. I have bad anxiety and might go to see someone so that I can get medication in helping me out with my nerves. Also thinking about seeing a nutritionist and telling them about TMAU so that way we can work on it together Ty I  will hope everything goes well let me know I hope you find a solution to this and yes I will keep you updated I have been followed in stores also and people have had their phones pointed towards me. This all started to happen after some neighbors moved in. I remember a couple months after their move, when I would walk down the stairs that face their backyard, there would be a bright camera flash, I was always confused why someone was always taking photos Everytime I walked down the stairs. I then started to see that they were actually taking photos of me. I came to this realization during quarantine. I would rarely leave my home but Everytime I left, their daughter would run to the screen by her backyard and point her phone directly at me. I could then tell that she was taking pictures because this happened like clockwork Everytime I left my home during quarantine. Also the reason she ran and then would point her phone towards me made it obvious. So basically I know that these people created a hatepage about me because ever since Summer 2018, I would hear people say \" Ew that is the girl from online. She is so nasty\" and these incidents happened to me even 50-100 miles away from my home when I was traveling. I would have people point and say that I am smelly and they heard about me online which is creepy how my own privacy has been taken away from me by those creeps neighbors. The creepy part of all this is that these weirdos would take photos of me Everytime I left which creeps me out how there are possibly hundreds of photos floating around me on the internet. Photos of me in sweats for the whole world to see. It honestly gives me the creeps that possibly even pedophiles and predators have possibly seen me because I am exposed online.

Yeah a low ph soap (5.5-6.5) What brand of charcoal soap?? I might give SebaMed a try.. I use dove soap and old spice anti perspirant deodorant. Baking soda (never with bleach) in the laundry. Activated charcoal and chlorophyll after meals helps at the source.  i get some reaction still tho only a phew a day Yeah try it out. When I read the reviews, ppl complained about it being bright green &amp; they mentioned it having a strong perfume smell. The color did not bother me and I did not think the smell was strong. Let me know if you like it Hmm. I think I am going to try out the baking soda in the laundry. Never tried it. And what chlorophyll brand do you take? Thanks \ud83d\udc9b GNC super foods triple chlorophyll. Yea the baking soda helps to properly clean the chemical from them. Just make sure not to mix it with bleach, you will get mustard gas and nobody wants that. Do you get reactions if you take them Activated charcoal dove for men Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.\n\nI have checked 84,457,041 comments, and only 23,021 of them were in alphabetical order. Does it smell really masculine??? I do not want to smell like a guy Nah its allright. But Sebamed and all ph neutrals are good. The dove charcoal is cheap tho around 2,50 for 400ml I still do sweat a little bit but I am vastly more comfortable after taking them. I tend to feel too warm after food as well and that also abates after taking one of each. It works through adsorption. The trimethylamine adheres to the large surface area of the chlorophyll and charcoal.", "I told my parents I told my parents about TMAU and they called me crazy and started laughing at me. They said it was all in my head and that all teenagers stink. I knew they would not understand but at least my mom said she would make an appointment with my doctor to explain my symptoms. After seeing numerous posts about people discussing their symptoms to their doctors, it is safe to say that I am not too thrilled about this. However,  I still have hope that my doctor will understand and research TMAU like I did. I will make sure to tell them everything I know about it. Prepare some very specific, bulletproof  examples of times people have directly said you smell. They will first try to establish whether you do actually smell or not. Be prepared to argue your case yea i can relate my parents think im going batshit crazy with my smell i told them abot tmau and they didnt belive me Dont worry you dont smell at all times. They mean well but they will never understand Ignore your parents. Do what you got to do to survive", "To anyone on this sub who has this (probably a lot of you), does the disease affect your life a lot? I am a teen who suffers from this. I have noticed that my body and breath smell like fish and honestly despite the smell being quite bad, I rarely actually get bullied for it. I would not call myself popular but at the same time I am not bullied 24/7 for it, I honestly just kind of exist. People do not really talk to me but they do not really give me shit either. I have been called stinky before and been told my breath stinks but moments like that are very few and far between, usually about once a year at most. I cannot tell whether I am kind of an outcast because I am either boring or maybe people avoid because I smell bad, but either way I would rather have it like it is now than be bullied loads. So how about you other folks? Sooooo I thought I had TMAU for a couple years because my lab results for various tests came back negative or normal and I did not have any other symptoms other than a foul, putrid, sweet smell that sometimes smelled like maple syrup and sometimes like ammonia. However- and this is a big \u201chowever\u201d- I found out I actually had e coli bacteria in my system. E coli has strange smells to it. It is usually described as RANCID, PUTRID, FOUL, SWEET and like AMMONIA. It varies often. If you are experiencing these smells and your blood tests have come back normal, I strongly suggest that you do an e coli culture test. I smelled horrible for 2 years! Usually e coli in the system can cause sepsis and death if it goes untreated so I am surprised that I dealt with it for so long but I am finally receiving treatment for it and the smell is finally subsiding. I was praying for a healing for a long time. Then I read that this one guy fasted for 21 days and took probiotics tablets the entire time until he was able to cleanse his gut out and then his symptoms went away. I believe that when he fasted he starved the e coli bacteria in his gut. As for me, I am currently taking Cephalexin 500 MG capsules 3 times a day, fasting and continuing with prayer and it is working. Also, you may want to see if you have BV if you have not done so already. BV produces a FISHY odor. I was informed by my doctor that both could take up to 3 treatments over the span of 3 months to get rid of completely because the treatments only kills up to 70% of the bacteria each time. Both the E coli and BV treatments are not to be taken at the same time. So you would go one week with one treatment and another week or two with the other. I wish you all the best!", "any advice? I do not know if I have tmau or not. I literally bought so many deodorant, remedy soaps, bought so many towels, new clothes and done many things. I try the my best to stay clean as possible and nothing works. Bro I am a senior in highschool and literally everyone covers their nose and try to clear out there throats around me. I sat next to this girl in class and she got up and moved multiple times. I can tell I give a good radius of my B.O as well. It fucking sucks. I tried everything to my laundry washer, airing out my room keeping clean. I do not know what to do. How about your diet? Has the biggest impact", "Organising for funding and awareness As a community can we organise fundraising for TMAU research? I have not seen much organised lobbying of any kind. If we get together I am sure there is a lot we can do... Our best shot at a treatment would be either Dr. Hazen's TMA-blocker or other developers who have TMA-blockers in clinical trials for preventing heart disease.\n\nFortunately for us, there is a whole lot of medical and financial support behind TMA-blockers for cardiovascular health, so it is a pretty solid bet that treatment will be available in the near future. (a rareconnect post summarizing the release of TMA blockers) \n\nHowever, malodor conditions still need national recognition. I apologize because i am uneducated on these TMA-blockers, but will they help get rid of this smell? If your specific condition is TMAU, then yeah the TMA blockers would help. That is pretty cool. I want to set up some kind of fundraising where I run marathons/ climb mountains etc. for donations. While at the same time raising awareness for this disease. It only takes one person to start for others to join on board. If you have Facebook there is a group called MEBO Support. Honestly, I think money would do little good. Even if we raised a few thousand to donate to a scientific laboratory, it would not be anywhere near enough to fund a project. I am pretty sure no good would come of raising money and trying to invest in a scientific cure. \n\nHowever, I think it is a great idea to do the climbing/ etc to raise awareness. The more people that know about the condition, the more sympathetic people will be and we will be judged less and receive fewer nasty reactions. I think this costs less but is more effective. \n\nAnother good idea would be collating everyone is success stories and tips from RareConnect, Reddit, Discord, Facebook groups, and any others. Information is out there and spotting patterns in all that data could be useful for us.", "Does your smell vary often? I am a bit confused rn. I have seen a lot of people on here talk about how they have had different smells over the years and stuff but for the about 4 years I have had TMAU now I have always smelled of rotten fish. Is it normal to not change smell? Honestly I kind of want my smell to change because I hate the smell of rotten fish and even though I have said before I do not really get bullied or anything, I can still smell myself and I hate that constant lingering smell of fish. Sooooo I thought I had TMAU for a couple years because my lab results for various tests came back negative or normal and I did not have any other symptoms other than a foul, putrid, sweet smell that sometimes smelled like maple syrup and sometimes like ammonia. However- and this is a big \u201chowever\u201d- i found out I actually had e coli bacteria in my system. E coli has strange smells to it. It is usually described as PUTRID, FOUL, SWEET and like AMMONIA. It varies often. If you are experiencing these smells and your blood tests have come back normal, I strongly suggest that you do an e coli culture test. I smelled horrible for 2 years! Usually e coli in the system can cause sepsis and death if it goes untreated so I am surprised that I dealt with it for so long but I am finally receiving treatment for it and the smell is finally subsiding. I was praying for a healing for a long time. Then I read that this one guy fasted for 21 days and took probiotics tablets the entire time until he was able to cleanse his gut out and then his symptoms went away. I believe that when he fasted he starved the e coli bacteria in his gut. As for me, I am currently taking Cephalexin 500 MG capsules, fasting and continuing with prayer and it is working. I hope u do not mind but I posted ur cured story to the subreddit. I put the links to your original post and also put ur username.", "Fecal TMAU research People with Fecal BO- do you usually have constipation/ incomplete bowel movements?\n\n( YES 85% of people with Fecal BO that replied to the poll have constipation and/or incomplete bowel movements. This is really interesting Yep tmau type 2 is linked to gut", "anyone want to talk about stuff? who is online, anyone want to talk? I just got back with hanging in the mall, it is so weird going out now. I am use to house clothes that I tend to overdress going out. Pants, the good shirt. Etc"]
