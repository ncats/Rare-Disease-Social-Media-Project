["Can pressure on the skin such as the sole of your foot or just wrapping a bandaid around your hand cause that area to become inflamed and red. ", "Knees I have diagnosed THEM. My knee flares/leg flares are debilitating. What are emergency measures you take while in these flairs to help (I am not looking for mediation as I am already on that.)? I do not really have any suggestions other than to lie down or sit down, which i am sure you do already in these situations. I find putting a fan on but covering my legs with a light sheet helps to cool my legs down to an extent without making myself really cold. I really feel for you, as mine are also debilitating, and i hope things improve for you. Thank you. mix a little peppermint oil (I am talking like 2 drops) into a moisturizer &amp; apply it. I find it tricks my skin into feeling colder and much less on fire. I use it on my ears quite often Hell...my knees have started becoming the most debilitating part of my body, too! I relate to this so hard. I am sorry you are also in the knee THEM nightmare. I find the only thing that helps is elevation of entire legs and to be under fans. I also have gel ice wraps but I am sure to put several layers of towel and my pants legs between my skin and the cold wrap. I need to ice my knees for orthopedic reasons, and I actually think the knees started THEM flaring after my chondromalacia and MCL knee injury.", "I have had THEM for awhile now, but I am experiencing new symptoms that worry me. My usually all red hands now have white/purple dot clusters and are becoming very numb when I flare. Is there ever a time where I should go try to get treatment because of concerns of long-term damage?  Hi all,\n\nI have never been treated for my THEM, just diagnosed at the Mayo Clinic over a year ago and we left it at that. I have extremely low blood pressure which seems to be contraindicated with a lot of the medication treatments out there, so I never really pursued it. My colder month flares are also so much less severe so I seem to forget I have it lol. (Does not help in getting treatment). If I am doing too much and using my hands despite them being bright red, my hands will also go numb. And my feet regularly have white/purple spots if they are exposed to too much cold flowing air, ironically.  \n\n\nI do not know if you should seek more treatment, but wanted to let you know you are not alone with your symptoms. Personally, there is not much else my doctors can currently do. Thanks! That is just helpful to know. I am always concerned that numbness means potential long-term damage, but if these sorts of symptoms are common amongst THEM sufferers, I am somewhat comforted! No problem. I do not know if it is common, but it certainly happens to me. Ditto. It is awful \ud83d\ude16 Have you looked at bier spots? It is a benign form of vascular marking.\nI get them a lot - anyone can get them but I would not be surprised if it was more common in people with things like THEM  Ever heard of them, I will look into them!", "What triggers your THEM? Mine is a fan Been experiencing burning in my feet/ankles for 10 years now and just finally found out about this condition.  During hot summer nights, I would bring out my fan while I sleep.  And I like to keep my feet outside of my blankets, triggering my flares in the morning.  And my most recent flare, I dipped my feet in the pool right before sleeping.  \n\nIs this a rebound flare?  Anyone experience this also? Yes and I also have reynauds which seems to often trigger flares as some sort of rebound. \n\nI think for me finding the perfect balance between hot and cold is key. I also have Raynaud\u2019s too. Super weird when one foot is burning and the other is ice cold. Cannot remember a time when I did not have some sort of flare and felt \u201cnormal.\u201d Usually a trigger is seasonal temperature changes. If it is hot outside I am hot too. If it is cold I am cold. If it is room temperature outside my body freaks out and then I have different flare ups working against each other. Good times. Same!  \n\nI am not recommending this bc I am not a doctor. \n\nI spent the past year trying to fix my reynauds via blood pressure meds (which was already low). I finally realized the link is not vessel related bc I can be hot in one spot and freezing 2 inches away. I stopped my meds bc the THEM got worse on them. \n\nA couple of days ago I was researching neurological links and came across heat therapy. Which sounds counterproductive I know. \n\nThe method I have tried is called Bobs protocol, look on YouTube if interested. 20 minute FULL BODY hot soaks once a day. I have seen a massive reduction in my heat sensitivity.  I usually cannot expose my feet to heat but this has sort of shocked my body to wear it actually believes it is hot instead of believing it is cold or something. Lol. Not scientific. \n\nAlso there is a method suggested by Mayo Clinic in which lidocaine is applied to the arm and a super rich capsaicin patch is attached.  Supposed to achieve the same effect. Closed toe shoes + exercise instantly make my feet get red hot Shower, and walking", "Extended remission or spontaneous cure? Nearly 5 years ago, I began experiencing intermittent, burning redness in my ears, cheeks, and nose. For about 18-24 months, I experienced episodic flares that would come on every evening for anywhere from 5-30ish consecutive days and then no symptoms for 1-3 weeks. Symptoms included bright red skin that was hot to the touch (sunburn-like), with a feeling that my skin radiated heat, and a horrible burning sensation. It came on almost exclusively in the evenings when I would come home from work and lie down on the couch. Occasionally it came on very late at night if I was working late at the office, and at it is worst, I would occasionally experience it during the day in response to extreme emotional reactions (anger, embarrassment) but this period only lasted a couple of weeks. Aside from those daytime episodes, I could not identify any flares except lying down in the evenings and the pain/redness would continue through bedtime but would always be gone in the morning. The redness and burning and heat were always bilateral and usually started in my nose and cheeks (I could feel it coming on) but involved a range of other body parts, seemingly at random and usually about 3-4 at a time: hands (palms especially, also fingers), ears, knees, chest (splotchier, other body parts were solid red), neck, biceps, and thighs. My knees and thighs were the worst in terms of pain and burning and often made it difficult to get to sleep. Notably, I do not recall any symptoms on the soles of my feet but I think my toes were involved a few times.\n\nI was previously diagnosed with mild to moderate Raynaud\u2019s about 8 years ago but go extended periods of time with no symptoms. \n\nThe redness and burning were severe enough that I sought medical attention. Because they symptoms only occurred at night, I took a lot of photos. As soon as I showed doctors the photos they were alarmed, and I went through a lot of specialists and testing. Rheumatology, dermatology, immunology, and endocrinology. We ruled out common autoimmune conditions, dermatological conditions, MCAS and mastocytosis, folate deficiency, allergies, and thyroid issues. I was finally referred to an endocrinologist to test for carcinoid syndrome.\n\nI had to wait about 6 months for a referral, and during that time my symptoms resolved spontaneously. Still, I went through testing and ruled our carcinoid. I was also tested for a rare endocrine tumor called pheochromocytoma, which had also been suspected and ruled out after testing 7 years earlier (due to other symptoms- no redness). Bizarrely, one of the pheo tests came back slightly elevated (less than twice as high as the upper limit), which is unusual since most people with a pheochromocytoma have significant elevation but it is rare / no known explanation for a slight elevation. It was enough to do an MRI though, which revealed no tumor. The endocrinologist noted that I had not had a flare in about 9 months, and recommended that we wait until I did and then repeat testing. \n\nIt is been about 2 years since and I have been almost symptom free. On about 3-5 occasions I have felt the sensation of heat and burning in my cheeks and nose but the redness was mild and never spread or worsened - though also occurred in the evenings and usually a couple of days in a row. \n\nI came across an article describing erythromelalgia and could not believe how much fit\u2014 except that I do not recall having symptoms on the soles of my feet and, of course, I have been (nearly) without symptoms for years now. The Raynaud\u2019s has also been mostly \u201csilent\u201d for awhile, but I have sporadic episodes a few hours at a time and have also been told this is not uncommon. Looking at photos and reading some posts here, I am struck by the similarity - but none of my doctors ever mentioned it (I know it is rare, but these specialists were were so thorough and determined!). \n\nI cannot think of any major lifestyle changes that occurred just before, during, or just after these symptoms. Has anyone experienced or heard of periods of remission or even spontaneous resolution / \u201ccure\u201d? And, if I did (or do) have THEM, is there any reason to seek a delayed diagnosis if the symptoms have resolved? I still have several dozen photos taken over a year+.\n\n\nThanks for any insight you all can offer! I do not think the soles of my feel flare (just the tops).\n\nHow is your climate? Could that account for some change? My hands and feet flare in summer, and my face in spring and fall, and nothing in winter. Some people are opposite. \n\nWhat do you notice when you exercise? My symptoms persisted for about a year and a half with no more than a couple of weeks between flares, so it never seemed weather-related. I am in the Northeast US.\n\nI am a runner and sometimes I will turn red, but it looks and feels different. No burning or pain, usually sort of splotchy, and in proportion to sweating and overall exertion. Once I have cooled down, that all goes away. I do not recall it being any better or worse while I had these symptoms. \n\nIs there a connection between THEM and exertion? Each patient experiences THEM differently, and what the OP relates sounds like THEM.\n\nIt is not always clear what brought on THEM. Many THEM patients do have Raynaud's as well. And the burning and redness are also consistent. Flares being brought on by laying down are also very common.\n\nMy THEM is primarily bilateral in the soles of my feet. I rarely get redness in my knees and part of my thighs, and very rarely have only my right hand turn bruise purple color.  But no cheek redness or pain. No ear involvement. And so on.\n\nOP, you may just be one of the lucky few for which this has (mostly) spontaneously resolved. Obviously if symptoms pick up in intensity do take photos and seek further evaluation.\n\nWhat changed to make it better? Who knows? Maybe there was some slight dietary change, even something as obscure as a change in an ingredient in a favorite food? Maybe your body fought off some other underlying condition that was causing the THEM? To answer your question, yes, often exertion triggers THEM flares. I am an athlete, and exertion does not cause bad flares for me, not as much as standing still in hot weather does. I find that heavy workouts actually relieve symptoms (at least temporarily).\n\nThat is funny. I grew up in the south, and my THEM got really bad when I moved to Europe and then to Southern California. It was worst in the summer in my non-AC home (never got too hot, but nighttimes were very difficult sometimes). I spent last winter in the northeast and experienced total remission the whole time I was there-- not a single flare. I had these great wool socks, and I continued wearing them even after moving back down south, and I honestly think that has helped. I still flare on warm-weather walks, or on warm nights, but it is much better than it used to be.\n\nFacial flaring is a separate topic and seems totally disconnected from other body flares, temperature, etc. It is its own monster, and completely unpredictable. But my ears flare when I wear over-ear headphones, especially at night. Or when I use a hot styling tool on my hair. That is about all I can say with any certainty about facial flares. Otherwise they just have a mind of their own, but also seem to come in clusters: several weeks I get them highly, and then several weeks I do not. Like you, it is not related to climate, weather, exertion, diet or anything. But for me I get migraine that behaves the same way (unpredictably, and they often seem to go hand-in-hand with the facial flares).\n\nAnyway, what I am trying to say is, I have THEM, and yes, I have experienced periods of total remission. And what you have still does sound like THEM; I think it is worth bringing up with your doc. Mine did not know what it was but looked it up for me. If yours does not know, do not be afraid to ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: when I was a kid I had cold urticaria; I have the \"remnants\" of it now, and often get the SLIGHTEST splotches when exercising in cold weather. I feel a slight itchy sensation, but it is just the \"ghost\" of the terrible hives I used to get. It seemed like I grew out of the urticaria just in time to get THEM. Anyway, mentioning because my THEM is not splotchy, but my urticaria is. Hey, this post is a few days old, but I just wanted to say, I had mostly been in remission for a few years after being diagnosed by my rheumatologist. And then today both my feet and fingers flared up at two different things, my feet this afternoon when washing my car and my fingers when making dinner. Its not a bad flare at all and both thankfully went down quickly. \n\nI always had a mild case with only my feet, hands, and ears affected. I described it as \"red, hot, and tingly\" initially rather than burning, if that gives you an idea of (non) severity. I have had almost no episodes in 3 or 4 years until tonight. I was told about 1/3 of people's symptoms decrease, 1/3 stay the same, and 1/3 get worse from diagnosis. I guess we are hopefully part of that first 1/3.", "Long term stress induced THEM?  &gt;I have done inflammation marker tests, autoimmune panels, nerve studies, and everything is normal. If it is THEM, has anyone experienced it after long term stress/trauma?\r\n\nMaddeningly sometimes all the bloodwork and autoimmune panels are normal and it is not clear what is causing a patient's THEM.\n\nHave you been formally diagnosed?\n\nFrom what I can see from your photos it looks like fingers and ears are pretty red.  Feet and toes less so, but there is some. It *might* be THEM. \n\nIn photo #7 the pads of your pinky and ring finger are looking very pale, which would make me suspect Raynaud's. But at the same time some of the other fingers appear quite red, consistent with THEM.  \n\nTake photos during flare ups of symptoms. Show those photos to your doctor. \n\nIf it is THEM the redness would normally be accompanied by pain. Symptoms would typically get worse when exposed to warm water and better under cool water. Looks like you have THEM and Raynaud\u2019s. I developed this after suffering significant nerves damage and went through massive stress/trauma during that time as well. Any family members with the problem?\n\nAny issues as a kid?\n\nOr did it just show up? Not this specifically, my mom has autoimmune disorders but never had symptoms like these. It showed up after I got out of an extremely abusive relationship and was going through a lot of therapy. How were they able to diagnose you?? Everything has come back clear and it is making me feel a little crazy. The only thing I can think of is it is from the stress/trauma Stress is a cause for it to flare, but I have not heard of it actually causing the problem before.  I will say that mine definitely got worse during a stressful time. So did my mother's. But we had a mild form of the problem beforehand. Them specifically has normal blood tests.  Basically docs have to rule out all the imitators and if you are still on fire, its THEM lol.", "Anxiety meds Has anyone found anxiety medications to alleviate symptoms? My most aggressive flares tend to be an immediate stress reaction. I have found that not only are the flares leas frequent but also significantly less debilitating on anxiety meds I am on Prozac for anxiety but I have not noticed much improvement to my THEM. Maybe the meds help us stress a little less about the pain but personally I still get the same amount of attacks as I did before being on medication. Beta blockers are worth a try, you can take them as you need them, dont go to Temazepam, they work but highly addictive.", "Bee Venom Therapy for THEM Hello!\nMy mom has suffered from THEM in her feet for 18 years with no luck in finding treatment. The only thing that gives her relief is soaking her feet in ice cold water multiple times per day. Recently we learned about Bee Venom Therapy (BVT) as a treatment for Lyme disease and MS and upon further research found a few articles online of people using BVT for Erythromelalgia. Has anyone here heard of this or tried it before? We are considering giving it a shot and would love to hear about others experiences with it!\nThanks :) Do not soak your feet! It will break down the flesh and make bad matters worse. Ice packs in 20 minute intervals and high velocity fans. Moisturize with lanolin free lotions. Do not soak. I am not trying to cause problems but I do not understand this.  I have been soaking my feet since about June of 2015 and I have no skin breakdown.  Does it have to do with the water temperature or how Long you soak or some combination ? The official guideline from the THEM association cautions against soaking your affected areas in cold/ice water. Whether using cool water, a fan, or cool gel packs, moderation is key. Any method can cause skin breakdown or nerve damage when used for too long. And it can make symptoms worse by triggering rebound flaring. That is, you might flare even worse once you step out of the water if you overdo it. ( My child has it and we were told if she has an active attack to start out with something cool, not cold.  We keep voltaren in the refrigerator and put that on first when the tingling starts. Helps, does not stop.  She is also on Gabapentin 3 times a day.  She has not had it for 18 years though and we can already see it gets worse - my daughter\u2019s is already migrating up from her feet to above her ankles.\n\nWe were told there is only so much that can be done so if someone finds something that works for them, I say go for it.\n\nThanks for asking the question on Bee Venom...very interesting.", "I hate this  if it is any help this is what mine looks like too lol, I hate this too Hey, it helps a little knowing I am not alone haha", "Has anyone had any experience taking adderall and amitriptyline together?

Soaked my affected hands in the hottest water my faucet could produce. My THEM manifests mostly in my hands and face, hoping the hand soaking will also translate to less redness in the face region. Anyhow, anyone tried Bob's protocol? I had an acupuncturist suggest soaking my feet in Epsom salts and the warmest water I could stand.   For me, it was the dumbest suggestion I have ever followed.  My feet were in more pain than usual for the next several days Yes, it worked amazingly for me. It  took me to the threshold for the pain and swelling, then it released them for the evening, allowing me to sleep with actual sheets on. I have to do it every night when it flares, but the flares are further between now.", "Does anyone have some good recipes that do not cause a flare up lol I have been struggling with food and flare ups lately and was wondering what everyone else does ? I think food triggers are very individual.  I have not noticed any particular food triggers for me. Then again I am flaring almost every single day so maybe that is telling me that my diet sucks overall?\n\nMost commonly I have heard to limit spicy foods. That seems to make since because capsaicin, the chemical in chili peppers that gives them their heat, dilates blood vessels. So maybe cut out chilis. Sweet bell peppers have so little capsaicin that they should be fine.\n\nOther foods known for dilating blood vessels include nuts, avocado, dark green vegetables (kale, spinach, broccoli, swiss chard), kiwi, olives and olive oil, butternut squash, and shrimp.\n\nYou can try cutting out these foods and seeing if things improve at all. If you absolutely love them then add them back in one at a time to see if you have a reaction to any particular food. Watch the preservatives, salt and sugar, extra spicy spices, and anything from the nightshade family (peppers, eggplants, tomatoes, chilis, and white potatoes). While everyone reacts differently to different foods, these are some of the THEM triggers that cause trouble for many of us. (Not to mention alcohol and caffeine which are both vasodilators)\n\nSo when I buy prepackaged foods at the store, I always read ingredients list on the package and I am wary of foods that just list the word \"spices\" in the ingredients list. \n\nI do not have any specific recipes but you can never go wrong with steamed, fresh, or sauteed (non-nightshade family) veggies and some fish or chicken. I also like sweet potato quesadillas for a vegan option. I can send you a recipe for that if you are interested but I make lots of substitutions to avoid nightshades so what I make is almost unrecognizable to the recipe! \ud83e\udd2a", "Update So I have been to the doctors now and he agreed with me that the swelling knees is not hives and he is going to look at the blood tests I have done and see if I need any more or need to be referred. He said it will take a while cuz it is the NHS. I did mention THEM to him and he knew nothing about it and was a little passive aggressive to me saying what is he suppose to say as he has never heard of it but I just wanted his opinion. I told him about the bruising on my knees and he once again said no idea. I am glad he is now looking into it tbh and I knew it was not hives. The other thing I had with the red patches was some kind of acute allergic reaction but I cannot remember the name but he told me to just take the antihistamines and  it can happen once to somebody or it can come back and then to start writing down any triggers. Apparently I was lucky that my lips and throat did not swell up   The other thing I had with the red patches was some kind of acute allergic reaction    \n\n\n\"Persistent Hypersensitive Reaction\" ? or Persistent Bite Reaction\"  -- I was diagnosed with that and it also does not make sense for my personal health problems, then I was diagnosed with THEM and now all of my skin biopsies are questionable again lol. Oh weird I just had some acute allergic reaction today but I cannot remember what the name of it was that the doctor told me... Sad times sometimes even professionals cannot explain You made progress.  He is going to read a bit about THEM!  That is great!\n\nAnd no surprise he had not heard of THEM.  I live in a metro area of around 1 million people. I am seeing the only specialist in the area familiar with THEM and he has fewer than 10 THEM patients.  THEM is rare.\n\nNow I got a bit lucky. During my first specialist appointment I had a flare begin in my hand. So right before his eyes my hand went from normal color, to pink, to bright red, to nearly purple. It was fascinating for both of us to watch and enough for him to say it is THEM.\n\nCome the next visit he had rounded up the residents in training to come have a look and told them they will not see this often.  I was happy to help educate them hoping that if they see that one patient 15 yeas from now something will job their memories and they might think THEM. Is there pain with it? With and without touch? Is it continuous or not? I am glad you are making progress and that someone is willing to look a little further! My knees swell and burn and sometimes ache. Sometimes however I just get burning red patches on my knees. Sometimes my hands swell a little and ache but that is not as common as my knees. I get strange blotches on my legs too sometimes with it without my burning knees but often with it. Recently my knees when they are not flared up sometimes look bruised but I do not know why that is Thank you That is lucky. Did it only effect your hands ? I forgot to mention to the doctor that my hands swell and ache too sometimes or just my fingers but as it hardly happens compared to my knees I did not think to mention it. When I showed him the worst picture of my knees being swollen he started to take it seriously but often my knees have red patches that burn rather then being fully red but when he saw that he did not seem as bothered however it is just as bad For me it is mostly my feet.  Flares in my hands are rare (but boy do they look worse!)  so I lucked into him seeing that flare. I do get some redness and burning on my knees and that seems to be a bit more frequent now.\n\nFollow your doctor's advice about anti-histamines.  It can help some THEM patients so if that is you *maybe* it will help some? \n\nAnd make a log of symptoms. Details which part(s) of your body are red and/or burning. Take pictures. Note anything that triggers an episode. Rate any pain on a scale of 1-10.  If you have a systematic logging showing symptoms multiple times per week that cause significant distress then he may be more likely to refer you to a specialist.\n\nAnd I noted from your picture that you are quite young. Seriously discuss with your parents the idea of ringing up a specialist familiar with THEM and having a private pay visit, if possible. Well tbh nothing seems to trigger it atm just happens randomly for me. Though sometimes heat from the radiator can set it off, I am 19 and tbh I do not really have a good relationship with my mum and she is always working. She does not put me first in anything really and always down plays things. Like when my knees and legs were in a lot of pain and sometimes made me cry for a couple weeks she did not want me seeing the doctor for some reason. I think my mum has some personality disorder as she has very odd beliefs. She did not want me going to the doctors when I could hardly walk because they will think I am a hypochondriac! So yeah my mum is a no no. She can also be a bit of a compulsive liar if it fits her agenda so she will not help, she has no sympathy or empathy. Infant she was quite nasty to me when I could not walk properly like not even helping me and being unpleasant and Unempathetic. Whenever I have flare ups or body ache she says stupid things like it is the material of the jumper I am wearing that is making my arm ache! Also when my I started having explosive direah after my last flare up when I could not walk much she again was mad at me for calling the doctors about saying I have been doing it to much but it was not my fault I have been having problems with my body since January. If it was not for my aunt who went to pick up my prescription and told them how concerned she is about my knees I would not of gotten to talk to another doctor about it not being hives. My mum told me I had to be more open minded and they will think I am a hypochondriac again. After I had Covid vaccine and was in bed all night I was shaking badly and i felt so cold and my head was awful I had to take 4 pain killers. I could hear my heart beating so I could not sleep and in the morning I had soaked through my clothes and my bed sheets. My mums again did not help me and I was too weak to change my bed sheets and my aunt did it for me. She was bit anoyed that my mum would not do it for me. Seriously for my mum to help me with my physical health I would have to fall down the stairs and brake my neck Im not completely sure that is THEM. With an THEM flair normally it is the redness and the pain at the same time. It is a very specific type of pain. Nerve pain. Yeah I know the allergic reaction is not technically, modern medicine is still in its infancy.  Eventually we will be Star Trek, but for now, human medicine is essentially only a little more advanced than leeches and herbs.    \n\n\nIt is really hard to see what is going on without tricorders ;-) I was originally going to list the potential secondary THEM causes. Do you just want a link to the research paper?", "New treatments have freed me from my THEM (for now) Treatments I used:\n1) Medical Marijuana\n2) Bobs Protocol (heat therapy)\n3) Misoprostol (prescription med)\n\nJust to give some context, I am 19 and my THEM has been diagnosed. I have had it for just about a year now. A few months ago it progressed to a state where I was nearly incapable of almost all activities, and due to multiple new treatments (not sure 100% what is helping) I am running long distances again and working out. Back to living a normal a life. I do not really even get flares anymore. The skin gets very red on my feet when I run or take a hot shower, but it is not painful. It can be irritating but then instantly goes away when i am done. Before I talk about what I think may be helping I want to first explain my unique situation when I first got THEM.\n\nThe first time I noticed THEM, like everyone else, I had no idea what it was. I had noticed my feet were starting to get really red after running and they would be irritated. A month after first noticing this I was in excruciating pain for nearly a week. We thought it was athletes foot so had no way of actually treating it, but after that week it just disappeared. Not completely, but almost. I would only get swollen and red feet at night. Nothing more, and it would not hurt. This continued for about 6 months until it progressively returned to that extreme pain, but this time did not disappear. On and off I would be able to run, but the consequences were just not worth it. For about 2 months all I could do was be sedentary and not wear any shoes. I hardly slept too.\n\nNow it was still winter and I was very desperate for a change, so I came across Bob\u2019s Protocol (which essentially cured it for Bob). This protocol is really just heat therapy. You basically just remove all cooling methods and get your affected areas warm-hot for a certain amount of time each day. Look more into this separately. Anyway, I only used hot showers (ideally you soak the area), and my THEM was already in a bit of a dormant state so it was not\nthat bad. Around that same time I started smoking medical marijuana, and the prescription drug Misoprostol that I started taking a few weeks back was supposed to start taking affect. Since then I have had my THEM improve to the point where I do not really think much about it in my day to day. I have not stopped the medical marijuana, heat therapy, or Misoprostol and do not plan to. I may not know which treatment worked, but I would rather not have my THEM worsen again.\n\nSorry for such a long post, I did not mean\nto write this much. But I thought this should be shared in case anyone else can find relief from\ntreatments I tried. Thank you for sharing your experience! What dosages of misoprostol are you on? Have you had any negative side effects from it? I have THEM in my feet, face and ears. I am at the point where I take two tablets of 200 MCG dosage in the morning and at night (4 pills a day in total). It is supposed to lower blood pressure I think, which is why it could be helping. Only side effects I have had (there are not many) is that my digestion is more sensitive, but that is nothing compared to THEM. It helps to take the misoprostol with a full meal though.", "If you had to describe the pain during a flare, what would you say? Is having your hands few centimeters above a candle a good description?\n\nI am not diagnosed with THEM but yesterday for the first time I had pain during a flare on my knuckles and that is how I would described the pain.", "Do these look like THEM? Further elaboration on experience under this post  I have not gotten pictures of these happening during the same day, but it should not matter.  \n\nDuring the day I have mottled, purple feet. They are freezing cold to the touch. I can still perceive touch with them, but they are so cold they feel kind of numb to the ambient temperature. Usually clammy and damp. Socks do not really work since a) it is really impossible to get on because they are sweaty, and b) the sweat would just end up making the sock damp and then cold. Blankets do not do much either.  \n\nAt night the mottling disappears but is replaced with a smooth red appearance. They are hot to the touch. There is no tingling or itchy pain, but it just feels like my feet themselves have turned into radiators. Usually dry compared to the purple daytime feet. I have to stick them out from under the covers and lay at a weird diagonal angle. Peppermint spray/oil on the feet under my fan somewhat relieves the burning feeling. Typically it is just the soles of my feet that get red but the top of the foot is still warm to the touch.  This red discoloration is common after walking on them and especially showering.\n\nThis does not happen every single day, but at least four times a week. When it does happen it is almost like it is on a circadian rhythm, the timing of flare-ups always happens around the same time\u2014in the late evening and at night. Just as the mottled cold feet always happens during the day.\n\nI suspect I have some form of dysautonomia as well, as I experience excessive sweating and fatigue in response to a warm environment, frequent unexplained headaches and migraines, and I have had fainting spells exactly as described in orthostatic intolerance from standing upright, even when hydrated.\n\nI have been trying to find out what the hell is up with my feet and while doing a paper on dysautonomia I managed to find out about erythomelalgia and the descriptor \u201cThe three hallmark symptoms of THEM are redness, warm to hot skin, and burning pain. Additional symptoms may include swelling or changes in perspiration, and the skin may be cold and/or bluish purple when not actively flaring. THEM flares may be intermittent or continuous, mild or severe, and are most commonly triggered by warmth, physical activity, or stress.\u201d absolutely hit all the marks for me, aside from the pain aspect. It is not a sharp spiny pain, it is just a mild burning feeling. It feels like I am outside and while the rest of my body is in the shade my feet are cooking in direct sunlight and I cannot do anything about it. I am sorry you are going through this. \nMy feet do this as well. They go between THEM and Raynauds. A handful of THEM people I spoke with also seem to experience this. I second what other commenter said. I have both THEM and Raynauds and it sounds like/appears like you do, too. Knowledge is power, so see if you can keep documenting both the Raynauds and THEM flares. Save to a separate, organized folder on your phone to show doctors. Also maybe consider keeping a phone or written journal of symptoms and what triggers or helps relieve them. This is how I ended up being diagnosed by a Rheumatologist after a few years of seeing several different types of specialists. I do not have Raynaud's though; it does not occur as quickly or locally as Raynaud's does. They also do not turn white before going purple or red like Raynaud's.  \nBecause this tends to happen around the same time it seems like it is got something to do with circadian rhythm, which would make sense as the circadian rhythm is controlled by the hypothalamus which also is the key brain site for controlling autonomic nervous system efferents and thermoregulation, both I have some trouble with.  \nLess commonly my cheeks get extremely hot and pink for absolutely no reason too, feels like my face burns. Not from embarrassment or anything, completely out of nowhere. Last I remember happening was at school in the morning which does not seem circadian related the way this is. Absolutely gets worse with heat and friction. In the first picture my feet do the exact same thing in the cold they look purple, white little blochtes and sometimes red. The bottom of my feet also get red and warm and definitely have to have them not under the covers. But getting them in a position where it does not hurt is difficult. My feet do tingle never had any of my symptoms of itching. Cheeks, nose, and/or ears red and burning are also common signs and symptoms of THEM. Burning pain, as opposed to sharp spiny pain, is very common in THEM.  I describe the pain on the soles of my feet as like walking barefoot on a burning hot pool deck in summer.\n\nTHEM is often paired with small fiber neuropathy which can affect sweating response. Dysautonomias are also relatively common comorbities with THEM.\n\nYou may need a multidisciplinary approach with a neurologist involved since you seem to have significant vascular issues and likely neurological comorbidities. \"like walking barefoot on a burning hot pool deck in summer\" yes EXACTLY  \nas for likely neurological comorbidities... well i have autism so :shrug: haha. cannot rule out having some mutations that gave my hypothalamus some fucked up parts", "Erythromelalgia and surgery Hi all,\n\nAsking this question for my dad, who has THEM.  The THEM is present most severely in his feet, and he needs to have surgery for a structural foot problem.  Basically he has a chipped bone that is causing him severe pain, which he needs to remove.   He also has a bad bunion problem which he is considering fixing.  However, he is afraid that the surgery will make his THEM worse, or that his THEM will prevent proper healing.  Has anyone faced a similar issue?\n\nThanks very much for your help! How is your dad doing? My husband has Erythromelalgia and had a fall with broken tibia and ankle. Had to have surgery. It is affecting and he has lost so much mobility due to it.", "Has anyone found relief or increased life performance, after starting treatments with low-dose antidepressants like venlaflaxine or lacosomide or recombination with Lyrica? Just to get your life back I am coming to a point where I want to start medication, after trying hundred kind of alternative treatments but noting really seems to work. My cause is ideopathic still. I am 41 and a healthy person. This THEM is really dominating my life, being busy with it 24/7 the whole day. Just cannot get my mind of it. Also messing up my sleep and the way eat, over analyzing everything I do. So just wondering if starting to use SSRI like Venlaflaxine, would really benefit it. As I read some stories of people who use this and actually had good relief, even some went in remission. One of the doctors I spoke to last year in Amsterdam, told me he had some good results with patients who started Venlaflaxine or Lacosomide. So was wondering if anyone here that could share their experience?", "Sauna Unfortunately I can\u2018t stand Sauna anymore since my THEM started. Loved it before.

It is ok but honestly, not really.", "What do you all do to help your burning? I have a working diagnosis of THEM, and I just moved into a new house whose air conditioning is not nearly what it was supposed to be. It is about 80 degrees in my house in the afternoons, and my burning is just unbearable by bedtime. So ...\n\nWhat do you all do to soothe your burning? \n\nI feel like I have tried so many things I thought would be more helpful than they actually were, and I am hoping there are good ideas out there First, here is your provisional welcome to our crappy club. The admission criteria really sucks and our parties are no good without alcohol. But at least the members can commiserate and compare notes.\n\nGo barefoot and point a fan directly at your feet when seated or laying down.  Sleep with your feet out from under any sheets or blankets and with a fan pointing at your feet. \n\nNo alcohol. Sorry. But alcohol dilates blood vessels and makes flares worse.\n\nSome people find that spicy foods makes flares worse.  If your notice a correlation then cut out those hot sauces.\n\nConsider a cool shower before bed. Again, point a fan at yourself after. Even slightly cooling your core body will help. (Going To need to buy more fans!)\n\nIf your home air conditioning is not up to the job and all else fails you might want to invest in a window air conditioner for your bedroom.\n\nElevate your feet. Prop your legs and feet up on a bolster pillow while sleeping.\n\nUse ( on your feet. Be sure your get the ones with lidocaine and not the menthol ones.  The patches are large enough that I cut one in half and apply half to the sole of each foot. Only leave on for up to 12 hours.\n\nAnd lastly, work with your doctor to try various treatment options.  Some THEM patients respond well to aspirin. Some find some relief with antihistamines. Those are some over the counter options. Your doctor can suggest prescription medications after review of your specific case. When I did not have AC, I used a vaporizer with water in it and sprayed myself to fall asleep lol.  Now, I use it when my skin is burning but I do not feel like taking a shower. Combined with the fan, it is almost like AC..... almost", "Could I have given myself erythmyalgia by drinking wine 2 weekends in a row?  No! Erythromelalgia is not something that is triggered by a couple of one-off drinking experiences. It usually comes on:\n\n1) after an injury to an extremity that causes complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and then Erythromelalgia can follow that over time. \n\n2) as a secondary condition (or sometimes even a precursor) to development of an autoimmune disease, neurovascular condition, and/or dysautonomia conditions like POTs\n\n3) as co-existing condition with Raynauds, another neurovascular condition like erythromelalgia\n\n4) primary form which is erythromelalgia that had no other underlying condition and is just the standalone condition\n\nErythromelalgia is something that once you have it, it stays in with you for life for many (not all) of us, sometimes progressing to other areas of the body after starting somewhere like the hands or feet. \n\nWithout knowing any additional details of your symptoms, I would say do not psyche yourself out at this point. You cannot give yourself erythromelalgia just from wine. However, if you continue to have extreme heat and pain in the feet, hands, ears, or face with even the slightest of increased ambient temperature, spicy food other common triggers, you could speak with your doctor about it. \n\nYou might also look into rosacea. Some people have an enzyme deficiency that causes a similar reaction to alcohol, but its not Erythromelalgia.  \n\n\n( I have mthfr could it be because of that? I assume you mean a MTHFR deficiency?\n\nI do not really see how metabolism of homocysteine would cause erythromelalgia.  So I do not *think* it is related, but I have forgotten a lot of the biochemistry I learned. I think they mean, could the alcohol reaction be because of the mthfr, not could the mthfr cause THEM. &gt;mthfr \n\nFrom what I see on the googles... yes.  If you have mthfr you can have a reaction to alcohol.  It is not THEM, it is just the mthfr. THEM is a specific clinical thing. I am very positive mine was triggered after a bad viral infection I had. It also triggered IST (inappropriate sinus tachycardia). I have never heard of any condition like that being triggered just by drinking for a few days. I have researched this thing quite a bit, and I never came across anything that even suggest drinking could trigger it. Does heat always effect it? I have pots and burning neuropathy in most of my body and am scheduled for my tilt table test for pots since  i have some mild blood pooling and heart stuff going on so maybe it is possible I have it? Not sure,I do not have pains from heat in the shower it does not se like but sometimes wearing shoes is very uncomfortable but that could be the neuropathy Yes, heat is always a trigger for me. Extreme cold is, too, as I have Raynauds so my blood vessels will consfrict with that and then try to overcompensate with warming and go complete opposite...over vasodilation to warm up. If you have POTS or any form of dysautonomia, erythromelalgia can be secondary to that. My severe ear pain and redness started over a month ago. Two weeks after I finished a steroid dose pack\n\n\n\n\nIt is constant", "Aspirin? This might be a dumb dumb question\u2026 but is anyone else\u2019s treatment simply an aspirin a day? This has completely changed my entire world! I honestly used to be terrified of the day I got engaged and got pics of my hands taken, but now my hands are unrecognizable!! They are so much more normal than they used to be (other than when I am drinking) and I just cannot believe it! Highly recommend Very happy to hear you are benefitting from this!  I have discussed this as a treatment option but my doctors but have not trialed it yet.  Can I ask what exact dose you take?  I was given recommendations of different amounts by different doctors. One adult aspirin or 3 baby aspirin. I believe the baby aspirin are 81mg I have read that aspirin helps about a third of THEM patients, does not affect another third, and worsens the last third. Unfortunately, I was in the last category, but I am really happy that you have found such improvement! I did 300mg a day but did not help, and I have tried so many different things but now I am trying 0mg of aspirin a day. I have only taken it for a week, so far I have not seen any improvements yet but hopefully soon! Glad yours worked well for you!! ", "Rewarming skin, trigger for THEM? Can rewarming skin from after being cold be a trigger for THEM? Yep! Okey!  Every time i rewarm my skin om face, i get beet red, very hot skin and severe burning. Been to alot of derm, none says its rosacea. Worth considering THEM?  I have pictures if that is helpful  Were you already diagnosed with THEM?  If not, there are other things to look for first.  If so, then yes this is most likely your them igniting.  No, sorry i have not been diagnosed yet.i have been trying to get some kind of diagnos for years now. Ill check the link. Thanks Does it happen to your hands or feet?\nDo you get Pins and needles? With itching and/or burning?  Have you been tested for autoimmune problems like lupus? Nothing on hand and feet. I can feel sometingeling before an attack. Then severe burning when i have an attack. If i can remember right i think one derm did some autoimmune test. \n\nears go beet red and burning sometimes too. \n\nCan affected skin become flaky? It can get dry as THEM seems to affect sweating.  But flakey sounds more like psoriasis or eczema", "This is my first time ever hearing about this. Do you guys think I have it? I saw a rheumatologist a year ago who only seemed to suggest hydroxychloroquine as a solution. More in comments ", "Suspected THEM in my feet for awhile now. Now my hands are becoming red and warm, but looks more blotchy compared to what my feet look like with a flare up. THEM too?  Quite likely THEM as well.  Feet, hands, and in some nose and ears.\n\nFor me my right hand looks the worst, but fortunately does not hurt. Have your symptoms worsened over time? I have had THEM for about 9 months now and it is become common for my hands to feel very warm at night. Which was not normal in the past. Normally my feet are the killers My feet definitely are the worst and got progressively worse over many years.  I was finally diagnosed only about 6 months ago and started on mexeltine.  Hard to say if the condition has worsened since then but the medication works well for me and sharply reduces my pain level.\n\nHowever in the last two months or so I have noticed the redness progressing up my right arm a bit.  So far it is just 3 inches or so past my wrist.  My hand/arm does not hurt, but not sure if that is due to the medication. 3 inches is 7.62 cm", "When I have the worst flare ever. Silly me, I tried to keep walking during the flare. It just got worse. Pain scale 100/10 ", "What causes it? Is it the lack of ability to sweat? It seems like my feet get angry red when I exercise and I check my socks for dampness and there is not a drop. I have SFN but is it more of the autonomic nerves? In about 15% of cases it is genetic, a mutation in the gene that makes a protein that regulates the flow of sodium ions into nerve cells. For those patients there is usually a strong family history with at least one parent having THEM and likely siblings and others with the condition.\n\nTHEM can be a primary condition, not caused by anything else. In these cases it is not clear why the patient developed THEM unless a genetic cause is confirmed.\n\nFor many others is is secondary to another condition. For many of those it is secondary to a myeloproliferative disorder (certain types of blood cancers).\n\nTHEM can also be secondary to other conditions and it is common for THEM patients to also have SFN. THEM can also be associated with autoimmune conditions such as Sjogren's or systemic lupus erythematosus. It can even be associated with advanced untreated syphilis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI too have THEM with SFN and anhidrosis. Not a drop of sweat below my navel in years, no matter how hot I get. I can feel like a cold blooded reptile forced to regulate my exposure to my environment in order to regulate my body temperature.\n\nIf an underlying causative condition can be identified and cured then the THEM often resolves. This is great!!\n\nI have a question if you know, what is the difference between THEM &amp; SFN? Because some of what I have read makes it seem like THEM is a type of SFN... (Esp in relation to diabetes... maybe?? IIRC) But then in FB support groups, people have said they are NOT the same thing.\n\nI am so confused about it. As far as I can tell, I have both... in my whole body. But my feet are the worse (followed by my hands). Only officially diagnosed w/ THEM. When I have tried googling, it just confused me further and does not seem like there is necessarily a consensus. But idk. Indeed, some would say that THEM is a type of SFN. I have seen a lot of comparisons and SFN is certainly present in a significant proportion of THEM patients. But they do seem to be different conditions.\n\n**What is Small Fiber Neuropathy?**\n\nSmall Fiber Neuropathy is a condition is which there can be a variety of abnormal sensations caused by damaged to (no surprise for guessing here) the small nerve fibers.\n\nNerve fibers are often described as the wires of the body. Some wires in the walls of your home are insulated with a plastic coating and some short wires inside your laptop  are bare metal. Similarly some nerves are insulated, this time with a fatty coating called myelin, and some are bare.  Uninsulated nerve fibers are thus smaller in diameter than their insulated myelinated counterparts.\n\nMyelinated nerves mostly control voluntary muscle movements such as the signal from your nerve to your brain when you think that you want to move your hand.\n\nUnmyelinated small nerve fibers control sensory signals such as touch, pressure, and pain as well as control certain things that you have no voluntary control over.  Sweating, blood vessel dilation, and digestion among other things are under control of these small nerve fibers.\n\nIf **there is damage to the small nerve fibers** themselves there can be short circuits, of sorts, where signals get a bit scrambled. Unfortunately our brains can interpret that as odd sensations of pressure, electric shocks, or pain. There may be abnormal sweating, paralysis of the digestive system, and/or unusual dilation or contraction of the blood vessels.  This constellation of symptoms can be lumped under the heading of Small Fiber Neuropathy.\n\nSFN can be diagnosed by a skin biopsy. In SFN there is so much damage to the small fiber nerves that there are fewer nerve ending visible under microscopic examination of a tissue sample.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What is Erythromelalgia**\n\nErythromelalgia is a pain disorder which feature abnormal dilation of blood vessels. And, no surprise now, the pain sensation and blood vessel dilation are both controlled by small nerve fibers.\n\nIn genetic forms of THEM essentially the nerve is not so much damaged as the switch that turns it on or off is faulty due to a genetic condition. Chemically, to trigger a pain sensation, the nerve cell should allow a small amount of sodium ions to flow through a special protein to enter the nerve cell. The special protein should then snap tightly shut to prevent more sodium from flowing into the cell. In genetic forms of THEM that special protein is built with faulty instructions and the opening can get jammed open or not close tightly allowing more sodium to enter the cell that is wanted. This keeps the nerve activated and continues to send a pain sensation longer and more intensely than normal.\n\nThis same special protein is involved in small nerve fibers that control other involuntary functions such as blood vessel dilation or contraction. In both genetic and non-genetic forms of THEM, faulty control of firing of those nerves results in blood vessels dilating or constricting more than they should. \n\nAs blood vessel dilate more than they should they swell with excess blood. The excess blood shows through the skin and redness and is felt as excess heat.  Pain can result as blood swollen vessels press on nerves, **even if the nerves are not themselves damaged** in any way.  \n\nCuriously 85% of THEM patients do not have a recognized genetic cause of the condition. It is not clear what is causing THEM in these patients. A significant number of patients with THEM have other associated conditions, including SFN. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nSFN is virtually synonymous with damaged nerve fibers. THEM *might* show damage to the same kinds of nerve fibers, but not necessarily. Oh my GOD, thank you so much!!! I am not sure I fully understand, but that def helps a lot. I really appreciate it!!!! Awesome response. Really thank you for that! I just have another question: I am starting to realize a trend and that is for my flares. Usually it only occurs after excersing outside and wearing closed toed shoes. How can I exercise without shoes and not flare but as soon as I put on shoes I flare? Shoes trap heat. Heat makes blood vessels dilate.  Blood rushes in and swollen blood vessels  may compress nerves.  But I would think that wluld cause noticeable redness.\n\nMaye try swimming.  It is easier to shed heat that way.", "Could this Erythromelalgia?  Could be. Does it burn alot? Get worse when your warm? I had a line across my wrist where the redness would stop. Definitely gets worse when warm or under any type of stress.  Sometimes the burning sensation is worse than others and usually goes hand in hand with how red they are becoming, \n\nHand in hand ... hah *sigh* \n\nMy doctor did some testing for raynauds but I am not affected by cold temperatures in that way and it does not look like the online photos of raynauds either Sounds like it is THEM. I am not sure if other problems cause this to happen too but its worth checking out. Its tempting to soak in cold water but dont do it cuz it can damage nerves more. AC will be your best friend Well, I live in Alaska so I guess that is good. People do blast the heat indoors though, feels very uncomfortable especially in class. Is there a derivative? the symptoms of  this have really taken prevalence in the last 3 months. Looks like my THEM. Mine begin to itch first, then burn while turning red.. I have a cinderblock wall in my apt that is a lifesaver cause I can place my hands on it and it is always cold. I got a marble cutting board to keep on my desk at work for the same reason\n\nTHEM is often a secondary autoimmune issue linked to another issue, but it can also occur on its own Looks like, but that is an odd line of demarcation. Were your hands folded a certain way, or submerged in water, etc? Mine looks different depending on what posting I am sitting in (if my feet are hanging down vs folded beneath me, which makes my KNEES flare, for example). It only takes about 5 mins for it to be visibly red in a new position (or submerged in water). A good test would be to hold a limb in very hot water (like a hot tub) and see how red it turns. \n\nAlso, sorry. : ( I am not sure what u mean by derivative. Imuh dumbass \ud83e\udd23. If u mean a condition that is similar I am not sure. That looks more like Raynaud's because of the localized discoloration. I have not seen an image of an THEM flare up on the back of the hand. Then again there is not much information out there. \n\nDo you take any vascular constrictors like ADHD meds, or stimulants? I do, and I think this mess started when I began taking them. I saw another reddit post where someone had red hands, and mentioned taking ADHD medication.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy personal experience: I cannot remember when it started, but it was within the last 6 years. I would be using my touch pad on my mac which would get warm. I would start getting tender skin under my finger nails.. To complicate the diagnosis I have been break dancing for ten years so I put lots of pressure on my hands (footwork). I figured that might be the cause. \n\nIt started around the time I began taking adderall daily in the fall of 2015. One day I just started getting red hands around lunch time. \\*background I sit under an AC fan that blasts me.. then around 1:00pm it shuts off, and the sun hits my office this causes my hands to turn bright red.. randomly usually in fall. I was also getting random goosebump patches on my shoulder, and face that would go away in seconds I just thought it was stress or allergies. \n\n In 2016/2017 I was not taking adderall, and do not remember having a flare up. I started taking it again in 2018 and had maybe one or two flare ups. This year I started getting more so I saw an allergist. He told me I was not allergic to anything.. which is odd because i have been taking Zyrtec D almost daily since 2013. I got off Zyrtec D in September of this year. Fast forward November 7th I ate at a high end Sichuan restaurant had two beers and all hell broke loose. I started getting random pins and needles feelings in my hands. Would wake up paranoid in the middle of the night with dry tingly hands. The back of my neck feld like I had icy hot. It was a nightmare I thought I was loosing my mind. I quit adderall, and caffeine, alcohol. Took a Zyrtec D, and it seemed to go away. Might just be the fact that it is a vascular constrictor, but adderall seems to stop it (only lasts 5 hours, but turns my hands white, and ice cold) I am thinking this caused it. My life is a mess now because I am already a scrawny nervous hypochondriac. Sometimes I do get itchy skin, my feet and hands seem to sweat in the cold weather, but not when its hot. My hands will get red and dry quickly.. This flare up seems to be the worse I cannot imagine it lasting this long every year i would lose it.. Seems I cannot drink alcohol anymore which is a bummer. My cold sensitivity is almost gone. I am standing outside in 40 degree weather, and can barely get a chill going after 10 minutes. Skins still warm. Your symptoms sound a hell of a lot like mine. Cant sweat when hot. Just get red, dry, heavy over vascular hands/feet and pissed off. Forget about alcohol, I feel like I am going to burst to pieces. I was on suboxone for years and had some bad side effects with edema, so when the scary colors started happening I figured I would stop. Has not seemed to help BUT I was absolutely crushing energy drinks and caffeine, like to the point where I was drinking them to quench my thirst. Drank 3, 4 a day on top of a couple coffees, I basically drank them all day and I did this for years. Wondering if the caffeine/energy blend bullshit was acting similar to ADHD drug, both being vasoconstrictors. Also nicotine is a vasoconstrictor but that is my last vice and I am having a hard time kicking the lozenges.\n\nHas your body adapted yet after kicking the ADHD drug? Yes. Change your diet. Go carnivore for 30 days to rule out auto immune disease. Do intermittent fasting. It helped me. I barely eat meat ...", "Knee Flares. This is how it all started for me. I was finally diagnosed with THEM in 2017. Now I suffer from flare ups of the knees, hands, feet, ears and more occasionally my left arm. Tired of this being my \u201cnormal\u201d life.  Have you tried any meds?\n\nI am really sorry you have to go through this. My kid has it and it is painful and isolating.

I finally was able to get my primary care doctor to just try some things out. For me, the hardest thing has been falling asleep at night. I started amitriptyline, I am not sure if it really reduces flare ups, but it puts me to sleep quickly, so that has been a huge help.", "Portable Seating  Hi. I believe I have secondary THEM. So I always need to sit when blood rushes down too much. I found these on Amazon for like $30 each. They weigh like 2lbs each., but holds over 200lbs each. I take these everywhere in case I do not find a seat. People stop me all the time asking what they are. They are especially useful while browsing and shopping in stores or waiting on line. Barnes &amp; Noble does not like people sitting in their store so they are rude to me all the time, but I still use them.

Most people generally start with a trial of aspirin (as I did) and that tends to work very effectively if it is secondary to a **myeloproliferative disorder.** \n\nGetting blood work done is a good idea. \n\nHere is a good place to start to learn about treatments\n\n( Yes I have severe itching after taking a shower or bath, and I know that is also a sign of MPDs. Same boat, trying to find the cause. Just got dx officially this week and had labs done yesterday so waiting on results. I have been experiencing them for 2 months now. Had to go through rhuem and derm before dx. Great, thanks for the info! Definitely and uncomfortably hot burning feeling, but not pain. Oh no I am so sorry to hear you are dealing with that, I am hoping the labs come back fast for you with some answers. Sending you good vibes to feel better, I know how awful THEM can be. I also wanted to mention, I know there are not a ton of people in this sub but I have found there Sri two big THEM groups on Facebook and they are wonderful. Lots of supportive folks and they are quick to answer questions and share their experiences so I thought that might be helpful too!", "Does anyone else get burning inside of the nose when flaring? ", "Is this eryhromelagia?  Looks like it, blotchy hands Any redness on your feet as well?", "Today was another cold day and my feet and hands would turn purple for some reason. Has anyone experienced purple hands and feet? My hand goes white sometimes? What is it? Why?  White fingers when cold is likely Raynaud\u2019s. Purple skin could be down to that as well. My hands go strange colours in the cold too! There is a chance it could be Pernio. Definitely Raynaud\u2019s. It goes hand in hand with THEM sadly. I have both too. Thanks I will have to let my doctor know at my next appt. I have heard that THEM can trigger both. Thanks. Ok, thanks. I am not familiar with Pernio", "Could it be THEM? Hi folks, I would be hugely appreciative of some advice in case I could be a sufferer. I have had a burning scalp for about a year now and recently have seen my eyebrows and beard go the same way. This has resulted in diffuse hair loss from the areas affected. Seemingly unrelated (I thought) I have been having issues where my whole body will flare up under stress, my face and scalp will flare if I drink alcohol and my hands will flare of experience a sudden temperature change. All instances give off massive amounts of heat and the skin feels dry and irritated afterwards in all cases. I have been told I have telogen effluvium which is causing my hair loss (I do have some nutritional deficiencies) but considering this other range of strange symptoms I am wondering if it might be THEM instead? Going to try my best to get derm referral but would love some insight in the mean time. Thank you everyone! The term erythromelalgia comes from the Greek: erythros \"red\", melos \"limb\" and algos \"pain\".   Commonly the redness and pain are accompanied by heat.\n\nTHEM is very frequently secondary to a variety of other medical conditions. One of those conditions that often accompany THEM is Small Fiber Neuropathy. \n\nRedness is absolutely characteristic of THEM.  You mentioned flares, but does your skin turn red?\n\nSFN can be associated with several of your symptoms but not always redness. It can cause reduced or absent sweating which can cause overheating. Alcohol is well known to dilate blood vessels which would add heat, all the worse if sweating is not keeping up with your cooling needs. Some of what you describe sounds to me more like SFN than THEM.\n\nEither way, a visit to a dermatologist is a good place to start.  The dermo could order a skin biopsy to confirm SFN or refer you to a neurologist who might do the same. Hi, thanks for the reply. Yes my skin turns red wherever I am experiencing pain, it can be blotchy or it can be pretty solid looking just depending. I will always see this when I am exerting myself so either exercise, stress or if I have been drinking. I am just really wondering if anyone has experienced similar and if they had the accompanying hair loss which I am seeing. I will definitely get a derm opinion if possible, my GP has not been very helpful in the past in terms of getting me referred to specialist so I will do my best and hope for a good outcome.", "I think I might be joining the club soon :( Last summer I traveled to Puerto Rico to visit my family, and holy crap. I was in pain nearly every hour of that ONE MONTH visit. I immediately noticed bright red feet and hands. It was odd, but I also remembered of that happening back home at night if I had forgotten to turn on my fan or if my comforter was too warm. No big deal because by the time I woke up it would be gone. The other thing that would trigger it was cleaning. You know, sweeping the floor, etc. I also live in the northeast, so the weather up here is comfortable, and with the long winters, I barely have symptoms for half the year. I am 20M, and I never thought anything of this. I thought it was normal to have that burning pain and redness every now and then until I went to Puerto Rico and the pain was pretty much debilitating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told my doctor what was happening and he said it could be Reynaud's Syndrome. I said yes, but that it is more like the OPPOSITE of Reynaud's. He said he has never seen that before and sent me to a specialist, so I am waiting for that. Meanwhile, I have been doing some research on my own, and let us face it. It is not hard to tell you have this based on what I have read.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... I am pretty upset about it because this is quite painful, and apparently I do not have a particularly debilitating reaction, which means it can progress even more? I do not know how I would handle that. Right now as I am writing this I am pain-free. The flareups occur at night if the temperature under my blanket gets too hot or if it is warm outside, and the burning sensation is limited to my hands and feet. Flareups are also triggered when I hold a hot cup of tea, laundry right out of the dryer, hot shower, exercise, and that sort of thing. It hurts, but I can sort of carry on. I am seeing all kinds of specialists for another medical issue (inappropriate sinus tachycardia and orthopedic stuff), and they are running all sorts of tests on me, which are coming back normal, so at least I should be grateful this seems like something benign maybe?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I have a few questions and I hope you guys can help me out a bit:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes the burning sensation get worse when you lower your extremity and better when you raise it?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo your arm veins bulge when having a flareup? (I am very skinny so this is more noticeable on me)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this the biggest issue in your life or is it something that you can somehow get used to and live with?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes it get worse with time? 1: Yep. Gravity can be a trigger.  For example, raising your feet can relieve symptoms when your feet are flaring. Raising your hands can relieve your hand symptoms.  \n\n\n2: In my case, I do not know about arm veins.  But my feet veins definitely bulge up when my feet are flaring, so that can be a part of it.  \n\n\n3: Treatment is very individualized.  For some people, such as myself, a combination of antihistamines and cannabis works really well for managing the pain.  For others, they have to go with more serious intervention.   \n\n\n4: It depends on why you have THEM in the first place. If you have THEM as a secondary condition to an autoimmune disease or something, than treating that condition will also reduce how often and how bad your them gets.  If you have THEM as the genetic condition, then it is really hard to say as it varies pretty dramatically between people with the condition.    \n\n\nFor more help and info:  ( &gt;Does the burning sensation get worse when you lower your extremity and better when you raise it?\n\nYes. Elevating the extremity helps decrease the pain. Lowering it can exacerbate the pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Do your arm veins bulge when having a flareup? (I am very skinny so this is more noticeable on me)\n\nNot that I have noticed.  I do have one hand that turns absolutely purple, but little to no pain.  Maybe it will start hurting in time. Oh Joy! /s\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Is this the biggest issue in your life or is it something that you can somehow get used to and live with?\n\nI have a LOT of other health crap. THEM is right up there near the top, but managing other issues takes priority.\n\nFinding meaningful employment was a challenge but I now have an office job that I can do and I am able to take steps to minimize pain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Does it get worse with time? \n\nMine has, though medication since my diagnosis has improved the pain level substantially. \n\nNot everyone gets worse. Sometimes an underlying condition can be identified and treated making the THEM go away. \n\nSometimes THEM goes away on its own.", "omg i think this is it. is this related to Adderall and ritalin?

I am doing this already right now along with the ssri that im on and my only hope right now is this being related to the combo\n\nI am an extremely anxious person and anxiety has always controlled my life. even when i was 13 i went to the er once for chest pain that turned out to be from anxiety\ni got on an ssri a year ago but it never really touched any of the anxiety it is just something that masks suicidal thoughts.\nthe only thing that completely helps me live my life is adderall, my past 6 months was the only time in my life in which i have not suffered like crazy from life (now i can safely say it was me being severely understimulated)\n\nim also taking propecia(finasteride 1mg if this is related)\n\nI cannot even find experts for this stuff in my country\nI am giving up on life slowly but surely if i keep going this way.\n\nevery help is blessed right now and I am so happy for finding this sub reddit Pharmacist know more about side effects and drug interactions than Dr\u2019s. Not that you will get the answer there but check and see if your pharmacist will look over your medications for any drug interactions and/or rare side effects.  Just a step - not an answer.\n\nTHEM can be caused by a genetic defect in voltage gated sodium channels - just hear me out.  Info gets into a cell through a channel where sodium ions exchange information.  If something goes wrong in this channel, information gets exchanged wrong and crazy shit/the wrong thing happens.\n\nNot all of these channels are the same and not all systems in the body have the same channels.  Some drugs are said to trigger THEM.  \n\nI would guess your body is having a voltage gated sodium channel issue - which there is no known fix for.  However - you may have the opportunity to reduce something to avoid the trigger which is what I think you are asking.\n\nI would suggest editing your post to add this short question at the bottom:\n\nHas anyone with medication triggered THEM found a way to stay on the triggering medication and reduce the THEM effects?\n\nYou sound like a strong amazing person! well i honestly do not mind going off ssri completely which is what I am doing right now slowly\n\n\ntime will tell me if I will be able to get on adderall when that time comes.\n\nthe interesting thing was that as soon as i popped the daily ssri almost all of the redness from the adderall comedown disappeared.\nand now when I am tapering the ssri it does not do that anymore.\n\nnot that this info should tell me anything it is pretty much trial and error\nthanks for the info\ni really hope that is not the case I am a healthy 21 year old and now i cannot get nervous without extreme heat in my body\nbut yeah if all of that does not work I will need a way to keep taking adderall...\nI am literally incapable without it sadly. i have this small unrealistic hope that it is all due to lexapro im probably genetically predisposed though. are there any tests to confirm having this mutation?\nshould i expect pain in the future aside from the heat?\nhow deadly is this There is a genetic test. One company charges 250.00 if your insurance does not cover it.  I think the trajectory of THEM as far as intensity greatly varies.\n\nI do not think it is deadly in itself but you passing out is a serious issue.  THEM can be very painful and isolating.\n\nKeep asking your Dr\u2019s questions and if what you are trying is working go with it.  I think it is possible that it was triggered by a med but that does not mean it was.\n\nIf you keep passing out your Dr\u2019s need to do an MRI of your brain just to make sure nothing is wrong in there.  And talk to your Pharmacist about rare drug side effects/drug interactions.\n\nYou are doing the best thing for yourself you can, asking questions and trying to get to the bottom of \u201cit\u201d.  That is not easy and I commend you for your dedication yo yourself. yeah i agree. first thing im doing is getting off all the chemicals. im probably getting off finasteride too. even though it seems unrelated. no one can know what causes it. im calling the pharmacist thanks For what it is worth, I have THEM and I take Adderall. I need it too badly to get off of it, but I do think it makes flares worse. I just (like 4 days ago) started on gabapentin, and it has already helped so so much. I do not think you necessarily need to sacrifice proper brain function to treat your other symptoms. my flare ups started when I started Ritalin. When I do not take it my flare ups do not happen. I was started on Gabbapentin and Ritalin and the duo made my flare ups stop also. I believe it is a genetic predisposition that the stimulant activates. If you are healthy and young, I would not recommend starting Gabbapentin. You should not want to be on 2 medications everyday for the rest of your life as both can have some harsh side effects long term. Plus, THEM is a vascular disorder and if you are young and healthy, it can only get worse. I would not tell you to get off medication that is helping,  but I think you are doing the right thing in considering that adderall and ritalin are also vascular constrictors, so the THEM is probably worse on them especially when they wear off and your vascular system begins to dilate again. hope this helps. I am young too, 22, and I am looking to get off of my ritalin and gabbapentin to see if the ritalin is what is causing this. i see a neurologist later this month I can update you if you would like for sure.\nright when I found the right med that stopped me from being detached useless understimulated person i stepped right back into hell knowing what normal feels like What is your dosage of gaba? Do you notice the flare up when the Adderall is actively working or after it is worn off?  I have tried Adderall 20mg a couple times and noticed it stops the flare up for about 24 hours.  After that they seem to return with a vengeance. Adderall is also known to cause Raynaud's.  Which is basically the opposite condition of THEM. I have noticed that if I take adderall my THEM symptoms are gone while it is active.  But once the Adderall has cleared the THEM symptoms are exaggerated for a couple days.", "Or both at the same time\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03loll\ud83d\ude43 \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  This is the most relatable thing I have seen in ages! \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 Finally a meme for me", "Them??? Lengthy post  Had started getting raynards October 2020, and started getting facial flares March 2020\u2026 they were in no way as server or close together and I can only remember it starting off as the face. Hands, feet, cheeks, nose, ears but also my eyes are effected and the splotches on my body! This stayers somtimes 2021, now I am flaring evrytime I go to sleep abs then at least once a day. 90% of the time it is random, but sunlight, heat, anxiety, exercise (even basic walking) and eating bring it on, when I say eating it is not the contents of the food or heat etc as it happens instanly/witching a few mouthfuls. It can happen in multiple areas or just one at a time\u2026. My cheeks throb and pulsate, inside of my nose burns, ares goes puffy looking and all areas feel tender like they are full and it burns so bad, purple tone when not flaring and increased claminess in areas I look back at pictures and think it do not even look as bad as what I was feeling\u2026 it can last hours to days, I think the longest I had one was 24hours. All results of mine have come back fine, I have had multiple blood tests and nothing\u2026 first suspected was lupus but that and scleroderma has been ruled out\u2026 eveything has!! I have through them from the start but since having to go to A&amp;E I had everyone saying lupus where I spent a few months down that road for it to not be that. Saw a derm who soad it is my blood vessels they are weak and struggle dialating and constricting\u2026 I do not think he knows of erythromelalgia as that is what it literally says on google it is, I have to wait 3 months till the next appointment.\n\nSomething had come up on my 24 hour ecg which I was expecting anyway as I think I have pots\u2026 do not think this has anything to do with this concern, but let me know otherwise I am so sorry you are going through this. Your face is quite similar to mine in terms of THEM.The symptoms also sound very similar.  It is important to find a doctor that is qualified to diagnosis THEM. Prior to me seeing a doctor who knew what it was I was told I had Lupus, rosace, cellulitis, and more. \nThere are a few very helpful Facebook groups. Wonderful people who are going through the same thing. Yes really really is the worst!! I am so sorry for you too, it is the biggest pain\ud83d\ude02 I recently saw a derm which I have been waiting months to get to this point for him to just tell me it is my smaller blood vessels being weak and not being able to constrict and dilate properly\u2026 telling me it is quite complex no one looks/treats this issue and no disorders etc when it turns out that is the literal defenition for them\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fwhen I see him next I am going to tell him this or kat going to have to end up going to A&amp;E again\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f have you found anything that works, started any treatments etc? Hey,my derm told me the same thing(blood vessels not working properly basically,but his exact description was them's diagnosis so\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f),said it is not \"a big deal\" and it can happen when someone has Raynaud's,as an after effect I guess.I was not prescribed anything specifically for this, although mine is not as severe as yours comparing the pictures,but I have found my antihistamine I take for Raynaud's helps a bit(I take levocetirizine). First my standard disclaimer: I am not a doctor. I am not YOUR doctor. The last time I was in A&amp;E I said some very unkind things about a doctor. But I digress.  Point is, I am not a medical professional.\n\nYou have THEM.  I would bet on it.  And I rarely say such with any level of certainty here and I respond to almost all the *\"Could this be erythromelalgia?*\" posts.\n\nEvery. Single. Element. It all screams THEM.\n\nRaynaud's? Check. Raynaud's is a very common co-morbidity. Raynaud's is like THEM's obnoxious cousin who insists on being oppositionally defiant to you in every way at a family reunion. In Raynaud's the blood vessels abnormally constrict, forcing blood out of the tissue, leaving the tissue looking abnormally pale. In THEM the blood vessels abnormally dilate, letting the tissue swell with excess blood, making the tissue look abnormally red.\n\nFlare when going to sleep? Check. Laying down causes blood vessels to relax and dilate as your body is not fighting gravity so much to force blood to your brain. This little bit of vessel dilation can set off flares. It does so in a great many THEM patients.\n\nAffecting hands, feet, cheeks, nose, and ears with some splotches elsewhere? Check. That is the exact list of the most affected body parts.  I would guess your knees light up too and you just forgot to add it to the ever growing list.\n\nFlares daily that come and go, lasting a day at a time sometimes? Check. Allergic reactions tend to be shorter lived. THEM, not so much. It maddeningly comes and goes all the time, often set of by recognizable triggers.\n\nSpeaking of triggers, set off by sunlight, heat, anxiety, and exercise (even basic walking)? Check. Probably set off by advanced walking too. Pretty much anything that increases your body's need to shed excess heat and or increase blood flow to the skin can trigger a flare. For some people even certain foods can set them off. But ALL of what you listed are common triggers.\n\nNormal blood tests? Check, with explanation. Quite a few THEM patients have abnormal blood tests because certain blood cancers (which are easily identified in simple blood count tests) are linked to THEM in *some* patients. I am glad you apparently do not have one of those cancers. But for those who do, treating the cancer often causes the THEM to resolve itself. The frustration with a normal blood test is then that you are not sure what is causing it that might could be treated. And most THEM patients have normal blood tests, at leas the routine tests.  In some an elevated ANA points to an autoimmune cause. Very specialized blood tests might can confirm an autoimmune cause, such as IgIG vs TS-HDS or IgG vs FGFR-3.\n\nSuspected lupus, scleroderma, or damn near anything else? Check. (And, ( It is never lupus.) So many patients bounce from one specialist to another without a diagnosis (or with an incorrect other diagnosis) while symptoms continue.\n\nThe advice I give here is that many doctors are not familiar with treating THEM. Many doctors can go their entire career without seeing a single THEM patient. THEM is rare. Really rare.\n\nSo see a doctor who is familiar with THEM. The Erythromelalgia Association maintains a ( of medical professionals who are familiar with THEM. I strongly suggest considering getting an evaluation from one of those doctors even if you have to pay out of pocket to do so outside the NHS. Since you mention going to A&amp;E I am assuming you are in the UK?  Be sure to click the little (Search by Country &amp; State/Province) link under the search box to let you search outside the US.\n\nThere are several different medical specialists on that list. Based upon what you have described I would suggest choosing a neurologist off that list if one is near to you.\n\nMeanwhile, exercise by swimming so you can shed body heat quickly. Stay cool, but do not use ice packs. And read this subReddit for several other ideas for how to lessen symptoms. I would tell you to try out carbamazepine. I have seen similar cases see major improvement on that drug.\nAlso you should look into Mast cell disorders. Without the pics of your red hands and feet I would have immediately said mast cell condition. Yes, actually quite frustrating\ud83d\ude02 I had them telling me how bad it is but no looking into it really whatso ever, deffo going to bring this disease up with him ans tell him there are things that can be prescribed\u2026 he may just not know about this condition but now I will make sure he will\ud83d\ude02 Omg Thankyou so much!!! Deffo learning some new things, suprised as I spend hours trying to research. I would bet on it too!! Suspected this from the beginning but my rheum wasent quick to listen, now the derms basically clarified without saying the name (do not think he knows what it is) Never could find an answer for the sleeping one so Thankyou so much!! Deffo going to try and prop myself up more \n\nYep knees definitely do!! There isnt one part of my body that is not effected \n\nYep tried the allergy route too cuttting out foods writing down etc and nothing\n\nI am hoping when I bring this up they will know the exact tests that are needed \n\nAt this point I really am debating private beacuse nhs is way too long winded and no one really knows anything \n\nThankyou so much for this!! If only thoses providers were as helpful and seekful as you\u2026 I wish you all the best!! Deffo going to save that!!im sure I will need medications to bring up to them, as I was first told there is not really much they can do (but do not think they know about erythromelalgia) also mast cell, what is that? The top comment said it all very well, but my advice would be to not stop trying to find a doctor who knows about THEM/bloody vessel disorders and stick with them. It is the first step to not feeling alone in all this. Keep hanging in there. Yes could not have said any better \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffbThankyou so much!! It does get hard is not it beacuse you get so so limited\u2026 I will not stop!! Feel free to message me anytime, I have felt quite alone in my condition so as much as I would not want it anyone else to suffer it is nice knowing there are others out there! Thabkyou so much, same for you!! Yes it deffo is a little easier knowing it is not just you and that there is an actual condition for it\u2026 It was made out a lot different by my derm Oh yeah I get you... I convinced myself I had rosacea for ages and drove myself crazy because deep down I knew something more was going on. I am affected in my face, knees, feet and hands. As soon as I saw a derm they completely ruled out rosacea and suggested THEM. I have now been seeing a rheumatologist (often a specialist that deals with THEM) and it is just comforting knowing people are looking out for you and do not think you are crazy!! Me too!! It is what they say as it is a smaller problem, was your appointments for them all local? My mum works along side some derms at my local hospital and the told her I need to ask my gp for a referral to medical dermatology in London which is a good 2/3 hours away, as the local derms said they do not see it often and it is quite rare, alredy sounds like they do not believe me\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Yes I live in London and all my doctors are based here :) I am lucky that my parents are both in the medical field so had access to contacts etc. If you have not already - defo check out the THEM association website handbook, it has some really useful thorough info about the condition and where to start with treatment. Ugh that is so annoying for you! Another possibility is to look up the THEM online forum, there is a section there on doctors who know about THEM. I think it is mostly US based but there might be UK ones too. GP is a good place to start, however referrals can take ages, so if financially possible maybe consider seeing someone private to start off with to get a working diagnosis then switch to NHS. My Dad is a GP and was the first one to mention THEM so they do know!! Perfect!! Thabkyou so much for all of this, will deffo check them out Thankyou \ud83d\udc95", "Elimination diet ?

The only reason I bring that up is because originally I was told that having raynaud's and POTS was pretty normal as a part of the symptoms a lot of people experience, but I back then I am not sure if I was experiencing this yet. \n\nBTW, 22-year-old female, moderately healthy with celiac disease and asthma. \n\nSo this has been happening for years now. Usually it is pretty bad for a few weeks or months at a. time and gets triggered by loads of stuff, from typing on my computer too long so that my pinky and ring finger on each hand end up swollen, red, shiny and burning, or sitting on the couch for too long until my neck, face and ears are hot, red, and stiff/burning, or often when I go from being pretty cold to warming up, and then within the hour my whole head and ears and nose in particular are burning and throbbing and red. My eyes also feel a bit stiff and \"cottony\", and I start to feel a bit nauseous and ill. It will do it a lot for a while, and then suddenly it will stop happening for months at a time. Nearly a year at one point I think. But then something or other will trigger or my health will be a bit shit for a while and suddenly it is happening again.  I am currently in the middle of an episode that has lasted at least a few hours, though it may have started earlier as someone commented on my face looking quite rosy.  I was working in the cold all day and I noticed it happening with my hands, and every time I would go inside it would kind of start. Until I got home and it went mental. All the pics are the best I could do to capture it right now. I feel a bit nauseous,  my eyes seem like they are showing a lot of like, fog and delayed light, my lips are kind of tingling, and my ears, temples, nose and cheeks feel like they are on fire and burning hot, in sensation and to the touch, in addition to being bright red, a bit stiff and shiny. \n\nDoes this sound like what you experience? Does it happen along with Raynaud's sometimes (at separate times/triggers of course)? Are there any underlying health conditions that would cause both, or may line up with my other diagnoses of asthma, celiac's and potentially ehlers-danlos (mild hyper mobility type)? I am also dealing with an eating disorder if that might be involved at all. \n\nThanks so much!  \n\n\n\n\n\n Hello there! I am sorry to hear you are dealing with all of this right now, I completely understand how frustrating it can be. I have had THEM and Raynaud\u2019s for about two years now and just today saw a neurologist for the first time who believes I have Dysautonomia- he is sending me to the closest Mayo Clinic specializing in Dysautonomic Disorders. It is been a struggle for the past few years seeing doctor after doctor and trying to figure out what is causing the THEM for me. From your photos and what you described, I would say yes it appears you are having THEM. Mine is usually located on my face, cheeks and ears and occasionally my feet. My Raynaud\u2019s is only located on my hands.", "Curious Just wondering did anyone have an onset of pain before the appearance of your THEM? \n\nFor me, I have pain in my left leg and then it travelled upward unilaterally and then about a year ago started having episodes of THEM. I have neuropathy pain but that is associated with THEM. \n\nwhat you are describing sounds more like CRPS- complex regional pain syndrome. I am not a doctor and I do not know for sure. Did you have an injury to the leg? The THEM is appearing in your leg or else where? I have looked into CRPS but I have not mentioned it to my doctor so maybe that is worth bringing to her attention as a possibility.  \n\nNo I have not had an injury to my leg. My leg only hurts during the evening and gets worse when I lay down but even if I work myself too hard or walk around too much it will make the pain progressively worse for that day. The THEM appears bilaterally on my feet, hands, and face. Gotcha! Have you had any recent blood work? If so, are your blood counts normal or did you have high platelets? Do you find any relief from the episodes with trying aspirin? One thing that has helped me with my THEM has been magnesium from the health food store. \n\nI am also getting tested for Small Fiber Neuropathy (many many people with THEM have it)  because it can also cause THEM but the pain of SFN can effect other places on your body such as your leg possibly in your case. THEM is such a difficult issue because doctors know so little and I know it is frustrating doing a process of elimination like this when you are in pain. Yes I have had a lot of blood work done pretty recently and everything comes up normal. I do take magnesium but mainly for my left leg spams which have really helped! \n\nCompletely agree, it is really tough to keep hope as well. I have been tested for SFN and still nothing. Hopefully I will get some answers soon", "Been told it could be THEM. Thoughts? ", "is this THEM? help! - details below  I am super new to reddit as well as THEM but am so grateful that I found this group! For the past week or so my hands have been flaring up like this at night time and it is been absolutely insufferable. it feels like a sunburn is slowly taking over my hands and has even occurred on my face? It is happened a few times in the past but i have chalked those times up to winter time dry skin or sitting on my hands funny. This time seems so much worse than those ever were. \n\nI am more confused because it seems like these symptoms line up with THEM, but my hands have also been extremely weak, numb, tingly, and basically useless since this spell has started. The redness subsides during the day but I cannot feel or use my hands for the most part, and it is been extremely difficult especially because I am trying to finish up my semester of school work but literally cannot type on a computer. During the day the parts of my hand where the redness occurs most become purplish and almost scaly, and I cannot even feel my fingers. \n\nI went to the ER yesterday and they told me it was a rash and referred me to a dermo. All of the dermotology clinics near me are booked out for months, but this feels more urgent. I think it is getting worse and more complicated - is this just THEM, or something else? I am very confused, sad, and irritated and I feel like no one understands. :( I would follow up with dermatology. \n\nThe sudden appearance of it does not suggest THEM, and your hands seem almost swollen when it happens? That is not something I experience (formal diagnosis). \n\nThis is going to sound pedantic, but it also seems like allergy red rather Tham THEM red in-color, but obviously that is side commentary more than anything. \n\nPurple/scaley does not quite line up either. Have you tested with taking an allergy pill to see what happens?\n\nIf it puts your mind at ease, dermatology can deal with THEM, but the puffiness you are experience makes me think allergy (not a doctor, obviously). When you have this happen again try to take a Benadryl or anti histamine to see if there is any effect. I would also test taking aspirin when this is happening at a different time to test the result. Do you also feel tingling pain in the red areas or just heat? \n\nI would consider looking up information on Mast Cell Activation Syndrome. I have THEM and MCAS due to Dysautonomia and there are a few things to rule out to get you headed in the right direction for help since these things mimic one another. Hang in there! There is also a Facebook group for THEM that is really helpful too! Do you take any stimulants like adderall or Ritalin? Or anything similar? So, at first glance I would say maybe.  Your right hand looks really angry red there! And there is a bit less, but some redness on your left hand. Redness on your cheeks and nose is prominent.  Looks like maybe also a bit on what I can see of your ear peeking through your hair in the last picture.\n\nRedness and pain in the feet, hands, nose, cheeks, and/or ears are consistent with possible THEM.  But THEM does not typically cause the sort of weakness, tingliness, and numbness you describe.\n\nIf you really get so weak that you cannot type an evaluation by a neurologist should also be part of your workup.  If there is anything you can do to prompt a flare or otherwise ensure that any neurological tests are run while you are experiencing weakness it might help. Can I ask why you are asking this question?  Has me wondering if my stimulants are exasperating my raynauds and causing my newer color changing hands and feet. My erythromelagia started after I started taking the stimulants Vyvanse for ADHD. A few searches showed a ton of other people taking stimulants got it as well. Apparently it is a side effect of the medication! Yah I saw a lot about Raynauds and Vyvanse. My raynauds definitely got worse when I started Vyvanse.  I did not see the link with THEM but totally makes sense.  Did you stop taking Vyvanse? I am wondering if I should do a test and see if it helps.  My body temperature is out of control. I kept taking it\u2026 Im relieved to find out it was not caused by something more malicious. And so I do not think I will have any long term consequences, because it happens so rarely to me. Ah I see.  Mine is daily now (raynauds or crazy red hot swollen flare type things) but I do not think I have an autoimmune (I should know this week as had blood work late last week but I have been tested before and it was negative so I am already looking for another solution). May try a week or two without Vyvanse and if I see improvement maybe try some non- stimulant meds or decide which feels worse \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Red hands and feet Anyone know how to get rid of or reduce the swelling and redness in my hands and feet?

It is pretty impossible to not have red feet in high heels, at least for me.", "This life sucks. I am 12 years old and I have THEM. It is terrible. I am unable to sleep, move my hands, or even go somewhere without severe pain. Do you guys know if there is anyway to help? I wish there was. Avoiding flares is the only thing i have found. Dont get hot i lay in bed all summer with AC and fans. Im sorry your suffering. It sucks, but there are things you can do to make it better. Do some research!\n\nWhat works for me is being warm/hot all day, then cooling off at night. Thanks! I will keep that in mind! Thank you1 I just remembered I have had some success with putting icy hot on and directing fans at affected limbs. I use cold socks on my feet. They also make them as gloves. I keep it as cool as I can, I do not wear socks unless there is snow on the ground. I keep my feet elevated as much as possible and use a fan pointed at them as often as I can. Thanks! Hopefully this will help! Have you tried cutting out Gluten from your diet? That helped me and reduced my symptoms by 80% I will have to try that! How do you calculate that?\n\nI mean what does the doctor or you do for say that you reduce a 80% your symptoms?\n\nI am really interesting in know that. So you get any treatment for it from your provider?\n\nI get lidocaine infusions and they help tremendously. I do a Keto diet which helps and maybe that is because gluten is cut out.

", "I noticed this red rash a couple of years ago but has been more prominent this year. Has anyone experienced this before?  But it is not really a rash because it does not itch. But I called a micro/neuro vascular rash that shows up whenever I am anxious, or excited and it will disappear quickly. It only started on my chest but has spread to my face and extremities this year. I was thinking maybe neuropathy, erythromelalgia, Rynuads. The same thing happens to me a lot. Do you know what causes it or what it is exactly? It is just a flare up. Whenever I get hot/warm or I take a shower I get red patches like that everywhere. Yes!!

Wool socks help. Currently looking for wool compression socks. Regular compressions socks did not help. Compression does not help me, but I too use wool socks at night because my nerves seem to be hypersensitive.  The thick socks keep me from feeling the bed sheets and blankets.", "How does caffeine effect your THEM? I know caffeine is listed as a possible trigger but for me I think it helps reduce the likelihood of a flare-up.  And I think that makes sense.  Some of us are helped by vasoconstrictors and some are helped by vasodilators.  Caffeine is a vasoconstrictor. \n\nAlcohol is a vasodilator and that screws me up every time.  However the last couple weekends I drank some coffee before having a couple beers.  No flare-up.  I also find myself able to walk farther before a flare-up when I have had caffeine.\n\nAnyone else think caffeine may be helpful in their case?", "do people here also have strong restless legs syndrome? also what about ssri treatment? how strong is the association between ssri use and this? I kind of do, but I do not know if it is because moving them helps with the discomfort. Sometimes, yes. I never thought there was a correlation before, but you could be right! well i saw research of SSRIs are able to fix raynaud's but can sometimes trigger this instead.\nSSRIs are also known to cause restless leg syndrome.\n\nnow I have also seen that the gabapentin is used to treat both disorders.\n\nit seems like serotonin plays a big role here.\n\n\nserotonin syndrome is when you have way too much serotonin in your system (usually from mixing medications)\nand that is known to raise body temperature to dangerous levels, like the extreme form of this weird illness.\n\nI am going to ask a professional neurologist about all of this soon.\nI am not going to surrender before i find the roots of my inner oven!!! So sorry I am only seeing this now! I had no idea about the serotonin connection until you mentioned it, but you may be right! I know this because I actually take an SSRI (Prozac) for depression. I do have both severe raynaud\u2019s &amp; erythromelalgia, but do not take Prozac for those conditions. \nI started the Prozac about a year ago and, looking back, the Raynaud\u2019s has been way less severe over this time. I still have the THEM flare-ups sometimes, but they have not been as severe in past years. My THEM is typically way worse in winter and, oddly, subsides in the summer. However, this winter it is not that bad at all! \nThanks! I will read more into this.\n\nEdit: Oops. I just re-read your post and noticed you said that although SSRIs are thought to help Raynaud\u2019s, they might trigger erythromelalgia (I presume in those who did not already have the latter condition). I cannot answer that because I already had both these conditions prior to the SSRI. I have had Raynaud\u2019s for literally 30 yrs now. The THEM started about 15 yrs ago, except I did not know then that the  condition even had a name. I sometimes wonder if my severe Raynaud\u2019s damaged by blood vessels so badly that it triggered the THEM (IDK if this is possible) or if I have an underlying vascular disease that caused both of them. \nSorry for the novel! Lol. Yes, sometimes. My father has it too, so maybe I just inherited it from him though.", "Heat Rashes Do you also get \"normal\" heat rashes really easily?

Guess im a vampire \ud83d\ude02 i think heat causes them tho. Or both heat is definitely a trigger for them itself I get these all the time.

It could be the combination of spices or the star anise or ... my biology... that makes it work for me hehe. My eye doctor did tests on my eyes to discover that my tear ducts and mybomian oil glands are both blocked (inflammation caused by the occular rosacea) and occular rosacea and facial rosacea often co-exist. My eyes developed first and then the face. Erythromelalgia I blame for bringing on the facial rosacea flares because the heat from the Erythromelalgia flares induces a rosacea flare.

Mine tingles a lot, but I am not quite sure if that is the feeling you are trying to explain I get this often during flares and it sometimes lingers after the flare is over. Often describe my flares as electric fire. I sometimes feel like I have been driving for hours and that buzzing feeling stays. In fact I will have a buzzy feeling for a while after a long drive.

I am starting on gabapentin \ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89 I am on that! It helps. Hope it works for you too! Oooh I am so happy to hear that it worked for you! May I ask what does you take? I am a bit nervous about the drowsiness I am only on 300mg because I cannot tolerate the drowsiness. It does help though. Not 100% at that dose, but it is something. Fingers crossed for you! Update: gabapentin WORKS for me. I did not realize how bad the swelling was even when I was not experiencing a flare. This is the first time I have seen my fingers, toes, and chest all one colour and not been in pain. I am so so happy What is your dosage? When you say it works, can you stand in place without pain now? Okay it worked for 2 days and then now works ~40%. I am very slowly ramping up from 300 mg to 2400 mg. As soon as I started on 600 mg, my short term memory went OUT THE WINDOW. Like..lost my purse, left my keys at a gas station, found the butter in the knife drawer. \n\nThat said, it seriously helped. Even when I flare, it is so much more tolerable, and that is just at my current 600 mg. I can stand in place without pain, but the duration for me is always dictated by the temperature and whether I am wearing shoes. So, you can now stand pain free at 600mg, but before you could not? I do not have flairs, it is 24/7 with me unfortunately. My THEM in general does not seem to be as painful as it is for others, but my flares are pretty severe. So I suppose now I can stand for longer without discomfort. I am so so sorry that it is constant for you, I honestly cannot imagine dealing with that. May I ask whether you are currently on any treatment? No, I am not currently taking anything.

I used to be a long distance runner, unfortunately, those days are over. \n\nI can stand for about two minutes before my feet hurt, and sit for about an hour before my feet start to burn. They start turning red after about 20 seconds of standing. It actually effects all my skin from head to toe. So, if I rest the bottom of my arm on a desk too long, the bottem of my arm will turn red. It also effects my hands too. It is an interesting feeling, having your butt and feet burn while sitting, and trying to study.\n\n I am still secretly hoping it will disappear one day. The thing that bothers me most is how long car rides went from being fun, to painful now. Dating has also went from fun to something I do not do anymore. I became really unhappy when I discovered that I cannot hold someone is hand for more then 15 minutes or so, other wise the pressure will make my hand turn red and burn.\n\n I do not dwell on what is wrong with me anymore, because I will become depressed. I am in my late 20's, and it felt like my life was just starting to get good. I am still trying to keep my life pointed forward. I wish I never took Cialis, but I cannot go back in time and change it. I just take it day by day now. I am truly sorry to hear that. I am sure it is all the worse for it to come on so suddenly. For what it is worth, I am 25 and have a lot of the same problems, just to a lesser degree. I ignored it for a lot of years, and never really considered the impact that it has on my life. One of the best decisions I made was going to a rheumatologist (I freaked myself into thinking I had Lupus), where they told me they knew of a dermatologist who specializes in immune disorders. They told me I had a lot of treatment options. That was the most hopeful I had felt since this started. This is not something that you are necessarily stuck dealing with, at least at the current severity, if you are willing to explore different options to see if anything works for you.

Hopefully a short and sweet heatwave! It is been pretty hot here the last couple of days (about 90F/32C).

My docs all say neuropathy but it looks a lot like them THEM is a symptom. THEM can result from a number of different things. About 5% of people have THEM because of a genetic mutation on the SCN9A, 10A, or 11A genes. That is called primary THEM.   \nMost of the time THEM is secondary to something else, most often blood or autoimmune disorders. For me personally, I have \"autoimmune SFN with related erythromelalgia.\"  \nI was positively diagnosed with SFN after having a QSART test.  The autoimmune piece came after we checked my FGFR3 antibodies (not a part of normal inflammatory markers) and they were VERY elevated.  \n\n\nSo it is not the same thing, but yes, SFN can cause THEM.

Does this happen to anyone else? I get no rash/hives and it definitely feels internal and neuropathic Yes I get this too. When I get hot or exercise, I get flares in my hands but the rest of my body would feel itchy. For example, if I am on the treadmill in the gym, when I begin I would feel like itchy all over, but it would go away about 20 minutes into the work out. It is like an overall sensitivity to the heat in general. It only started happening to me about 1 year ago (22male). Afterwards I crave cold showers. Have you done any tests? Blood tests etc? Interesting. It is more of a poking sensation rather than an itching sensation. Do you think it is related to erythromelagia Yes but only blood tests and every checked out fine What do you mean by poking? I am not sure. Do you get flare ups? No, I do not get hives or any rashes. I do get redness however. I feel like I am being poked all over my body (torso, face, arms, hands, legs, feet). After I start to sweat it dissipates. I will still feel it after sweating but it is not nearly as intense. Some people believe it is r/cholinergicurticaria but I experience no hives or rashes. Multiple sclerosis would make more sense to me but I honestly have no clue. I would think after a couple years my symptoms would have progressed but they are pretty much the same. Well from what I read from THEM and my own experience, we do not really get hives or rashes. I personally just get dry cracky skin in the areas where I get hot flare ups (hands and feet). During the flare ups, the blood flow is exacerbated thus the arteries/veins become more prominent. I would recommend you return to your doctor or go to a new doctor and try get some other testing, maybe an AMA test. Action is the antidote to despair. Yeah, I have taken action.

I cannot bear to think that I might have to live like this for the rest of my life. \n\nI just needed to vent. I am so sorry that you are struggling so with your THEM.  I hear you and empathize.  I really understand how getting a good night's sleep can be hard to come by.\n\nHere is to finding an effective therapy for your soon! This disease is horrible. My kid has it and is a teen. It is painful, isolating and it steals from you. BUT you are not alone.\n\nI got a silk-like pillowcase for my daughter\u2019s hair from Sally\u2019s Beauty as a stocking stuffer and she said it helps her sleep bc the texture of the pillowcase causes less friction and therefore less heat.  I am finding that with a lot of things - sheets/clothes/socks.  I do not know if a real silk pillowcase would be even better but the one at Sally\u2019s Beauty was not expensive - worth a shot. Maybe pair it with a refrigerated face mask 20 min before bed.\n\nTo be clear I know this is like a drop in the bucket.  All you can do is keep searching for the right treatment. \n\nKeep reaching out. Thank you for your kind words :) That sounds interesting, i will have a search for something similar. Thank you! I am so sorry that your kid is suffering. I really hope it does not last long for her. Do you have access to medical marijuana?  I would never touched the drug recreationally, but now medically, it is the only thing that gets me to sleep. I can help if you do not know where to start. Feel free to PM me.   \n\n\nI have had progressively -worsening THEM for 13 years and have been an MMJ user for 3.5 years. I do not have much to add than what you already know, but can say you are not alone. I was diagnosed at 30... 4 years later feeling like I do not know how I am going to ever have a normal life again. Luckily, we have the small few who understand where you are at. Hopefully that makes you find a bit of comfort in these times. \u2764\ufe0f Thank you \ud83d\udc96 Have you tried mexiletine? No but my doctor says that is the next thing to try, I will need some tests on my heart first. Have you heard good things about mexiletine? It works for me.  My saving grace.   It can affect your heart rhythm, thus the doctor wanting to run some tests.  Unfortunately, as you have found, not every THEM patient responds well to every possible treatment.  But it is worth trying IMHO.\n\nI take it twice a day.  It is half life is only 10 hours, so a bit more than half of the previous dose is out of my system before I take the next.  Net result, if I am a couple hours late taking a dose (or accidentally skip a dose) what is left in my system is sub-therapeutic and the PAIN returns.  \n\nOther strategies include topical lidocaine patches, going barefoot as much as possible at home, sleeping with my feet sticking out from under the blanket, and keeping a fan blowing over my feet as I sleep.", "Disabled Students\u2019 Allowance (DSA) Hello, I am wondering if anyone else have applied for disabled students allowance (dsa) for university and if so how much did they receive? You do not receive direct payment. You discuss with a needs assessor (once told everything is acceptable and receive a letter from the DSA team) they will go over various bits of support and equipment that could benefit you.\n\nOnce done they send a needs assessment report to you and DSA. DSA goes through this and agrees the support that they can (sometimes having to query bits of support which can result in some if it being rejected) and will send a letter with what is agreed along with the quotes.\n\nYou would then contact the suppliers for the quotes given they will provide the support and invoice DSA directly.\n\nThere are some items that you would buy and they reimburse like infrequent taxi journeys if agreed and some general allowance items like ink and paper, again only if agreed.\n\nThere is not a payment to student simply for having a disability. Right okay thank you! Yeah", "I tried midodrine topical cream. It seems to work! We all share what works and what does not from time to time.  I saw a ( by  u/theshadowyswallow that mentioned a topical treatment using midodrine. I wanted to report that I have tried it and it seems to really help!\n\nMidodrine is normally administered orally as a pill. It is a vasoconstrictor normally given to raise blood pressure. Taking it as a pill *might* help but would have systemic effects and raise my already high-ish blood pressure.\n\nI found the ( that she was referring to which was published in a reputable medical journal JAMA Dermatology. It describes a small scale trial of midodrine which had been ground up and mixed with a skin cream in the compounding pharmacy at the Mayo Clinic. Most THEM patients treated with that cream found prompt and significant relief from THEM flares.\n\nI first called my local compounding pharmacy and asked if they could prepare this if the doctor prescribed it. They had not worked with midodrine before but found they could get the medication and said they could do it if I got a prescription.\n\nI then forwarded the link to that research letter to my pain management doctor and asked if we could try it. We discussed it at the next appointment and she sent the prescription to the compounding pharmacy.\n\nIt took about two days for them to get the medication and prepare it. Cost about US$85 for a 2 ounce container of cream.  I just paid out of pocket as this was something of a trial.\n\nI have since spoken to my insurance company and it seems they are willing to cover it up to about $120 per month, with me responsible only for my normal copays, . \n\nI haver only used it as a sort of rescue treatment with the other means of control are failing me. But it seems to do the trick. Constricts the blood vessels in my feet and the pain subsides with a minute or so. Nice! Thanks for sharing. It is neat that it actually works in the blood vessels themselves as a vasoconstrictor vs. the special compound cream I use now which is ketamine and amitriptyline that simply deadens the pain but they remain hot and engorged. ", "Shoe issues for work Hi, I have had erthyomelagia for a long time now, and know about it for like 5 years, but never had a reason to bother doing anything about it since I could get away with no wearing shoes. But I am now working in a lab and it is become a serious issue. Does anyone have any good solutions to wearing shoes that help like maybe wearing shoes that are too large or extremely thin? I had this issue working in a hospital, but I found some clogs that were pretty breathable. I think not having a back and being slip ons really help, because you get more air. I would wear super thin socks or no socks as well. If your scrubs are long enough no one sees your heel. \u263a\ufe0f\n(\n\nAlso (\n\nThey are super thin and have a sole and I wear these working out and you do not wear socks. They have some black ones which might work for you. \ud83e\udd17 I feel you.  Just arrived at my night shift job and the first thing I did was take off my socks and shoes.\n\nIf I have to wear something then super breathable clogs or sandals though maybe the OP cannot get away with that in a lab?  Otherwise a small fan on the floor facing my feet and I keep a spray bottle of water to mist my feet.  That evaporation of water cools much faster than fan alone, sort of mimicking sweating. I have heard of people refrigerating gel inserts for their shoes for temporary relief. Perhaps if you brought a cooler with a couple of sets of them, you can keep switching them out?", "What is your primary symptom? \n\n( I have mainly itching and nerve like tingling. Also my toes swell. Sometimes they burn at night. Burning. They swell too but the redness and burning is the biggest thing. You cannot necessarily tell they are swollen unless you know what they look like normally. I have pain and itching.", "New THEM diagnosis here. Worsening over time? I started experiencing my first symptoms a few months back; there was not much \u201cpain\u201d, just a burning sensation in my toes, which were bright red. Freaked me out at first, but quickly dismissed it as nothing. However, as time has passed, I now have longer flare ups with legitimate, awful pain. The pain is extending up into calves and also localizing on my knees. \nAfter speaking to my rheumatologist and cardiologist, I was only just diagnosed last week, so there is no immediate treatment plan until some other tests are done. \n\nWill this only continue to worsen over time?\nWhat causes the condition to worsen? It is not entirely clear why the condition worsens in some patients and not others. But one possibility is that if your THEM is caused by an underlying condition, and that condition continues to worsen, then your THEM may worsen.  But that is certainly not the only reason why your THEM may worsen.\n\nIn some patients THEM stays about the same. Mine did for around 9 years. In some patients is worsens. Mine suddenly started worsening about a year ago. And in some patients is improves on its own. Mine sure did not!\n\nSounds like you have more tests ahead. Doctors might be able to offer medications as a treatment even as they continue to run tests and try to determine an underlying cause. Be patient. They may have to change your medications several times to find something that works for you, *if* they can find something that works for you. Mine worsened a bit this past year. But so far, it is mostly manageable (except when I cannot sleep) or do chores. Just be kind to yourself and take it easy when you are in a flare cycle.", "Current pain management strategies for patients with erythromelalgia: a critical review (", "Does anyone else have chest pain? If so is it related to THEM? I am just looking for input here, as I do not know how seriously I should be taking this. My chest hurts in my sternum quite often &amp; anti-inflammatory meds usually help that but I also get deeper pain that feels like a squeezing pressure that goes into my back too which I have found no relief. I am asking this because THEM is technically a cardiovascular issue too and I am wondering if anyone else has had chest pain. I am also 21 &amp; weigh like 110lbs. Thank you in advance", "Saw an allergist today, he thinks it is THEM. My patches do not hurt though, they just feel very hot and kind of burn  THEM is also know as the burning man syndrome. Burning is the key symptom. Started getting these patches on my knees and feet when standing back in September. They go away within 15 min if I lay down. Heat makes them worse, like showers, exercise, hot weather. They do not itch, and they feel hot like a sunburn and I can feel them burning through my clothes sometimes. Could still be THEM. Different severities. Mine usually feels itchy with some pain as it gets longer. I get a very similar thing on my feet after hot showers! I am 80% sure it is related to my THEM but this is just smaller and more localized. Are you trying anything to ease the discomfort? THEM is not often described as itching. Hot, burning, painful, and like a sunburn are common descriptions. \n\nAnything that cools the area often makes the redness and pain better.\n\nSo no guarantee that this is THEM, but it very well could be. While *most* THEM patients first have symptoms in their feet or hands that is not *all* THEM patients.  It might be the early start of THEM. THEM in localized areas is numb (For instance this one area in my pinky toe is kind of numb and flairs a lot) but the bigger flairs will be noticeable. The heat and exercise thing do point to it being them. This probably means you just went to see a doctor earlier on. I did this June/July of 2020 with the same kind of symptoms but in my toes. It has now spread to my feet, legs, elbows, face, and hands. I feel like it is important to make clear that if this is the start of THEM you need to be prepared for the possibility for major progression. Nobody EVER. EVER. Told me that.  About 1 in 5 them patients self-reported the symptom as itching at least part of the time  \n\n\n (  \n\n\nCheck out the patients guide and the survey responses.  This rare disease is poorly understood as of today and so there is some variation in how people report their sensations.  \n\n\nFor me and my mother, it is usually itchy or hot/burning.  I would describe it as a chronic second degree burn or a bad sunburn.  Sometimes it is just insanely itchy and numb. Sometimes its pins and needles.  If you have been taking meds like antihistamines or cannabis, it is also possible that you are 'treating' the pain and are not as aware of it as if you were to stop taking those meds for a few days.  (If you have got a flu and you take dayquil... you have still got the flu, you are just not 'expressing symptoms')     How bad does it affect you? I am seeing a neurologist and she thinks this is what is going on with me. I have had this for ~2 to 3 years and it is localized in my hands and feet. It is virtually nonexistent during winter, but when summer comes... oh boy. Does not seem to be getting worse, but I am so scared if it reaches my face and I end up feeling like my whole body is burning or like I am drowning. Please tell me that is not how it feels.  At the worst of it, it is like being an open channel to the plane of fire.it just courses through you like a solar flare. That is when I get the heavy duty benedryl and go checkout for a while.\n\nThose days are not frequent and medication keeps it bay.  It is only when I am off my meds that it comes on that terrible.  I dont know what you have tried for treatment, but for me, antihistamines and Cannabis work to keep the absolute worst days away.   I still have bad days if it is hot, but it is not 'possessed by a demon' bad. My 'bad days' are more like I have been carrying hot coals in my hands while wandering a desert at twilight.  \n\nBut all of that is when it is over 68-73.  Under that it is like a smothered kitchen fire. Sometimes there will be a little life but its quick.  Or if it is a good day, itll just be some stinging in my hands and feet around the evening.\n\nI am sorry.  \n\nBut not all cases express the same...  yours might not be as bad.  You also might be in the lucky group like me where antihistamines can make a dramatic difference. That was my first sign of THEM and some swelling in my feet. And progressed very quickly, it was summer time so that definitely did not help. They do look like rashes but do not itch, some people get itchy. If I lay down and elevate my legs it goes away within 15 min! I have also been taking more lukewarm showers instead of hot as a preventative measure. Lukewarm showers definitely helps a lot Yeah I have had two dermatologists suggest cholinergic urticaria (despite me saying multiple times that they do not itch, so I doubt they are hives). I am just glad that a third doctor suggested THEM because I think that is a more accurate diagnosis.\n\nWhat do you do to treat your THEM, and do you know if it is primary or secondary? Yes, it is very hard to find a doc who listens instead of saying it is varicose veins, nerve stuff, even saying the swelling should go away in a couple of months, which was not the case. Mine did start small and progress just as your knees look and mine do not itch. I have them now in my hands as of 4 months ago that can develop later unfortunately for me. He did say every person is different with THEM having them in the knee and hands are a little more rare to have. My dermatologist doc did not say anything about primary or secondary I will have to ask in two weeks when I see him. He said yes you do have THEM which was diagnosed by my primary care doc that research a lot for a months figuring it out. Dermatology looked at every pictures from day 1 to now and said yes you have THEM. And the symptoms I been having everyday especially in the heat or room temp. Even at 68 degrees is still not comfortable for my flare ups to stay away, definitely challenging. How long do they stay? What triggers them? They are triggered by standing upright and heat. So standing in a hot shower, exercising on my feet, standing while cooking in a hot kitchen etc. they last however long I am upright. If I am standing for two hours or 15 min, that is how long they last. If I sit down and elevate my legs they go away within 15 min. Sounds like THEM. \n\nAny other areas of redness or flaring? \n\nI am impressed your allergist thought of this!\n\nOn Facebook we have several THEM groups if you would like to come join us. Although if yours is only your knees, that is a rare presentation! But I am sure there is a reason for it... something with the blood vessels there, or even your posture. My knees only flare when I am sitting a certain way I get it on my feet in certain situations, like the hot shower, when I come inside from being in the cold and have on warm socks/shoes, or during vigorous cardio exercise. I have also started to notice my palms can get pretty red and hot and feel swollen, but I just assumed that was from dry skin since my hands do not get blotchy (palms are uniform in redness) like my knees and feet. Now I am starting to think it is related unfortunately. \n\nAnd I was very happy to hear the allergist mention this, I had two dermatologists tell me it was heat hives (cholinergic urticaria) and then they referred me to the allergist, who was like \u201cthis looks nothing like CU, this actually looks like something another patient of mine had... erythro something.\u201d I had read about THEM so I was like \u201coh THEM?\u201d I got CBC, metabolic panel, c reactive protein, sedimentation rate and TSH tests done in January when I first started going to the doctor about this, and all labs came back normal. Allergist ordered an ANA just in case, but yeah I do not really have any other symptoms so I have no idea what it could be secondary to. It is been a very stressful journey, but I am glad to have a doctor think of something besides hives! Def sounds like THEM. Hopefully your doctors will be able to help you more. Mine had not heard of it, but researched it with me. \n\nNo other symptoms, all healthy labs. \n\nOne doctor was even very encouraging about the diagnosis, saying that in a way it is a relief to have a name for it and know it is not something \u201celse.\u201d Which can sound dismissive, but the way he said it put my mind at ease, like I could stop worrying about finding out what \u201celse\u201d is going on. hey there again haha you replied to my post. I was told by rheum and immunology that THEM does not cause itching, and that if mine were ever itchy would be hives or a possible allergy to something im in contact with. Im never really itchy and the patches have never been raised. My pediatrician when i was younger brushed this off as sensitive skin or hives from a pollen allergy but anti-histamines never worked to fix it. It wasnt painful, just hot and made me feel kind of exhausted. Shes not a good pediatrician regardless so im not surprised that she was off base she never even payed attention whenever id see her and my mom despised her but it was too complicated to switch dr's. If youre reacting to anti-histamines, its probably a combination of those things since you experience the burning uncanny to THEM. I know someone who had an allergy that she thought it was THEM, went to get an allergy test was told that it wouldnt be itchy and it wound up being that she is allergic to nickel and she had to literally replace all of the pipes in her home. Do you think that maybe this is the case for you on top of THEM, and that is why your mother has the same issue? Food for thought since you mentioned its been happening a while, maybe it could be the pipes in your house or something stupid like that and its a separate issue from THEM. 1/2\nNo. Its pins and needles, which my brain interprets as an itch.  It is pretty normal for them from what I have read.  Antihistamines actually help by binding to the nerve ends responsible for transmitting neurovascular stuff.  Not by modulating histamines.  For the record, I am 40 and my mother is 70 and we have had these problems our entire lives, regardless of where we lived.  Trust me, I have been through the same decade long mystery illness journey that most THEM patients have been on.  I am diagnosed. The details are way too much to get into for a reddit comment.  Long story short: docs call me a unicorn.\n\nTheres a ton of published stuff that basically says treatment for THEM is highly individualized.  What works for one patient does not always work for others.  Antihistamines are actually a common first step in treating THEM because like 40% of THEM patients respond to it.  That means that 60% doesnt though lol.  I am just lucky.  When I skip my meds for more than a couple days, it goes from itch to full on nuclear fire. 2/2 finding a doc that knows THEM well enough to diagnose it is kind of difficult.  Check out the physicians directory on erythromelalgia.org \n\nIts important to find a doctor that listens to you and respects you as a person.  That can be difficult. In my case I found a great dermatologist and rheumatologist at a research hospital to help me with my mystery disease (that turned out to be THEM)\n\nThem is commonly misdiagnosed as hives, athlete's foot, and fibromyalgia before its correctly diagnosed. Sometimes it can take years to rule out everything else since THEM is diagnosed by excluding all other options.\n\nGood luck on your medical journey Ah got it! Didnt know that. I never looked into anti-histamines because some of them interfere with my medications and they hadnt helped me previously with the blotchiness. I understand the itch thing now. I didnt realize when you were referring to your mother that this has been going on so long and im so sorry youre experiencing that. By any chance do any one of your parents or grandparents have ashkenazi jewish ancestry? I remember reading that THEM has affected a lot of ashkenazi jews. It especially affects young teenage girls and winds up chronic. Food for thought. I hope one day you find an answer. If you are interested, I use a liquid form of THC that really blocks the pain (not the heat though) i have at night, message me if youre interested in it as i dont want to post that kind of information on the public thread. It truly makes me unable to feel the pain and sleep so well. No anxiety whatsoever. Great headspace. Its the only thing that provides me relief. Sleep is so crucial with chronic pain and i never wake up in the middle of the night and i feel significantly more rested with it and without it im a zombie the next day. Since your mother is 70, it would actually probably help with arthritis or anything if she has other health issues. Just putting that out on the table, my friend's grandmother was able to stop taking oxys after using it and found so much more relief. If you or her take any medications that would interfere with it, i say dont try it. Many people i have shared this method of making it with now use it and find relief, helps with so many different ailments. If youre willing to give it a try, message me. If you need to sit on it for a while, ill answer in the future :) Im in no place to tell you what to do, but if i can help someone out of pain than its worth the shot of mentioning. Some people are very opposed, but this is probably healthier than inhaling thc or digesting an edible of some sort. I find those to interfere with my digestion but everyone is different. I also feel much safer knowing i know the exact dosage of this and how much to take because i can alter it. I usually take it at about 9:30 and provides me relief until about 5 pm the following day. I live in a legal area so I talk about it all the time. We need to remove the stigma from medical cannabis and the only way to do that is to talk about it openly and honestly.  \n\nCannabis is a freaking miracle and helps tremendously.  Combined with allegra d or cetirizine and it helps even more.  Cetirizine withdrawal can trigger a bad flare though.\n\nAccording to 23 and me, I am about as western European as possible lol.  2/3rds british and irish, 1/3 french.

I have a lot of extended family with similar issues that have been self-diagnosed as hay fever, or diagnosed with edema. Both of which are in the box of \"things THEM is misdiagnosed as\"  From what I have personally seen of people throughout my life, I would say this problem is a lot more common than it seems, its just that most people do not have it so bad that they go to the doctor to figure it out. Especially since it can be treated with antihistamines sometimes.  It makes it very easy to ignore as \"allergies\" instead of taking the years to find out \"why\". this has been my argument with them the past week following the geneticist, they keep telling me nothing is wrong w them and laughing at me and being like wtf, like to the point where my dad, brother cousin and grandma (since passed) both very obviously have crohns and they act like their symptoms are normal when they are so so so so obviously not. half of my family has had a foot of their colon removed and almost died from diverticulitis from ignoring these things. im the youngest and they exclude me and say the most horrible things about me and act like this is all a bait for attention. they cared the last two weeks when they saw how sick i was on mothers day and then yesterday suddenly that didnt matter at all when i asked them questions. as if it isnt crucial given i have no idea what is going to slap me in the face when i see the results given my mom is adopted and it was totally black market and any and all information didnt make sense relative to eachother. i dont know why they are so nasty to themselves and everyone around them that is a self aware and nice human It is like wildfire. It is spread almost everywhere in about a year. But that is accurate for how the face flair feels. Like YOURE underwater but the water is lava.

This time of the year is always when my flare ups get the worst/most frequent (often multiple times a day) but now within the last two weeks twice I have the weirdest thing which I have never experienced or heard of before which is a butt flare up!

I was diagnosed with erythromelalgia a number of years ago, with thankfully a mild case (mostly my feet, sometimes my hands and ears, very red, very hot, but more of an uncomfortable tingling than burning most of the time). I am now 29 and have had symptoms since I was around 19. \n\nHowever, in the past two years I have gone from having issues pretty much every day to maybe once a month at the most.

But I have no idea why or if things are going to get worse again. \n\nI have had a bunch of other health issues spring up during this time period, including an unknown form of inflammatory arthritis but did not start medication for that until a few months ago, long after the erythromelalgia symptoms suddenly decreased. I have only ever seen my PCP and rheumatologist for this and they really do not know much so do not have answers. Has anyone else been lucky enough to suddenly get somewhat better? Yes, me too! Partly it is because I do not live in an extremely cold environment anymore. I have both Raynaud\u2019s &amp; THEM, so frigid environs wreck havoc on my system and would cause frequent THEM flares in the winter, especially in my hands and feet. Weirdly, my THEM always seemed to go away in summer. \nOver the past year, both my conditions have improved (and not just from the milder climate I live in now). Someone suggested it might be serotonin ... I guess this chemical may help Raynaud\u2019s &amp; THEM. I saw someone post about this on this sub and then put two and two together ... I have been taking Prozac (serotonin booster) for about a year now. I take it for depression, but if it is also helping my weird circulation, I will take it! Also, congrats on your THEM going away! That is awesome. It can be so painful and also embarrassing. Hope your good luck continues. :) I am still living in the same house I was when diagnosed so definitely not a change of environment for me.

Hey all, I have a conundrum. I will start with a TL;DR, then go into the tale. \n\n**TL;DR: Someone says they have THEM, but has not brought it up to any of their doctors in over two years. I now believe they are saying this to avoid responsibility and activity, but I cannot confirm that without more information. I am not even sure what that information would look like because I do not experience this disorder and their symptoms are kind of in line with what I have seen so far, just not to the same level of severity.** \n\nI live with someone who, in the last two years (maybe three) has been complaining about potentially having Erythromelalgia. Up until recently, I have believed them without much pushback. I have no diagnostic ability. It is not really my place to question this sort of thing. However, I made the startling realization that, while there have been a number of doctor's visits, THEM has not been mentioned during one of them. Not a single one. This seemed odd to me, considering how much this has been impacting *my* life and I am not even the one suffering from it. \n\nWhat I *do* know is that their feet, hands, knees, arms, and sometimes one or both sides of their face will be more red than usual. They complain about \"flaring up\" and, according to them, this can be caused by anything, really. Standing too long. Going out in the sun. Exercise. Cat sitting on the lap too long. Etc. Anything that causes even a moderate increase in body temperature or pressure can cause \"flaring\". The pain they mention has always been moderate. Nothing really to be done about it. Does not reduce them to a a weeping mess or even move them from their current environment to a cooler locale. They just... stay where they were, doing what they were, while complaining to me about it. \n\nMy concern is that it feels like they do not actually have THEM and do not want to confirm it. Instead, using the possibility as an escape from responsibility to live a relatively comfortable life. I can provide pics of one of their episodes, but my goal is mostly to have a conversation about this. I plan on bringing it up to one of their doctors the next time I have a conversation with the clinic, but I want to be as prepared as possible. The triggers sound spot on for Erythromelalgia flares! Any increase in either internal or ambient temperature as small as the heater turning on or pet sitting in the lap or a food additive or spice or warm food. Also, standing for too long triggers flares because this condition has to do with the blood vessels overdilating allowing too much blood to the extremities, so with the help of gravity, standing can become very painful for us. \n\nI am not sure what you are really asking, though. Is this person you live with not actively seeking medical advice about the Erythromelalgia and that is what is frustrating you? Or maybe they have and encountered less than helpful medical specialists who blew them off and they felt defeated so have not tried again? \n\nNo matter what is going on, I encourage you to try and be as encouraging and non-judgmental as possible as you try to bring up the topic. And be clear that your motivation is from a place of care and wanting to help them vs. being tired of hearing them talk about THEM flares. \n\nWe, as people with THEM, have a wide range of severity, so even if your person does not have it as severely as some folks you might have seen online, it does not mean that they do not have it or that it is not still very  uncomfortable or anziety-inducing for them. \n\nI would say as someone who lives with progressing THEM, that most of all, I want to feel seen by my partner. This illness can be very isolating so your partner might be complaining as a way to feel seen, or they might just not have good medical support yet and are feeling frustrated and not ready for the rigamarole that can sometimes take years to find a knowledgeable and caring provider who will actually volunteer to help them manage THEM. \n\nSo if you make them feel seen and supported and do it compassionately, sharing your motivation is to make them feel seen and supported, then I do not think it is out of line to bring up the topic of seeking medical support and diagnosis again. Maybe ask them kindly, what do YOU think will help the most in terms of getting you some support? \n\nWhat is helpful for diagnosis is trying a number of different specialties (dermatology is a good place to start if there are no other chronic conditions). Some people also have luck with Rheumatologists or neurologists or vascular specialists. \n\nI can also say from experience that what helped me get a diagnosis was keeping an organized album of flaring pics on my phone to show the doctor and to keep a trigger journal to note symptoms, time of day when they are worst, what it feels like and what helps alleviate the flares. Pics and trigger journal are what got me diagnosed along with seeing someone at a university research hospital who actually knew what THEM was. It took several different visits with different specialists before I found one to diagnose, though. It is normal to self diagnose and then struggle to find someone to actually give you the diagnosis AND be willing to be the doc to try and treat it and/or help you figure out if it is the primary or secondary form of THEM. \n\nFeel free to ask additional questions, but I appreciate that you care enough to do some asking around and research on your own. Just continue to be mindful that it is a very hard condition to live with and can feel very isolating since people tend to blow us off or dismiss our concerns in terms of how our THEM affects our daily lives. And that makes us feel even more defeated or isolated. &gt;Is this person you live with not actively seeking medical advice about the Erythromelalgia and that is what is frustrating you?\n\nHonestly, I think this is the biggest part of it. I have ADHD so I suck with follow-through, but I am normally a very solutions-based person when it comes to other people. If someone comes to me with a problem, my brain goes in all kinds of directions to bring harmony back to them. So, for them to have never even mentioned this to their doctor is *immensely* frustrating. And when I asked them about this, their response was along the lines of \"I did not think about it/I was distracted with other stuff\" but that does not make sense to me. My *only* state is distracted by other stuff.\n\n&gt;We, as people with THEM, have a wide range of severity, so even if your person does not have it as severely as some folks you might have seen online, it does not mean that they do not have it or that it is not still very uncomfortable or anziety-inducing for them.\n\nYeah, this is basically what I was hoping to hear. I knew there was a spectrum involved, but I was not sure whether the rest of the symptoms lined up (or if they lined up too perfectly).\n\n&gt;What is helpful for diagnosis is trying a number of different specialties (dermatology is a good place to start if there are no other chronic conditions).\n\nSpeaking of, we actually just finished up with a derm about allergen testing. Found out they are basically allergic to our house (dust, dust mites, cats, dogs, cedar, oak, ash lmao) but I do not know how much that would lead to THEM symptoms. According to them, even without bringing up THEM at the doctor, the workflow seems to be the same, but in my mind, why hint at something like this? This is an incredibly difficult situation to navigate. \n\nI have moderate THEM that mostly affects my sleep, although I have to modify a few other things in my day- to-day life as well. For me, exercising more and moving around actually helps\u2014 in the long run... even if it does not seem like it in the moment. I do not limit what I do at all. I exercise profusely. Sometimes I have a painful flare, but I always push through it because I feel like it makes my endurance batter, not worse. I could use my THEM as an excuse, easily.\n\nBut the hard part is, some people with THEM will get worse when they \u201cpush through\u201d. Not to mention it can only be their choice. We cannot speak for anyone else, but someone with a chronic condition *can* potentially abuse that fact. Or just be in denial to themselves a bit. And saying something will only put them on the defensive. \n\nWhat you can do, though, Is push for a diagnosis in the interest of experimenting with treatment. Especially if it affects you, you have to the right to ask the person to at least become aware of the options, although the choice to try anything will be theirs. If they decide not to do anything, you are free to decide it is not right for you to live with that person\u2014 not because of their illness, but because of their unwillingness to explore treatment. And they have every right to decide that!! But it might not be the right choice for YOU. \n\nThere is a possibility that they will try many treatments and none will work. (Some people resist trying because it is so depressing to discover that this is or could be the case). Prepare yourself for that. And know that if they still resist diagnosis and treatment, there could be many reasons, including fear of this. You have to decide if you are ok with that/accepting of that. It is ok not to be, but think through the different scenarios ahead of time and decide what you think is the right thing to do. Allergies very well could be contributing to exacerbation of THEM symptoms. And so THEM never came up in these visits with a derm? Because it is easy to have them prescribe a trial of antihistamine/allergy meds to see if this helps with severity or frequency of THEM flares. This is worth looking into for sure. \n\nI do not have significant allergies and antihistamine trial was still one of the first lines of treatment that my Rheumatologist had me try to rule it out if it helps or not. Unfortunately, in my case, it did not help the THEM. Mine is caused by a combo of Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and undefined connective tissue disease (either lupus or RA or scleroderma...waiting for a diagnosis that may never come but I show symptoms and bloodwork that connective tissue issues are at play).\n\n I also have Raynauds, the cousin of THEM which is vasoconstriction to the extremeties and having trouble regulating cold to the point it makes my hands and fingers white or purple and painful from the cold. People can have both THEM and Raynauds since both are caused by abonormalities in how your neurovascular system responds to constriction of blood vessels. &gt;I do not limit what I do at all.\n\nThanks for providing this context. While I only grabbed this little part of the paragraph, this part is especially useful to me, because prior to this, most of the other cases I have seen (or heard about second-hand) have been pretty severe and debilitating. Hearing from someone with a more moderate case is heartening. \n\n&gt;But the hard part is, some people with THEM will get worse when they \u201cpush through\u201d. Not to mention it can only be their choice. We cannot speak for anyone else, but someone with a chronic condition *can* potentially abuse that fact.\n\nI have a small bit of experience with this as a child. I was an observer at the time, but I know what it can look like, so this situation is pretty stressful for me. I do not want to say \"I am at the end of my rope\" because I have got plenty of patience, but we are also not getting younger. \n\n&gt;What you can do, though, Is push for a diagnosis in the interest of experimenting with treatment.\n\nRight, yeah. I think this is what I intend to do. She is mentioned (to me and family and friends) THEM and Raynaud's, so she knows the names and symptoms of these things. I just do not understand why her medical caregivers are not also aware that she knows these things lol. initially, after making this post, I was thinking about giving her doctor a call to schedule an appt and just pick their brain on THEM and whether or not they feel like they have any bells in their heads about this case (HIPAA should not be an issue here).   \n\nRelevant info: I do not generally sit on their appointments because I work and it is hard getting the time off, so I just wheel them there and back. &gt;And so THEM never came up in these visits with a derm? ... This is worth looking into for sure.\n\nYup! They had their appt two weeks ago and we have been basically BIG TIME cleaning the apartment and buying things like air purifiers and things. Going To get a AC to manage humidity/temp pretty soon. Because of my impatience and frustration, we had a blow up last week and I, in error, asked why we have not gotten a diagnosis yet. They explained that they have not ever brought up THEM by name and that \"there is no test for\" THEM, which is correct, from what I can find. Like, there are tests *around* it, but not for it. It is like looking for a black hole, basically. Like I said, this is an incredibly difficult position to be in. Any suggestions you make could be taken defensively. Personally I would be upset if someone told me that I should try to keep up and be active despite my condition, even though that is what I already do! But I would be much more open to someone wanting to learn more about the condition with me, so maybe keep that in mind as a way in. But, again, this is a tough one\u2014 everyone is different. Maybe ultimately talking to a relationship counselor would be helpful too. I have secondary THEM and it is not always obvious to people. I have to stand still for 2 minutes before my legs turn red and purple. It is possible to fake it, but I doubt it. It is probably just a more subtle case of THEM which is what I have. It is still annoying not being able to wait on line and having to put legs up every 20 minutes of walking. The itchiness, redness and heat come on more after prolonged standing or gravity from putting feet down while sitting. I have been to about 10 different doctors who do not know what THEM is. Most doctors are dismissive and there is not a cure anyway. I plan on going to a specialist, but generally doctors are useless in diagnosing and treating such an unusual disorder. I am going to say it, coming here and asking for tattle advice when the person says they have it AND they get red areas?\n\nCome on son.\n\nThis disease is so painful, SCIENTIFICALLY suffers are at a higher rate of suicide. It is painful, it is isolating and underlying conditions often cannot be diagnosed, if ever, 2-3 years after onset.\n\nJust say what the real problem is and do not use the person\u2019s medical issues to try and catch them in a lie. Thanks for this information. Is the itching consistent for you or is a per-instance sort of situation? Itching's never come up for them, so I was not sure if that is a universal symptom or case-by-case, situational thing. I am fine with you assuming there is another issue, but regardless of what other \"problems\" may or may not exist, they do not have any bearing on THEM, which is why I am here and not in r/badroommates or r/relationships. My concern is that they have simply resigned themselves to suffering from this disorder without even getting an opinion outside of their own. \n\nHave you ever heard of Factitious Disorder? You may know it by a different name: Munchausen Syndrome. People fake disorders enough that there is a name for it. My concern is that this physical health issue may actually be a *mental* health issue. If this is a result of stress, we can address it. Depression? We can address it. Anxiety? *We can address it.*\n\nIf we get a diagnosis that it is THEM, that would be great because we would at least know what to expect and how to approach it for the long term. Not even *mentioning* it as a possibility to the doctor *while physically with the doctor* seems like a flawed approach and counter-productive. Especially when you are able to throw the name around and recite the symptoms. \n\nI mean, there are two specialists listed on the ( finder within 30 miles of us, yet we have not even attempted to get a referral to them yet. So yes, I am coming here to find out if this is something that *can* be done. Because when someone is actions do not seem to make sense to me, I try to find out why. Sorry that upsets you.

I am sorry for your daughter. \n\nYou say \"people like you\" but you do not actually know anything about me, do you?

I have been with this person longer than your child has been alive and I have watched them go from one strange sickness to another without any explanation. Thousands of dollars have been spent on medical expenses ***before*** THEM even became a topic. Before the first flareup ever occurred. \n\nYou do not know a fuckin thing about me so do not act as if you have some clairvoyant glimpse into my mind. \n\nYou and I are done here. I know you are trying to get ammo against someone instead of talking to them and/or believing them. I know your argument is not strong enough so you want insight on how to catch an THEM sufferer in a lie.  A lie about how painful it is? A lie about what it is? You will take all the lies you can get.\n\nYou said who you are in three sentences. You are not that deep. If I do not put my legs up on time, they get very itchy. Mine is an all day thing. I know some people just have random flares from what I understand.  I flare anytime I am standing and walking  too long. If I do not sit in time, it moves to hands, then face and ears. Itch comes before pain. My blood likes to accumulate in joints first (ankles, knees) then spreads, and then my joints will hurt too. I sleep with legs propped up about a foot and a half or higher depending on how I feel. I have to have hands above chest level when I sleep and if I am on my side more than a few minutes blood will pool in hands, so I can only really sleep on my back. If I am off balance on my back by even an inch I can feel neuropathy and pooling really bad, it is like electric shocks in my hands. Man, I had no idea it could be so bad. Thank you for sharing. The literature I have read describes pain, but never in so much color. Thank you and I am sorry you have to experience, let alone live with something like that. You are welcome. I am glad to have this forum. The more people post, the more clarity we can all have. ", "POSSIBLE THEM??  Happens about once a month in the exact same spot. Only on left foot. \n\nAlways happens between 7:30-9 at night, when I am at rest. Sudden onset, I notice it burning and then get up. Usually goes away within about 5 minutes. \r  \nOdd.  Usually THEM is more widespread so if that is what it is I would expect to see more redness throughout the foot. \n\nBut THEM quite commonly flares as the patient lays down at the end of the day.  The change in posture and other changes tied to the circadian rhythm tend to cause blood vessels to dilate and that can set things off.\n\nNext time it happens consider running cool tap water over the red area to see if the redness and pain both go away in a matter of seconds. If so, something vascular such as THEM *might* be involved.  (Unfortunately, if it is THEM, the redness and pain will return as the foot rewarms.) See, every time it has happened, it has been fixed just by getting up and moving around. Completely gone in under 5 minutes every time! \n\nThis makes me think it is not THEM. Try compression socks? Localized heat uticaria maybe It looks like some sort of rash or skin irritation-  Actually secondary atypical erythromelalgia looks like this. I know you mean well it is just I like educating people on it. The difference is the \u201cedges\u201d. There is specific edges. Sorry, I have primary It is perfectly ok! You did not know. Just like I do not know much about primary THEM because I do not have it. Question about it, OP said that it stops when they get up and move, for me, and from what I heard, that usually makes it ten times worse, and usually THEM does not happen the same time once a month, unless they do something that triggers it once a month It is instant relief. Pain immediately starts to die down over a period of about 5 minutes. After those 5 minutes, I cannot tell it even happened\u2026. That is a good point. It depends on the situation. If they are laying down with a warm blanket over them then that might be the reason why (sometimes that happens). With the top part of the foot atleast. If it is the bottom part of your foot exercise normally feels like shards of glass or knives. I wonder if they are doing a sport once a month.", "THEM?

The redness and heat is constantly severe They look like red patches that are permanent. They look very similar to chilblains if you google it", "Bad night\u2026  I flare in my knees really bad, too. It sucks so much because it is hard to elevate knees like you can elevate feet. I know what you mean. I was put on beta blockers recently, was hoping that would help, but no such luck I have not ever been put on beta blockers. I was put on calcium channel blockers, however, and it made my life even more of a firey hellscape for the few weeks I tried it.

Good luck and watch some jerry springer or something that is usually my go to for long nights. I found that just pointing a fan at my torso had a better effect on flares in my feet than pointing a fan directly at my feet.  Go figure. Ugh I am sorry you are going thru this right now! \ud83d\udc95Are you taking anything for it? Like gabapentin (it does NOT it help me) but some people say it helps. Personally when I get knee flair ups I sometimes find even sitting on a chair and putting my feet on another chair or something so they are at least level if not slightly elevated sometimes really helps my flair ups or even just laying on the couch with my legs up or a pillow under my knees \ud83d\ude0a I hear that.

Ha", "Crying from the burn :( I am kind of freaking out because of this hand pain I am having. I suspect that I might have Erythromelalgia, though I just found out about it. Nothing too unusual going on, I did have 3-4 cocktails with a friend last night (I rarely drink more than one) and was a bit hungover today. I also have taken my Adderall 10mg prescription a couple of days this week, not today though. This just came out of nowhere tonight.\n\nMy hand is splotchy pink and burning, radiating heat. When I touch the pinky finger side of my palm, it is tender with a deep aching pain. The appearance is pretty mild compared to bright red google images, but still noticeable. I have had bright red, itching/hot feet after showers, and sometimes hot ears, for awhile now. But I never thought too much about it because it hurt much less than this.\n\nI have been diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis, PCOS, gluten sensitivity (I have been cheating a bit :/) and eczema. I have bad circulation and heat/cold intolerance, my hands and feet are usually ice cold. But then I overheat easily in the summer/when the heat is blasting.\n\nI am really overwhelmed and prone to anxiety, I do not know what to do about this. Any advice would be very reassuring. I am sure people ask all the time so sorry if this is redundant &lt;3 I know too well the difficulties of navigating doctors etc, so this seems like a nightmare right now Do you have a primary care doctor?  THEM is usually diagnosed by neurologists. So your first step is to make an appointment with your primary care doctor and show/describe your symptoms to them. If the color changes are visible, you should take pictures to show your doctors. You can mention your suspicion of THEM, but even if it is not, request to be referred to a neurologist for further investigation because your symptoms are clearly very distressing for you.   \n(Assuming USA and that you need referrals for specialists)  \n\n\nIn the meantime, I would avoid any stimulants (of course you should continue any prescriptions, but I would not take any other stimulants) and also any alcohol and anything else that widens/relaxes blood vessels. THEM is thought to arise from a dysfunction of the constriction/relaxation of blood vessels. Blood vessels constrict causing cold hands and feet, then they relax suddenly, sending a rush of blood into the extremity. Anything that makes your blood pump faster or sends more blood to the surface of your skin is going to make symptoms worse. So it is not surprising that you feel pretty terrible after a night of drinking. You can use cool compresses on your hands and feet for short periods if you need some immediate relief.   \n\n\nTake a deep breath. Your symptoms can improve. The first step is getting in touch with your doctor and letting them know about your symptoms. Yes go to a Doctor. Two things we use that are over the counter are lidocaine cream and Voltaren cream that we keep in the REFRIGERATOR not, the freezer.\n\nThe doctors told us NOT TO USE FROZEN COLD THINGS.  Cool things are okay. It is not good for the vessels to go from one extreme to another.\n\nMy daughter has many of other medical issues (like the list you gave) and she is also on prescription meds for this.  \n\nTake pictures now when it occurs. Doctors believe pics more than people.\n\nBe well and safe and hang in there! Thank you so much for the reassurance, really helped me to chill out. I do need a referral so I will talk to my PCP about this after the holidays. \n\nI am going to try avoiding alcohol / stimulants until then, difficult with Xmas and New Years but seems important... and gluten, in case there is some inflammation going on w/ me right now. \n\nThis morning I also thought of another possibility: I started metformin for PCOS not too long ago, and this Rx can cause B12 deficiency (symptoms such as neuropathy, itchiness etc.) So probably wise to supplement B12, it could be that simple. happy holidays \ud83e\udd0d Thanks for the advice &amp; cold warning! I took some pics for the doctor.\n\nLidocaine sounds good. I usually use tiger balm for topical pain relief, but it kind of made the burning worse... need something cooling lol. Xx \ud83e\udd0d Of course, you are more than welcome!  \nOh, it would be great if it were a B12 deficiency due to metformin because that would be an easy fix.  If it is just not the holidays to you without a couple drinks, then I would not say you need to completely abstain.  This year has been tough enough for many as it is.  It is okay to have a treat.  But I would cut down, especially if you notice that symptoms are worse following alcohol.\n\nHappy Holidays to you too! Some people claim that Adderall was causing erythromelalgia, and stopping that medicine stopped the flair ups.\n\nErythromelalgia began with myself after I took Cialis, and had a cold with a fever. Not sure what caused it, but It began suddenly 1 day after taking Cialis about a year ago, and has been constant 24/7. I would stop the Adderall and see what happens.", "I think I may have this\u2026  For some context, the other month I went through some EXTREME stress and my feet turned bright red and burned like all hell. I just thought this is extremely weird but must be from stress. Since then my skin all\nOver has felt a lot more sensitive. Like my clothes and things scratch or feel like it is burning. And I am getting rashes like pictures where I feel the heat radiating and I pull my pants leg up and see this. I sometimes get it on my feet/ankles/shins also. It seems like heat triggers it as well. I have always been red and blotchy getting out of the shower or sun but it was never painful until now. Definitely sounds like my THEM, especially with the itching+burning. You will find relief! Talk to a neurologist or pain management specialist with experience treating THEM (this can take months). They will suggest treatment.  Good luck! The photos *might* be THEM.  Some red blotches when getting out of the shower are not so unusual. Your body needs to get rid of excess heat so blood vessels in the skin dilate and the skin turns red.\n\nYour description sounds a lot more like THEM.  Triggered by heat. Burning in feet. Redness in feet. Yeah the blotchy patches after the sun or shower have happened my whole life.

You should show them to a doctor.\n\nMany, perhaps most?, doctors are not familiar with THEM or have not treated a patient with THEM. THEM is just that rare.\n\nThe Erythromelalgia Association maintains a ( of doctors familiar with the condition. IMHO it is advisable to seek evaluation from a doctor familiar with the condition. Too many patients bounce from doctor to doctor for years before diagnosis. Thank you! Yeah the first time my feet did it/this started happening was the other month. I was soooo extremely stressed. And I did not sleep for 36 hours. My feet turned bright red and burned and I just said hm must be anxiety.. ever since that I have had weird burning issues / sensations and the rashes. I saw on the link some doctors near me so I will take more pics and seek them out. Thank you", "Wow i cannot believe i found my people. I do not even have anything to add but I am just excited to know this is a real condition. Finally I have a valid reason to argue with my roommate at why I need the AC set at 67 degrees all the time.

I am grateful because in my case I do not really feel any explicit pain, mostly just heat and pressure from the amount of blood in my extremities, cool air and cool water usually calm it down after a few minutes. Hopefully as I age i do not start to experience actual pain when it flares up, but for now I am doing just fine and it is only a minor inconvenience. My hands, feet, knees, and cheeks do get alarmingly red though, but still, no pain as of yet and I feel i have had these symptoms for over ten years haha whatever it takes Yeah apparently it is pretty evenly divided between people whose symptoms stay the same, people whose symptoms get worse, and those who get better!

I am glad you have things that work &lt;3 Thanks a lot i appreciate, hopefully it is going well for you too Aw thank you! It is not going super great, but thankfully I have more mobility aids now and that is helped a lot!! maybe this is pots? pots causes blood pooling in feet that cause warmth and swelling and has quite similar triggers as THEM but THEM is excruciatingly painful and is associated with neuropathy. i developed it after pots- with pots my feet wouldnt be painful just hot red and swollen and now due to THEM it affects my hands (specifically fingers, it tends to localize in some more than others and same goes for toes/feet) and knees very badly with pain and are extremely hot to touch- very red. THEM isnt quite blood pooling, its a sodium channelopathy that stops your arteries from contracting to my knowledge, but its not the same as pots where the blood pooling is a circulatory thing I will look into that I did not know about it. Thanks for the info. From what ive read about THEM online i have textbook symptoms minus the pain. If Pots is the same without pain then that is most likely what it is. Thank you! I did not get pain with THEM until after like... 5 or more years? Do not mean to confuse you further \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude05 Sometimes it is not clear until/if symptoms get worse.

Hi everyone, \n\nI am so happy to have found and joined this community! I am 24 and recently got diagnosed with erythomelagia. I do not know when it started exactly because I have sensitive skin so when a flare up would happen it was rare and I always assumed it was some weird reaction or skin sensitivity. It started happening much more frequently a couple of years ago but it was almost strictly in the winter. Each winter it seemed to happen more often. This winter was the absolute worst I was having at least one flare up almost every day and unlike most of the time previously, some of these were painful. I still have been lucky and rarely have super painful ones, instead, they feel uncomfortably hot and sort of like they are burning but without a lot of actual pain.  I went to a dermatologist and after showing her photos, explaining it, and getting a bunch of blood tests to rule out other things, she has diagnosed me with it. With winter coming to an end, I still get flare ups (a little less than in the winter but still  every couple days at least) and so at this point I am going to assume that this may continue impacting me throughout the year. \n\nPrimarily I get flare ups in my hands but I do get them on my feet as well. I get it on my face once and a while and more recently, I have begun to get them on my knees too (once I got my first knee flare up it quickly started happening more often) which leads to my first question, **I have not read too much about it happening on knees, does this happen to anyone else? What about face?**\n\nAfter spending so much time trying to figure out what could be happening to me reading about erythomelagia was such an \"aha\" moment. Once I started doing more research I read a couple things saying that when a flare up is not happening, skin may be blue-ish purple which is something I have had since at least middle school. This especially happens when I am cold. I showed a picture of my knees when they were very purple to my dermatologist and she said she did not know what was going on there haha so my second question is, **Does your skin get purple/blue sometimes when you do not have a flare up and does this look like that?** \n\nMy third question is one out of fear and anxiety. I know erythomelagia often gets more frequent and more painful with time. I am scared because clearly mine is happening more often but it still is not awfully painful (I should probably note I have a bad habit of undermining pain unless it is really severe so this is not to say it does not ever hurt at all but I consider it more very uncomfortable than painful). **Have your flare ups become more painful over time?** Also, I very rarely have gotten this thing where I will get a stripe on my arm that gets red and feels exactly like a typical flare up but it is just this weird line, when I get these it BURNS like it truly feels like that part of my arm was burnt on a hot pan or something it. It feels identical to a really painful burn. I assume it must be part of erythomelagia but I have never read anything like this about it happening in a line, I will attach a picture and would love if you could give me your thoughts on this. **Has anyone heard of or experienced this?**\n\nAttaching photos of my typical hand flare ups, my knee flare up, my blue/purple skin, and the painful burning red line: (\n\nThank you all so much &lt;3 Hi there! I am so sorry you are going through this, THEM is so very painful and hard for many doctors to understand. I have THEM due to SFN (small fiber Neuropathy) Dysautonomia and I also have MCAS. Mine is located on my face, ears and feet but I know plenty of people who have it on their knees as well. The red stripe sounds like an allergic reaction to me but you would need to experiment with antihistamines to see what happens. The blueish purple sounds like Raynaud\u2019s syndrome to me, I have that as well and it commonly goes with THEM as one is a major vasodilation and the other is major vasoconstriction. \n\nBased on my experience this is what I would suggest, try taking aspirin or baby aspirin to see if that helps flares, document the results. Same with anti histamines. I went to several clueless dermatologist, allergist, rheumatologist.... all who were unhelpful and passed the buck until I saw an amazing neurologist who specializes in the neuromuscular issues. They understand THEM. You will need a full lab panel, possibly MCAS testing and maybe a SFN skin biopsy (do not be afraid it is not painful or scary) depending on what is causing your THEM, it can be treated but they need to rule out some things first by checking your platelet counts. \n\nKeep photos and document what is happening for the neurologist. Hang in there, I know this is very difficult and painful- my heart goes out to you and if you have any questions I am here to help share more of what worked for me and what I did.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add there are two really amazing Facebook groups for THEM with TONS of information and supportive folks so that might be of help too! Thank you so much for your reply. So my dermatologist did diagnose me and ran some tests but I believe she may not have been thorough enough or as helpful as I need, would you recommend I try to neurologist too? I believe I have primary erythromelalgia as far as I know and some blood work was done to rule out other stuff but that was just one day of blood work so I do not know if that is sufficient enough. My dermatologist recommended aspirin but said I should not be taking aspirin every day so to only take when I have a flare up which is not overly helpful since by the time it kicks in I do not even know if it helped or if the flare up just went down on its own. She also gave me cream it is Tiamol with 0.25% menthol and 0.25% Camphor but I have not found that to help at all either. She said to come back in 3 months if no improvement and I have not had any improvement but I want to make sure when I go back in I can either have an idea of what to say or if I should try to find another specialist instead. Thank you again for your response I really appreciate it I am glad to hear she was at least somewhat knowledgeable about THEM! I would definitely say to check with a neurologist who does neuromuscular, they can run further tests and blood work too. Have you found the aspirin to be helping a little? Sometimes I get a little relief from aspirin but it varies. I know in many cases they can also try things like Lyrica to help with pain, even something like gabapentin. There are definitely options no matter what so do not lose heart. I was in absolute misery at one point and now I am 75% better so it is possible even when you are at rock bottom! I wish you the very best and absolutely keep us updated. Please may you share what is worked for you? I am at the beginning of this journey too and I am petrified ! Absolutely! So once we figured out it was THEM and SFN then I started taking neuropathy supplements and that was a life saver. \n\nI am on Alpha Lipsoic Acid, Magensium Liquid (blue bonnet brand) zinc, biotin, quecertin and delayed activation vitamin C. This combination has been the best thing so far that I have found. Baby aspirin is also something I incorporate during a flare. I avoid triggers which is really challenging but helps. If you could keep a diary of food and anything you take or drink to help figure out triggers too that might help! I also have these little neck fans from online that I rely on when I have to be around warm weather, rechargeable and last 7 hours. Ice packs when you need to but not direct on the skin. \n\nSome people have tried topical compounds from the doctor that have helped them too. \n\nMany people have found relief with using a combination of things but definitely finding the root cause is what will get you there faster. It can be overwhelming but you are doing great and you are going to get better. Thank you, you have no idea how much I needed to hear those words. I know my triggers are stress and heat and the evening ? But that is unavoidable! I am currently under going lots of tests to make sure it definitely is THEM but I am just so worried that it will never get better ! Thank you for sharing what has helped you!! I know it is rough, hang in there! The comment about the evening makes me think you might have an MCAS combination as well, usually that is worse in the evening time and you can even have heat allergy that is part of MCAS. I have those same triggers in addition to foods and lotions etc. If you have any labs done I would ask about MCAS testing including Tryptase. In the mean time you can also start Quecertin and see if that helps too, it is a supplement so you can get it via Amazon or a health food store. It will definitely get better once you get the right things in your system, stay strong my dear! I am rooting for you! Sending well wishes! Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart !! Did you start trying these things out by yourself !? I am going to try alpha lipoic acid soon and I have just started aspirin as per what a consultant has said but is it worth trying the other things my self ? Of course! I am so glad to be of help. I would start with the ALA and give it a few weeks to see how you feel, if you are still having flaring after that then I would add in the Quecertin and see how it goes. They are both fairly inexpensive supplements and I really think you will find some relief. The ALA I tried because of the neurologist suggesting it as his top recommendation for people with THEM and the Quecertin I started trying after researching what people take with MCAS and I talked to some fellow MCAS people and got their opinion too. :-)", "Cooling Moisturiser for Facial Flares For anyone who, like me, suffers with facial flares as well as hands and feet - I have recently tried a new moisturiser that I recommend.

It is Avene Tolerance Emulsion. \n\nI hope this helps someone! Thank you for the recommendation!", "Cannabis and the Nav1.7 channel THC and CBD work directly on the Nav1.7 sodium channels in your nerves.  The gene mutation that causes Primary THEM is on the genes for the Nav1.7 sodium channel.  THC and CBD both reduce the sensitivity of the channel.  Effectively, this implicates that cannabis is a useful treatment for THEM pain.    \n\n\nHowever, the potency of the effect is diminished in higher temps. So Cannabis works well for milder temperatures, but it will not work if the temperature is just too high.  This reflects my personal experience, where it seems like the cannabis and antihistamines combined raise the threshold before the THEM goes crazy.  \n\n\n(\n\n( When you say temperature are you referring to the temperature at which you burn the cannabis? No, ambient temperature of the environment.  For me, without any meds, I will flare up pretty bad at about 68f. Sometimes less.  With cannabis, the temperature for ignition goes up to like, 75-80.  \n\nWith cannabis, my flares are significantly less painful. I will burn. I will feel like crap.  But the pain is just... absent.\n\nWithout cannabis, I am in constant pain, regardless of whether I am flaring.  It might not be burning, and I might otherwise feel fine. But constant pain, especially in my feet.\n\nIf it is a hot day, like above 80, than the cannabis does not seem to reduce the pain like it does when its cooler, but still hurting.\n\nDoes that make more sense?  It is complicated and difficult to express clearly. All that said, I should mention:: I dont puff down a joint or bowl or whatever all at once.  That can set off my facial flares via the heat of the smoke.  \n\nInstead, I use a glass bowl to keep the smoke temp down, and I take breaks between hits and only smoke a couple hits at a time.  \n\nCannabis works best as a maintenance medication, so you kind of have to take frequent tiny smoke breaks throughout the day.

If the nerves are misfiring it maybe could feel like tendon pain. Not sure but there is nerve testing to see if the nerve conduction is okay.  If it is not - I could see where sensitive nerves could pick up a different feeing. How long ago was the trauma to your leg? The one with the scar? Sorry for late reply. I have had the scar on my leg since I was a baby about 1 year old. Does not change anything with the pain but the rash seems to be more br9ken up compared to the leg sit no scar. I do get the fiery pain I my skin when the rash flares up like this. It is painful for water or clothing to be brushed lightly on it for a few days after but no pain on other skin. I was just wondering because my scar tissue from various surgeries changes over the years.  Nerve testing would not be a bad idea just to see if the signals are firing/traveling correctly.", "Is this erythromelalgia  I am not a doctor, and did not even stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night, but that does not look like THEM to me.\n\nTHEM tends to be much more widespread and look more like a sunburn in its milder forms.  I have not experienced any bleeding with mine either. This looks more like dry chapped skin. I have this happen in the winter and especially now with hand sanitizer use.\n\nWhen I have a THEM flare, my hands get bright red and hot all over; like they have been submerged in hot water.  \n\n( Thanks a lot guys for the quick and helpful answers I will check with my doctor because it is not healing which is weird Good luck figuring it out! I have weird things that do not heal on my legs and feet, so I know how frustrating that can feel. I agree with the other posters. This does not look like erythromelalgia at all.

Derm vs Neuro My dermatologist thought my facial flushing/burning was Erythromelalgia and wanted me to see a neurologist. I saw the neurologist and he said it cannot be Erythromelalgia because the symptoms are only on my face.\nAnyone know if Erythromelalgia can cause facial symptoms?\n\nI am not looking to be diagnosed here, I will be following up with my doctor next week. Just curious because the two professional I saw had very different opinions. Thanks! Personal experience here;\nI truly believe I have THEM and have had reddening of my face for quite sometime-primarily of the nose and cheeks. Ears occasionally, too. I am now in a \u201cfull THEM flare mode\u201d where I have it on my hands (started 1st, less than a year ago), and now my feet are beginning to be affected as of a few months ago.\nI have also had chronic urticaria (hives) for years-controlled by cetirizine (antihistamine). In my personal opinion... I feel like I have a connective tissue disease and/or mast cell disease in which may correlate with how my body controls histamine levels, it likely creates nerve damage, and how our bodies may control body temperature.\n\nThis article might be helpful for you:\n I have just been diagnosed with THEM (as in like 3 hours ago haha) due to presentations in my feet and hands, but I also find that my face flushes very easily and stays red and blotchy for hours at a time and my nose is constantly bright red. what kind of doctor did you get your diagnosis from? a dermatologist? just wondering where I need to start, thank you! Dermatologist but I got a referral from my regular doctor for a dermatologist who had experience with THEM. gotcha, thank you!", "I ate a hot dog. I knew results would not be good. It was delicious at least.   Thank you for sharing this!  I get annoyed sometimes when no one gets that this is what happens when we eat.  Happy your food was delicious! Nothing like the postprandial response.\n\nBlood vessels dilate in the stomach and intestines. Those vessels are under control of the same sorts of small nerve fibers implicated in THEM.  A hot time in the old town tonight ensues. Have you found that certain foods trigger it? I have not. Seems like every and any meal I eat triggers mine\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f lol Oh man, terrible headache and joint pain hours later too. I paid dearly for it. I have not been tested yet for SFN, but I have EDS and studies say up to 50% of us will also have SFN. I have just been tired chasing doctors lately. Yeah all eating triggers it a teeny bit, but certain foods definitely make it flare up violently: gluten and cured/processed meats being some of the worst offenders. It took awhile to figure out (still figuring it out too!) ... But yes, definitely. My worst offenders: gluten/wheat, cured/processed meats (bacon, hot dog, ham, etc), tomatoes, strawberries. I have not been formally diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome yet, but I nowadays I try to avoid most foods that MCAS folks also avoid, and it helps out quite a bit. Mast cells are nasty if they become inappropriately hyper-reactive in your body. They are known to unleash histamine, plus many other chemicals, plus send marching orders to our nervous system to do things like dilate blood vessels, increase heart rate, etc. I am pretty sure my Erythromelalgia is caused by, or severely worsened by, MCAS. It is just a bitch to get formally diagnosed as it does not always show up on traditional allergy testing. Welcome to the alphabet soup club.\n\nTHEM, SFN, T2D, HBP, NCS for me. \n\nFor what it is worth when I got the SFN diagnosis the neurologist just said some of my sympathetic nerves are \"screwed up\". No treatment more than the gabapentin I was already taking for THEM and other pain. \n\nPlenty of others around here with EDS, POTS, MS, RA, and/or SLE. THEM seems to come along with so many different conditions. Glad you know your worst offenders.  I kept a very detailed list of which foods/meals triggered flares to see trends.  Carbs are the worst for me but it is about balance and knowing a delicious meal will result in burning red hands is something I accept. Haha yeah in addition to processed meats, gluten and most grains are no-nos for me (carb heavy) ... But sometimes you just want to feel human and enjoy life's food pleasures! I am new to the whole THEM thing. I think I have a combo of both them/reynauds and am still trying to figure what, why, and when it happens. It is so random. I try and see if certain foods trigger it or what. So I am curious to know why hot dogs effect you? Is it something in the hot dog or \nmeats in general. Appreciate any input!  Well I am fairly sure I have some sort of mast cell activation issue going on, or histamine intolerance ... Cured and processed meats always trigger me, and they are on the MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome)  list of foods to avoid. MCAS can cause different neuro and vascular issues, as the mast cells are known as first linemen in immune system and send marching orders to various body systems to react. Such as, \"danger! Danger! Dilate small blood vessels and pump more blood!\"  I also cannot eat gluten or most grains. Tons of brain fog, joint pain, and THEM flares. I also have Raynauds too.", "I think I got erythromelagia from taking antibiotics. After stopping, it is beginning get better. Has anyone heard of this? I was taking doxycycline and minocycline for months (9+) and having terrible heat flare ups all over my face and ears. It was getting brutal. I had to quit two different jobs. At the same time, when the so called \u201crash\u201d started, I was putting hydrocortisone on my face to prevent the breakouts and this went on for a few months. I tried oral steroids and a steroid shot. Nothing was helping. However, I have since moved home and stopped all medications. It is been roughly a month and a half. I tried an antibiotic pill (bactrim) a few weeks ago and had a terrible flare. I think I can link the antibiotics and hydrocortisone to the them. As I progress further, I still have redness and some swelling in my face but the heat has gone down tremendously. I do not flare like I was and even at night, my ears get red but do not burn as bad. I think as I progress further, the condition may go away if I continue to go months with no medications. Has anyone heard of something like this happening? \n\nLastly, I do not get the pain and heat anywhere except my face/hands and had no previous health conditions prior. This could be a side effect or bad reaction to antibiotics? I am not sure if you can get THEM from antibiotics from what I have heard (it is usually genetic, neurological, etc) but who knows I guess that is possible. If it was them, I think I can compare some of my flares with the worst of the worst. It was truly horrible. Either way, I am hopping a couple months off everything and this will fade away. I have been going back and forth on them and topical steroid withdrawal. I was putting them on my face for months (many many times a day). Yeah, I would definitely recommend looking into side effects of any of the drugs you were taking/using at the time of the flares. My flares are caused by exercise and heat (ex. Being by the oven or stove sometimes) so keep track of how your face and ears feel (any pain, redness) in these situations. Of course everyone is different but elevated body temperature usually causes THEM flares. Yes, heat causes my flare. Just hot temperature in any situation (outdoor, indoor, etc.) but lately it is getting better. I have been taking hot showers and not having horrible heat flares. I do not put my face directly under hot water but I can do the back of my head and somewhat of my ears. I used to only be able to take cold showers\u2026 and really I used to not be able to even walk across the room without flaring. It will probably take a few more months to know for sure but I wanted to see if this had happened to anyone. Huh that is actually really interesting. Give it some more time and see what other people in this subreddit think. Were you taking doxy the whole time?  Sun sensitivity is a known ( Yes", "Adopted and suffering with symptoms.. My feet, hands, jaw and neck burn, itch and hurt all the time. Sometimes my hands and feet go extremely cold and I am constantly in physical pain. Idk if this falls under erythromelalgia or not but I spot after sex as well..\n\nI am adopted and do not know my actual medical history... I have done one of those DNA testing site and found out some things but no one has mentioned this despite it showing up in my test.\n\nI have an appointment with my family doctor on Wednesday and I still have anxiety because I cannot find much information that is not full of medical jargen and I do not know what is next... When I talk to her.. She will take me seriously (she always has) and we have been trying to find out what is up for months.. What is she going to do? How do I treat or manage this? I am anxious of the unknown.\n\nThanks in advance! The unknown can indeed be scary, but unfortunately there is often a lot of unknowns when it comes to diagnosing and treating something as rare as THEM.  I am not sure how the Canadian healthcare system works, but your family doctor will likely run some tests bloodwork.  Both to see if your symptoms could be something other than THEM and also to see if some other condition could be causing your THEM.  \n\n\nTHEM is often idiopathic, that is, the underlying cause is unknown, but sometimes it can develop secondary to some other blood, genetic, or autoimmune disorder.  Your family doctor may also then refer you to a neurologist and/or a geneticist for further evaluation/testing.   Doctors often prescribe drugs targeted to nerve pain to help manage the pain, such as gabapentin. Personally, I also use medical cannabis for the pain.  \n\n\nI know it can feel overwhelming to navigate this new possible diagnosis. I have had THEM for 13 years. At first it was mild, but it is been severe for the past 8 years. Feel free to chat/DM me if you have any questions. I have been dealing with this long enough that by now I can understand all the medical jargon. See my problem is I have had these symptoms  and legit I am textbook THEM and have been forever. I am adopted.. So all the doctors in the past have shrugged it off to be being dramatic or anxious... And now it is legit affecting my life. My doctor has ordered so many tests for blood, urine and stool as well as ultrasounds and stuff and everything keeps coming back negative...\n\nThe DNA testing I did online said this is a possibility.. And currently talking to my aunt to see if she knows about any NPD in the family (legit just met my bio family like just before Christmas so it is been amazing!) and hopefully will get something done..\n\nAnd because of the constant \"tests are fine so you are fine\" response through my entire life I have just rationalized my symptoms to something else... Well all those something else's have been dealt with.\n\nI have been on gabapentin before for borderline personality disorder as well as other neurological meds (BPD is an emotional disorder not chemical imbalance and cannot use typical meds to help it) and it fucks my depression and anti depressants up.. And I finally got those sorted after 8 years... So not doing that...\n\nThe worst part is my hands are not too bad right now.. I would say they are not \"bothering me\" because the itch and burn this morning is pretty mild (it is humid and wet here today). And like.. Why is that my definition of not being bothered by my body? That is not normal!\n\nI am frustrated and stuck and want to chop off some limbs... I am having so many issues and I am worried that I have had this forever but because I am adopted and was not taken seriously I have got other issues in my life (I am showing signs of ovarian cancer as well but they could also be the rarer NPD symptoms). I am so overwhelmed with pain and heat and discomfort... I want answers...\n\nHow do you manage? I smoke pot so I am definitely going to be grabbing some CBD oils and creams. But otherwise... When you say cannot because you are at work or whatever.. What do you do?\n\nSorry for the novel and thank you for taking the time to talk to me. I cannot work. I am 100% disabled by my THEM.  My THEM got dramatically worse when I was in the middle of grad school and I had to drop out. This is where I am at... I am going back to work for the first time since February.. Because we have not known what is wrong I have been scared to be out in public too much due to COVID.. Did not want to make things worse especially with so many unknowns... But I have to go back now because I am not diagnosed so I am not disabled and I cannot afford bills anymore and need to go back.. I am so sore and exhausted... Idk what else to do.. Can you see a neurologist?  Because they are the ones who could diagnose THEM or something similar. I am not doubting that your symptoms completely fit THEM, but there are other conditions that present with very similar symptoms. Or could you file for disability due to having BPD? \n\nMy story is a bit more complicated than that because I have had a different disability (cerebral palsy) my whole life.  But by itself, my CP did not disable me at all. I still lived and worked like everyone else and was independent. Then THEM hit, but even before we were certain of what was wrong with me, I qualified for disability through having CP, not THEM. Unfortunately my BPD is not deemed \"dysfunctional\" enough to have that option. And apparently the primary erythromelalgia do run in the family (I have an older bio cousin who got diagnosed as a kid) and I have looked on the national institute of health's website on primary erythromelalgia and from the day I was born to now I have hit every single symptom and always been told I am being dramatic. The only one they took seriously was uncontrollable and severe IBS as a child; and that is only because you could see it. No one took that I had severe cramping with no ability to relieve it. As well as severe (facial) flushing.. My parents were always asking why I was red.. \n\nI know there are possibly other issues involved but I have had blood work and testing done for all the basic and even semi uncommon problems. My body has been scanned and nothing comes up.. It is brutal.. I am thankful my doctor takes me seriously but it is been a hard road and years of testing and retesting for legit everything.\n\nMy face, neck, hands and feet get so hot it can melt lotion within 10 seconds and it hurts and they are red and splotchy and swollen. My sleep sucks, chronic pain and discomfort, fatigue, and have a non existent tolerance to pain meds.\n\nThere is so much more that is involved with PE because it is from childhood VS SE which is adulthood and I cannot find anything else on PE because majority of THEM is SE and is developed as an adult... And the NIH site is the only reliable site I can find with all the information on it and I tick every box. For everything else I have ever looked into there has always been something extra on my end (usually the burning) or something not right about the diagnosis. So I have seen a rheumatologist and they said no to fibromyalgia because the hands make it not fall in, I do not have endometriosis after seeing an OBGYN. I have seen a GI specialist and they are stumped as well as a colonoscopy doctor and he says everything is normal...\n\nI am stuck and this is why I am thinking it is this. This is not just something I googled and was like eureka I have got it! Lol It is something that is in the bio family and I fall into completely.. My cousin shares the exact same symptoms from childhood as me..\n\nI am just so not sure of what is going to happen next? Like.. What testing do they do when they do it? Genetic testing is such a generic test name.. It sounds like you already have evidence that you have the genetic type of THEM.  From taking the DNA test and talking to your bio family?  So I take that to mean that you have mutations in your SCN9A, SCN10A, or SCN11A genes?  If that is the case, THEM treatment is simply symptom management.  If you cannot tolerate gabapentin or pain meds, doctors would try to find a medication/treatment you could tolerate to reduce your symptoms. There is nothing else that can be done for the primary genetic type.   A geneticist would probably run another test to confirm what you found in your DNA test and maybe you could get disability based on that?\n\nI feel like you have a question that I am not answering.  Is there something else you want to know? That is probably how I am going to have to do it because in Canada the 23 and me stuff is not viable because even they say it is not a diagnosis.. It is a point into a direction for a doctor to diagnose.\n\nAnd honestly... There probably is I just do not know what it is I want to ask or find out.. Just never had to really face physical issues like this before (always just thought maybe they are right and I am just being dramatic) and now that I am older and more sure of myself.. I know I am not. And I am just lost because I am 30 and I wanted to start my life after 30 years of suffering from mental health.. And now this. It is just like... Come on life.. Lol If you think something is wrong, you are probably right. Do not listen to doctors who try to dismiss you.  Keep pushing and advocating for yourself. Keep asking questions until someone answers you in language you can understand.\n\nI know it can be annoying to be dealing with physical problems and it is tempting to push it aside so you do not have to deal with it. But remember that mental and physical health are intimately linked. If you feel terribly itchy, hot, and in pain much of the time and you cannot sleep and you are miserable, that is going to have a detrimental effect on your mental health for sure.  If you can get to the bottom of this, and get some treatment, even if it is only symptom management, you may find your mental health is easier to manage too. Good luck, I am rooting for you.\n\nAnd yes, 23 &amp; Me can be informative and fun and a good place to start, but their results are never diagnostic. Best wishes for your appt with your family doctor, and I hope you can see a neurologist and a geneticist soon. Thank you so much for all your validation, support and compassion. I am only 30 and still learning to fight this fight and I am done feeling how I am feeling so I am pushing so hard. It is just exhausting yah know?\n\nAgain, thank you \ud83d\ude0a You are welcome.

I have noticed that during a lot of my flares, my heart is beating harder (not faster, just harder) and I feel lightheaded. My doctor said that is nothing to be concerned about, but that does not sit right with me. \n\nDoes anyone else experience this? What should I do? Two questions; first, does it feel like you are panicking? not that I am saying it is in your head or anything, just that when I flare sometimes it makes me anxious. second, do you notice your blood pooling in your lower legs or anything? I get low blood pressure &amp; when it happens during a flare I notice the heart beat more &amp; I feel dizzy and foggy. If that happens I eat a teaspoon of salt &amp; an electrolyte drink I am sure that the anxiety plays a role because mine is definitely really bad, but I have noticed a few times recently where I notice the harder heart beats before I even realize I am flaring, which leads me to think something else could be at play. \n\nI also do not think I have ever felt blood pooling in my lower legs. I just feel my heart beating extra hard (I can FEEL it in my ears sometimes) while I am flaring and burning up. Not exactly the same but my heart does beat super fast when I am just lying down in bed while I am elevating my legs. Not anxious but regularly through the day my heart rate is usually pretty high Have you ever been tested for POTS or a doctor mention POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome)? I have POTS and it works hand in hand with my Erythromelalgia. Bingo!  **Exactly** what came to my mind.  POTS is commonly associated with THEM and can cause these sorts of things.\n\nIf you start to feel this happening lay down. Really. That is all.  The heartbeat thing will resolve in a few minutes.  \n\nBut if you try to fight it too long and stay upright it can lead to you passing out and you can get hurt in the falling. Chipped teeth, broken ribs, bruises, lacerations and al sorts of unpleasantness can result. POTS also wipes me out physically. Imagine having a cardio/exercise-fast heartbeat everytime you are simply standing up or walking or moving around your house. I tell friends and family that the reason I am so exhausted is my heart and blood vessels are literally working overtime (all the time) unless I am at rest in lying position or in a reclining/legs up position. What seems like nothing to them, perhaps washing the dishes or something, is like jogging four laps on a track. \ud83d\ude1c Fatigue is also a BIG problem for me. Thank you very much for the suggestion, I will be making an appointment with a cardiologist this week. I do. When the flares are really bad I get lightheaded and feel faint. At that point I also become extremely sensitive and grossed out by random things. Ok has your appetite changed??

She was wonderful,  and I am happy to finally have some clarity. \n\nI have lived with symptoms for a long time and have had the luck of being one of those people who doctors cannot figure out what is wrong. \n\nFor the past year, I have been trying to figure out why my platelets have always been elevated, despite no active infection.  I have seen a hematologist and rheumatologist as well.\n\nDoes anyone have this in conjunction with THEM? I have a small high plantlet count.

Aspirin is known to be effective in some cases of people who have THEM and high platelets (did not work for me). It is normally a lot of aspirin. Basically if it does not work it makes no effect and if it does it normally helps a good bit with the THEM. If you have any questions let me know. Thanks for sharing with me. I did the whole battery of tests with a hematologist, and can thankfully rule out cancer. I have never had so much blood drawn in a single time!\n\nThe doctor placed me on an aspirin regimen and I see them in a few months. Also did one of those vascular studies to get a baseline of my blood flow. She also mentioned using Voltaren gel (have not done that yet). \n\nI have been dealing with it for a while (and also have dermatographia as an added bonus \ud83d\ude15) and get pretty frustrated.

Thanks \ud83d\ude0a", "What are the differences between THEM and rosacea?  First, I am not a medical professional. I am just a guy with THEM.\n\nRosacea primarily affects the face, mostly the cheeks and nose, and commonly results in small pus filled bumps which are often mistaken for acne. There are multiple small visible blood vessels which may include burst blood vessels. Many patients experience puffiness in their eyes and well as dry eye. Rosacea may produced a stinging pain. Over time rosacea can cause a thickening of the skin resulting in an enlargement of the nose.\n\nTHEM primarily affects the feet and hands. In some patients the face, mostly the cheeks and nose, are affected. The ears and legs may be affected. Skin bumps are not a symptom of THEM. In THEM there is a more generalized dilation of blood vessels giving the affected areas a more sunburnt appearance rather than individually visible blood vessels. THEM does not produce eye symptoms like rosacea. THEM causes pain which is often described as a severe burning sensation. THEM does not cause skin thickening or nose enlargement.\n\nTHEM symptoms are typically relieved by cooling and/or elevating the affected areas. Rosacea does not respond similarly.  THEM symptoms may be eased by a cool wind or by using a fan to blow air across the affected areas. Rosacea may worsen by by exposure to the wind and blowing air. The cause of rosacea is unknown. In about 15% of THEM patients the condition is hereditary, caused by a recognized mutation in the SCN9A gene and THEM is recognized as a condition that is secondary to certain other myeloproliferative disorders. Thank you for explaining this to me. I suspect I have one of them but I am unsure which. I get the horrible burning sensation in my hands and face at times but rarely in my feet, it does happen sometimes though. My hands do not burn near as much as my face but they feel swollen, and sometimes it switches between my hands being lobster red to very pale at the finger tips. A lot of my flare ups are in the evening and I cannot pinpoint it down to anything like types of food, the only thing is I start overheating really quickly in average temp and I know it is all over \ud83d\ude02 my skin sometimes goes blotchy too, and I do have a bit of texture on my face but I only use a basic cleanser and moisturizer. Does your THEM give you overall sensitive skin? I am seeing a derm in a few weeks so hopefully I will be able to figure out which one I am experiencing. It is all so stressful which I know does not help flare ups for either of them Sounds like THEM and Raynaud's. Sometimes these two conditions occur together. The key is your fingers sometimes going very pale (that is the Raynaud's). Be absolutely certain to mention that to your doctor.\n\nSome THEM patients do not have much, if any, symptoms in the feet. Most do.\n\nTHEM commonly flares more in the evening, can make things feel swollen in addition to painful, and overheating is a common complaint.\n\nIf you are experiencing the redness and pain in your face rinse your face with cool (NEVER ice cold) water and see if symptoms quickly subside. This may be easier to do by talking a quick cool shower. Room temperature to slightly cooler water is sufficient to ease symptoms in THEM patients.\n\nI have a second condition, small fiber neuropathy, which is a common comorbidity in THEM patients.  SFN reduces my ability to sense touch in the affected areas so my skin is not sensitive in that way.  Other THEM patients may have a different experience.", "Alcohol Does anyone ever experience flare ups after drinking alcohol particularly beer?\n\nI have read about cutting out wheat in my diet to help. And I figured the two are related", "Test Test", "Does this sound like erythromelalgia? Seems like every day when I get home my hands will turn red like blood is pooling in them and get a bit vascular.. It only happens when they are low, especially down by my sides. My skin past few days has been prickly too when it happens, and sometimes when it is bad muscles feel sore. Couple days ago it happened a lot and my muscles were really sore after, but at the same time I had been overdoing it scrubbing dishes the day before, and it continued the next day (got better with rest but still kind of there when it flares up). Been happening for like a week.\n\nMy doctor said I had high blood pressure which does not seem related. Lotion kind of seems to help with the prickliness. Our office is cold, and usually gets pretty cold by the time I leave, then I heat up in my car, and our house feels warm by the time I walk in. When I wash my hands or are in a colder part of the house it seems better, if I take a shower it does not help. I also have the \"hot ear\" too that seems triggered by going from a cold to warm room.\n\nNothing else seems relevant and the only real change lately is I am taking in a lot less sodium (for blood pressure), drinking less, and almost completely cut out caffeine. Strangely it seems to correlate with me working on my blood pressure, which is actually going down (bout 130-140/80-95 now, down 10pts each side vs a couple weeks ago).\n\nThis is driving me crazy because it is interfering with stuff like making dinner when I get home. Maybe, except that THEM should not affect how your muscles feel at all.  Have you been seen by a neurologist, especially one that knows about THEM and can rule it in/out? Muscles might not be relevant or just feels like whatever is causing the red is causing some muscle fatigue but life i said i have been messing my arms up lately overworking them, can also be anxiety but i never had red hands with anxiety. It definity got better when they got cold and getting worse as they get warm. Everything i see about red hands when down by your side points to pretty benign stuff but still confusing Yeah, I still think getting seen by a neurologist and maybe a cardiologist is a good idea, if you can.", "My doctor thinks I have Raynaud\u2019s because I get bluish discoloration in my hands and feet, but my symptoms seem to more closely match erythromelalgia in a lot of ways.

He thinks I have primary Reynaud\u2019s, as I have had this issue with discoloration for probably close to 20 years now at least (so most of my life), without any symptoms that would point it being secondary. Your title describes what happened to me so this is going to be one long comment with my best advice. I am going to ask something very particular and it is very important. Does cold make it better or worse? Does heat make it better or worse? THEM in most cases = worse or triggered by heat. Raynauds Worse or triggered by cold. If heat is effecting it negatively and cold IS NOT then you need a new doctor NOW. Pain management, dermatology, neurology, etc. Do not go to Cleveland pain clinic they are a bunch of dicks, there is a doctor at duke but they are locked in another country, and idek about Mayo as their THEM clinic denied me and switched me to diagnostic. As far as medicine goes they will probably start on oral Gabapentin, if that makes you too tired make them switch you over to topical. I had decent results with Voltaren and gaba compound. After that I would recommend either a 1% ketamine compound or a 5% depending on pain. THEM is different for everyone but for some it progressed rapidly and started spreading vertically. Please be prepared. Raynoud's is a disorder where blood vessels constrict abnormally and force out blood from the extremity. The skin turns pale white when desanguinated and the patient experiences cold and often pain, particularly upon rewarming.\n\nErythromelalgia is a disorder where blood vessels dilate abnormally and allow blood to engorge the extremity. The skin turns red when swollen with blood and the patient experiences heat and pain. \n\nYour situation *might* be THEM.

I would love to see some more activity in this group. I know that there are other support groups for THEM out there, but how about we make this an exclusively proactive group? I would love to hear people's stories, their original symptoms, how they were diagnosed, who they went to see and most importantly what they found to be effective (and not effective). I think it would be great for people to share WHERE are the best places to seek treatment, WHO are the specialists they recommend and again most importantly WHAT they found effective.

Now that there are finally tests in store for me, while making notes for these tests, I realized the erythromelalgia has improved on my blood pressure meds.

Patients with Fabry Disease often have male relatives with the same condition. \n\nNot all THEM is genetic, but when it is the genetic form it affects the sexes equally.\n\nIf, by chance, you have male relatives with similar symptoms but no female relatives who are affected then consultation with a genetic counselor might be warranted.

I thought I had temperature and that it would subside.\n\nThe initial few days were quite bad and the palms and sole felt like they were burning . Touching any other part of the skin with my palms felt hot. \n\nThere was also marked red colour in the above mentioned areas which was not present before.\n\nNow I have visited numerous neurologists and all my tests are fine. Not a single test has indicated any abnormality. \n\nThe only change that is happened is that the feeling of warmth has come down by almost 25-30%.\n\nHowever ,the discoloration is still persistent and so is the increased temperature.\n\nDo you think it could be a case of secondary THEM?\nAnd has anyone here ever been successful in treating it?", "Pretty confident I have THEM ", "Cash Loans Now | $100 to $1,000 Apply Now ", "Does this look like Erythromelalgia?

It will help speed things up and explain things properly because sometimes our words are not medically accurate but a picture will explain that best. Any updates OP? How are you going currently?", "Does anyone else's THEM flare up respond like this? You can see my feet flare and then watch me quickly resolve it  I am not sure I have erythromelagia but I sure have all the symptoms.  This is the morning after drinking 3 shots.  Drinking makes it flare up everytime and go bright red and feel swollen and warm.  Then the next morning is usually like this.  I am not sure if this is the flare-up though or the after effect.  By this point my feet are actually cold so I think this is the overcompensation to the flare-up.\n\nJust wondered if anyone else's color changes could be resolved by a bit of movement. I can only resolve mine quickly by elevating them and sometimes also require using evaporative cooling methods (spray bottle with water and ceiling fans blowing on them to evaporate the water off).\n\nI have never been able to stop a flare from scrunching/moving my toes. My feet go all sorts of different colors because I also have Raynaud's, so my feet are either in an THEM flare or super cold and white or blue/purple (raynaud's) all the time...no exceptions. I have such a hard time with circulation in my legs, feet, and hands. When you stay still when standing or sitting, it is easier for blood to pool. Then with little movement it gets better. However if your walking too much then they can become red again, that is how mine is  Yes exactly. In this video I was sitting and then I can just flex my toes a bit to clear up the discoloration and stop the swelling before it starts.\n\nBut standing I have to walk around a bit to help it out. Walking more than a mile though will likely cause a flare up for me.\n\nI am new to this. Just started having symptoms a couple months ago. I live in Arizona and it was a rough summer. Before I had ever heard of THEM I had quit going outside to BBQ, started sleeping with two fans on me, and taking cool showers everyday. And I do a lot of laying on the couch with my feet up.\n\nHopefully the cooler weather helps. I guess I should not say resolve. This just delays the symptoms which just as quickly come back.\n\nSo far the only time I have stopped a flare up was when I was at a friend's and sat with my legs in his pool. Which everyone else thought was too cold to bother with. I sat there for two hours and even drank a couple beers without the flare up continuing. Best night of the summer \ud83d\ude42 Sorry to hear about that hopefully you can find the cause of your situation. I have had mine since I was a kid (I am 22 now) and it is been getting worse as of this year however I found the cause to mine which is small fiber neuropathy. \n\nIf you do not mind me I could suggest a few things you can do. Try removing gluten from your diet for 2 months to see if you feel a difference and if you do, then you maybe gluten sensitive which is different from celiac disease. Also it could be coming from your spine specifically lower spine possibly a pinched nerve or slightly pinched nerve, a misalignment per day. Try doing a cobra pose every day to see if there is a difference 10 times every morning.  One last thing you can do, watch this video.\n\n\n\nSo the concept is you expose your feet to hot water and soak every night , sounds counterproductive, but it may help.\n\nHope you find relief I will try those. In that order. Heating them in hot water scares me so I will leave that until last.\n\nAlthough I have noticed that sometimes by 3am or so my body will have cooked down sufficiently that I will actually warm feet under the covers. And I do think when I wake up they feel pretty good. So maybe there is something to that hot water idea Yes! Interesting that you mentioned sciatica. Just in the last few days the intermittent tingling I had only noticed in my foot had moved up to about my knee and I started getting a dull ache from below my butt down to my calf.  I had been thinking sciatica might be the culprit.\n\nAnyway I rode my bike a couple miles today and then did some stretching and the cobra poses.  Basically all the tingling and pain has gone away - for now. But I have notice this happen before with some exercise.  What is more notable is I was flaring up before the bike ride. It is gone now.  That sciatica point and cobra poses seems to have helped. Thanks Yeah make sure to do the cobra pose every so often and watch for you posture too, ear aligned with shoulder!

When I hit puberty I started developing symptoms for a tethered spinal cord, and around the same time was when erythromelalgia hit me. I had it in my hands and feet and it would burn real bad if I were exercising or in a hot room. Anyway eventually when we figured out I had a tethered cord I got the untethering surgery, and not long after that my erythromelalgia went away almost completely. I asked my neurologist about it after the surgery but he did not really know much about THEM. So I guess I was just wondering if any of you guys had any spine/neurological issues? Just seemed so weird how it vanished after the surgery (but then again I was nearing the end of puberty and I know hormones can affect THEM, so I do not really know) YES!! I have Ankyolizing spondylitis and Degenerative disk disease. This is interesting... I have scoliosis. My Dad had a spinal cord injury years ago and has burning feet now too \ud83e\udd14 I have the HLA antigen for Ankylosing Spondylitis, they did a full set of x rays about 3 years ago and despite hip pain- found no fusion at that time. Shortly after that I started developing THEM, I had no idea this could be connected. Thanks for the post. My kid has severe THEM which started 8 months ago and is getting worse by the day.  It is moving up her leg and now has muscle involvement with convulsing muscles.  She did have back problems when she was younger and I am going to get this checked out.\n\nHow did they diagnose you? Like what type of Dr? Was it through an MRI that the final diagnosis came?\n\nThanks!! Well I had bladder problems once I hit puberty, and at the urologist we eventually did an x-ray that they thought showed something strange with my spine. They said it could be a tethered cord syndrome, which would explain the bladder issues and the big fuzzy spot on my back (usually babies get it when they have TCS, rarely adults so that was weird). I went to get an MRI, but it actually did not show anything- but when we went to the neurologist after he said a lot of adult TCS cases do not show anything on the MRI. We ended up doing surgery without really knowing if it was tethered or not, but thankfully it was tethered so the surgery was a success! I am just glad we did not give up because many doctors told me I was just making up the bladder issues and that since the MRI was normal I was fine.\n\nI wish you and your kid the best of luck getting this thing figured out. Growing up with THEM and other issues was really rough for me, so I feel his/hers pain. I have always wondered if this TCS and THEM could be connected so I am glad this maybe opens up a path for you guys!! Thank you so much. I am glad it got better for you after being so bad.

", "Burning pain no redness I have had burning pain in my feet in the evenings for the past 7 years. No redness or swelling though. I find very temporary relief with pressure (squeezing my feet) and cold water. Does this sound like THEM? No, because one of the hallmarks of THEM is redness.  The Erythro- part of THEM comes from the Greek word *\u03b5\u03c1\u03c5\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2,* which means \"red, ruddy, vermillion.\"  The rest of the name comes from the Greek roots for limb/extremity (mel) and pain (algia) respectively.   \n\n\nHowever, it might be possible that THEM is in the very beginning stages and that redness will develop later.  I know that redness was not apparent in the beginning for me either. Hard to say exactly when visible changes started happening in my case. Sounds to me like peripheral neuropathy\u2014nerve pain in the extremities. I have this as well,\nAnd squeezing my feet or hands or arms can help this. Unless you are having swelling along with it, which can be quite a few other things. Is there numbness and tingling? Or aching pain? Mostly just the burning pain at night, sometimes there can be slight numbness Yeah that sounds like neuropathy for sure! If you have medical care, it might be worth discussing with your primary doctor\u2014or ask for a referral to a neurologist, if  this seems right to you. I say IF you have medical care, as I know many do not, and I did not until fairly recently(so I did not want to assume. I cringe when I hear people say \u201ctalk to your doc!\u201d When that assumes they have access). But when pain is described as burning, quite often it is nerve related. May I ask what is the cause of your neuropathy? I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, a collagen/connective tissue disorder which(since we have connective tissue just about everywhere) includes dysautonomia, which also creates all sorts of problems with the autonomic nervous system , which regulates so much! This creates a lovely environment just right for the nerves to not cooperate as well, causing numbness and tingling, deep aching pain and complete sensory loss in some areas. My erythromelalgia (I believe) is just another symptom of EDS and my dysautonomia\u2014at least for me. I also have a cardiac pacemaker for bradycardia and abnormal rhythms that can cause passing out or near passing out frequently. One thing I should mention too is my dysautonomia causes me hypoglycemia, and just like with diabetics, blood sugar issues can cause peripheral neuropathy(which is very common in diabetes).

I am adopted and have had a lifetime of struggle.. At 30 I finally have the diagnosis and am excited! All thanks to this group so thank you so much for giving me the info I needed to be properly tested!  There is a sigh of relief that comes with diagnosis, is not there? If I may ask, who diagnosed you? Did it take seeing multiple providers and specialists? I think my word of advice is to be open to trying other specialties if the neurologist is not helpful. In my personal experience, I have had the worst support from neurologist and also those I saw did not know much about THEM.\n\nYour experience could be totally different. It really depends on their bedside manner and their training. \n\nSo after living with this for over four years (diagnosed three years ago), my biggest pieces of advice are:\n\n1) keep shopping around for care providers until you find one who is knowledgeable about THEM and compassionate to help you on the long road of trying different treatment options. Do not stay with a Dr or certain specialty just because you were referred there. Go elsewhere (rheumatologists generally have good knowledge of THEM but can take forever to get into, some dermatologists also do, so do not settle)!\n\n2) do not get discouraged when the first, second or third med does not help relieve flares. Everyone is body is different and reacts differently to different drugs. I, for one, did not find any relief until my fourth and sixth drugs in the progression of trying different things. What I take now helps me manage the pain of flares much better than I used to. \n\n3) there is no cure for this condition. Very few ever find full remission. I am not saying that it is impossible to go into remission. I am just saying that the vast majority of us never do. It is helpful to manage our own expectations going in...knowing the primary goal is to help reduce symptom progression and severity to the point that improves our quality of life. \n\n4) Try to partner with your doctor to learn as much as you can about the underlying cause of THEM. Some THEM patients never really know, but if you can at least pinpoint a general idea (primary vs. secondary THEM, autoimmune vs. myoproliferative disease, neurovascular only like a POTs or Raynaud's co-condition) \n\nThis greatly influences how your doctor and you manage the symptoms and how you go about choosing the right form of treatment. If we manage the underlying causes and triggers as best as possible, it really helps with THEM!\n\nAgain... disclaimer that not everyone has luck with trigger reduction or finding out the direct cause of their THEM. And in that situation, you just have to slowly work your way through the different treatment options until you find one that helps. I had my immunologist do it through testing to diagnose primary them and currently has me on a waitlist for a neurologist who actually does have some experience and knowledge. \n\n\n And thanks for the advice but I just came here to brag and continue on cloud 9 because well.. I have been searching for this answer for over 20 years and at 30 years finally got my diagnosis. I am adopted so it is been a long road with no family history. But thanks anyways.\n\nEdit: I also made another ( elsewhere that has more details. Wow....that is an incredibly looooong time to wait for a diagnosis. I am so sorry for that! I am also happy to learn that your immunologist and neurologist are familiar with THEM. That is half the battle right there! \n\nGood luck with your way forward. Let us know how it is all going! Thank you. And sorry if I seem a bit bitter... It is exciting to have a diagnosis and then deflating having reality hit.. I did not respond well and I am sorry... I do appreciate your kind words and when I am ready to take it, I will have more appreciation for your advice than I do now.\n\nThank you for your kindness! Stay safe out there... It is pretty crazy!\n\nEdit: And my immunologist actually suggested it and then ran the tests because about 10 years ago she had a patient that was diagnosed and worked with this neurologist. It is so nice to have doctors that know what this is... I was able to discover it through doing my own genetic testing and getting it confirmed through them. I finally had enough and put money into 23 and Me and got me pointed onto genetic issues that I have. Being adopted made finding weird genetic things hard! Please do not feel bad! I did not take your response as bitter. And it is my bad that I misread your first post and thought you might not yet have a care team in place, hence the care-team/treatment advice. I should not have offered unsolicited advice when you were probably needing to just feel seen and heard by others with THEM. So sorry!\n\nI had such a hard time with no supports whatsoever when I was finally diagnosed, so I guess I am hyper helpful in hopes that no one has to go through what I did. \n\nI finally found a really helpful rheumatologist, but beyond that, I have zero folks in my life who truly get it. And she is so booked I only get to see her 2-3 times a year for 30 minutes at a time. \n\nI wanted to tell you that no matter what we feel is okay. Bitter, angry, frustrated, hopeful, relieved, scared, tired, etc. THEM takes us all on a roller coaster of emotions, so just continue to be extra gentle with yourself! I will try to do the same! \ud83e\udd17 Thank you for being amazing! You are such a good soul and I appreciate you stumbling across my post!\n\nAnd I feel that.. I try to explain it to people and they literally stare at me like \"oh my hands get warm!\" like... Yah no... Not the same..\n\nI got told by my bf's friend that I should just think positive and it will go away... Took everything in me to not slap him. The entire room just stared at him like you are dumb lol Oh man, I have been there! In fact tonight my partner did the whole \"well my knees and feet get itchy when they are hot, too.\" I ended up confronting them as kindly as I could about how that makes me feel dismissed and that what people need the most in life is a witness, someone to bear witness in an unconditional and compassionate way. \n\nI like this quote from Parker Palmer, \n\n\"The human soul does not want to be advised, or  fixed, or saved. It simply wants to be witnessed -- to be seen, heard and companioned exactly as it is.\"\n\nThat is why I should have not jumped to \"advice mode\" with you earlier and simply helped you bear witness to the complex feelings that surround a diagnosis 20-30 years in the making. \n\nHit me up if you ever need someone to chat with about it! And hang in there! You are too kind! I am genuinely moved by your compassion! It is been a day today and you have really turned it around on me! It is been emotional... Getting the diagnosis and then having to continue with my day like I do not have it.. So thank you! I get emotional easily so I appreciate you turning my day around! A it makes me have an emotional turnaround moment, too, knowing that I made someone is day suck a tiny bit less. It does sound like it was a doozy of an emotional day. I appreciate you being vulnerable with us on here...it makes it more likely we will open up in the future, too! \n\nI like to believe that in vulnerability, there is great strength. It takes a lot of courage to sit with our raw feelings. Most folks just try to stuff or ignore all emotion. So thanks for being a good example to us all!", "I wanted to share what a THEM flare-up looks like \u2014 to help others who come here wondering if they have erythromelagia.  I am currently seeing a dermatologist who has seen and treated THEM. Right now, I still do not know if it is secondary or primary. I also have raynauds, which can be seen in THEM patients.\n\nEDIT: not everyone is flares may look like this, but I have pretty extreme redness I would like to add to your post that some people's flare-ups are not nearly quite as bad on the visual symptoms side! Whilst this is a very good example, I would not want anyone to think they did not have it just because it is not severe as this (coming from someone who also has THEM diagnosed but who has not nearly as bad redness). I agree, I did not mean for it to seem like everyone is should look just like this. Thank you for adding your experience and symptoms to this thread:) Damn, I do not have it that bad on my hands, but that is basically what my feet look- My feet are flaring right now :( but my hands are not. I hate this so much! I only get it on my hands once in awhile, it feels like needles that are on fire poking my fingers, my feet just burn Do you know what triggers it? It usually happens in the evenings with no triggers, just the time of day for some reason. \n\nTriggers that I do know will cause a flare: alcohol, being in a hot room, being active, and oddly enough vaccuming/mopping during my weekend chores. I do not like spicy foods, but I have heard that can also cause a flare. Do you have an autoimmune disease? I have THEM too. It gets as bad as yours, on my feet, ears, nose.. it sucks!! Im so sorry you are going thru one right now! It literally just made me emotional just looking at this pic. \ud83d\ude1e my redness is on your level (might look a little more intense because i so pale) and i also have Raynauds. my hands are just as white as my underarm skin right now, but they will be going back and forth later this evening. \n\ni saw a rheumatologist earlier this year, and they did not have much to do for it (the pain is manageable for me, or i am used to it i guess; electric sunburn hands, baybeeeee). i should be hearing back from my genetics testing panel later this month.\n\ni have you and a few others tagged from this subreddit who have all described very similar symptoms to mine. there are dozens of us!\n\nedit: one question for you because i have seen this a lot in others with symptoms like ours: do you have dermatographia or pressure-sensitive hives? i have that, but it is much less noticeable for me, and antihistamines really seem to help quiet that for me. Yep, evenings are the worst. Does not matter what I do. Hi there, sorry for the delayed response! They have tested me for lupus and autoimmune markers, but as of now those test have come back normal. However, at my last follow-up with my dermatologist, he mentioned that it looks like I could have of scleroderma (CREST syndrome) in the future; which might explain why I also have Raynauds.\n\nI also get flares in other areas as well\u2026Feet (usually the left one), Knees/Upper Thigh (usually the right one), Ears, Nose/mouth area.  \n\nThank you so much for caring, it is nice to not feel alone with this:) I too have Raynauds, maybe that makes our flares even more intense?! Quite honestly, the raynauds is more painful than then THEM, but the THEM is way more uncomfortable, like I am over heating and as you mentioned\u2026an electric sunburn. It triggers a \u2018flight\u2019 response in me, like I want to run away from it. My dermatologist prescribed me gabapentin but I had to stop after feeling like a zombie and sleeping through my alarms on a work day. \n\nRegarding the hives, I do not have that symptom, but I will note this if I do in the future. Of course!! No one is ever going to understand you at least they are going thru the same thing! \nFunny, before I got diagnosed with Lupus, they told me it was CREST syndrome! Then they did more test and it was Lupus. I hope they can find what you have soon! Have you ever try aspirin for THEM? I tried it before , but I have to take it whenever I am feeling the flare coming for it to work. Other that.. full blown. Nothing else helps, not gabapentin nor lyrica. Oh wow, it sounds like our THEM journey is very similar! If you do not mind me asking, did you ever test negative for lupus (ANA test) before later testing positive for it? I have heard you can have pre-signs for lupus where the tests do not show you have it and later it develops into clear lupus diagnosis. What test(s) helped to diagnose your lupus? Hi it is okay. Honestly I do not remember at all. It was so long ago. But I do know that as long as I remember, it has always been positive. I am going to look thru all my bloodwork  and see if I can find a negative ANA. Also, I cannot remember any test. As per the doctors my signs, symptoms and bloodwork have been very strong for Lupus. Im going to send you a screenshot of my last blood work and you will see. A doctor like 5 years ago, sent me to get a test called AVISE-SLE and with that test she said I had the worse case of lupus she has ever seen, so I am guessing that test could be a good one to ask about if you are looking for a diagnosis. Oh wow, I am so sorry to hear that! It must have been scary -or- a relief to hear that you have one of the *worst cases of lupus* a dr has seen.", "Medication So I am quite new to being diagnosed with THEM but I have seen that aspirin helps to calm it down. I have not found anything that helps relieve it but does aspirin work for anyone? If so, how many mg do you take? Thanks in advance! It helps for some.  I happened to be taking one 325mg  aspirin tablet twice a day at the time of my THEM diagnosis. Did not help me. What it did do is make it more difficult for my blood to clot and I ended up with a serious bleed from a minor cut as a result.\n\nUnfortunately THEM patients often have to go through a series of trial and error to find something that helps.  It is maddening.\n\nA good doctor will work with you. Aspirin, Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, Mexiletine, Lidocaine creams, and who knows what else are all frequent treatment options.\n\nI got lucky and Mexiletine works wonders for me. For others it may do nothing. Have you ever taken allergy pills? I take Reactine for seasonal allergies and figured out it helps a lot with my THEM. Antihistamines work as vascular constrictors &amp; they stop your veins from dilating as easily. That works for me, but some people react better to magnesium as it does the opposite to the veins. It is a lot of trial &amp; error right now", "Small fiber neuropathy and Erythromelalgia? Has anyone been diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy and also have Erythromelalgia? Erythromelalgia has been associated with neuropathy, due to the neurological vascular discomfort itching, burning, swelling. I am hoping to get a skin biopsy done to see if I have small fiber neuropathy but I will get pushback from my doctors because they are all knowing and I am not(sarcasm) and I believe everyone else should get tested too. Yes, I have SFN. I was officially diagnosed after a QSART test. I had a skin biopsy too, but that only showed \"sparse inflammation\" and nothing else definitive. I have both plus Reynauds, Sjorgrens, pots and more. Interesting, what are they doing to treat it? I think I may have Reynauds too, and I have been tested for pots but they saw something slightly below normal. Question: how do they test you for Sjorgrens? There are so many tests for sjogrens. There is an eye test, saliva test, biopsy, blood work and just symptoms. \n\nI did a biopsy 2 years in a row and this year it came back positive. They say it can even take up to 10 years for the tests to come back positive after the first symptoms.\n\n\nI do not really test positively on most standard tests they give for any of the issues I have been diagnosed. I am usually abnormal but just slightly but have all the symptoms moderately to severe. To Treat all of my diagnosis? \n\nI am on so many medications including topical creams/ointments. \n\nI guess the day to day stuff is Gabapentin 900mg 3x daily ( provider says that this is the therapeutic dose anything less will not be effective for my disorders). \nMetoprolol 50mg - Maintenance of blood pressure levels not to go too high for Syncope from autonomic disorder associated with THEM, Reynauds, Sjogrens, SFN etc.\nMidodrine 2.5 mg -Maintenance of blood pressure levels not to go too high for Syncope from autonomic disorder associated with THEM, Reynauds, Sjogrens, SFN etc. Same as as metoprolol but this does increase my blood pressure so I do not bottom out when I go to stand up.\n\nVenlafaxine 37.5 mg- used for nerve pain and also gives me a little energy to combat my chronic pain fatigue. ( I sort of feel very wired on this which is makes me physically tired yet jittery..very odd feeling. My doctor keeps saying she will change me over to the extended release version instead of taking one immediate release in the morning and another in the afternoon whichkeeps me awake until midnight or later. She promises the E.R. version eliminates this problem as it wears off in 12 hours which would be about 8 pm for me.\n\nOxycodone 5 mg - For any severe pain not relieved by the other medications. I also have some joint degeneration that causes pain besides all the nerve pain. This really does help but I feel I could be increased at this point since this dose for me has not changed for almost a decade now. \n\nLidocaine IV infusion -  infusion given every 3 weeks for me but typically every 4 weeks.- This treatment is the most effective treatment/medication I have been given.\nIt cuts my nerve pain by half for 2 weeks and wears off from there until my next appointment. It cuts my flares from THEM/ Reynauds in half as I was in a constant flare prior to these treatments. During the infusion my pain level is a 0. I have experienced no adverse reactions with this therapy. I have been told that this treatment is good for nerve pain, THEM/Reynauds pain, migraines and even some muscle relaxation. \n\nCevelimine - dry mouth - very effective but can cause my body to sweat excessively some times, especially at night. \n\nLidocaine/prilocain topical cream- helps numb the skin and helps with the burning or freezing pain.\n\nClonazepam- Helps with nerve pain and helps with panic associated with severe pain attacks. My doctor will not prescribe it for me anymore unless I do not fill my script for pain medication. It was really effective though. \n\nHydroxazine pomoate 50 mg- antihistamine that helps me with itchy skin associated with my reynauds/THEM/SFN. Very effective\n\nMethylphenidate 10mg- Given for chronic fatigue associated with my chronic pain and my fibromyalgia diagnosis'. I only take this when I absolutely need it and have to be awake all day. This works better for me than adderall but that is just preference. Provigil works the best however my insurance will not cover for chronic fatigue but I have heard some insurance companies will.\n\nI have other meds and some work for these but overall these I use daily and help the most.", "Need a solution Red hot fingers  and palms itching pulsatile especially when i lower my hands holding a heavy object.

Anyone had anything similar?", "Finally a neurologist that wants to help! This developed after Covid infection march 2020. ", "Random rashes whole life I have had these kinds of rashes my entire life with no known cause and no consistent trigger. Repeatedly brushed off as hives until i recently saw a dermatologist after being diagnosed with THEM from rheum but rheum was especially concerned about it since it happened in her office and derm said it is absolutely not hives, its extremely hot to touch, and not raised or itchy and she expressed how incorrect my pediatrician was as a child for ignoring this and saying its hives when it is obviously not and expressed how concerning it was that i had so many negligent doctors in general about various things let alone them telling me it was nothing when i mentioned it asked about my health issues and it happened in front of their eyes. Recently, my THEM flare ups have been horrendous but this rash seems to be getting worse as well. I will note that im 99% sure which is which when my feet turn- pots does not particularly hurt me, and doesnt occur fairly often or if it does its happening at the same time as a flare up and im unable to tell since the triggers are standing and showering for both. The rash is obviously different than the two, the only commonality is the redness and heat. My THEM feels uncanny to its description and i already suffered from sf neuropathy before this occured. THC and using a fan is the only thing that helps me. POTS feet happened first occasionally. Was just sent for extensive bloodwork but the blood draw i had yesterday was for a lot of random immunodeficiency and red blood things which she didnt mention during the visit. Dont know what shes specifically trying to find. I attached pictures of the difference between the rash, an them flare up, my POTS feet, and i couldnt find a non invasive photo of what i believe to be livedo reticularis and dont know. If anyone has a clue or this has happened to them as well, please share your experience. Im concerned. This is all over my body consistently daily and just travels instead of stopping. It doesnt hurt, it just feels very draining if that makes sense. I seem to be fatigued and foggy after this gets widespread, when its localized i dont feel that as much. Its very hot, but not painful I will see it and look away and 30 seconds later it dissapeared in that particular spot. I also get these strange pigmented peppered looking rash that tends to be on my ankles and stays after an them flare. Takes a while to settle down. I was diagnosed with hashimotos when i was 11 years old, extremely active and athletic child and one day crashed and gained an absurd amount of weight and was absolutely exhausted. My stomach pain daily was insane which is what prompted the initial GI visit and i was sent to endo and diagnosed with hashimotos. Here we are now years later after a million specialists who ignored everything and insisted i was lying, finally found docs that are interested in solving this and raise a lot of concern, but they are still puzzled. I feel worse and develop more symptoms by the day and im at a breaking point. Petechiae and random bruising as well. This is only to inquire about possibilities of my visible issues, i have a host of other side affects alarming me.", "Any sufferers in Australia ? Recently I found out from my GP that I likely have primary THEM, i am currently on the path to the rheumatologist to rule out being secondary, i have always had problems with circulation, raynauds, chronic chillblains, unexplainable all over body red flushes and now this, I flare up most nights and mornings and now sometimes in the day, I think cetrizine helps out with flares but am yet to take it daily. Currently embarking on a anti-inflam diet to see if any effect.\n\nDuring the day my hands and feet are always freezing (unless flaring) and sometimes are purple and blue. Has anybody else come across such a wide variety of symptoms ? \n\nTrying to find research or any kind of information is proving difficult and would love any kind of advice on exercise that does not cause flares ? foods people have cut out ?  questions to ask the Rheumatologist ? Any known specialists in Australia ? \n\nThanks in advance ! Not in Australia, but came here to say I am in exactly the same boat as you, and I wish I knew what would help.

Little raised red bumps on my face every morning from nightly flares in my face. I am not sure if the bumps are from my rosacea that comes on during a hot night of erythromelalgia flares or if it is the erythromelalgia itself, causing the small red bumps. Mine are little and a few bigger white heads (i posted a pic on the rosacea page) I knew this wasent rosacea but think I have been clinging ontop hope that it was what comes with the treatment I am on\u2026 but I just know this is not rosacea\u2026 as it happens no matter what, I go to sleep with all 3 windows open, a huge fan and nothing but the thinnest of blankets, so it must be happening from inside as I still wake up red in the face and burning up even without a temperature, and when I get these flares I can tell it is not rosacea at all cos sometimes it can be just my hands or both hands and feet like it relaly differs but when it happens to my face and other parts are reacting the same I know it cannot be rosacea\u2026 really hoping for some sort of treatment soon, are you on any? Have you been diagnosed with THEM?\n\nBurning pain in hands, feet, cheeks, and ears are very common with THEM. Flares can be brought on at night as your body naturally relaxes the blood vessels. Some people do get a bit of rash in addition to the characteristic redness.\n\nNot every THEM patient responds to the same treatments. It is a bit of trial and error. There are several prescription and non-prescription medications that are common treatment options.\n\nYou can probably safely try some non-prescription medications. Some patients respond to aspirin or OTC anti-histamines. Follow package directions. Be careful about the tendency for aspirin to irritate the stomach and/or disrupt blood clotting.\n\nFor prescription medicines I have seen patients report the use of mexiletine, topical lidocaine or ketamine, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and even opioid pain relievers. A doctor familiar with THEM should coordinate any treatment options. You might also be referred to a pain management specialist.\n\nQuite unfortunately some THEM patients do not find a treatment that is effective.

Started out of the blue with chronic fatigue, then heart palpatations followed, then non stop body wide twitxhing specially in the legs then brain fog and now now I have this issue with my feet constantly going red at night when I get into bed and they feel really hot. I used to have frozen now and always covered by a blanket, now u cannot sleep with them covered and almost every night without fail they are cherry red and very warm. I noticed alcohol als sets it off.. Saw a neuro  and ran a compete blood panel and 2 emgs plus a brain mri and spine mri. It is all normal. Ironically these tests show I am. Quite healthy with no supposed issues!my neuro sent me on my way with some. Antidepressants thinking it is all come from stress but it is not working. I have been twitching now for 2 years straight and this hit feet at night saga has been going for almost a full year. Could THEM be part of my troubles ? I feel like my entire nervous system has gone hay wire for no reason! Any ideas on what to do next? Sounds a lot like my journey.\n\nCheck out the patients guide on erythromelalgia.org\n\nFor temporary relief: treat the painful hot spots as though you have been burned.  Mild cooling, elevation, no scratching or rubbing, no ice.  Ice can cause damage.\n\nPersonally I recommend cannabis for the pain, antihistamines for the burning.\n\nRheumatologists seem to be the best at diagnosing this issue, but you need to see a neurologist. Docs need to rule out a lot of stuff to figure out why you have THEM, could be genetic, epigenetic, or autoimmune induced.\n\nTo prepare for docs:\nAny family with something similar?\nTake before and after pics of flares\nGet a temperature laser probe to measure temperature jumps on your skin\n\nI hate to also say this, but prepare for it to spread to other areas.  I hope it does not, but it can. Itll be weird. Oh my!  Sounds horrible.\n\nCherry red feet, you say?  And warm to the touch. If also painful then that definitely could be erythromelalgia. THEM flares are commonly triggered by alcohol, so that lines up too.\n\nA normal blood panel, brain and spine MRI, and EMG is totally consistent with THEM. Sometimes THEM is caused by some kinds of blood cancers that would show up on a blood panel, but not always. Probably best that your tests were normal on that point.\n\nBut THEM is not really known for causing twitching. Not saying there is not a connection somehow.  I am just not really familiar with it. But maybe finding a doctor familiar with THEM and figuring out a medication regimen that helps could ease the twitching? Not sure. Thanks for the replies. I guess what gets me is this.. I underatand why alcohol can be triggering it and I have stopped drinking, but the only other time it ever happenes is when I jump into bed at night. Even though it is not hot or cold really... How the hell do my feet know that I have jumped into bed! And what is so special about being in bed that triggers this reaction. I can be sitting in peak sun outside in summer during the day and my feet do not react.. It is just something about night time and being in bed that sets it all off! I wish I knew how to stop this. It is really affecting my sleep The body has a circadian clock.  Hormones and things change at night. Best fix is to leave your feet uncovered in bed.\n\nEdit: and fans/air conditioner. The circadian clock and hormone changes throughout the day cause blood vessels to dilate a bit around the time we typically go to bed. And as the you understand, just as alcohol dilates blood vessels and can cause a flare anything else that dilates blood vessels can have the same effect.\n\nThe other thing that typically changes at bedtime is a change to laying down. When you are vertical the blood vessels in your legs have to contract a bit to force blood back up to your trunk and head. But when you lay down you do not have to fight the force of gravity so much and the blood vessels in your legs and feel dilate.", "Painless THEM? I have seen three doctors now who know what THEM is generally, but I constantly feel as though I am explaining treatment options and symptoms to them that they are not fully familiar with. My symptoms are essentially just redness and warmth in my hands that occurs nightly and with exercise. I experience zero pain and perhaps the mildest of tingling, but at times none. This has been relatively unchanged for several years. (I only noticed it when someone pointed it out to me about 3.5 years ago after a run, so I am sure it existed before that for at least some time.) One doctor has told me I do not have THEM because I do not have pain. The two other doctors said that I have THEM, but my manifestation of the disease is simply painless. This is confusing to me. Has anyone else experienced painless THEM? Is this a better prognosis than a manifestation of the disease that starts out painful or that changes over time? I am just worried this is a sign of something terrible to come, or that perhaps I will just remain like this for a long time. Cannot find much information on this. \n\nAlso, interestingly, my hands and feet are cyanotic/cold persistently between flares. I read online that this can happen. Wondering if anyone else deals with this. It is not really that bothersome, but it is just interesting because it is quite the opposite of a flare (but it is not quite Raynaud's). \n\nThanks to all! I have painless THEM. Actually the true symptoms of THEM are warmth and redness, not only pain.  I get burning \u201cpain\u201d occasionally, but it is not pain in what people traditionally think. I have come to not believe doctors at all about it, because they truly have no clue. They are just spitballing really. Thanks so much for the info! This is exciting because I have never interacted with someone else who has THEM. Kind Of have just felt isolated and alone with this for the past several years, and did not look into online THEM communities because I was in denial that I had it (since all I would read about the disease were the stories of disabling pain). \n\nAnyway, have you noticed that the warmth and redness are a big problem in your daily life? My warmth/redness tends to occur without any real prompting at night, and then goes away within 20-30 minutes. So I do not really do anything for it. Yeah I think that is most of us on this forum. We are all we have really. It is hard when even doctors do not know anything... \n\nYes, mine is the same. I get redness and warmth almost every night. I have no idea why the onset is always in the evening. Mine lasts most evening and through the night though, so consider yourself truly lucky that yours is so brief. I have the biggest issue with my knees and feet. Hands, arms and ears are also very common. I typically spend each night cuddled up to a bunch of ice packs. :-( So sorry to hear that! That sounds extremely irritating. I hope you find some relief sometime soon.\n\nFor the time being, I guess I will just be grateful that my manifestation of the disease is relatively mild. But my heart goes out to those who have serious problems with daily life because of their symptoms. Thanks for saying so! We are all in this together, from the mild to severe. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb Yeah I think I have this too. I spent so long trying to find out what this is but everything always came up with Raynauds. Mine is just hands and feet and feels like a burning sensation at times but not painful just annoying. Mines also after exercise or at night and I think I have got circulation problems too as when I put my arms/legs in the air the redness usually goes away. Still do not know if this is what it is I have not been to the DR and am expecting nothing from them. I dont even know whether there is a cure? Its incredibly irritating though. THEM is progressive (for most people) and not everyone will have pain at first. Some never feel pain at all and just has heat and redness. And in some cases THEM can just start with full blown plain. It is different for everyone.\n\nMine started 8 years ago with just the tops of my toes turning red while washing dishes every night &amp; now it is spread to my entire feet, hands, knees, and now upper thighs.

I used to feel like a fraud or that my rheumatologist got it wrong and that I had something else wrong with me because I could not relate to anyone in the forums where they talked about pain 24/7. \n\nBut I am past all that because now I am one of them lol", "Does anyone have experience with skin biopsy?

That way if it is some other sort of skin condition a dermatologist would be well suited to diagnose the problem.\n\nTHEM pain is usually described as intensely burning.  I describe mine as like walking barefoot on hot pavement.  The press has sometimes called THEM \"Man on Fire Syndrome\" because affected body parts can feel like they are on fire. Seriously.  THEM pain is not usually described as light or tingly.\n\nTHEM usually comes and goes in flares. Warm water from showering can prompt or worsen an THEM flare. Generally heat, or anything else that causes blood vessel dilation such as exercise may cause symptoms to worsen.  When I am in flare I can have a hard time even wearing socks! \n\nIf immersion in cool water does not cause pain relief and the redness to go away (very fast, like within 30 seconds) then it might be more likely to be some sort of allergic reaction to the Accutane or some other cause rather than THEM.

Thanks for your advice though I will try and find one.\n\nI am sorry about your condition it must be awful.

Which all should come back normal (like everything else) and then he should do a DNA panel on the SCN9, 10 and 11 genes as those are the ones that affect peripheral neuropathy (THEM).\n\nIf you do not have the gene for THEM then it is not primary. Secondary I have heard can occur within a couple years of certain disorders like lupus, sjogrens etc. So if nothing comes back, you are still young...\n\nBecause this is so rare... I have been dealing with it since childhood... It was not until a DNA test I did on my own that pushed us down this path. And finally got me diagnosed. I have had uncontrollable IBS since childhood, I was really flushed as a kid without much provocation, and really sensitive to heat/cold my life. Now with this.. It explains it as primary can cause other nervous system issues.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nEdit: also if you can legally get some... CBD cream with a bit of THC I find helps my flares... Especially in my hands... That is where I get hit the most!\n\nIf it is legal... Google how to make it.. Super easy and much cheaper cause you can buy a cheap oz and use that. I make my own... 70$ for an oz that makes like 6 jars or 70$ for 1 jar in store.... Lol Mine is all the time too, but I believe I have secondary THEM. It started as super red feet in shower, burning and itching. Later feet turned brown from blood accumulation. Then it spread to knees, hands, face and ears over time, but got less red. Only gets red if my feet are down for more than 5 minutes with no movement. Or if not elevated high enough while sitting. I have THEM and I have been on accutane. My THEM developed before accutane so I doubt they have any connection. But yes, it looks like THEM to me. Is not there idiopathic primary THEM? At least that is what the Erythromelalgia Association says in their guide and they say it is the most common type.\n\n Hmm... Did not know idiopathic was the most common... I had read online through other medical websites (like NHS and rare diseases) and was told otherwise... It is hard to find concrete and recent research that is concrete... I am checking this site out tho..\n\nI just know this was the path I took and was told if I had the gene it is primary and if not it is not.. Lol so thank you for the correction! Accutane has everything to do with it. It is a horrible horrible drug", "Does Anyone\u2019s Insurance Company cover Compound Ketamine Cream? Im Apparently it is experimental - so sayth my insurance company.  They will not cover it, or gabapentin, in a cream form.  \n\nJust wondering if anyone else with compound cream w/ketamine gets it covered by insurance.  \n\nThanks.\n\nMy kid has THEM - not me. My husband got a compound formulation of ketamine cream from Kaiser Permanente. I think KP did not make it \u2014they contract with an external pharmacy. We paid our prescription co-pay, but I do not remember how much it cost. My husband has a severe nerve injury from his time in the army. Thanks!!!! Just FYI, I have Kaiser, and found this thread while searching for information/help bc they were covering my topical with a $50 copay until the beginning of this year. Now, it is $250 for the only thing that really helps manage my condition. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but would be awful to change insurance for this reason and run into the same thing, so figured I should say something. Thank you so much!! We pay $236.", "Menthol-infused compression gloves and socks I have not had a lot of success managing my THEM, and the flares have been particularly rough lately. In a desperate bid to help me get some relief, my husband bought menthol-infused compression gloves and socks for me at a drugstore.\n\nHe convinced me to try them during a flare (my hands will flare and resolve, then immediately after my feet will flare) and they provided sooooooooooo much relief! I am able to lie down and rest and fall asleep.\n\nI just wanted to share, in case it might help someone else! Where can you buy them? Target! They are called Copper Fit Ice", "Hello, I have been having this for a while but only googled the symptoms recently and found out that this is something serious. Going to a neurologist today to make sure  I have read the patients manual I found on the internet and the symptoms seem to check out. It happens every time I stand in a warm or/and humid place and after I step out of the bathtub after bath or shower. It becomes swollen red and very hot. It hurts too of course. It disappears after a few minutes of sitting in a colder, dryer room or place and it often leaves purple marks behind. The video is a bit misleading because it was more red in reality.\n\nI started experiencing this only a few months before this and we had no idea what it was, so we assumed I might have become allergic to shampoo on my feet or that I have fungus but none of those creams worked. Iit is only on my feet in the exact area that a sock covers, except the soles. But since I am always at home and pretty much never wear socks, we ruled out being allergic to socks quickly. What I am wondering about is that I have another problem with my feet that started way longer ago and I have no idea why it happens. My soles just constantly hurt. I guess I can call it chronic pain, I have no idea why it happens. My soles do not have what I assume is THEM and the other parts of my feet do not have the pain and I wonder if there is a chance for those to be related. The sole pain started years ago so just because the two things are both on my feet, next to each other, I do not think they are connected, but they could be. I guess I am asking if other people here with THEM have this symptom or not? Hi there.  And good for you for being proactive and getting checked out.\n\nErythromelalgia is typically made worse by exposure to heat and eased by cooling. In some patients it is worse when standing and better once your can lay down and elevate your legs.  \n\nYou said this is only in your feet. THEM may present in the hands, knees, cheeks, and ears quite commonly. If you have pictures of redness in any of those areas be sure to take the photo with you to show the doctor.\n\nHow would you described the pain on your soles? There are a lot of things that could cause that. mine do.  I cannot bear to have my feet touched or they hurt like crazy.  Doctors were not sure if it was plantar fasciitis or not, but once we discovered I had primary THEM, they were satisfied with calling it an THEM symptom.  My soles will frequently burn up too.  For the longest time, we thought maybe it was the carpet I was allergic to or something. hmm mine is different  \nbut yeah I just got back from the doctor so\n\nUPDATE:  \nNeurologist said that I should have went to skin doctor first and go through all the steps instead of starting with the most rare and incureable disease. But she coincidentally also happened to be a psichiatrist so at least I can make progress with those problems of mine. yes it is only on my feet, nowhere else at all\n\nsole pain is like pressure, even if nothing touches it, sometimes when it is more intense it is more like numb feeling or spikey Some of what you describe would fall under the broad category of paresthesia. Spikey, numb, pins and needles, pressure and more are all kinds of sensations transmitted by the small nerve fibers. \n\nTHEM is commonly described as a burning pain.  And burning sensations are carried by the small nerve fibers as well. \n\nSo maybe somethin is going on? Dunno.  And THEM is such a maddening condition that you can find yourself bouncing between specialists.\n\nGood luck. Take the home measures you can to relieve discomfort and try to be patient. thanks, that I will do", "Update on using Heat Therapy for \u201ccuring\u201d Erythromelalgia A while back I posted my progress from using heat therapy in combination with Misoprostol as a daily medication (details can be found on my last post) along with using medical marijuana for stress and immense pain relief. Today, my symptoms have only continued to improve, even in these ice cold months (I am on the northeast side of the US). I no longer really need the medical marijuana, but still enjoy it recreationally, and I am no longer on Misoprostol either (stopped taking it months ago).\n\nNow, because I started using all of these treatments in combination at the same time, it is hard to tell what really kicked most of the THEM symptoms away, but I will give the most credit to the heat therapy. I truly believe that is the sole reason my symptoms are in such remission (misoprostol may have helped too, no way to tell). Whenever my feet stay cold consistently, my symptoms worsen, and whenever I stay warm, my symptoms are nearly non existent. It just took time for my body to get used to staying warm again, but it was 100% worth it. I am still going for long runs both in 90 degree heat and in 25 degrees and even that will not set off an episode. The worst I have seen is just red feet afterwards that resolve themselves really fast after a hot shower.\n\nI went from extreme agony laying down with my feet elevated all day to living a very active life with almost no symptoms (they do not hinder me in any way anymore). The worst I will get is slightly hot red feet, but that is only after some exposure to the cold usually, and it does not even hurt, and resolves itself very fast. Hopefully that can give others some hope for possible treatments to get their life back if your in the boat as I was. Feel free to reach out about any questions, I would be glad to help out!", "Heart palpitations Hey guys so I do not have a dermatologist appointment until a few weeks. I recently just posted in this sub and I am pretty sure I have this.\n\nDoes anyone else experience heart palpitations during a flare up and should I be concerned?

Severely painful  On your ear it would be considered red ear syndrome but there is a association between RES and Erythromelalgia. I have both, and it does get annoying painful at times. There is an association with small fiber neuropathy and Erythromelalgia. Only way to get tested is with a skin biopsy. Thank you for letting me know! Is it normal for Erythromelalgia to be not only hot but bee-stinging painful and get triggered daily? I am trying to learn as much as possible from real patients because I have been getting the run around so much from doctors with little to no help and it seems to be escalating as far as flushing and pain level goes. Mine would feel like bee stings when I was a kid too. It does not hurt as much now and I get it less frequent. Not sure why that is tho. But I have been getting really bad in my feet lately. \n\nYeah most doctor do not know sh*t about this or how to treat it, sorry that you have to deal with the run around but you are not alone!\n\n\n \nI have a few recommendation. One of them would be an anti inflammatory diet, mostly Whole Food plant base diet, since this conditions has an inflammation component to it so it could help. Also, I have heard some people cut out wheat from their diet and it reduced symptoms.  It is possible that some of us with this condition may have a gluten sensitivity, which is different from gluten intolerance aka celiac. So try experimenting with that and cut out all wheat for 2 months, then reintroduce it to see how you feel. I am currently trying this myself but I have not noticed a difference, I am 3 weeks in. Lastly you could try really cold showers, it will shock you for sure lol, but can be uncomfortable for most, it will lower the inflammation for sure, and try to be consistent with it and it could help in the long term. Thank you so much for sharing about your journey with this, I have found the most helpful information from talking with people on these forums who experience it day in and out. I have worked on keeping a food diary for about a year but I have not found any real correlation but coffee and peanut butter which I think tend to flare up sensitive people. I am on day two now of doubling down on some basic non drowsy anti histamines and I am finding some slight relief. The immunologist wants to run some basic blood work and get a baseline idea to move forward, she seemed confident that if it was CIU or even Erythromelalgia that we would work toward finding some relief. My heart goes out to anyone who has to deal with this on a daily basis. Have you found any drug that helps?", "I start Mexiletine next week. Wish me luck! I am a 23 year old male who developed THEM about two years ago. It began in my hands first and then eventually spread to my feet. Through my own research I discovered THEM. I have been working with a dermatologist who is fairly open to working on the THEM with me. We have tried aspirin and amitriptyline so far. I felt mexilitene seemed like the best option and she agreed with my suggestion. I will keep you guys updated on how it goes. Wishing you great results! Awesome you found a derm who is open to helping. Wishing you luck! Keep us updated on your experience. Hoping it works!  Did wonders for me. Let us know how it goes! Really? Could you tell me a bit more about your experience? How was your THEM? Did you feel a difference immediately or did it take weeks/months? And how is your THEM now?\n\nSorry lots of questions, but it is nice to see success stories. My THEM is a burning pain in my toes and feet of both legs.  Pain is worst on the soles of the feet. Redness extends to the ankles when flaring is at its worst.   I sometimes get redness in my right hand extending about 3 inches past my wrist, but there is no pain in my hand.\n\nMy doctor started me on mexiletine 150mg twice per day. Within about 2 or 3 days I had significant pain reduction.  It was just that fast.\n\nIf I forget to take my meds the pain returns in just a couple hours.  The half life is about 10 hours, so half is flushed out of my system before the next dose is due.  Forget to take a dose and the serum concentration drops below therapeutic levels.\n\nFor me mexiletine just stops the pain.  Redness continues, but I do not mind it as much. 3 inches is 7.62 cm Thank you. Everyone has such an individual experience with THEM. I know mexilitene is very hit and miss. It seems like when it works for people, it works really well, and then for others, nothing. But I do think it is a good place to start. \n\nI think for all of us with THEM it is trying to be proactive and finding a medical professional which is open to working with us (which is no easy feat). I am very curious now to see how I react to it. At the beginning I think she was a bit hesitant, but I was fairly consistent in explaining the whole situation to her. Even when I suggested mexilitene, I think she was not sure. But she went away and read the studies and then got back in touch and said she was open in working with me and trying different treatment options (which surprised me slightly as I had bad experiences with doctors before just brushing me aside). I totally understand that, I have had a rough time with doctors brushing me off as well. It sounds like she is doing what doctors should do when encountered with something new, doing some homework and then working with the patient. I am so glad she is one of the good ones after all!", "Terrible dry eye My THEM is in my face and eyelids.  Super painful sometimes.  Fun part... antihistamines make it super bad.  So I have to stop.  I have already injured noth my eyes from super dry eye.\n\nGoing To have to step away from reddit for a few weeks as its just...  too..  painful  I am so sorry. I have dry eyes, too, though my eye doctor swears it has nothing to do with my THEM and is instead, for me, just caused by poorly functioning meibomian glands (the hydrating oil glands) of the eyes and my occular rosacea. \n\nI understand your need to disconnect for a while, as sometimes we just need a break from trying to understand THEM and other conditions better. Sometimes it is overwhelming and even depressing to research and share info about it because it reminds us of how painful it is for our lives to be so deeply affected by these conditions. \n\nJust do not suffer in silence. Make sure you talk to someone, anyone. Being seen and heard helps, even if it is a reddit internet stranger. So I am wishing you peace during your break from social media but also wishing you the wherewithal to know you are not alone and that you can always reach out, even to this group, if you just need someone to chat with. Theres a link between neuropathic pain in the eyes and dry eye, theres also a link between THEM and sweat production.  Dollars to donuts THEM causes oil gland problems when it is in the eyes/eyelids.\n\nThank you for your compassion.  The issue is really just reading and screen time makes the eye pain and dry eye worse.  But yea, your kind words are appreciated.", "Do you guys ever get brain fog? Brain fog was a big symptom for me for a long time, and one that I would tell doctors about as my primary concern before I was diagnosed.  But the doctor that diagnosed me with Erythromelalgia believes that the brain fog was caused by the lack of sleep due to my feet becoming red and burning, NOT from the disorder itself.  So do you guys ever get brain fog?  I have not had it in a few months now, and when I would get it, it would come and go in waves (daily issue for three months and then disappears).  So just curios about others who have this disorder.", "Primary Erythromelalgia - A Review  It seems important to share this part in particular. It lets people know what kind of trials they will have to go through to get diagnosed and how it can be a bit of a journey:\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n....\n\n### Differential diagnosis\n\nTo differentiate PE from secondary erythromelalgia, clinical conditions (myeloproliferative disorders, neoplasms, rheumatologic diseases), medications (bromocriptine, calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, felodipine, and nicardipine and topical isopropanol), substances (mushroom/mercury poisoning) or poxvirus (Chinese epidemic of erythromelalgia) should be carefully reviewed \\( Due to some shared clinical similarities (severe pain and vasomotor disturbances), PE needs to be differentiated from Fabry disease, which is a rare genetic disorder that causes lipid metabolism aberration and is characterized by burning pain and acroparesthesias in the extremities. A decreased plasmatic level of \u03b1 \u2013galactosidase A is crucial in the diagnosis of Fabry disease \\( Other differential diagnoses include Raynaud phenomenon, frostbite, vasculitis, cellulitis, erysipelas, dermatitis, osteomyelitis, complex regional pain syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), peripheral neuropathy, arterial or venous insufficiency and gout \\(\n\n....", "Does this seem like THEM? Hi, everyone! Since I was about 11 years old (I am now 25), I have gotten episodes of extremely painful and burning red patches on my feet and palms that are hot to the touch. My hands and feet also swell quite a bit (pics below). \n\nThe episodes are usually triggered by warm weather (now even when it gets to the mid 60's) and are exacerbated by friction (walking in shoes/sandals) and exercise. \n\nThis will last from several days to weeks (or is somewhat continuous during the summer months) and have progressively gotten worse over the years to the point that I am unable to walk when it is at its peak. I have been to several doctors with no luck finding a diagnosis or treatment. \n\nThis has prevented me from taking part/enjoying various activities (hiking, trips to places that are hot). I am worried because I will be moving to Houston, TX in June for work where it will pretty much be hot year-round. I have no idea how I am going to manage it for such an extended period of time. \n\nAny tips/suggestions?

Oh yeah, thanks for asking! More of a tingling sensation when it first starts but it is mostly painful/burning... not really itchy. Symptom description wise sounds like a yes, but visually in the 2nd &amp; 3rd pics I have not.\n\nI would suggest seeing dermatology (to identify what each flare up is &amp; if there is anything else also going on) and neurology (test for neuropathies) and/or vascular. Many places have added telemedicine and video chats, but check with your insurance coverage first. Good luck &amp; please update us!! How do they test for neuropathies? Like an EMG? Thank you so much for your help! I have seen a dermatologist before and no luck there, but I have not approached vascular or neurology before so that is a great idea. Thanks again! EMG is one, they also do nerve conduction velocity (NCV) testing.

I have been taking alpha Lipoic acid as the doctor recommended and have had enormous improvements but it is not completely gone. \n\nI am also in the process of being tested for autonomic failure and mast cell activation because those can cause THEM/SFN if they are left untreated and my doctor thinks that might be the cause of my THEM.

I do have some broken blood vessels and was fairly red even after flares for a little while but with time the ALA has helped that too. My dr told me most people see improvements in a month but honestly I felt changes after just a few days, I have now been on it for 6 months and would say I have improved about 70%. \n\nI went to two derms and one rheumatologist and none of them knew or understood how THEM works and what to do to help. I would definitely find a neuromuscular neurologist, they understand neuropathy and the twitching tingling is part of that too. I was totally on the edge of a nervous breakdown before I started ALA and saw my neurologist. The pain is indescribable.

I am heat intolerant and very sensitive to sunlight I flare instantly, I am only 3 days in with no changes but I am going to keep going Thankyou!! What dose are you on daily? Yep! That sounds exactly like me. I also cannot have anything touch my face or ear skin without a flare, even water does it. I am on 600mg 1x a day. The brand I use is called Sundown. I also take liquid magensium from blue bonnet company and that has helped my flares a bit too.  It is also helped my stomach, I have gastroparesis from autonomic issues and the magensium helps keep things\u2026 flowing lol oh and these little neck fans from Amazon, I take them with me to keep my face skin cool if I go out of the house or to a movie or friends house.

My Raynauds developed first, then the THEM several years later. \n\nIt really comes down to symptoms, triggers of brining on those symptoms/flares, and what helps calm them down. Hard to tell from just pics. I second this, it looks like burning pain in the second photo. Do you feel a burning or tingling sensation? I have THEM and Raynaud\u2019s as well. Those toes on your right foot in the second photo look awful  \ud83d\ude25 and not like a Raynaud's flare.  Could be THEM. If it was taken just after a Raynaud's flare ended it *could* be a rebound reperfusion as blood rushed back to the tissues. that looks like my reynauds.  I have both, and this looks more like my reynauds than them.  \n\n\nReynauds can cause \"chilblains\" which is what your second picture looks like.  (\n\n( This looks like straight them. I got misdiagnosed at first. Is it better or worse with cold? Better or worse with heat? If it gets worse with heat better with cold it is THEM. I think people in the comments forget what the early signs are. Yours looks just like mine. Attacking the toes and small areas of the foot. In less than a year it is gone to my face, elbows, legs, and sometimes hands. That is scary. It is worse in heat. Cold seems to make it better. Which sounds like THEM, right.\n\nI also get symptoms of Raynaud's in my hands. Thank you for the sympathy! Yes, it felt awful at the time. It was not a flare up, but like that consistently. If you notice too that my right leg is much redder. Could well have been Chilblains caused from Raynaud's or THEM, though if you notice my entire right leg is much redder. This seems more like THEM than Raynaud's to me? Thanks for your reply. Yes definitely burning pain, as you can see from the entirely red foot and even spread up into my leg.  \n\n\nHow bad is it for you? How do you treat both of them? This is all new to me. Coldness calms it down, toes tend to get worse from exercise. Stress seems to cause Raynaud like symtoms in my hands... I think it might be both :( That sounds like THEM. Atleast in your feet it seems like it is THEM. I would try and get your doctor to refer you to pain management and then discuss it with the pain management doctor. That is how I got a proper diagnosis. I am going to duke in a week or two and maybe Mayo in 9-12 months.  That definitely sounds like THEM. Well there are a few things- you mentioned you had Raynaud\u2019s first? Do you know the cause of your Raynaud\u2019s? \n\nDepending on the cause is what will determine what will work for you. So THEM classified as a type of peripheral neuropathy, you might also have small fiber Neuropathy (I do), some people develop these conditions due to Lupus or other health issues and some folks have no real cause they can find so it gets a little complicated. I personally have Dysautonomia which is causing my issues, yours may be different. \n\nso in the short term when you are having a flare up I would elevate your feet, put cool water or fans on your feet and try taking low dose aspirin. Document if the aspirin works, you will probably have to try it a few times. See if your doctor can give you a CBC for blood counts to rule out some blood disorders that can cause THEM. You can also request a skin biopsy to see if you have small fiber Neuropathy. \n\nI have found that taking the supplement Alpha Lipoic Acid and liquid Magensium have helped me IMMENSELY. My neurologist said the ALA is the best thing for this. Some people find relief from beta blockers so it is a bit different for everyone, it is sort of a trial and error thing which I know is hard because you are in pain. It took me two years to get real help with this, I have it on my feet, face and ears and was at the most miserable point in my life when I finally started on these supplements which have really helped a ton. I hope this was helpful and you can find some relief soon, I am sorry you are dealing with this condition. If you have any questions or I can help more in anyway just let me know!

So no problems with it for you then? I have heard mainly bad about these kinds of creams and it is scared me\ud83d\ude02 brimonidine gel/ mirvaso, are these the same etc? I have heard about rebound flushing and it ruining people\u2019s skin still years and years later\u2026 or are these completely different? Midodrine is normally taken orally to boost blood pressure in patients with POTS.  Rather than taking it systemically a topical cream applies it only to the problem areas.\n\nChemically midodrine appears to be quite different than brimonidrine. Midodrine is an alpha 1 receptor agonist. Brimonidrine is an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist.  In short, they work by entirely different mechanisms \n\nIt has worked for me. I use it sparingly due to its price. I think of it like a rescue inhaler for an asthmatic.  But when all my normal management efforts failed it has worked within a minute to stop a flare. No rebound flushing. I use it and then prop my feet back in front of a fan. Feet do feel a little odd after use, but not painful. I use maybe a pea size dollop per foot. I paid attention to pain and did not take notice of how it effected redness.\n\nMy THEM is mostly my feet. I do not have symptoms in my face. I cannot think of a reason that using it on your face would be different but if THEM has taught me anything it is that every patient is different. I will definitely ask about it orally, I have quite low blood pressure at times and always just on the lower side, and I have been suspecting pots for months where I actually have an appointment next week to discuss my 24hour ecg results as something had come up on it\u2026 do you think this pots/ whatever they have found could be causing or have any effect on erythromelalgia? You could be like my daughter (20) who also has Acne Rosacea (like me).  There are four types and one can just be redness.  Like THEM, she tries to avoid her triggers.  For her, it is spicy food, garlic and onions. She is also gluten free (celiac disease).  This calms her Rosacea.  When flaring, she uses a tinted green concealer under her foundation to conceal the redness.  \n\nHer rheumatologist is not treating her THEM with medication.  Her main trigger for THEM and Raynaud\u2019s is stress.  Even excitement.  She finds that meditation techniques really help! POTS is a common co-morbidity with THEM.  So are other related conditions of orthostatic intolerance that affect heart rate and/or blood pressure when standing after laying down for some time. \n\nThat is not to say POTS causes THEM.  But there may be be a common cause that underlies both conditions in some patients. A dysfunction of the parasympathetic nervous system may be to blame. Sorry for asking so many questions, I actually suspect everything I experience (a lot\ud83d\ude02) is all down to my nervous system\u2026 Is that treatable? Would that make it easier to get rid of them and pots THEM is a really crappy diagnosis and many doctors and not so familiar with it. As a result patient-to-patient networking is really important.  It is not a substitute for advice from a doctor but can be a means to share things to discuss with your doctor.\n\nI try to be sure that anything I take to my doctor is not just \"something I read on Google or on Reddit\" but actually comes from a reputable source.  Thus I sent that above linked research letter from JAMA Dermatology to my doctor so I could discuss it.  It has its limitations as it was a very small sample but we decided the risks seemed minimal in my case so my doctor was open to trying it and wrote the prescription. And it worked for me.\n\nSo...  I have had other neurological system issues for a long time before my THEM diagnosis. I have Neurocardiogenic Syncope which is similar to POTS but for me it is that I get ***very*** low heart rate when I stand but not so much of the blood pressure drop that some get due to blood vessel dilation.\n\nFor me it is lifestyle management. No cure. It is been 20+ years. Have not got rid of my NCS. Not to say you cannot get rid of your THEM. Wow Thankyou so much!! You have been really helpful\u2026 wishing you all the best !!", "I think I have erythromelalgia Hi, everyone\u2026 I am new here. I have had raynaud\u2019s for several years since my early 20s (37 now). However, the last two years I have been having the red looking skin like most of you have shared. I have it on both knees, elbows, legs, feet, arms, sometimes my hands, etc\u2026 \n\nI do have a biopsy scheduled in January\u2026  because my quality of life has been greatly affected by this. I do plan on bringing this up to my dermatologist that is doing the biopsy, but if anyone has any useful information that I should ask them (I would appreciate any help)\u2026\n\nMy flares last minutes to a few hours (or until I cool off) and it happens throughout my entire day\u2026 multiple times a day! I will be so happy once this is fully diagnosed, but I am glad I found this community. I feel so much weight just lifted off my shoulders, because I am almost 100% that it is erythromelalgia!", "Mine is significantly better But maybe it was never severe. It affected my feet mostly and sometimes my hands. My feet would turn red, burn, itch and swell up. I would run cold or cool water over them and eventually the episode subsided.  \n\nI self diagnosed by internet and found a doctor with it who discovered magnesium helped. I have been taking magnesium regularly ever since. Once in a while my hands act up when going for a walk. I just run cool water over them and it gets better.\n\nNow my 11 year old's feet, ears, nose and the back of her legs are turning red. No burning yet, but it freaks me out! I started her on a magnesium supplement. I hope it helps. As I read other posts I realize that as a kid one side of my face use to turn red and get hot when I chewed. Also when I ate anything sour. I wonder if it is related. What dosage do you take magnesium per day pls? If you think it is genetic, you might look into whether you can get checked for mutations in your family's SCN9A, SCN10A, and SCN11A genes. If you do have mutations there, you may qualify for some clinical trials that study primary (genetic) THEM. What brand and dosage of magensium? I am on a liquid mag right now and I have found it helps me as well. I have facial, ear and feet THEM. Also diagnosed with SFN. I just take Spring Valley 100mg magnesium citrate. Only taking one a day currently. I used to take one 2x a day. Spring Valley 100 mg magnesium citrate once a day. I used to take one capsule twice a day though. Interesting. Ok. I just do not want to know if there is some horrible disease I could have from it. Thank you so much I am definitely going to incorporate this into my daily meds as I have seen magnesium mentioned a few times now. I sure hope it helps for you. Up to you. Genetic THEM is not connected to anything else afaik, and ( If you have psoriasis, have you considered psoriatic arthritis as a possible alternative diagnosis? especially since it is a self diagnosis. I had THEM like symptoms but was diagnosed with PSA, and taking DMARDS has helped a ton. Maybe something worth thinking about. Thanks  I do not usually have THEM symptoms anymore, but my other daughter was  diagnosed with PsA when she was 2. She took Methotrexate for a few years.  \n\nI went to a doctor once about my THEM symptoms years ago and he seemed perplexed and just told me to take Claritin. \n\nI am hoping that my daughter who now seems to be having THEM symptoms is not developing PsA. Wow, I did not even know you could get diagnosed with psa that early, that is nuts. I am glad you are doing better and wish your family the best! Thank you. I did not even know kids got arthritis before she did. I hope you are doing well also. \n\nAre you taking Methotrexate? Just curious.  How long have you had PsA? I wonder if THEM responds differently to treatments if it is genetic vs secondary. Thanks! I am taking Otezla which has helped quite a bit but I am moving to Cosentyx because it is not helping the psoriasis as much as I would like. I have only had PSA for a year.", "Does anyone with THEM also have chilblains? I am pretty sure that is what the red, swollen and itchy spots on my hands are and I was wondering if my THEM could be causing them (or if they have any correlation at all, really). They are on my toes too and make wintertime absolutely miserable. ", "Does THEM look like this? I have Raynaud's as well, possible MCAS, but suspecting THEM. Always in evenings, hot, burning, itching hands/feet/ears.  It does look like my THEM, that said, the journey to diagnosis is complicated and there is a lot of mimics. (another way to think about it is, THEM mimics a lot of other problems). So I do not want to say \"yep! that is THEM\" and send you down the wrong medical road.  Instead, I can only say that \"it fits the profile\".   \n\n\nAre you seeing a rheumatologist yet? It has been my experience that they are able to recognize THEM because they see it as a symptom of autoimmune disorders, whereas other doctors may not have ever even heard of THEM before. I saw one back in December who dx me with Raynaud's and suggested Ehlers-Danlos eval. I now have confirmed Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, dysautonomia too. Maybe I will check in with her again and ask about THEM. Thank you There does seem to be a link between dysautonomia and THEM.  With EDS though, it could be EDS vasculitis or another EDS symptom. Biology is complicated This honestly looks just like mine and I am being treated for Psoriatic arthritis. Now I need to figure out if I have THEM. Are you getting any treatment? No not yet ... Not sure who to ask. I might schedule follow up with rheumatology. Or maybe a vascular doctor? Maybe both if you can but I would definitely see someone. I have been seeing a rhuem and I am taking otezla and it seems to help. But THEM sounds like it can be caused by all sorts of things. I am going to ask my Rhuem about possible tests I can take to try to pin it down.", "Guaranteed Cash Advance Loans | Personal Loan up to $1500\u200e ", "Couple of questions My feet, ears, and face often burn.  This happens more frequently at night, usually when I am laying down.  If it happens during the evening or when I am not laying down, it is typically when I am in an unusually warm room.  I tend to get splotchy rashes on my feet and toes, but the facial redness is pretty consistent.  Skin feels hot but I never have a fever.  I have been exercising a lot more lately and I have been experiencing it virtually every night.\n\nCouple of questions for the community:\n\nCould this be THEM?  \nDoes anyone have THEM that was diagnosed post COVID infection?\n\nI really believe that THEM is not going to be a rare disease for much longer.  From what I have read about it, thrombocythemia is a common causal mechanism of THEM.  There is increasing evidence that most of the damage caused by COVID is caused by excessive platelet activation in hosts.  THEM is also a recognized and studied side effect of the COVID vaccines (though its rarely associated with thrombocythemia in those cases).", "Erythromelalgia or possibly other circulatory issues? Any input is appreciated before I decide to see a specialist!  Yes, I would get seen by a neurologist and suggest possible THEM. Go through the THEM checklist.  Looks like you have the redness in your feet. Does it hurt? Would you describe the pain as a burning sensation?\n\nIs there anything that makes the redness and pain go away? In THEM typically cooling the affected 9like with a cool foot bath) area will quickly relieve both redness and pain as the blood vessel constrict. But once your feet warm back up the redness and pain return if the flare is ongoing. Pain: yes, somewhat- I do feel a burning sensation and a general discomfort that I would almost describe as itchy.\nCool water: yes absolutely. I can remember being 12 years old and waking up with burning feet, then putting them in the sink for relief. So that, or elevating them under my bedroom fan have been the two solutions \n\nAlso, I read that it is more prevalent in people of Norwegian descent, and my grandma claims to have the same issues....thank you for the guidance! It sounds like THEM.\n\nIf you have a family history and have had symptoms from a young age then you *might* have a genetic variant.\n\nYour grandma has similar symptoms does your father/mother have any symptoms too? The genetic variant follows an inheritance pattern called autosomal dominant. An affected person has a 50% chance of passing the condition to their offspring. So if your grandma's child has it too then this is likely genetic. Kind of looks like POTs blood pooling too I have been reading into POTS too...I have fainted maybe 4 times in my adult life which I attributed to low blood sugar, so could be. Definitely experience more red feet/hands and splotchy legs more than lightheadedness though I have this too but I was told it was because I have very fair skin and it is just because of blood pooling. I have been very deconditioned lately so perhaps that is also a reason THEM is often paired with various other conditions. The combination of conditions can sometimes point to a possible common cause.\n\nPOTS falls into the category of Dysautonomia. And Dysautonomias are *sometimes* a condition found in THEM patients. \n\nYour history of just a few fainting episodes might be relevant. Maybe not. Do not omit it when going over your history with your doctor.\n\nSounds like you need a rather thorough workup.  Good luck. That is what my feet and legs look exactly like after a shower. They thought it was a circulation issues or varicose veins. But turned out to be erythromelalgia.

I am male turning 19 this month. I have had hot/itchy/pins and needles feet whenever I stand for a while or do something quickly. I have not seen if it relates to the heat but I cannot recall it happening much during the winter. The veins start to bulge and along with a bit of reddening they feel pretty warm. Ice packs seem to almost hurt and so I do not use them anymore but just use a fan. What should I do to make sure it is them? Is this enough to go to a doctor?

Mine has spread to my face, ears, knees, hands, and feet, and when it strikes, I also get severe headaches with it, so just learn all you can and find your triggers and explore your options with a good doc.

Eight months ago, I was blinded in my left eye by optic neuritis, but no doctors at the Mayo Clinic can make any connection.\n\nHas anyone happened to have a similar experience? A year ago, I was an active and healthy 27 year old. This has completely upended my life. Did they run any tests to see why you had ON? There are many reasons (with MS) being the most common one. That is correct. I had a brain MRI that was normal, so they do not think it is MS. I hope you can find an answer or someone that had similar symptoms. I have visual symptoms (visual snow, after images, tunnel vision but not ON. I am not a doctor and certainly not a neurologist.  So be forewarned about my ramblings here.\n\nFrom what I can see the optic nerve is myelinated, that is it has an layer of sheathing similar to how a wire in your home has plastic insulation. MS, and certain other conditions, attack that myelin sheath.\n\nThe nerves involved in THEM are not myelinated.  Comparing them to copper wiring these nerves lack insulation, just similar to a bare copper wire.\n\nA lot of what causes THEM is not well understood. But one area of some understanding is that the immune system sometimes attacks the small fiber (uninsulated) nerve cells which may result in THEM. But since the optic nerve is insulated it should not be susceptible to the same sort of auto-immune attack. Other disease processes that might cause THEM seem to similarly be dependent on those nerves being uninsulated.  So my speculation, and it is very much speculation, is a lot of those processes are likely not in common with optic neuritis.\n\nWhich, from what very little I understand, largely falls back to more systemic inflammatory processes that could cause the ON and might be involved in THEM.  \n\nI hope the doctors have been able to address your vision issues. I read that ON vision loss is usually temporary. Hopefully that bodes well for you.\n\nAnd as to your THEM?  Our virtual club highly recommends a moderately cool foot bath and online commiserating with others. So welcome to our club. Sorry the admission requirements suck so bad. I appreciate your thoughtful response. I have been very lucky in seeing about seven doctors (neurologist and rheumatology) included, but they do not think I have any neurological or immune system issues. I had about a thousand blood tests and scans.  Unfortunately, my ON attack was eight months ago, and it is unlikely my vision will be returning. Most vision improvement happens in the first month or two. \n\nI received some ketamine cream and was told to take aspirin. I am sorry everyone here also has this issue, it is really quite terrible. I am thankful you are here to speak with though. Just checking, that is what Mayo\u2019s options for pain were, ketamine cream and aspirin? At first yes, I was only there a week ago. We are going end of September but from what little info I have gotten out of their Pain Clinic and their THEM clinic (that refers to the Pain Clinic) - they do not have any additional treatment options above what our local Pain Management team has.

One day, I will develop adrenal insufficiency. I think diabetes has arrived. \n\nThen I stumbled across this. I am waiting on some doctor appointments. I have almost gone to the ER thinking this is adrenal crisis. \n\nMy first symptom has been a dark red scrotum. The dermatologist cannot fix it. Some of the medication prescribed is throwing off what little hormonal homeostasis I did have. Color is the only issue, and it was consistently warm. \n\nThen my ears and face started to flush. My wife was convinced I had Lupus. I am so tired. I fall asleep without warning. I dropped my phone on my face typing the first paragraph. Still no pain. Just redness. I did start breaking nose capillaries from the flushing. \n\nThe facial flushing has chilled out. It comes if I lay down. The ears light up a lot. \n\nMy mouth starts to burn. This is insane. So painful. I have great dental hygiene. I develop gingivitis, but it flares randomly. The dentist says I am good. Sugar alcohols seem to be the trigger. Maybe even stress.\n\nNext, my hand knuckles are red. These vary in red colored intensity. Then the creases of my palms start doing the same. Sometimes they are even an orange color. \n\nI think surely I have some fungal or bacterial overgrowth. I am a tad concerned. I am just waiting out for my doctor appointment. \n\nI woke up this morning and my hands, where they are red, start burning just as much as my mouth. The intensity/pulse of the burn is in sync with my mouth and hands. \n\nI am concerned. If my scrotum follows suit, I would probably have to end things. I do not know if I have this condition. It may be possible. \n\nI am here because I am exhausted and want some opinions. My hands stopped burning when I applied hydrocortisone to my scrotum, fastest topical absorption. The redness faded more when I drank pickle juice, electrolytes. That is a last resort thing for me. I hate that stuff. \n\nI see some red on my big toes. So here are some pictures, no scrotum. \n\n\n\nI have this bump on my middle finger\u2019s top knuckle. My mouth still burns. my symptoms are so similar to some of yours. I am diagnosed with THEM, it is caused secondary to another condition my doctors are still trying to figure out. The hydrocortisone is a lifesaver. When I lay down for bed at night my ears are bright red &amp; so hot too. The creases in my hands turn red, along with knuckles and toes. Elevating the red extremities helps. Applying a few drops of  peppermint oil mixed in with moisturizer helps too. I take Hyrdralyte or Pedialyte for electrolytes btw, I recommend them. my dad had these same symptoms for over a decade and was diagnosed Psoriatic Arthritis and put on biologics that he says cleared everything up. I hope you find answers &amp; just know you are not alone  Damn. Sounds like you are having a real time of it. From what you wrote I think this *might* be THEM. \n\nNow I am not a doctor. I have not even dressed up as a doctor for Halloween. I am just some rando on the internet so take my ramblings with a whole box of salt. \n\nThe hallmarks of THEM are pain and redness. Most commonly the extremities are affected.  Hands and feet and probably the most common affected areas. Knees, cheeks, and ears are other common sites. I have heard of a few people mentioning redness and burning in the mouth but it is not common. I have not heard about scrotal involvement but I imagine it could be implicated in THEM.\n\nYes, THEM flares commonly occur when you lay down to sleep. Laying down triggers your body to relax blood vessels as you prepare to rest. Unfortunately that makes THEM worse. That you seem to have worsening of symptoms when laying down makes me think THEM is more likely.\n\nIf you get the redness I would suggest placing the affected body part(s) under cool (just under room temp) water. If this is something vascular like Erythromelalgia the redness will probably go away.\n\nTHEM usually temporarily responds to things that cause blood vessels to change in diameter. Heat and exercise often make it worse. Cooling and elevation of the affected area often eases pain.\n\nYou mention messed up genetics.  In about 15% of cases THEM is genetic, following an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. While a new mutation is always possible, this inheritance pattern usually means one parent is also afflicted. Half of children of a parent with this genetic form of THEM would be expected to have the condition, on average.  Do any family members have similar odd flushing, redness, and/or burning?\n\nCommonly THEM is secondary to some other condition. There are a LOT of conditions, including some blood cancers, that THEM sometimes comes along with like your drunken cousin arriving to crash your kid's wedding - unwanted and causing way too many problems. In these instances the THEM often resolves if the causative condition can be successfully treated.\n\nIf this is THEM for you there are treatments. It is sometimes a trial and error system to find what works best for you. Patients commonly are prescribed aspirin, mexiletine, amitriptyline, carbamazepine, midodrine, and/or NSAIDs among others. What works for me might not work for you. Work with your doctor to find what works for you.\n\nSpeaking of doctors, many are not familiar with THEM. THEM is rare. Really rare. Getting a double yolk when you crack an egg is rare. Getting a double yolk six times in a row is really rare. That is the level of rare we are talking about here. Many doctors have *never* seen a patient with THEM.\n\nThe Erythromelalgia Association has a ( of medical providers familiar with the condition.  There are a variety of specialists on that list including podiatrists, vascular medicine doctors, dermatologists, neurologists, family practitioners, and probably others I am forgetting.  IMHO, if you suspect THEM then seeing a doctor who is familiar with the condition is important.\n\nPrepare for your doctor's appointment. Take photos of affected areas when flaring so you can show the doctor what is going on if you are not in full flare during the appointment. Make note of what makes it worse or better. Write a list of questions. Consider taking a friend or family member with you who can take notes and be sure all your questions are answered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition to medicines you can try things at home. Elevate your legs when sitting. Place a fan pointed at your body as you sleep. Keep affected body parts out from under a blanket, if possible. Use a ( (but never ice!) to keep things cooled off. \n\nLimit exercise. Swimming is a good option for exercise as you can shed body heat faster in the water. \n\nLimit drastic temperature swings. Many patients have bad rebound flares when they warm back up if they got too cold. Play with your thermostat to find a temperature that is comfortable for you. It might be a couple degrees cooler than others would like.\n\nGood luck there.  Hopefully whatever this is you can get some relief soon. ", "Does this look familiar??? It is driving me absolutely insane. I have been having these flare ups of red patches of swelling for a few months that seem to come and go with no rhyme or reason - Erythromelalgia is the only thing that looks similar  The biggest give aways to tell if it is THEM is to know what triggers it specifically and what do these red flares feel like.

Mention it to your docs, but be ready to go through the process of \"is it hives? is it lupus? is it arthritis?\".    \n\n\nMore importantly, its a sign that \"something\" is happening. So its ok to go to the docs and start the process of figuring it all out.  Good Luck! Yeah, based on this additional info, I would agree that it sounds a lot like THEM. If you do not have luck with one doctor, do not give up. Sometimes it takes several and different types of specialists. I had best luck with a Rheumatologist knowing what THEM is. I will not sugar coat it. Depending on what the underlying cause is for you, THEM is not something that typically just goes away. That being said, some medications end up helping control the severity and pain of flare ups. Everyone is different. What you need to focus on is to keep documenting your triggers and taking lots of photos to show doctors. This is how my Rheumatologist diagnosed me since I only ever have a Raynauds flare in an exam room. \n\nYou might also have Raynauds if you have the opposite which is cold and tender and changing colors. Anyways, you are not alone and sometimes you have to be your own best friend and advocate. Do not let anyone tell you it is in your head. It is not. So just focus on trying different docs until you find one who will help you and diagnose you. \n\nI tried dermatologist, neurologist, and heart doc before a rheum, and even then, I had to go through three Rheumatologists and one two foot doctors before anyone knew what the hell I was dealing with. This literally happens to me every few days. It does not hurt but my hand will turn bright red just like that. It will sometimes feel very hot but I do not have pain. Still trying to figure out a diagnosis and plan on seeing a rheumatologist. This is me too - it is not ever what I would call painful but it is often hot and very red! I am not a physician but it looks like urticaria or contact dermatitis", "I think I have erythromelagia... This has been occurring since I was in middle school. My friends would always point out how red my toes got. And it is only in my toes. The rest of my foot is basically still a normal color. When I am in a hot area, or the summer time my toes will turn red, and then by night time they feel very hot. No pain, not sure if the hotness it is a burning sensation. Slight itching but not major. The only thing I do to cope with it is when I sleep I have a fan directly facing my feet and it helps. But my feet are either really cold, toes turn a purple color and they never get numb or tingle. or they are really hot and turn red. They are only slightly normal in the morning when I wake up. Does this sound like erythromelalgia? Yes. \n\nHow does exercise affect you? When I run, I notice the flare ups more. Especially if it is a hot summer day.", "Does this look like THEM?  -My triggers are sitting or standing for a while, working out, and of course heat. Pretty much only ever happens at night. \n-Not necessarily painful, just uncomfortable and very very warm. Also gets very itchy.\n-Happens mainly in my feet, hands, sometimes my ears and cheeks. I occasionally get it on my chest as well. \n-Stops when I elevate my feet and hands or I move to a cool area. \n-No other symptoms. \nThanks in advance!!! That looks a lot like THEM and your description is consistent with THEM.\n\nTHEM usually *hurts* though some describe it in ways like you do, warm, itchy, and uncomfortable.\n\nThe redness of THEM is often worse in the evening or when exercising - both are times that the blood vessels normally dilate which makes THEM flares worse.\n\nRedness is common in the feet, hands, ears, cheeks, nose, knees, and in slotches elsewhere.\n\nStanding is a common trigger for the feet, and to a lesser extent the hands. That is just gravity at work pulling blood down. But oddly often laying down does trigger THEM as the change of posture relaxes the blood vessels which also lets blood pool in the extremities. Thank u a ton, this is all great info! It looks like it and the things that you mentioned definitely sounds like it. I am not  sure if everyone feels the same, but mine usually does hurt, a very annoying pain, It makes me cry and I have high tolerance for pain. Nothing helps, not even elevating whatever limb is having the  flare. Ice helps a little bit but i think it is because it numbs the area. So definitely see a rheumatologist. They prescribe meds for it like gabapentin and Lyrica. :) good luck Best of luck to u as well, thanks for the reply! Bummer...sorry to say but your triggers and what helps relieve the flaring does sound a lot like THEM. \ud83e\udd7a Mine is very classic (and officially diagnosed) THEM, but I never think it *hurts.\u201d It is achy and hot and uncomfortable, but I do not seem to get the excruciating nerve pain I hear others discuss Yes, def. bring this pic to your doctor Can this happen to you in your 30? I only noticed it a month or so. Only happens when I am hot ie after workout or walking a lot in shoes etc. I cant work out why it started happening :( The only think I did out of my usual routine is take the covid vaccine\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude22 I am under 30 so yes it can happen. Regarding the vaccine, this has been happening to me well before I got it so I doubt it is related. Yours looks just like mine and I would describe it the same way: not painful, but hot and uncomfortable. I have seen folks on this thread say \"THEM HAS to be painful\" and unfortunately that is often considered a Hallmark of the triad: pain, redness, warmth. But I was diagnosed with THEM by a specialist and have not once felt pain. Just extreme heat and discomfort from the sheer amount of blood running to my hands. 29yr old male, btw. Yep, sounds exactly like mine. Yaaaaaaaaa you are fucked. Side by side that looks almost identical to some of my flares and I have diagnosed THEM. Sorry bud. For me mine spread so fast that most areas felt painful.  But not the face, hands, or ears. Those just feel like I am in an oven. I think before my flares got this bad I had a hard time imagining how anyone with THEM could experience no pain. Because all I was feeling was pain. But now it depends.", "Advice from anyone with a diagnosis Since I was around the age of 16 I have suffered from chronic pain with no diagnosis. Since the age of 16 I have had 3 hip surgeries and I have seen multiple physicians, including a neurologist but they all brush me off and tell me I am \"too young\". Around the age of 16 my knees have turned red, hot to the touch, are an aching pain and will swell. The older I have gotten (I am now 25), it now effects my feet and hands as well. Some things will trigger it, like stress or the weather and oddly enough, cold weather triggers it more than the heat. Lately I have noticed that before a flare my arms and torso will hurt even when only my shirt brushing it. I really just need some advice on how to get a correct diagnosis. I hope it does not bother anyone to ask! I just really do not know what to do. :( Sometimes my THEM is worse in cold weather too. For the first 5 years, I ONLY had symptoms in the fall/winter. You are not alone or crazy.   \n\n\nAs for getting a correct diagnosis, I can only encourage you to be assertive until someone takes you seriously. Might take 20 neurologists. Do not give up. How old are you now?  Can you make your own medical appts? Many times people with redness actually have Small Fiber neuropathy.\n\nSFN causes symptoms like the hypersensitivity on your skin.\n\nYou need to go to a teaching hospital neurologist who does skin biopsies.\n\nPrayers - My daughter has an THEM diagnosis.  Look up voltage gated sodium channels.  Information is sent into a cell through a channel where sodium ions relay messages.  If those channels are screwed up, the messages are incorrect.\n\nThere is no reason why the triggering of misfired information cannot be ignited by cold as well as hot.  It may be the stress of an extreme - regardless of what that extreme is (hot vs. cold).  It could be a change in a factor they do not know about yet (oxygen levels, blood pressure, etc) that in some people causes pandemonium in those communication channels.\n\nThey do not know.  This is a new area of research that they are just starting to understand.  Some people with THEM have a genetic defect in one of the sodium channels.  Also, not all channels are the same and not all parts of a system have the same channels.  \n\nSide note and take this for what you want....my daughters acupuncturist says her internal core is cold and she needs to get it warmer.  Drink tea.  He said it is like if you leave a body part out in extreme cold - that body part begins to feel warm but it is actually cold and the flow is slowing.\n\nShe is drinking Chinese herb tea but he mentioned ginger and cinnamon bark as warm elements and what does it cost to have a cup of tea 2 times a day?  \n\nI hope you get some relief.  Doctors really have no idea about the cause of a lot of things and no idea about how systems really work: migraines, immune diseases and voltage gated sodium channels.  They do however know a lot about shutting down a patient when they, the Dr, do not have an answer.", "Can erythromelagia flare-ups occur without pain? ", "Side effects Has anyone had any type of side effects for Mexiletine (I take 200mg) when they first started taking them?? I have been on 150mg twice a day.  No noticeable side effects.  But a definite reduction in pain! I was on mexiletine 100mg 3 times daily for six weeks and then moved up to 200mg three times daily (for the past 4 weeks). At the beginning I had a bit of heartburn but that is gone, now I get some reflux form the tablets every now and again. No major issues.\n\nUnfortunately however mexiletine has not worked as I hoped it would, no real relief. I am moving onto a lidocaine capsaicin compound cream soon.", "I think I know what caused my THEM. So the other day I had an appointment with a neurologist, and I was feeling very productive, so I decided that before the appointment I was going to request ALL of my medical records from every hospital/clinic I have ever been to. Well, I did, and after almost a week of just reading and requesting all of that, I ended up finding my first complaint. I described it as \"bulging veins when it is hot that hurt in my arms\" (I was 15). My doctor at the time dismissed everything I said and told me to drink more water. But I knew at the time that there was more to it, so I came back AGAIN, and they started treating me like a hypochondriac, so I left that practice. Luckily, they do take notes, so I was able to see the dates and what I told them. It was not a surprise to know that those complaints began only about 2 weeks after I recovered from a serious finger infection that I left untreated until my finger got swollen, very painful, and red. I was out of State without insurance and did not want to ruin my vacation. \n\nI can obviously not tell if it was the heavy duty antibiotics or the infection itself. All I know is I was really sick for over a week or so. After that, I also found out my muscle twitches, or so called fasciculations, began after the infection, and ALSO, my Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia, which also began around 2016 (the year of my infection). \n\nSo... I think, in my case, I must have developed some sort of dysautonomia after that infection. I still feel like doctors are not really listening. The only one that has kind of gotten the hints is my cardiologist who tells me I must have an autonomic issue because my heart looks fine, but it seems to overreact to the smallest amount of exercise. They still need to run more tests, and I am expecting another year until we are able to figure out what is really happening here. I have learned so much about advocating for myself when I am visiting a doctor. Visiting a doctor should not be about you sitting there listing symptoms. You have to ask lots of questions and help them out get the whole picture. They only see you for about 15 minutes and go on with their busy lives, so you kind of want to make yourself stand out and be extra helpful. I have much less stress now that I think I know what caused all of this.\n\nI just thought I should share this to see if maybe others here had similar beginnings with THEM.  I am going to make a wild guess here, you have taken an antibiotic from the family of flouroquinolones. Those antibiotics can completely wreck a nervous system. Right now the side effects are widely underreported but that has been changing.\n\nThere is a common term called flouroquinolones toxicity, it can cause autonomic issues, pain, sfn, fatigue etc.\n\nIf this is an antibiotic you took there are supplement stacks which often help minimize symptoms.\n\nErythromelalgia is one of my symptoms. However, I did suffer from some autonomic issues which have improved either because of supplements or just time from my reaction.", "THEM Flares Post-Shower Hello fellow THEM people, does anyone else get bad flares after bathing? I keep the water warm not hot, but without a doubt it always trigger a flare on my ( (sorry, not the most flattering pictures)\n\nIs there an OTC cooling lotion or something that could help cool down the burning? I get this all the time, it was what made me realise I had THEM actually. I end my showers by having the cold water on for a bit and I lie down after to try and relieve the flare-up. Mine do this too! I always assumed something about standing up for that time &amp; the shower warmth triggered all the blood to gather in my feet. Cold water at the end seems to help, so does elevating your legs right after. Definitely. Even mildly warm water in the shower sets my feet off. I try to remember to give my legs a cool rinse for a minute at the end of my shower.  Helps a bit, I think.\n\nAnd no worries about the pics. We have the least erotic set of feet and leg pics on Reddit. Oh jeez, but yeah, I get horrible flares after bathing, I fainted because of it one time I definitely do, although I definitely do not recommend ice cold showers either, it triggered a flare and more nerve pain the usual Thanks everyone, it is nice to not feel alone with this! I had thought about trying a cool rinse at the end before, but I worried it might cause a rebound flare. \n\nThe funny thing is, I did not even realized my flares looked this bad. I always KNOW they are there, but I think my subconscious avoids looking at it. Last night I looked in the mirror and was a bit shocked how extremely weird it looks. \ud83e\udd75", "I did not know there was a reddit community! I just wanted to say hi! I am very excited by this. \n\nBeing diagnosed was a huge deal for me in terms of my overall health -- I have been complaining of autoimmune issues for years with normal blood work. My doctors thought I was crazy, tried to give me the Fibromyalgia talk (I have no symptoms of Fibro, so I shut that down).\n\nI could have sworn that my erythro had been diagnosed years ago and brought it up to my Dermatologist a few weeks ago who was essentially like \"?? what are you talking about?\" It was not in my chart, apparently. When I explained, he tried to talk me down, told me it was rare, it was likely impossible for me to have it. He did it nicely, in his defense, but I was pretty firm like, no, doc, here is the deal. \n\nAgain, in his defense, when I sent him a photo, he was like, \"holy crap! that is it!\"\n\nAs many of you know, being formally diagnosed leads to a shit ton of tests. My blood tests are on the edge, but hopefully do not move any further (no blood cancers here, please!) I do not have the genetic mutations associated with primary THEM, so we knew it was secondary -- leaving us mostly with autoimmune diagnoses. Essentially, as shitty as it is, my THEM confirmed to my doctors that I am not crazy. It is sad that it had to come to that, but at least it had some benefit. My autoimmune condition is still not diagnosed, but we will get there (I type while fighting an awful bout of autoimmune-induced tonsillitis, bleh). \n\nMany hugs from me! Mine seems to be incredibly easy to trigger, as I can never identify when its going to \"activate\", I never feel a drastic temperature change, so I have always assumed mine is just super sensitive and that a fraction of a degree difference can trigger it. However, mine also seems to respond very well to NSAID's, likely due to its presumed autoimmune origin, so its far from the worst thing to happen to me, and at this stage, is more of an annoyance than anything else (I am sure many of you have it more severe). \n\nIf it is needed: ( an album of my rashes, super fun obviously, haha. The smaller rashes were just me showing the stages for my doctors, usually it consumes my full hand, I assure you (hand, upper lip, cheeks, ears and neck are my common spots -- I know, all kind of odd, but alas, it is in fact THEM, as the hand rash shows!)", "Any tips for THEM?? Hi, does anyone have any tips or literally any ways to cope.. I am 21 years old. It is so hard explaining what I am feeling to my friends and family. My flare ups started in November I have been to 6 doctors now. At first they thought I was having an allergic reaction but clearly was not that. My dermatologist did a biopsy and I have had bloodwork done so many times now everything comes back normal. Now my dermatologist is starting to diagnose me with THEM and they believe I could have Raynaud's disease also which does run in my family. That seems extremely insane or how is it even possible to have two exact opposite diseases. This has been the issue because I cannot do any type of heat but the instance I get too cold I am in insane pain as well. They are about to start me on a bunch of medications although of course unknowing if it will even help this worries me. One medication they are prescribing is Ketamine which to me scares me to be taking these if they end up not working. But of course I will do anything for this pain to stop. I have noticed I have been progressively getting worse each day it feels like. I do not know how to avoid some of the main triggers I read one is stress I am a full time student and now I am feeling zero motivation for school because once I start flaring I feel hopeless. I manage a tanning salon which feels impossible to avoid the flare ups because the heat that hits my hands the instance I start cleaning the bed. Of course I do not tan anymore nor can I even imagine ever again. My flare ups are awful in my hands and feet, ears and now my face. Also I am not sure if this is a symptom but I notice if I walk around or do \"too much\" even simple tasks I also get the itchy tingling feeling on my shoulders and back as well but not sure if that is apart of it. I have always had health issues I use to be very overweight. I believe all my problems really started after my weight loss surgery I had the gastric sleeve. So already bad enough I can barely eat a normal amount at all makes sense if I had developed this from lack of nutrition. If anyone has any tips at all please let me know I feel stuck. Not to mention will we ever get a full night of sleep again? Wow.  Sorry to hear you are having it so rough.\n\nYes, it is entirely possible to have both THEM and Raynaud's.  There are issues regulating the diameter of blood vessels in both conditions.\n\nIt is not unusual at all for bloodwork and many other tests to come back as normal for THEM patients.\n\nNot sure which ketamine preparation you have been prescribed.  My Pain Management specialist prescribed a skin cream that includes ketamine, so that is not unheard of.  What I was prescribed has to be prepared at a specialty compounding pharmacy and is rather costly.  I opted not to buy it since I got pretty good relief from other medications.\n\nOther medications that are commonly prescribed include aspirin, amitriptyline, and mexiletine.  Unfortunately there is often a trial and error process to find something that will work.\n\nAsk your doctor about taking an antihistamine that might help with the itchiness while you try to get things under control.  Maybe something over the counter like loratadine could work for you.\n\nOther things to try include:\n\n* cool (NEVER ice cold) soaks for the affected body parts\n* pointing a fan at affected body parts\n* elevate feet while sleeping\n* minimizing exposure to heat triggers, including most exercise\n\nUnfortunately you may have real difficulty continuing your job at the tanning salon unless the beds can be cooled down entirely until before cleaning.\n\nNo idea if your surgery may have trigged your THEM.  Most  THEM is considered secondary to another condition, but it is not always clear what the other condition is. \n\nAnd finally, if you can get the pain under control perhaps your appetite with return.  \n\nGood luck.  Lots of people have struggled with similar experiences. ( Count yourself lucky that they are willing to do Ketamine. You can have it compounded into a cream to put on your feet.  My kids has THEM and we keep her creams in a makeup fridge by her bed and carry them in insulated lunch bags when we go out.  So they are cool - not cold.  They just said they will add Ketamine to the compound cream.\n\nShe will have two regular over the counter creams (lidocaine and Voltaren) and two separate compound creams (one with Gabapentin and one with Ketamine).\n\nThe gabapentin cream gets put on with the lidocaine and Votaren twice a day. The Ketamine compound will be used for flairs.\n\nShe is on 900 mg of Gabapentin which is making her super drowsy.  We are going to start amitriptyline as well.  The hope is the amitriptyline will work well enough to bring down the gabapentin some.\n\nGoing to a children\u2019s pain clinic for a review next week for an inpatient program.  \n\nHang in there. Keep reaching out.  It can be isolating but you are not alone. I dont know if it will work for you but I have gotten some relief from using mentholatum on hands and feet and elevating with fans pointing at hands and feet. I tend to have the ac cranked all summer because I prefer to freeze my limbs to numbness then feel the burning. Might complicate the Reynauds though. Im so sorry your going through this. Thank you so much for all the information! I will be trying the medications and hopefully see which can work for me! I will for sure begin to elevate my feet at night. I just found a doctor today in my area who has knowledge over this so hopefully I can see her asap! Thank you! This website was very helpful! Thank you for replying I feel a little better knowing that it is a cream I did not know what to expect. I am so sorry to hear that your kid has this as well I hope she can also find the right medication also! That is a smart idea for the creams in a makeup fridge I will have to get one! I just found a doctor in my area who has knowledge of this disease so I am hoping she can help. Thank you again and I will continue to reach out. I more than ever want to spread awareness because this is terrible and I would of never have known what this even was if I had not gotten it. Best of wishes to you and your family! Thank you! I will have to look into that I have not gotten my medicines yet! I for sure will be having my ac on all summer. I feel the heat is way worse I almost rather stay frozen in pain from Reynaud's than have these flare ups! I am so sorry you are going through this to. You too!!!

Currently, they swell and turn bright red/purple without an apparent trigger. Other times I get startled in the shower when I look down and my feet/ankles look like they are on fire. Incidentally, it is not painful but very uncomfortable. With my hands, if I go on a walk they swell and I have to take off all my rings. And if I do not wear makeup, the same happens to my face. My nose turns bright red and gets big :/\n\nIn the winter I have the opposite reaction: my hands and feet turn white and spotty. It is hard to walk, and running becomes painful. Walking from my car into the gym on a winter day is enough to ruin a workout bc my feet are in agony.

She had a rheumatologist appointment in October, however was told it would be a waste of time. She was told to go online and search American medical websites and ask questions, she does not have Reddit so I thought I would jump on and ask about other people\u2019s experiences so I can pass it along.

This doctor is listed as practicing at (\n\nOne is a general practitioner who seems to have moved abroad.\n\nOne is a Family Medicine doctor who is listed as practicing at (  He seems to be around retirement age so maybe he is the one who recently retired?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou Aussies in WA need more doctors who know about THEM!!!!", "Hi everyone, I have some question. I am a 15 year old male who has had this problem for a few years now and I have finally decided to do something about it. I will explain my symptoms and how they get worse over time and hopefully some of you might be able to tell me what is going on. So for a walk after 10-15 mins my toes then my feet get slightly red and start to itch. No pain nothing and if I sit down they stop in a few mins. If I keep walking I get a slightly red splotchy rash up till about my knee. I have never noticed the leg itching but my feet always do. When I read about this disease it said it was severe pain and episodic. Mine is not episodic as i can just sit down and it will go always extremely quickly. My pain levels are no more than an itch. Also when I am in a cooled environment it takes it a bit longer to start. Thanks in advance! I get the same thing though have no diagnosis! They could be hives and you could try antihistamines. :) Thanks! I will still go to a doctor just to make sure but that is a big relief.", "Warm red blotches that appear for random reasons?

Face affects me the most as it is embarrassing and everyone can see it\n\nFace, tingles like numbness and feel burning deep in my skin, go so so hot and instantly like as soon as I step foot in a restaurant, someone is house and cars. \n\nEars, when hot but also randomly\n\nFeet and Hands, swell look like burnt skin can be really itchy they can feel as if they are throbbing and can literally turn all listed\u2026. Instantly I was diagnosed last year and I was put on antihistamines. The one I am on is called amitriptyline. Topical Creams (some are over the counter/some are expensive compound creams insurance may or may not pay for): lidocaine cream, ketamine cream, gabapentin cream, Voltaren.\n\n\nDrugs: Gabapentin, amitriptyline (that we have used and no they do not work but you got to try bc something could work for you). I would try the amitriptyline bc gabapentin makes you TIRED.  \n\n\nThe ketamine cream is the most expensive. Here it costs $230 and insurance will not cover it. Have to find a compounding pharmacy that handles ketamine.  It is totally worth it and I highly suggest having it in the summer. I also suggest getting an insulated lunch bag and keeping any creams in it and in the fridge. Keep two bottles of water in it. This keeps the cream cool and you can drink one and/or use the cold water and a towel on your face incase of flair emergency. Also pack a hand towel. \n\n\nPrescription strengthening Lidocaine cream should be covered by insurance and is great to have but does not work on big flairs or face flairs (which seem to be the worst).\n\n\nAdvice from mom of kid who is suffering. Good luck and best wishes. Thankyou so so much\u2764\ufe0f would you say you still experience any what I have listed while on treatment, really is the worst\u2026 any side effect will be better then living like this How do you get diagnosed, blood tests were fine\u2026 so last resort I can think of it this but I am 110% certain, I have lots of pics is that enough for a diagnosis and even at my last appointment my doctor saw how hot and red my face got, how is that working for you? Do you still experience anything I listed above while on the treatment? Pictures *might* be enough. I had the good luck to have a flare begin during my first appointment with a specialist doctor. Seeing that was enough to make the diagnosis.\n\nErythromelalgia is often a condition that occurs along with other medical conditions. Some of those other conditions can be very serious and show up on blood tests so the blood tests are absolutely appropriate.\n\nI was prescribed a drug called mexiletine. I was already taking gabapentin for another condition and continue to take that. Another doctor ordered lidocaine patches and those help quite a bit too. You do not think they will just rule it off because my bloods were fine do you? When I had my first appointment with him I actually had a flare too my face was really red and blotchy as it was \u2018hot\u2019 in there ans I was wearing a mask\u2026 he even wrote it down\u2026 so that is proof in itself\u2026fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc I do not want it but I need it to be something so it can be treated and this is the only thing that matches There is no blood test for erythromelalgia. Patients with THEM can have blood test results that are absolutely perfectly normal. Indeed many THEM patients have unremarkable blood test results which is a good thing!\n\nSome patients with THEM also have some kinds of blood cancers such as leukemia which would show up on a blood test as an abnormal result. Other THEM patients have autoimmune conditions and they might have some abnormalities in their blood test results.\n\nSo having normal bloods does not rule out THEM. But it is extremely important to run those blood tests since THEM can be a strong hint that something worse could be going on. There is a big difference between cure and treatment.  We have not found a cure - something that prevents flairs.  We have a few treatments that semi-work.\n\nYes, my kid still has flairs - multiple times a day.  Of everything- the ketamine cream works the best.\n\nI am trying to find a pediatric anesthesiologist to do intravenous lidocaine.  There are more aggressive treatments but it is hard to find someone to do it.\n\nAre you over 18?  Do you live in a state where marijuana is legal?  Topical marijuana and ingested marijuana has been a successful treatment for some.\n\nGood luck. If it were me, I would start with oral amitriptyline (my kid went ip to 50 mg at night) and get prescription creams.  Get the ketamine bc of your face if you can afford it and prescription lidocaine.\n\nWe are asking about the following drugs at our next Pain Management appointment: Valtrex, pot and Lyrica. &gt;amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant, not at antihistamine. Thanks so much !! Thankyou, good luck to the both of you !! It is an antidepressant but it is used in smaller doses to help with the symptoms of erythromelalgia. It is actually one of the most potent antihistamines. I took pictures of my hands, face, feet and ears as that is where it affects me and showed them to my doctor. At first she thought it was CRPS but I was not in any pain. She prescribed me with amitriptyline to see how I would get on. I had no flare ups while on them so she figured it must be erythromelalgia. I was sent to a pain specialist and I go to him every few months for check ups and blood tests. \n\nFrom what I have seen on this subreddit I do not suffer with it as bad as a lot of other people. I get a flare up maybe once a fortnight and I just take my tablets. so I do not really have any other advice only to tell you other than what I currently use. Sometimes if it is bad I splash cold water on where it is affecting me, I also have a fan to keep my face and ears cool.", "Dryness Does anybody have any recommendations to treat dry feet? My feet are insanely dry and I have been using Vaseline and seems to do nothing for me. Also does anyone find they have this as a result from THEM? Whether as a result of THEM, or SFN, or some other dysregulation of the sweat system, yeah I do have dry feet. And ankles, shins, knees, thighs, and hips. Not a drop of sweat from about my waist down in years.\n\nSo skin creams have not done much. It is impractical to keep my feet soaking 100% of the time.  Ice packs from the freezer melt and only last so long. It has been a losing battle.\n\nBut recently I stumbled across a different kind of cooling pad that seems to have as a side effect that my feet do not feel so dry when I use it.\n\nThe product is called Feet Cooler, by what seems to be a small business in the US.  Google it.\n\nIt is a fabric pad sewn in a quilted pattern. In each pocket in the pad are some little pellets of *something* that can soak up and hold onto a tremendous amount of water. Soak the pad in water and then those pellets swell making the pad sort of poofy.\n\nI can confirm that it has taken more than 2 days for the pad to dry out. The drying process has the water evaporating - and that cools things off. Not frozen. Nicely cool. I keep my resting on the pad or even wrap it around my feet a bit. And that evaporating water helps hydrate my feet.  Feels great.\n\nThen reuse the pad. Soak for 10-20 minutes. Wring out the excess water. Hang up the pad until dry to the touch. And it is ready to use.  Portable refrigeration, just add water.\n\nIt seems to be dependent on evaporation so might be less effective if your humidity level is set to soup.  But inside, in my airconditioned home and office, it works great. This is what I use\n\n My feet have been better hydrated since I started using the compound cream regularly for pain relief. Since the amitriptyline and ketamine compounds absorb through your skin in a carrier cream, it helps keep feet hydrated. It has to be made by a special compound pharmacy in the US, so it is hella expensive but I use it mostly in the hottest four months of the year when I flare the worst and then try to save money the rest of the year by using other pain relief and cooling methods. I use Vaseline, but I have realized you have to always have socks on. This helps with the dryness, but also reduced my flare ups. I Also use one of those cheese grader looking foot files (gently) everyday at the end of my shower. Then immediately apply Vaseline and then put socks on right away. Creams with urea in them may help. Vaseline is amazing for barrier protection, but often will not impart much moisture. Derms like cetraban, hydromol and the like.", "Ready to see a doctor, where to start? I have been dealing with what I think is THEM since Aug last year, and Raynauds since around 2018. I am pretty confident its THEM, and am ready to see a doctor about it. Where should I start? Neurologist, rheumatologist, immunologist, dermatologist? I do not want to waste money and time seeing a doctor who is never heard of THEM. Thanks. Please find a neurologist. Finding a doctor who has ever seen an THEM patient can be quite a challenge. THEM is rare enough that many physicians have not seen the condition.\n\nSearch out a specialist in your area who is familiar with THEM. That could be a neurologist, rheumatologist, vascular medicine doctor, dermatologist, or perhaps some other specialty. \n\nThe Erythromelalgia Association maintains a ( on their website. Search there to find a specialist in your area who is familiar with the condition. I really do not know. Cleveland told me I was too deteriorated and Mayo is trying to put together a team for me. Most doctors havnt heard of it. You are just going to have to deal with that. Pain management is where I would start. My rheumatologist did not give one shit. Mayo is as far as I know the best. But you have to get diagnosed first I second this neurologist.", "To those who get it on their face too How do you cope? What helps you? I am struggling so much", "Ketamine plus amitriptyline topical cream cured me Or at least abated 80% of my symptoms. It does not get unbearable anymore. \n\nI have been dealing with this for like 11 years and it was a really shitty process. Tried countless meds and nothing worked but this. Lidocaine patches, tons of anti-depressants, gapabentin with propranolol, lyrica, aspirin, tramadol, cortisone injections, you name it.\n\nMight be worth asking your doctor about this cream. It does not work immediately but after a week I started getting relief and now it works daily.\n\nCheers! What % are they? My daughter has 5% ketamine and it is not helping. Hi, I believe it is 2% amitriptyline and 1% ketamine, but I will check and get back to you when I can. Feel free to remind me! I am very sorry your daughter is going through this.\n\nI responded *somewhat* to oral amitriptyline, but the side effects sucked hard. Perhaps it is worth it to ask your doctors to try a cream also with amitriptyline? They just put her on oral amitriptyline. If it is not too much, what were the side effects? From the topical cream I had no sides. From oral amitriptyline I got very, very drowsy, slept like 14 hours per day, got headaches and dry mouth (probably dehydration from sleeping too much) and the usual anti-depressant sickness. *However,* I fully admit I did not take it long enough. I know most people are fine after 2 weeks or so. \n\nHas your daughter tried gabapentin or other nerve pain medication yet? It did not work for me but it works for a lot of people, and comes with the added effect of reducing anxiety.\n\nI also tried a capsaicin cream, which showed some promise (hurt a bit tho - the pain of hot food but on your skin): ( I only stopped because the ketamine cream got approved for me a few days later. This combo topical has worked well for me, too, but costs 45 dollars per 3 ounces which is crazy! Oof, sorry to hear that. I am Portuguese and I get it through the NHS. 3 100-ml bottles per month. She is on 900 mg of gabapentin a day and oral amitriptyline.\n\nI think she needs IV lidocaine next. Where is your THEM located? Curious if this would work for face. That is awesome. I am glad you can get what you need. I am currently in the US and the healthcare here is inhumane! I wish you the best. This is a terrible disease, especially for (what I take to be) a child. Hands and feet. However, the dude I first contacted with THEM had it on his face and his main treatment was the cream, which worked pretty well. He later said MSM supplements healed his symptoms, without need for the cream. I find that doubtful but maybe it is worth a shot? Good to know! I tried MSM crystals for a while and had mild success but found more relief with liquid magnesium and neuropathy supplements recently. This is such an interesting and weird condition, I hope they do further research into this! I was thinking about trying topical amitriptyline as I am having a major flare up right now! I am still trying to get myself to the right level of medication (I am on 40mg of oral amitriptyline atm it has helped tbf) but at this point my doctors are treating me like I am annoying when I go back in with pain :( I am extremely sensitive so does this cream cause any pain ? I tried going up to 50mg oral, but it made me quite unwell and I got scared and gave up after 5 days. Like I felt really panicky and tight chested, not sure if that is normal? It is normal, I felt like that on Amitriptyline. Would likely abate if you stuck with it for 2 weeks or so, but I did much prefer the topical cream (also with ketamine). And no pain at all. It takes a while to start working, but there are literally 0 sides.", "Could this be Erythromelalgia? I know this condition is hard to diagnose so nobody will be able to say for sure but does this sound like Erythromelalgia? \n\nFor years I have had the following symptoms, in an evening just before bed my hands become red, very hot and mildly painful / a burning sensation. This is temporarily relieved by elevation of the hands but starts again immediately as hands are lowered,running hands under cold water helps too. When I am led down during the night the symptoms occur and last all night. After I wake up within 30 minutes / 1 hour my hands return to normal. When I wake up I often have a headache and feel nauseous. Lying down  trigers this, it also flares up during the evening before bed, it flares up when I am really stressed. It also flares up during exercise (walking) but mainly effects my feet (more painful, red, hot). Sometimes my ears go red and hot too with this. \n\nI have added photos of the hand when it is normal vs when it is hot red and painful, unfortunately due to the lighting you cannot see the colour difference as much as in real life. \n\nI have mentioned this to drs but none of them have suggested a cause. I have frequent heart PVCs and have mentioned this to a few cardiologists as part of my symptoms but none of them seemed to know what it was. I have had two heart operations in the last few years that meant I had to lie down for a few hours awake as they operated. In both cases lying down caused my symptoms and in the first operation the staff became really concerned about my high temperature but I told them this is just what happens ever night when I lie down. In the second it happened again and they noticed it but were less concerned as I warned them it would probably happen but they did note my temperature was high. I am not sure whether this is cardiac related or not but none of my cardiologists have suggested it is, they all seem confused by it  and do not place much importance on it so I do not think it is related to that. \n\nWhilst the pain is not always that severe the burning sensation in them is quite bad. If I wake up in the night I cannot fall back to sleep I have to stand and sit up for 20-60 minutes so the symptoms ease and then lie down and try to sleep before they flare up to badly again. I am writing this post at 3:00am because i have woken up with it and now cannot sleep. Hi, I am really sorry to hear that you are experiencing this. This sounds just like my erythromelalgia, and my hands during flares look very much like yours. For me my hands are extremely affected while my feet are minimally compromised. I would not say I experience pain per se, but extreme heat, redness, and discomfort. The redness disappears upon elevation of my hands so I spend a bit of the day looking like I am praying. Worse at night is common for a lot of THEM sufferers and yes I would say stress is my biggest trigger. Well except for heat of course. \n\nI got diagnosed by a doctor found on erythromelalgia.com's site. They have a doctor locator so you can find a specialist near you (there are not many, 1-2 per state, if you are in the US) but may vary depending on where you are in the world. Once, again I am sorry to hear you are struggling with this. If it is THEM getting properly diagnosed is the first step. Also, judging by your hands you may be a younger person. I am too-- late 20's. I think the mean age of diagnosis is 60's? Anyway, it does happen to younger folks. If it is THEM a diagnosis is helpful because you can then work on getting the proper tests to determine the underlying cause. For me it is idiopathic (there is no known reason...) But rulling out certain disorders can be really beneficial. **Welcome, and kick off your shoes. Your feet have got to be killing you! Sorry, but this is going to be L-O-N-G.**\n\nLet me extend a provisional welcome to our community as it look like you have erythromelalgia. Yeah, I said it.\n\nSo pull up a chair and share some stories. Unfortunately the club house kind of sucks. No beer (alcohol makes THEM worse) but we offer a free virtual bucket of water to soak your feet.\n\nNow let me warn you that I am not a doctor. Not even close. I do have THEM and a bunch of other health conditions. So take my ramblings for what they are worth, the ramblings of some random internet guy. I also hold an undergraduate degree in genetics so sometimes go off on that stuff as it related to THEM. Go to a doctor to verify all this! (More on that later)\n\n**Let the ramblings begin. What is this Erythromelalgia stuff anyway?**\n\nThe word *erythromelalgia* is derived from Greek roots meaning *red limb pain*. THEM is characterized by redness and pain in the extremities when blood vessels dilate abnormally. Flares can be brought on by anything that causes blood vessel dilation including heat or even just the normal blood vessel dilation that happens at night before you go to bed as a response to your circadian rhythm.\n\nTHEM most often affects the feet and hands. It usually affects both sides of the body but sometimes only one foot or hand is affected in a flare. Many THEM patients also have this skin redness and burning pain in ears, cheeks, the nose, knees and sometimes the torso and shins.\n\nTHEM pain is usually described as *burning*. I describe the pain in my feet as similar to the pain of walking barefoot on hot pavement on a hot summer day. This is not a pins-and-needle feeling most of the time. THEM ***hurts***.  Media reports have called in Man on Fire Syndrome because patients can feel like they are burning.\n\nCooling the affected area can quickly make the redness and pain go away. Be careful and DO NOT USE ICE COLD WATER BATHS. Many THEM patients are diagnosed after suffering frostbite injuries after using such ice baths to ease their pain. Soaking in cool tap water is usually sufficient to temporarily ease discomfort. As you found, elevating the affected body part(s) can help as well by letting gravity help drain excess blood from the area. Unfortunately the pain and redness come back quickly after a cool water bath.\n\n**Finding a Doctor**\n\nTHEM is rare. Likely *really* rare. Anytime your health condition has an entry on the webpage for the United States' ( like erythromelalgia does then you are going to find a hard time finding a doctor who is familiar with the condition. That website notes \"The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate per 100 000 people per year in a population-based study in the US was 1.3. \"  So about 3,300 people are diagnosed with THEM in the United States each year.\n\nOne of the best resources I can direct you to is ( which has a ( with the names and contact information for doctors who are familiar with THEM.  Based upon your mention of it being around 3am at the time you posted I am guessing you are in western Europe.  On that Physician Directory you will find a link below the search box that says \"Search by Country &amp; State/Province\".  Click that if you want to search locations outside of the United States.\n\nThere are several different kinds of specialists who might be involved in treatment of THEM patients. Since you apparently have cardiac issues I would suggest looking for a cardiologist or vascular medicine doctor from that list who is near you. Neurologists and Rheumatologists also often treat THEM patients. If in the UK you might need to ask your GP for a referral to get the NHS to cover the appointment. \n\nIMHO finding *a doctor, any doctor regardless of specialty,* who is familiar with THEM is more important than which specialty they practice. There are only a couple listings of cardiologists on that list in the entire UK.\n\n**So what sort of tests might a doctor offer?**\n\nA doctor considering an THEM diagnosis should run some basic blood work. A minority of THEM patients have their THEM caused by myeloproliferative disorders. *WTF is that!?* Blood cancer. Not going to beat around the bush. But if that is what is causing your THEM you want to get that identified right away. If a myeloproliferative disorder is treated successfully then the THEM often resolves itself.\n\nSometimes an auto-immune disorder causes THEM. Much like how the immune system mistakenly attacking the pancreas can cause diabetes, the immune system attacking certain types of nerves can cause THEM. Treating an auto-immune condition can greatly reduce THEM symptoms. Because auto-immune disorders are commonly encountered in the practice Rheumatologist are likely to look to that as a possible cause and test for it.\n\nIn about 15% of cases THEM is genetic. THEM can be inherited in a *autosomal dominant* fashion meaning you can get it if either parent gave you the \"bad\" version of the SCN9a gene. Or you got really unlucky and got it from a new mutation. Genetic testing is not always considered but is more common if multiple family members have similar symptoms.\n\nAnd other sorts of tests might look for conditions commonly found in THEM patients. Neurologists often treat patients with Small Fiber Neuropathy or dysautonomia and might test for those conditions. Rheumatologists and Vascular Medicine doctors often treat patients with Ehrler's Danlos Syndrome which is sometimes found in THEM patients.\n\n**An what about treatments for the rest of us?**\n\nAh, dammit!  They always get around to asking this.  Uh....  (looking meekly) ...  it really is a somewhat scatter-shot, trial-and-error process. Sorry.\n\nSometimes something as basic as aspirin, vitamin B12, or antihistamines help. Patients have reported a variety of oral or topical prescriptions such as sodium channel blockers (mexiletine, amiloride, or lidocaine) or a topical vasoconstrictor cream with midodrine which has to be specially prepared in a compounding pharmacy. There are other things to try.\n\nThose sodium channel blockers are normally used to treat epilepsy or heart arrhythmias. Given your cardiac history, your cardiologist should *absolutely and without question* be consulted about use of such medications.  But remember, I am NOT a doctor. What do I know?\n\nThe key thing is that what works well for one THEM patient may not work for the next.\n\n**So what to do now?**\n\nMake an appointment with the doctor.\n\nDocument. Document. Document. Take pictures of flares so you can show your doctor. Take notes about what makes a flare better or worse.  Make a list of questions that you want answered. Take a friend or family member to the appointment with you to take notes and be sure all the questions you have are answered and that you understand the answers.\n\nAnd get a bigger bucket. Makes it easier to soak your feet. Thank you for the detailed response! Yeah I am 25 years old (male). Yeah I think I will definitely see one of the Drs listed on the website about this, hopefully it can be resolved or if not at least reduced a little with either medication or home remedies. Thank you so much for this detailed response it is amazing really helpful! I will try to book an appointment with a doctor from the website there are a couple not too far from me. Yeah i am from England I will probably see somebody private if I can as the wait times on the NHS for specialists are usually quite long now with Covid. \n\nThat is really interesting about auto immune conditions potentially being the cause, I saw a very good GP earlier this year before my heart operation and he wrote the following as the first step of a plan of action: \n\"1. Looking at the wider picture, with your unusual symptoms elsewhere, I wonder about an autoimmune issue. I feel it needs to be checked.\"\nI had a general blood test that seemed fine but have not done anything else, this is because we decided the next step was to see a cardiologist to have the heart operation (was 9 weeks ago). I also have chest / rib issues GP suspected possible costrochondritis or unknown cause. If I see a Rheumatologist he would be able to check my chest / rib issue and look into possible THEM / autoimmune causes so I think this is a really good idea. \n\nIt is all an odd one really, I feel happy that I have finally found something that sounds very much like what I experience even if sometimes not much can be done about it. At least I know i am not going crazy and that there are people like me out there haha. Maybe I finally have an explanation or a medical condition that can I can say to my family when they ask me \"why do you keep running your hands under cold water every five minutes?\" or friends / acquaintances who ask \"what is going on with your hands? Are you okay? Is that normal?\".", "I have been lurking for awhile since my derm suggested I could have THEM. Toes only turn red at night and it is not always both feet. Do you think it is THEM?

It was tough and go.\n\nMy set up was this, in bed:\n\n* One pedestal fan strapped to the top of the bed (I do not have ceiling fans, country girls make do)\n\n* One pedestal fan to the left side of my bed\n\n* One clip-on fan clipped to the bed on my right side.\n\n* One portable air conditioner inches away from my face on full speed to my right side\n\n* One Donjoy Iceman cold therapy device device, (think of it as an ice pack you can strap onto yourself and it is constantly filling with ice water from the tank so it lasts for hours, often used for injuries and surgery recovery) that I laid on my pillow to soothe my scalp.\n\n* One-two ice packs or bricks depending on how bad it was.\n\nThis was my set up EVERY night.

I also ordered a whole face ice mask that can also be heated up but it did not arrive until AFTER my experiment. Typical. \n\nHonestly I put the hot water bottle on the back of my head and leaned back against it on the couch and felt some IMMEDIATE relief. It boggled my mind that I was putting hot on the hot and getting... Less hot? Um, ok?\n\nAnd as painful as it was I turned off the devices that night and just tried to use heat. I steamed my face and leaned back on a hot water bottle.\n\nThe next day I woke up... Fine? Actually? Like... Perfectly fine?\n\nMy cheeks were still bright red like I had a skin condition but honestly other than that? Good.\n\nAnd it has been like that since.

But I still have a fan on my side of the bed directed at my feet and legs (so I can poke them out when I get too hot, always been like that). I have moved back to my side of the bed because I do not need the air conditioner anymore, my partner does not have to wake up to get me cool packs anymore.\n\nThat was months of extreme, 24/7 hell that was somehow soothed by a heat pack to the head.\n\nI finally understand flares because before it was, as I said, 24/7 ALL THE TIME burning without any break.

Hello! I was just diagnosed with erythromelalgia, first by a dermatologist and then confirmed by a rheumatologist. I am wondering if anyone's erythromelalgia was also accompanied by other nervous system weirdness. I have textbook erythromelalgia flare-ups on my feet, hands and face/ears, but I am also having numbness and tingling in hands, feet and face, weird sensations like cold patches or feeling like something is touching me and lots of random muscle twitches. I do have an appointment with a neurologist, but it is not for a few months. \n\nMy doctors have tested me for autoimmune diseases (lupus, RA and Sjogren's run in my family) and checked my blood counts and B12 level -- all normal.

THEM is considered a form of peripheral neuropathy, I was diagnosed with small fiber Neuropathy in addition and then after than learned that I have something called Dysautonomia which is where your autonomic nervous system is basically failing or malfunctioning.\n\nI know quite a few folks with THEM have SFN and another condition in addition, for some it is Lupus or other autoimmune problems but it could also be caused by hypothyroid. That is just what I have experienced and then observed from the THEM groups I am a part of. This is really interesting. Thanks! I have wondered a bit about general nervous system issues. I have orthostatic hypotension (I get dizzy for few seconds when I stand up) and also have a cardiovascular disease. It feels so complicated to untangle what is causing what, and what might be tied to something else. One step at a time, I guess. I am lucky to have really good doctors. That sounds like POTS, which I believe falls under the autonomic malfunction category. Do you have a neurologist? It definitely seems like it would be related! I am sorry you are having to deal with multi layer issues, I know it is not easy! As cool as bodies are, they can also be so complicated and weird when not working right! I actually just was referred to a neurologist! The multi-layer issues are tricky for sure. I alternate between being fascinated by what is going on in my body and feeling totally crazy when new symptoms pop up. I think I saw POTS mentioned somewhere and it sounded like a possibility. I am hoping the neurologist can shed some light on this! I think you will find a lot of help from a neurologist! I had symptoms for years that got over looked and then two years to get a clear THEM SFN diagnosis and after seeing a neurologist- he put all the pieces together and boom Dysautonomia. The guy I saw is a neuromuscular neurologist and I think those might be the best for the autonomic issues, they truly understand what these crazy bodies are doing haha. Hang in there and I hope you get to feeling better soon! I was just on a phone call with an THEM researcher about this very topic. (THey are looking for patients with familial history, taking surveys and blood samples, then more research later)\n\nFor Primary THEM more specifically than secondary, yes, that additional pins and needles in the hands and feet, face, ears, etc, is a suspected symptom of THEM.  There is not enough information on THEM to really say that a lot of suspected symptoms are actually symptoms.\n\nWhen I was younger I just thought I was really sensitive to Chi. The way this disease actually modifies the way your nerves communicate... I will just pretend that is still the case... ;-)  Basically your pain system is normally \"tuned down\" to avoid random noise.  THEM tunes the sensitivity towards 100%.  The same thing will happen with neuropathy, only instead of it being a genetic change its because your immune system damaged the myelin sheath around the nerves, so they are tuned up to 100% as well, just for a different reason.\n\nIn addition to the tingles, I also have interstitial cystitis, which sucks. This is another \"suspected symptom\" because of its link to pain sensitivity. There are also suspected GI symptoms, but again, more research is actually needed to push the needle from suspected to known.\n\nSome of these suspected symptoms you will find in the patients guide on (  Some of these you will only find in survey results or by actually talking to a specialist in the field.  \n\n\nDoes anyone in your family have this too? Mother, father, grandparents? I had no idea all that could go along with THEM. I am honestly not sure if mine is primary or secondary, but I am an adult who has never experienced this before four months ago! No one else (that I know of) in my family has this condition. For me, THEM started in my feet following a back injury on the heels of an unrelated surgery. It started slowly at first and only happened in the evenings, then it quickly got more aggressive and started affecting more areas of my body earlier and earlier in the day. After it really got going, I started having more issues with tingling/sharp little stabs of pain (even when not flaring), more intense dizziness when standing and some weird balance stuff. I am also extremely tired and dealing with some nausea. \n\nI have data from 23andMe and I ran it through Promethease to see if that shed any light on anything. It came back with significantly elevated risk factors for lupus/RA and Sjogrens, myloproliferative disorders and MS, so .... that all gave me a little pause! So far at least, all my bloodwork looks good. \n\nInterstitial cystitis sounds pretty miserable -- I am sorry you are dealing with that! Thanks for all the great information. That gives me hope that the neurologist will be able to help me sort my stuff out! I think the guy I am seeing is a general neurologist with a focus on neurophysiology, but he is in the neurology department at a research university in my city, so he works with all kinds of different specialists. Keeping my fingers crossed. I hope you have been hanging in there health wise! That sounds more like secondary then.  Good news is that treating the underlying issue can help relieve the THEM too.  \n\nI have not heard of promethease before, I will check that out!\n\nI hope they can figure out what is going on with ya quickly! Thanks so much! Hi, I definitely did! Like you, autoimmune ran in my family and all labs appeared to be normal, until I was tested for mold exposure. These are weird labs not commonly ordered like MMP-9, TGFB-1, etc.). I had a gene that made mold I inhaled invisible to my immune system so it could not be tagged and removed. Treating that normalized my thyroid, nerve issues, and hit the reverse button on my THEM. As an NP, I see people heal from THEM on a regular basis when this is treated. Of course, it is not the magic bullet for everyone, but I cannot help but share if it could help, because when its your root cause it is miraculous. Take it from a person who can now lay in a hot bath for 30 minutes, visit a hot spring, or stand for hours at a time with no fear of a flare. :) That is REALLY fascinating! Who ordered the tests for the mold? I honestly believe my THEM is secondary to something (based on how it popped up for the first time at age 40 and rapidly worsened) and I am worried my doctors are going to shrug their shoulders and be like, \"we tested for a bunch of stuff and nothing came back, so let us just try some medications.\" I am having so many odd issues that seem nerve related, but they come and go, which makes me feel crazy and also makes me hesitant to mention them all to my doctor. I am glad you got your issue sorted! I am hoping I can once again enjoy a leisurely visit to a sauna someday! I definitely think that my genetics loaded me for THEM but the mold exposure pulled the trigger. I have seen this to be the case for many people I work with. It was Dr. Margaret DiTulio of Regenix that treated my mold exposure. I write a great deal on my website \"Untamed Iona\" about figuring out the root cause (officially termed Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome or \"CIRS\" for short) if you would like to read more. I definitely think when we identify a the root cause driving our THEM, we can reverse it! :) Are you taking any medication to help your THEM and SFN now that you have a diagnosis?  I will be asking my neurologist. I already have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobility subtype) ... Have not been formally tested yet for POTS or MCAS yet but I do have some autonomic issues and mast cell issues, based on symptoms alone. Oh wow, my doctor believes I have Hypermobile EDS too! I have met so many people recently that have the same things I do. It seems like these kind of all go together. \n\nSo far what I have been taking that has helped me is liquid magensium ( blue bonnet brand) Alpha Lipoic Acid 500mg 1xday, Quecertin 600mg 1xday, a b vitamin without b6 that has zinc and biotin. I also incorporate low dose aspirin and vitamin c sometimes. I have been on this assortment for about 5 months and it is continued to get better the longer I have been on them although within the first three days of being on ALA I could tell something was different and my flares lessened in frequency and intensity and have just gotten better and better since then. I hope that these things can help you too! Wow I am so glad the supplements are helping the symptoms. I do not see my neuro until early July, but I will keep these supps in mind. I do take zinc and quercetin (but only 150mg... Maybe i will bump it up). I have been reading about ALA ... Good to hear it is working! Absolutely, my neuro told me that ALA is the number one thing he gives his neuropathy patients so I was super excited to try it and have it work so well.", "Anyone flare almost everyone they sleep I have to take naps several times a day, something medical is going on I do not know about abs I am just so tired all the time\u2026 deffo think and aware of them but I have other problems going on too!! So I can nap for 2 hours and wake up burning hot and throbbing, always the face but also hands and/or feet will react the same too. I do not know why it is when I sleep, I have purposely tried leaving windows open, having less on, having no blankets etc and no matter what it still just happens \n\nAnyone else ? I seriously hate having to go to sleep now Laying down and sleeping are each common triggers for THEM flares. Many THEM patients experience much of what you do.\n\nWhen you are upright your body signals the blood vessels in your legs to constrict a bit to help force blood up to your torso and brain, all fighting the pull of gravity.\n\nWhen you lay down your body no longer has to fight gravity so much and it signals your blood vessels to relax a bit and dilate.  \n\nSince THEM involves an abnormal dilation of blood vessels this extra dilation when laying down tends to make THEM worse.\n\nIt sounds like you are trying several things focused around cooling off that are not working for you.  A couple more things you might try are fans and cooling pads.\n\nPointing a fan at your face can sometimes feel uncomfortable on your eyes.  If it is for you you might try a lightweight sleep mask.  You are trying to get the benefit of cooling from a fan without drying out your eyes. But a sleep mask can act as an insulator trapping heat. So it is a sort of trial and error thing, as is so much in THEM treatment.\n\nOtherwise pointing a fan at the feet might help. Or pointing it at your torso, even if you do not flare there, might help. Cooling the torso can slightly cool your core body temperature. This tricks your body into  constricting blood vessels in your extremities in order to redirect warm blood to your torso. That can help ease flares in your hands and feet. Worth a try, IMHO.\n\nAnd cooling pads might help. Ice packs do not last long and can be too cold, risking skin damage from freezing temperatures. I use the cooling pad from ( and is it cool without being freezing and can last a few days. (I am a customer of theirs and have no other affiliation. I do NOT get a commission from them.)\n\nAnd then there are medical options. Talk with your doctor. Lidocaine patches are available over the counter and can be helpful in relieving pain, even it if does not reduce the blood vessel dilation. Some patients respond to various prescription and/or over the counter medications. That is a good idea actually!! For angling at the torsoe, I used to do it at my face but it would make it worse for some reason, toreso should work \n\nWill have a good read into all Thankyou!!! Yes. There is some more pricy options for this like eight sleep and bedjet. I know that price takes a big hit but I wanted to let you know they exist. Thankyou for this !! No problem! My them causes havoc to my sleep too. If I find any more tools or tricks I will let you know. Thankyou so much!! It is the worst is not it\u2026 effects you doing the most vital things\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Completely! And sometimes it is hard explaining to doctors that it is not always just the pain. Sometimes it is the feeling like I am standing in front of an oven that is just been opened. So it is not just a matter of \u201ctake more painmeds\u201d. Yeah and it happens when you do absolutely nothing and avoid everything, you can god imagine if you step out of that what happens", "Spots on knees? Erythromelalgia or something else...? (Same splotches on both knees. Feel very red and typical rash-like look.) ", "Joint problems? Hands are red &amp; hot but feels different to THEM flares, is specific to joints &amp; no obvious trigger (but happens more at night). Doctors assuming it is part of THEM - does THEM come with morning stiffness, joint aches and inflammation specifically to joints? Only recently diagnosed  I get this occasionally but my rheumatologist thinks it is more autoimmune related than THEM related. If this is occuring frequently, it might be worth trying to get in to see a rheumatologist, even if it is a several month-long wait. And if you have a primary care doctor, they can order some of the blood work to start the process of seeing if you have any underlying reason for this joint inflammation. GP ran some basic autoimmune blood tests before diagnosing THEM, but I do not know what specific tests she ran and when they came back negative she pretty much lost interest in my joint symptoms. She asked rheumatology about it and they said they were not sure if joint symptoms were part of THEM - presumably they are not that familiar with it but I could not find anything anywhere about joint symptoms with THEM except in the case of comorbid conditions. I will try bringing it up with my GP, see if she will refer me anywhere to be sure Rheumatoid althritis can cause THEM. Ask a rheumatologist about testing ur blood for rheumatoids been tested twice now and all normal. frustrating but I have a rheumatology appointment in February to discuss symptoms so fingers crossed", "Does this sound like THEM? For several months I have had flare-ups of sore, irritated, burning, red skin.\n\nIt affects the tops of my feet most obviously - they get red and sore every day, especially after a shower.\n\nThe other areas are my perineum, perianal, left buttock, genitals, back of my neck, face and forehead, and my tongue. My hands are not affected.\n\nThis is what my feet look like:\n\n(\n\nI have seen a dermatologist and all of my blood tests have been fine. He does not know what it is.\n\nSometimes it is sore without being red. Nothing is itchy at all.\n\nI have never heard of THEM affecting the tongue, but mine is often sore and burning.\n\nI have tried aspirin which does not help.\n\nI have no family history of THEM.\n\nDoes this sound like THEM? I am going crazy not knowing what it could be or how to treat it. THEM is more often seen first on hands, feet, ears and face. Those are the top from my own medical research. In your situation I am wondering if it is more of a mast cell activation issue. Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, or Disease.  I say this because mast cells can trigger rash/red flares all around the body, and often can be triggered my heat. The red feet after showers is common with MCAS. Back of neck could be if you are hot/sweating. Do you wear hats or have longer hair?  The genital and butt could also be heat ... Especially if you are not wearing 100% cotton or breathable fabric underwear, or do activities in hot environments and do not change underwear (ex. Keep same underwear on after a workout, or after mowing the lawn on a hot day). \n\nMast cells can be quiet and behave, until a life event triggers them to go wonky and overreact to many seemingly harmless things. There is a couple mast cell or MCAS subs on here.\n\nJust my thoughts. I have heat-induced mast cell rashes/flares, which is separate from THEM (though you can have both). Thanks for your comments. I have never heard of this mast cell condition before so I will look into it.", "My wife has been experiencing a burning sensation in her hands/ears/cheeks for two months. Does this look like THEM?  That is exactly what mine looks like during a flare. Thank you for sharing that! Honestly, my wife is relieved to hear that she might be on the right path to discover what might could be the cause of her pain. Yes, this looks like THEM. poor thing! It does look like THEM.\n\nFor at home test you can try immersing her hands in cool (tap water, or slightly cooler) water to see if the redness and pain go away.  Immerse in warm (NOT hot) water to see if the redness and pain come back. If the redness and pain come with heat and go away with cooling then THEM is more likely.\n\nGood luck getting her in front of a doctor familiar with THEM. Take lots of photos to the appointment in case she does not have a flare in front of the doc. Thank you! We can give that a try! We have seen some quick flair ups from the warm bath water when she bathes our kids. Just acknowledging that it could be THEM is helping her a lot. The doctors have not been very helpful thus far. looks exactly like mine.  Docs will need to rule out mimics, but this definitely fits the profile.  \n\n\nIn addition to the other suggestions on this thread, I would also suggest checking out the patient guide and survey results on ( .  The guide can be useful for docs, as well as patients, and can help her find peace of mind with the mystery symptoms that do not really show up in other publications (that I have seen).    \n\n\nIn terms of docs, I have had the most luck with a rheumatologist, as they see this often enough as a secondary symptom to lupus. They will also be involved in ruling out mimics and trying to identify why she has THEM in the first place. However, its a neurologist that actually treats THEM, as its a neurovascular disorder.   \nGood luck! Thank you so much! You are comment is very helpful and encouraging to know we might be on the right path. Much appreciated! My ear has been on fire for over a month, non stop. It is horrifying \n\n\n My ears do that!  Maybe 1-2x week for years. Actually red ears were my first body part, now it is spread to hands/feet with daily flares every evening. The ears still only 1-2x week. How do you treat this? My burning is 24 hours a day. It is been nonstop for almost 3 weeks. It is completely disable let me I have not been able to go to work Oh no, I am so sorry to hear  ... Yours sounds more severe. Rheumatologist, neurologist or dermatologist are all options to check out and see if they can evaluate you for it -- according to others on this subreddit. I am not formally diagnosed yet but I see my neuro again next month, so I will be asking. Is she in any medications?\n\nDouble check all of them. Make sure she is not reacting to one. Even one she may have been in awhile", "After about a month of being constantly exhausted I stopped taking my Gabapentin. Oh well, back to 2-3 30 minute flares a day for now :(  I had to stop gabapentin a few months ago as well. It made me an absolute zombie. I am sorry you are back to flares, but I hope you feel a little more human now. :) It makes me feel better knowing someone else was dealing with the same thing. For a while there I could barely make it through the day without going back to bed and I had no idea why. Hope things are getting better for you now as well :) That is a horrible decision.. fatigue or flares. That is awful :( You do get used to it as you build tolerance over (maybe a really long) time. Have you asked your doctor about trying Mexiletine or other non sedating therapies? Yeah, I just upped my dose of gabapentin.  And have times I just cannot stay alert. Nothing about Mexiletine specifically but I have an in-person visit with a new specialist (we are relatively early in the treatment process) so hopefully they can give me something that works. Not sure if anyone had suggested taking it just before bed, instead of throughout the day? Everyone reacts differently I just wanted to be another voice saying that the fatigue and flulike ache do pass/diminish. It took me about 6 weeks to not need to take a nap after every dose.   \nStarted at 900 mg/day. Now I take 2100 mg/day without fatigue due to gabapentin.    \n\n\nThis is not to say that this is the best treatment for you. I hope you will find something that works better for you. Only suggesting that if gabapentin is working for your THEM pain, it might be worthwhile to give it a bit longer for the fatigue to improve. Thank you for the input. I was going to dismiss Gabapentin all together but i will keep it in mind if other options do not work out. I have heard how inconsistent treatment can be patient to patient. Those side effects definitely passed for me after a few months. Now I am on 3200mg a day and it does not make me drowsy at all.  But agree with other commenters - everyone is different and it is a process of figuring out what works.", "Officially Diagnosed Hey all, I posted here a little while ago. This past week, I saw my PCP and showed him some pictures/notes that I had taken of my flare ups. I let him know about the multiple people in my family with MS and Lupus, and as I made my case, I was not sure that he was going to take it seriously.\n\nSo, I was surprised that he already knew about the condition and was confident to diagnose me right away. He also let me know there was not much to be done about it besides pain management.\n\nIt is bittersweet. I am glad to have been diagnosed, but it is hitting me suddenly how much this affects my life. I have stopped playing guitar because it hurts too much, and my plans to take up archery may not pan out. I guess I just wanted to share about a diagnosis victory and the following disappointment. \n\nAs an aside, has anyone worn gloves to help hand flare ups? There is a lot of talk on forums about footwear, but my hands are more often affected than my feet. Gloves make my flare ups worse generally. I keep some gel ice pack gloves in the refrigerator though, not the freezer, for bad hands flares. I also do things like play video games with my hands resting on a laptop cooler. Following this.  My hands are much more affected than my feet so I was trying to see if there were some gloves +/- cooling that were out there.  I found these mitt-like chemo cooling gloves but have not purchased.  I raise my hands in the air to help quickly dissipate the red &amp; burning but that gets tiring.  I have a PVA Chillpal cooling towel which is wonderful and a little mister.\n\nHoping you can get back to doing the things you love.  Pacing has helped me get back to my daily activities I love but caused major hand flares.  Knowing &amp; accepting my limits has greatly helped. Honestly, when I cool my flaring hands and feet with cooling mitts or cold water, it makes them feel so much better at first, but when they finally warm up again, the pain is SO MUCH WORSE than it was initially. If I put my flaring hands or feet in super warm to hot water, it makes them flare really, really, really hard for a few minutes, but if I grit my teeth and keep them there, they start to normalize; then I get several hours to days of relief from the heat, pain and swelling. YMMV, but this is my best avenue of relief, and nothing else comes close. I can wear regular shoes again and rings and play bass again and everything! Even my doctor was surprised when I did not request any more refills of my lidocaine patches and voltarin gel. It is been consistently working for about a year and a half now. I also have lupus and a host of other AI issues, so being able to cut out some prescriptions was a relief as well. Interesting!  This sounds like a desensitization therapy like done in OT for pain syndromes.  How long do you leave your hands in the warm/hot water? Maybe 5, 10 minutes? It really depends, the more frequently I do it, the shorter my times get. I also have Raynauds, so cooling the erythromelalgia was causing rebound issues. I love hot baths, and had resorted to taking them with my hands and feet out of the water for a long time. Then I finally said \u201cf it, it cannot hurt any worse\u201d, and put my hands and feet in the bath, gritted my teeth while they turned purple, then black, then red, and was astonished when the pain and discoloration slowly dissolved away. That was the first night I would slept well since the THEM started. So of course I do it every night now, and only flare hard once in a while anymore. So you just kind of made up your own protocol based on trial and error it sounds like ? I have heard so many people suggest the official Bob's protocol, but I have always been nervous it will make me worse because injury and then the subsequent heat and inflammation of swelling has caused my THEM to spread to my knees. \n\nSo I am concerned that further heat input might make me worse. I have Raynauds and UCTD (undifferentiated connective tissue diseas) that most closely resembles lupus. I also have POTs. At this point, I am not sure what is causing what...sort of a chicken and the egg scenario. I just know my THEM spreads, even to my hands, ears, knees, face and torso. Sounds along the line of what is dubbed Bob's Protocol. Google it.  Not developed by a doctor but it follows a pain desensitization approach of using warm to hot water baths. Welcome to the family !?  \ud83d\ude2a\n\nThe diagnosis is a starting point. Now you start to explore treatment options with your doctor to better manage your pain.\n\nAnd now you can avoid triggers to help limit flares. It *really* gets better when you understand the process and are not having flare ups seemingly at random and do not know what is causing it.\n\nAnd gloves?  I would be wary.  I have involvement in one hand but it is more redness (ok, purpleness really) but not so much pain. My feet *burn* and I cannot tolerate socks and shoes for long.  I imagine that gloves for you would be more painful than anything. &gt; while they turned purple, then black, then red\n\nholy shit dude. \n\ni have the same cyclic raynauds/THEM and...the black color you are describing is scary. was it like the fire-hot dark/deep red (when you press on it it does not even really change white; just stays fuckin' hot, red, and angry). i think a hospital trip would be in order for me if i saw black...but it is interesting that it was purple at first. when my hands are purple-y (my skin tone is pale white), they are usually super cold. i can get a weird warm purple/red that is like a transitional color/temp when i get into a warm/hot shower if my hands are cold, but that usually resolves into a uniform red in the shower.\n\nif you are comfortable, can you post more about your THEM history and this method you are doing? call me starship troopers, cuz i would like to know more.", "I began experiencing symptoms that aline exactly with them after taking medication called Xyrem for narcolepsy, and it does not go away when I stop taking it. Is it reasonable to think that the medication could have triggered them, or could it have been something else? And is there anything I can do about it? It flares up when I am even remotely warm or do any sort of physical activity. It happens in my hands, feet, knees, cheeks, and ears. Very interesting.\n\nI have narcolepsy too, but have never taken xyrem. \n\nHowever, I have always been convinced there is a connection between the two disorders  I am not sure about a reaction, but Erythromelalgia can be linked to fatigue problems, especially if you get face flares.  My docs have not been able to nail down if its chronic fatigue or narcolepsy in particular. apparently secondary them can be caused by some autoimmune disorders, and there is increasing evidence that narcolepsy is autoimmune so that would make sense tbh Oh that is interesting, I had no idea! Good luck! Autoimmune can be rough Huh, interesting. I took Xyrem years ago (I do not have narcolepsy, \u201cjust\u201d horrible insomnia) but had developed neuropathy before then.\n\nAnd then my THEM is secondary to small fiber neuropathy.\n\nMy sibling has fibro and narcolepsy and takes Xyrem, but does not have any THEM symptoms. Well, I think it is more than that. I think it is specifically related to body temp and body temp control. One made the other go haywire.\n\nPeople with narcolepsy are less able to keep their bodies cool at night, which might lead to the blood vessels dilating to desperately try to cool. Or vice versa: the inability to cool off is disrupting my sleep to the point of disorder (and making me fall asleep during the day). However, I believe the narcolepsy preceded the THEM. I am not 100% sure though, because I was not diagnosed either right away Can we chat narcolepsy for a second?\n\nI have a lot of sleep disruptions, overwhelming exhaustion during the day (especially if I am not working) and before I fall asleep I always hear (usually) my name being called.. Sometimes faint and sometimes very clear. When I fall asleep during the day, it is impossible for me to get up... So I fight through it a lot with emotional outcomes... \n\nShould this be something I bring to my doctor? It is been something I have felt/experienced since probably my teens but always thought of it to be anxiety/hormones.. Is this similar to your experiences?\n\nI have idiopathic them and if these two are related... They could be connected. Only time I have ever gotten a solid genuine regular sleep is from sedatives like Seroquel and prescribed sleep aids... Sounds like my battle with fatigue attacks Because there is something more going on and I need to figure it out...\n\nMaybe I will bring more of it up with my doctor... You definitely should.  They might not be able to do much about it, but its important that they know what you are dealing with That would exactly it. And also I will know what I am facing, how to manager triggers and flares better and make things more stable. It is all I want for my health right now. yeah that sounds like narcolepsy, I would definitely say to talk to your doctor about it and potentially get some diagnosis tests done. even if it does not turn out to be narcolepsy, it is good to rule things out! Yes for sure! Like I just took my second nap of the day. And then tonight it is going to be difficult to fall/stay asleep and shit...\n\nWhat is the difference between insomnia and narcolepsy? Narcolepsy and them club checking in. It does indeed seem like a lot of us for such independently rare conditions. Sorry for the *very* late reply! I am no expert, but from my limited knowledge, insomnia is characterized by a difficulty falling asleep, while narcolepsy usually manifests as cataplexy, sleep attacks, or excessive daytime sleepiness, mostly caused from the brain going directly into rem sleep rather than going through all the stages and getting healthy restorative sleep.", "Diagnosed today with prumary THEM, I have burning pain, needle like pain, and the painful feleling that Im using shoes way too tight since august.

If so, how was the experience after first and second shot? Thank you!  I am in the Johnson &amp; Johnson trial  I got a shot back in November.  (It is a vaccine that requires only one shot.) Not sure if it was the real vaccine or the placebo. I had absolutely no reaction. No change in my THEM. I have now received both Moderna vaccines. No effects after the first shot except a sore arm. After the second shot, I got chills, vomiting, aches, dizziness from 12 hours after shot to 30 hours after shot. I did not really have trouble with THEM but the chills meant I had to cover up and bundle up a lot more than normal which was not bad until my chills started to go away and then being all bundled up caused some THEM flaring more than normal. But no lingering effects on THEM. Exactly what I went through with the 2nd Moderna shot. The chills were a kind of break from the burning, in a way. The aches were really bad though so I could not enjoy it How did you get the trial if you do not mind sharing and what state you are in? In the early stage of vaccine trials the FDA had a website up for interested persons to register to be contacted for a vaccine trial.  I think that was a list any of the vaccine studies could tap to recruit trial participants.  \n\nSo it was simple enough. I filled out the online form and waited. Eventually I got a call and was at the clinic the very next day.  Was there several hours with a TON of paperwork, medical history, and such.  And I got the injection that same day. As far as I know the J&amp;J trial is not recruiting additional participants.\n\nAs a part of the trial I downloaded an app to my cell phone and check in if I have any symptoms that might be COVID related (none so far), and otherwise twice a week to report I have had no symptoms.\n\nI am in South Carolina. Thanks for your reply. The second shot sounds truly nasty but as my friend who is a nurse says, \u201cBetter than being on a ventilator!\u201d \ud83d\ude33 I am concerned for my teen daughter with erythromelagia.... early in her childhood her pediatrician mistakenly gave her TWO vaccines when he should have given one. A month later she had a condition called HSP- broken blood vessels/bruises all over legs and arms. It resolved itself but now as a teen she has mild erythromelagia. I cannot help but think it is related. So I am nervous for her to get the Covid shot. That said, the dr agrees that getting Covid would be worse.... Wow! I hope it was the actual vaccine and you are now safe! Thanks for your reply and for volunteering to be in the trial. \ud83c\udf1f Wow...I am so sorry that happened to your daughter and that she now deals with THEM. I do think your doctor is right. COVID would be much worse on THEM in the long term, and could be potentially debilitating and even fatal compared to mild symptoms for 12-24 hours due to the vaccine. My Rheumatologist said that it was not going to cause any worsening of my THEM and I have had zero lingering effects from the 12 hours of chills and fever feeling I had. Everyone has to make their own informed decision, but for me it was a piece of mind to get vaccinated. I think weeks of fever and potentially long-term health issues from COVID would be much more worse on me and my THEM. Thank you so much for your kind reply!!!! I just read it. I am so glad the vaccine did no further harm to your THEM! And now you will be protected. Covid is so dangerous and complex of an ailment. We are in the U.S. and although I have decided to have my daughter vaccinated, scheduling a vaccine here is extremely challenging. As she is 17 she can only receive Pfizer by law- but if it keeps being impossible to nail down, she will be 17 and be able to get Moderna. \n\nI hope your THEM remains mild and manageable going forward. This is the only social media group I have found for THEM. My daughter sees a rheumatologist periodically (and had one visit with a neurologist who had to look up THEM before our visit!). It is a rare one alright. Again, many thanks an stay safe!", "Anyone else have no pain, only intense heat? (Diagnosed, NZ) Hey all, I have just been given a working diagnosis of THEM. All the symptoms match \u2014 except for a lack of burning pain. It is very uncomfortable, extremely hot and swollen feeling during a flare, making it hard to use my hands, but I would not call it *pain*. It feels like having my hands inside an oven, not on an element, if that makes sense. Just wondering what the future holds for me right now really. \n\n**Does anyone else have mild/no pain symptoms, or started with no pain and had it develop later?**\n\nAlso would love to hear from anyone with THEM from New Zealand (or Australia) \u263a\ufe0f Yes, mine is more of just burning rather than traditional pain. \n\nI am in the US I am not officially diagnosed, but mine is mostly without pain. Symptom onset is hot burning sensation although my skin feels normal temperature to the touch. Along with uncomfortable tight feeling, mild swelling. Me too!!! Does it happen at night? Yes it is primarily at night Canadian here. Just got diagnosed in August after 1yr3months of searching for answers. I am about the same, symptom-wise, as you.   \n\n\nIt started in my knees in May 2019, then moved to my feet in January 2020, and I occasionally feel very mild tingling as part of my symptoms now too. Seems to be progressing, but so far it is more hot and annoying than painful.", "Hives or other skin oddities I am currently in the \"we dont know what the f this is\" stage of diagnosis and primary THEM seems like the best fit to me right now.  I was wondering if THEM can be preceded by hives?  Not necessarily in the same day but like, a year or two before everything turns into fire. They essentially went away as my skin transformed into fireskin. From scalp, to eyes, to torso, to toes.  (Started with feet when I was a youngling).  So far they have ruled out.... everything... and have no idea what is happening.  Ice been to dermatologists, rheumatologists, allergists, and beyond lol.  I have an appointment tomorrow with the dermatologist to discuss referring to neurology.\n\nThe fireskin is literally hell on earth. Sometimes I am like cyclops with smoke just rising from my eyes, sometimes I am full Johnny storm. A fire elemental that just happens to be human lol.\n\nRing any bells for yall? I can certainly understand how primary THEM *might* be confused for hives.  I cannot really think of why true actual hives would somehow transform into THEM.\n\nNot saying this could not be THEM, but I have not heard of very many THEM patients experiencing significant flaring on their torso.  And I do not usually hear of a generalized scalp involvement - THEM tends to be more specifically around the ears, nose, and cheeks if it affects the patient's head.\n\nBut, at least in some cases, THEM can be secondary to an auto-immune issue. And hives can be too, something called uticaria. If this is the case you *might* have an elevated ANA level on a blood test.  This is just speculation and I am not a doctor! \n\nTake note of what, if anything, leads to a flare for you. And what, if anything, relieves the pain of a flare. In THEM usually heat and/or exercise brings on a flare and cooling the affected areas (say by running them under cool tap water) relieves the pain AND redness.\n\nGood luck with the medical appointment. Negative ana, negative on so... so... many tests lol\n\nThanks for the feedback!\n\nHeat is absolutely a trigger.  Anything above 68-70 and my skin is on fire.  Cooling definitely helps. As does raising my legs.  Exercise is also a trigger.  I have to have a fan on me when I am doing even the most basic stuff.\n\nIts constant (multiple times a day, sometimes just all day)\n\nDrowsy antihistamines help, dont know about non drowsy kind yet.  Brings the fire from a 10 to like a 4. When it is a 10, it is insane how much it burns and hurts.\n\nIt is on my cheeks, neck and ears too, it just  also seems to go up scalp. It definitely reacts to pressure. Like leaning against a hard thing will set off my scalp.  Sunshine is a trigger too.  Etc.\n\nIt started in my feet as a kid.  Also shoulders.  If I take a hot shower or get overheated in general, my shoulders will form petechiae.  \n\nIt went to face and neck, hands arms, and lower legs a few years ago. About when the mystery rashes started. Multiple biopsies, multiple theories, nothing definitive.  Prednisone treated hives but did nothing for the full body fire.  Last year it spread to torso and from what I can tell, inside of my throat (reaction to hot drinks)\n\nI get vasospasms in my fingertips.\nMy neck will turn red and burn like crazy and you can see my blood vessels almost glowing with rage in the neck splotch.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, mom has fireskin all over in normal THEM pattern (no torso or scalp like above), dad has it on his feet. If I may ask, how would primary THEM be mistaken for hives?  Does it come with lumps or nodules or spots? Mostly it is that both conditions have redness that comes and goes. Hives usually responds to antihistamines and THEM does too in some patients. THEM can be in splotches \n\nTHEM is MUCH rarer, so a doctor who sees such redness that responds to antihistamines may presume hives and discount any pain as something spurious. I will post a fuller reply in a while. \n\nBut do either of your biological parents have similar symptoms,  even if not as severe?  And when you have vasospasms in your fingertips do they ever turn pale white and feel cold? I have been for about 3-15 years now.  Dermatologist says I am a medical unicorn lol.\n\nStarted seeing docs 15 years ago due to severe pain in feet and difficulty walking and especially standing.  Puffy and red.  No diagnosis.  Thanks to ACA, I was able to start seeing specialists when disease went from inconvenient to full blown mystery lol. Mom and her mother are like 100% matches for me.  Dad only has the burning in his feet.  Dermatologist thinks I have raynauds as well, but sometimes I have to walk barefoot in the winter to deal with the burning heat in my feet.\n\nVasospasms are sharp, but red and warm. Not cold. I am putting together a shared photo album on google for people.  Back in a couple hours. Ok.  If mom and grandma both have similar symptoms then you need to be presumed to have hereditary primary THEM. That is caused by a mutation to the SCN9A gene. Your family history is consistent with the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern for hereditary THEM. \n\nIf your doctor runs a genetic test and you are positive for a mutation to that gene then there are research labs that would appreciate you donating a blood sample to assist their research. They would appreciate samples from mom and grandma too.\n\nWith your dad having burning in his feet too he could be so unfortunate to need evaluation as well.\n\nRaynaud's often occurs in THEM patients,  but if you do not experience episodes of pale white fingers that seems less likely.\n\nYou are indeed a medical unicorn. Or to twist a cliche, the doctors have been looking at all the horses for years. It is time to think about zebras. Photo album:  all my docs have seen.\n\n Unfortunately the research hospital I am going to doesnt have a gene test for this disease lol.\n\nAny recommendations for a lab to reach out to post diagnosis where I can donate my blood to science?  ( New Haven, CT  is listed as recruiting for inherited THEM studies.\n\n They are interested in families where two or more generations have THEM.  They probably would accept blood samples if you qualify. Apparently my dermatologist worked alongside a PEM specialist. I now have a diagnosis!!  \n\nThank you for your feedback!! Excellent! Must feel like a weight off your shoulders. Just having a doctor say \"Yes, I know what that is. It is real and not something you are imagining.\" can be a relief.\n\nNow another part of your journey begins. Hopefully you can find a treatment that is effective for you! It definitely is.  I have had so many bad experiences with so many docs.  From \"this longhair is just looking for pain meds or is trying to get his cannabis card\" to \"are you sure you are not just drinking too much coffee\" to \"specialists will not see you because your blood tests are normal\" \n\nNeurologist - touches foot with probe.  \"Can you feel that?\" Me:\"yes\", neurologist: \"then your nerves are fine.\" End of appointment. Do you ever get the hives after walking or exercising outside\u2014particularly if it is a warm day, but maybe a breeze? In addition to THEM, I have cold-induced urticaria which seems to be brought on by changes in temperature to my skin. Sometimes it is so bad that it can be hard to breathe. Taking a daily antihistamine GREATLY helps keep the hives from happening. But do not miss a day! And keep Benadryl liquid caps with you!", "These are really good to use as they stay cool!  How many times can you reuse them? And do they really stay cool for two hours?  I have cold socks and my hot feet can cool them off quickly.

", "PROPRANOLOL Hi there, just thought I would let this group know that ive finally found something that works for me.....Propranolol. \n\nI only take it when I need it for my anxiety as it makes my psoriasis worse (it is a betablocker) but thought I would drop this here. It comes back as soon as the propranolol wears off which sucks but you can use it long term. :) \n\nHope you all find something that works for you and maybe give this a go!

Guessing you have tried aspirin? not old enough to be prescribed it (: It is actually dangerous to take that if you have low blood pressure along with THEM. It is an amazing thing, it fixes my anxiety, but made me pass out and break my foot because I had no blood anywhere in my body. I have low blood pressure too. So annoying how we have to choose between things. The redness makes me even more anxious too so it is like a cycle. Guessing you have not found anything that works? Not really, I am not saying to stop taking Propranolol if it works! I meant, be cautious with it, and check your blood pressure. Hey, I know this comment is two months old, but I was just put on propranolol for migraines two weeks ago and then today I just had my first THEM flair in three or four years! I had spontaneously gone into remission with it so I guess it spontaneously could have come back, but now your comment makes me wonder if maybe it was not. \n\nHow did propranolol make things worse for you? And did it get better after you came off of it? pre-propranolol I would get flare-ups when I exercised, when I was cooking, and when I showered, as well as random bouts of it throughout the day.\nwhen I was taking propranolol, it was near enough all the time. I could not really sleep, standing was painful and my hands were incredibly painful to do much with. propranolol was also significantly slowing my heart down to the point where I thought it was a concern.\nafter I stopped propranolol, it pretty much returned to the usual quite quickly.\nnow I take amitriptyline for THEM and it mostly gets rid of the random flare-ups, though it has some rather bad side effects for me so when I turn 18 I will be hopefully trying new medications (: \n\nhere is my theory on it:\nI think the reason propranolol works for some and not others is that erythromelalgia can be for a few different reasons. for some, it is because the blood vessels are narrowed or widened in the wrong places so you generally just have too much blood flow to the extremities, and for others the blood specifically has too much flow to the blood vessels closer to the skin (which control temperature) rather than the deeper down ones (which pass nutrients around the body through capillaries). so the body goes \"whoa, the nutrients is not getting to the hands and feet\" and sends more and more blood just to get the nutrients there, resulting in the temperature increase. it can also be due to an increase in a certain type of blood cell.\nso, because of all this, propranolol, which slows down the heart, may not actually help all the different reasons that cause THEM - restricting blood flow is not going to help if ultimately your body is going to want more blood for nutrients' sake. I appreciate this is very waffly explanation from a very non-professional perspective, at 5am \ud83d\ude05 hope this helps. Thanks! My heart rate is already high, so we thought propranolol would be great for migraines. Did not even occur to me it could make this worse. Unfortunately, nortriptyline raised my heart rate crazy high (my currently high heart rate is still an after affect from that years later) so that class of drugs is off the table for me. I will definitely bring this up with my neurologist and rheumatologist at my appointments next month. Cause its been working great for migraines but I really want to go back into remission with the THEM. yeah that makes sense - I also have severe issues with heart rate (resting at 101bpm) so hopefully other types of THEM meds may help (: I wish you all the best!", "Officially diagnosed by one of the docs in the directory on THEM website.

Apart from the typical things we know like burning redness and blotches etc. So absolutely anything else you have noticed with these symptoms\u2026 and also how are you diagnosed what kind of tests are taken? I have had 2 blood tests (before I even discovered this being the answer to my problmes) would it have come up on them? I have a lot of other stuff going on that popped up shortly after erythromelalgia and I have also been trying to figure out what is connected (if anything at all). THEM started for me seven months ago. A couple months later, I got hit with terrible fatigue and started having numbness/tingling in my left foot, hands and left cheek. My right arm feels weak and I have issues in that hand. My appetite was off and I struggled with imbalance (and my balance *had* been pretty good previously -- I practiced yoga regularly). \n\nI had a brain MRI, which was more or less normal, though I did discover I have mild cerebellar tonsillar ectopia. I also saw a rheumatologist who ran autoimmune panels that were normal. She diagnosed me with benign hypermobility syndrome and also diagnosed the THEM along with a dermatologist. My B12 was on the low side, but after a series of injections and supplements, it is back in the normal range, yet my symptoms remain! It is all driving me batty... such a puzzle... and it is hard not to feel like you are losing your mind.

That can bring heart rhythm abnormalities into the mix.\n\nAnd probably most concerning is that a significant percentage of THEM patients have a myeloproliferative disorder, which is a term that described certain blood cancers.

When my THEM first came on, my family and I assumed it was athlete's foot from all the running I did. Obviously we were wrong, and I used treatments for athlete's foot like anti-fungal sprays and creams, which did nothing for my THEM. There were a few days that were hellish. I did not know cold helped, so I just toughed it out. For the next 6 months or so after the worst of it, I had little to no symptoms of THEM.  would only get swollen hot feet at night, but nothing during the day, and I was running half marathon distances in 80+ degree heat. Then it started getting colder outside, and my THEM was getting worse. This was when I got a diagnosis and learned about cooling methods along with the elevation of my feet. From then on I was always cooling my feet and elevating them. Not much later my symptoms worsened severely and have stayed that way still (3 months since then). The more I cooled my feet, the worse my THEM seemed to get over time. I am obviously not certain that the cold makes THEM more sensitive, but I have my suspicions that the longer and more often you use cold exposure for relief, the more temporary that relief becomes, and the more severe THEM gets.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past few days I have been experimenting with this. I have not full blown started to expose myself to heat, but I have avoided using cool water, and only use fans when totally necessary to avoid a bad flare. The limited cold exposure seems to be already working. I can be on my feet longer, and my toes actually have normal color when my feet do not have pressure applied to them. It has been roughly 4 or 5 days that I have been doing this, and before I would sleep with a fan blowing cold air from a cracked window onto my feet. I was doing this when it was 16 degrees or colder outside, and it probably boosted my symptoms like crazy. I was even getting ulcers and blisters from the cold on my feet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anybody else experienced something similar, or tried heat therapy (Bob's Protocol) and saw success? I am only 19, and I have not even had THEM for a full year yet, so if this does work I have a lot of hope that I can stop THEM early in its tracks. This sounds interesting and like a possible thing to work. I have both raynauds and THEM. My extremities get very cold (used to turn white, now just purple and blue) and then when they try to warm up they go overboard and turn to burning hot and red. Not saying you have raynauds of course, I just think our bodies over react to temperatures. People with raynauds have had a decent amount of success with using cold/heat therapy, so if it works for that it would make sense heat therapy could work for this as well. Yea I do not think I have Raynauds because my skin does get very purple and blue when it is cold on my toes but never turned to that white color before. I did not know cold therapy worked for raynauds that is interesting. I am glad to hear this! I wish this Reddit were more active; I would love to hear other people\u2019s experience here! \n\nOne thing I do when my feet flares become absolutely unbearable (usually a hot summer night) is sprinkle room-temp water on them and then let it evaporate naturally. I will repeat if needed. It helps cool them without using a fan or cold water, and it seems to prevent any rebound flaring. It is not perfect, but it helps. \n\nMy opinion (I think I already said this) is that bob\u2019s protocol has a lot to offer, but is most effective for those whose THEM is worse during \u201crebounds\u201d from cold. Mine is not. That being said, I still do the hot soaks because they feel good, and I weaned myself off of my \u201cfoot fan\u201d at night just to make my own life easier. I even wear socks now when it is cool. I do not think my flares have improved since being strict about the protocol, but I plan to continue the soaks (because they feel good), and not using a fan to cool my feet at night. For me, the best treatment is just to stay cool. And a note on that: I believe that one reason the protocol helps is because the key to reducing the flare is reducing overall body temp\u2014 not foot temp. I think making your feet cooler and cooler just raises your core temperature, thereby making the flare worse. There is lots of evidence that body temperature can be manipulated by heating or cooling the extremities. Do a quick Google search on lowering body temp for sleep by warming feet and hands, for example. The idea is if the blood flow increases in the extremities, it cools the core. THEM flares are our bodies trying to cool off, and just going overboard. But if we keep the core cool there should not be as much of a problem. Once the flare has started, the focus should be on cooling off the whole body, which means unfortunately keeping the extremities on the warmer side. thanks for the encouragement!", "Could this be THEM possibly??

(I presume this is what the OP is experiencing.)\n\nFEPS3 can cause pain, often worsening late in the day or worsening with exercise, fatigue, or other illness. The pain is usually accompanied by a sensation of cold and the patient usually experiences sweating. Pain could be relieved by application of a hot compress and/or taking oral anti-inflammatories.\n\nMost FEPS3 patients are diagnosed in adulthood, commonly after age 40. Patients generally show improving symptoms with age.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth THEM and FEPS3 can result from genetic mutations that affect the sodium ion channels that are important for sensation of pain. In these conditions that ion channel sometimes gets stuck open, letting in too much sodium to the nerve cell. Medications with block sodium ion channels (lidocaine or mexiletine) are often prescribed to THEM patients. I would guess that FEPS3 patients might respond well to those also.\n\nThere are subtle differences between familial THEM and familial FEPS3. Familial THEM patients often have symptoms from childhood while FEPS3 patients most commonly start experiencing symptoms later in life. And THEM patients usually describe their pain as a burning sensation while FEPS3 patients often describe their pain as feeling cold.\n\nMuch of what is known about FEPS3 comes from studies of two unrelated Chinese families. There is relatively little information available as compared to information about THEM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER: I am absolutely not a doctor. I am not your doctor. I am not the OP's doctor. Yep, I do, and I have primary THEM, we got this, stay strong! One of the worst things that I have been discovering in regards to the mutation of SCN11A is that there is very little research out there. The main thing to take away from the little research that is out there is how the mutation causes certain voltage-gated sodium ion channels (NaV 1.9) to have a lower threshold to fire an action potential in response to stimuli, mainly pain receptors. For many years doctors could not explain the involuntary movements I have had, chronic abdominal pain, neuropathy, and constant overheating/burning pain I have had. That was when NIH ran genetic tests on me and found the SCN11A mutation. Treating many of those symptoms and many others has been made even more difficult due to another rare gene mutation that makes me an ultra rapid metabolizer of the enzyme CYP2D6. Since many medications are metabolized by CYP2D6, including pain medications, we have not been able to truly manage so many symptoms. With so few cases and even less research about these types of mutations, i have been reading every piece of research i can get my hands on just to find ways to improve daily life. And any insight I gain from others will always help. &gt;Since many medications are metabolized by CYP2D6\n\nAnd unfortunately sodium channel blocker mexiletine appears to be metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme as well. It is a common medication used but may not have worked for you.\n\nAnd though mexiletine is oft referred to as an oral lidocaine analog, what I am seeing is that (  Sometimes THEM patients are treated with a lidocaine IV drip, with varying results. I have NO idea how long such a treatment *might* provide relief, nor if it would provide relief of symptoms for you at all. And lidocaine skin patches may prove useful at home? \n\nAnother approach ( is an intrathecal injection (into the spinal canal) of ziconotide (band name Prialt), which is a peptide. It is ( within the spinal fluid and by peptidases in systemic circulation for any ziconotide that leaks into the circulatory system. It is not removed by the Cytochrome P450 system.\n\nFair warning. Ziconotide is expensive. Say $5000 for a treatment just for the medicine. The treatment administration would probably be more.  You would almost certainly have to try and fail multiple other options before an insurer would cover it.\n\nIMPORTANT:  I am NOT a doctor. No way. No how. Talk to your doctor. And bring him/her information from reputable sources to consider. Have they tried putting you on a sodium channel blockers? Genetic them has responded well to this. Yes, right now I am at the max dose of lamotrigine. After I am on that for a little longer we will probably add another one. But so far it has only helped a bit. I do have chronic GI problems that increases motility in the intestines. That seems to reduce absorption and metabolism of medication. Almost every medication I have been on either does not with or only works for about a couple weeks. It does not help that i I am an ultra metabolizer of any medication metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme. Yes I have primary (a newer test found a variant). I have tremors and restless leg syndrome. I also have migraines. Mine has progresses so fast. I am losing my mobility by the day. If you saw me at the doctors you would not know that two years ago I was an athlete who volunteered. I am currently on mexiletine. It is not as effective as I want it to be.

When standing still, the pain becomes immediately worse before dissipating about 5 minutes later. I also find that my whole body gets itchy when running or walking and I often find that my skin gets blotchy. I have been experiencing this for more than 5 years. \n\nI recently saw a podiatrist about my symptoms and after an MRI, I was told that I had tendinitis in my arch and unexplained swelling in the pads of my feet. Physical therapy based on this diagnosis has done nothing to reduce the burning pain. \n\nI am a 27 year old female with fairly well controlled type 1 diabetes (a1c in the 7s or 8s). The podiatrist and endocrine have ruled out diabetic neuropathy since this pain occurs when I am active. I am diagnosed with erythromelalgia and I can almost count on it that I will start flailing up after 1km and then if I keep walking all sorts of other pains join in. My flares are are the worst when I am active or even standing for too long, some days worse than others, but seems like whenever my body gets hot my legs start burning so any exercise even just walking,or hot tub, hot weather etc.\nSo I mean it could be possible that you have it, sounds similar to what I have. But please see a dr and have them rule out everything and thoroughly diagnose you!. That may be THEM that is also similar to what I am dealing with - 27 male no diabetic history. With exercise I get itchy full body with a stinging sensation along with hands that flair up and only get better with cold, maybe post a picture of a flair up?\n\nDoes cold help? Does warm weather make it worse? Yes cold does help, but have to be careful with it, like my drs told me to not use icy stuff but rather just a cold cloth or cold water, ice sparingly. Like sometimes I will do rather cold water for my legs below 30, like not super cold but just enough to calm it a bit. My hands also flair up when I exercise. Like it is hands feet and sometimes face. I always took picture of my flares so I could show it to the drs(went from one specialist to another) I would go to a neurologist, that is what I did to make sure the tingling/numbing sensation in my feet were not something nerve related. Because erythromelalgia is a condition which they do not know what causes it and they do not have a treatment for it, I would rule out as much as possible so that you do not end up being misdiagnosed. \nI live where winters are rather cold (summer is not so hot either)but It still starts as soon as I get active, even a walk outside. In summers I pretty much live in sandals, like wearing socks in the house can be enough. \nI find the best exercise to be swimming cause the pools are so cold It kind of helps keep the feet normal while getting an exercise, but as soon as I am on my feet again the flaring starts. Anyway it is just a pain really and something one has to learn to live with. I have THEM, but I also experienced itchy blotchy skin after running that I am not sure has anything to do with THEM. I started taking a 24 hour non-drowsy antihistamine prior to running and this worked well for me. I got the Kirkland brand at Cost-Co for pretty cheap\n Not sure if this will help you, but it worked for me. Slight update: I just found out that my mom was diagnosed with Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon a few months ago. Has anyone noticed a family connection between the two conditions? Yes! Many people in the online support groups I am in have both. I have both. The Raynauds came at age 22 and the THEM did not start until age 30. I have had it for five, diagnosed and being treated for past 2.5 years by my rheumatologist.

But if you do want to try for your face it I have one word for you - snorkel.\n\nFor comfort you might want a very low profile freediving or scuba diving mask. A mask designed for freediving would be optimal for making it easier to submerge your face without the mask getting too much in the way. The ( (about US$75) is probably the best of that lot. Other masks might work as well and be cheaper, but you probably need something with actual tempered glass lenses and not plastic. Those super cheap masks at mass retailers are made of a plastic that I imagine would not hold up to much heat at all. For your purpose having as much of your face exposed as possible is probably what would be needed.\n\nAnd for that breathing...  A ( without a valve should work just fine.

I think it is been helping with my THEM a little but are the side effect everyday? Anyone experience these? I will have to real test it in the heat but the side effect have beeen unbearable.  What dose are you taking? I started gabapentin about a month and a half ago. They started me with 100 mg x 3 times a day and switched to 300 mg x 2 times a day after a couple of weeks. The small doses were fine but the larger ones have made me severely nauseous and drowsy which is not a good feeling to have especially while working. What has helped me has been opening up the capsules and mixing half of them with water and distributing the doses throughout the day instead of taking the whole dose at once. Has not been fun doing so, but has worked on those unwanted side effects so far until I see my doctor again. Thanks for the reply, good know how others are reacting to the medication. My doctor gave me 100 mg only at night, which does not sound like much but it is base on my weight at 100lbs. And then if no side effects or no improvement 2X a day, I am not doing that probably, bc of side effects. First night I got super dizzy. Now I am waking up with severe headaches, nausea and some dizziness. My nerve pain in my feet and hands are much better for sleeping, but not worth the severe headaches and nausea.  I feel it has been relieved some which is great. I cannot bare the side effects or I will just get off them and try something else. Have you read this study? It has some other medication suggestions you could try if the gab is too intense \n\n I am currently weaning off gabapentin because I could not handle the side effects. I was taking 3x300 mg per day for about 3 months and was completely miserable. I had extreme fatigue and brain fog. I could not go anywhere or do anything because every part of me was so damn tired at all times. I told my rheumatologist about the side effects and he wants me off them completely, so I have been weaning off them for a few weeks now. Of course, now that I am weaning off them, I am having insane dreams/nightmares, but I know that is only temporary. For me, the benefits I experienced with gabapentin were minimal and nowhere near worth putting up with the side effects. I would say to give it some time (maybe a month or so) and if you are miserable, let your dr know you want off of them. I was only diagnosed about 4 months ago, but I am learning that treatment is all about trial, error, and patience. I take 100mg at night, but they wrote me for up to 300, 3x/day. (300mgs knocks me right out, so I am good at 100mg before bed, so far.) \n\nI have not noticed any side effects - but it is definitely reduced the number and severity of THEM attacks these days. I have been tracking and it used to be daily, now it is a few times a week. I hope you get past the side effects or find something else that will work for you! \n\nEdit: oops - hit post too soon!

I was having I think it is a migraine and I felt sick all day and all night. Severe headaches was unbearable. Nothing helped. I get tension headaches sometimes so anything with sun or light makes me gets headaches but nothing like this to wear I could not get out of bed. I was getting car sick which I never before in my life. I felt dizzy, and after i stoped taking the medication after a day or two I was completely fine. Yeha I have 100mg. I started out at one pill at night. I think it did help with my THEM a little not a major difference but I could not bear the side effects much longer. I kept getting migraines everyday all day and night. I was sick in the car, walking, eating, sleeping. I was only taking them for 4 days. The first day I got super dizzy, then the next three days of headaches and very sick. I did ask my sic if I could take my ibuprofen 600mg with the medication and they said yes. It did not work made things worse or about the same. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I could not believe it was going to make me so sick. I never experience this in my life, repeatedly.

I have not personally tried them yet but have the same issue as you and plan to.", "Does this look like THEM? My hands and wrists are burning.  also, background info!! I am coming off of my prescribed adderall medication for my adhd, i am sweating a TON, and i just had an insane stressful situation at work. Our entire system went down and i freaked out. Hi there! Can you share more info such as common triggers? For ex: heat, alcohol, exercise, etc. Are experiencing the heat and redness anywhere else on your body? Any other side effects? \n\nMy THEM often gives off that marbled appearance, like your photo, but the redness in mine is typically more severe. I would also like to know if this is THEM! I get the same thing in my hands and I have been diagnosed with Mastocytosis. The burning can be very annoying! Any tips to make it go away besides holding my fingers towards the ceiling? yes!! also i took this with flash and in person my hands were MUCH more red. Every time it is happened I had been sweating a lot, super hot on my feet and hands, and usually it is when i am coming off of my adderall with little sleep. Essentially the whole system at work went down last night and it started happening i assume due to stress. Let me know if you need any other info! :) Hi did you ever figure out what this was or did it go away? I also get this when my Adderall is wearing off, along with hot red ears and I am wondering if it could be caused by erythromelalgia. crazy you said that because my adderall was wearing off when this happened. i am actually getting blood work done this upcoming week, but i think i may have some form of thyroid issue. i will update you!! i have not had a flare since, but at times i notice my feet getting super red and burn when i come down from my meds. it is never this bad though. Thank you for the response!! I have hashimotos and hypothyroidism and my levels have been elevated for the last 2 months and we are working to tweak my thyroid medicine to get them down. I have been on Adderall for almost a year and this just started happening to me about a month after my thyroid bloodwork came back elevated, definitely think there is a connection and I am wondering if this will go away when my thyroid levels normalize again. Good luck with your bloodwork!!", "Socks - TOP TIPS PLEASE - I know hard to think about but wondering if anyone had advice on. Hi all, I have had THEM for year or so and I can get away with not wearing shoes at work, as long as I wear socks. Very difficult to wear socks as they often trigger flairs.\n\nJust wondering what socks people wear when they have to where socks? What types of materials/brands are best? I was thinking modal socks?\n\nInterested in peoples thoughts. can you have your toes exposed ? For some reason, if I have my toes exposed, it feels so much better. My mom got me some open socks for wearing around the house and I love them. Cotton for me. \n\nThey have mesh top socks that have antistick beads on the bottom.\n\nMen\u2019s and women\u2019s good to wear if you have topical creams applied as well but need to walk around. Wool. I wish I had discovered them sooner, but they keep your feet balanced. Can you wear sandals at work? These are the only foot covering I have been able to stand for more than an hour. \n\n Unfortunately not. Would be great if I could. Basically have to wear socks + smart brogue type shoes. I can take off the brogues at my desk but need to keep socks on. Thanks. Great advice. I would have thought they might make my feet itch and irritate. but will give them a try. Any brand in particular that you recommend? No unfortunately not but thanks for recommendation think I need more dress socks than these. thinking maybe modal, cotton or wool. I think I will get a pair of these for outside the office though so thanks for the advice. No problem. Good Luck! Smartwool is my go to. They are expensive, but worth it.", "Anyone experience when to know if secondary THEM is triggered by SFN or other causes in the body? I have been busy trying to find out my cause why THEM has arrived in my body last year. So far I have taken nearly all the required test and nothing showed anything suspicious. \n\nYesterday got my glucose tolerance and thyroid back, even these are normal. Really struggling where to go from here. \n\nThe thing I am wondering actually, how would I know if the redness and tingly sensations are not just nerve inflammation rather than THEM. When I cool though my feet after waking or hot shower, the tingly sensations disappear slowly. I do not have pain, it is just red and tingly. Also the blood stains and spots under my feet are visible when pressure is on. \n\nHow could you verify if those strange blood changes under feet are driven by nerve endings or blood problems caused by THEM or something that is causing?\n\nHave tried numbers of food diets, but nothing really gives big changes. No meds yet, but looking at to start low dose naltrexone for a try and aspirine.\n\nIf that does not help, consider to try venlaflaxine.\n\nWould be great to hear what others are doing", "some of the.. interesting.. patterns my flares take (undiagnosed, but 90% sure it is THEM) ", "Does it look like I have it? I already set up an appointment with a rheumatologist.  The left knee in your first picture is the one that stands out to me the most as looking like my THEM knees. (Diagnosed in 2017...started in feet).\n\nThe other pics probably do not do you justice. Keep taking pics as much as possible and documenting times of day and specific triggers that seem to bring on a flare and what it feels like when it happens, what helps relieve it and any other details around when you get these symptoms. Because it is very hard to diagnose unless you are in the middle of a flare during the exam AND that particular doctor knows a lot about THEM. \n\nGood luck with you appointment! Thank you! Very helpful. I have another photo ( of both of my knees when I had an especially bad flare up after walking around in hot weather. Is it only in your knees? What helps relieve it? Is it painful or just hot? Does it feel swollen almost like someone injected hot water under the surface of your skin on the knees? It is my knees and my feet (you can see the redness in my feet in the original photos). YES swollen + inflamed and painful to walk on. Elevating my legs helps to relieve it.. it is almost a routine now. I will walk my dog in the evening (evenings above 60-70 degrees exacerbate it) and I will come home and immediately elevate my legs. to add to this.. It helps if you have some pics of \"normal\" to show the docs as well.  That way they can see the difference between normal and flared in your pics.  I kept sending them pics of my red feet and they were like \"yea you have red feet.\" Then they saw the side-by-side pics. Second this!! Based on this additional info, it does sound a lot like how my THEM started. I am so sorry to hear this. Getting a diagnosis will be improved greatly by your detailed notes of what triggers it, how it feels, and what helps relieve it. And lots and lots of pics in different lighting's since you most likely will not be flaring before an appointment. \n\nI have Raynauds, too, so it is hard for me to be in an THEM flare when in a gown in a cold exam room. My Rheumatologist always sees me in Raynauds flare and not the THEM flares for this reason. But she is seen the photos and believes my stories and that is how I got my diagnosis.", "Has anyone else experienced this I have woken up 3 times like this now, 2 \u2018attacks did not wake me up.. instead i just woke up so hot in the face and hands and feet\u2026 which were all puffy/swollen/filled up looking?? But the state of my face wow\u2026 so splotchy and red and hot it took like 2/3 days for my skin to return to normal\u2026 it was honesly a state, I had not done anything differently but I just ruled it off as skincare or whatever but I am now currently going through it right now at 2am where I have been tossing and turning all night being really hot in my face, ears, hands and feet my face looks like it has a rash on it everytime\u2026 it is not bumps it is just patches and splotches of redness and almost like purple ness or purple undertoned\u2026 like a deathly skin tone, all areas are puffy and just super super hot, where they are all throbbing like really badly, I have the worst headache I have ever had in my life like pain in my jaw too, I am really shaky, my eye sight is like shaking and my heart was literally beating through my throat\u2026 it is so bad I am debating calling an ambulance. While these parts are hot the rest of my body is cold\u2026 so I know when I wake up with a red hot splotchy face it is not now skincare Do you get similar overheating/flaring symptoms at any other time like for example maybe in the evenings after dinner or when exposed to hot showers, hot weather/ temperatures, heaters, or high humidity? \n\nHonestly, the red splotches on face, worst in middle of night and heat in face, hands, and feet does sound a lot like Erythromelalgia symptoms which are worse at night when our parasympathetic (rest/digest) part of the autonomic nervous system is most active. It is responsible for dilating our blood vessels and so this is why folks with erythromelalgia have more flaring at night. \n\nIt is hard to say definitely, though, and usually erythromelalgia would NOT just come out of nowhere to be as severe without sort of a progression up. Usually it starts in only one or two areas of the body and then progresses to other areas over a long period of time. For many, erythromelalgia starts in the feet first and they notice it most when standing, exercising, showering, or being in hot temps. Hands and ears are often next and face and other areas of the body follow (for some people). For others, it mainly affects their hands and feet.\n\nThe rest of your symptoms sound a bit like you have a fever and an infection of some sort and you would need to get checked out by a doctor. Try to stay calm, breathing deeply and slowly in through your nose and out through your mouth in a nice slow exhale. And get into see a doctor when it is safe and convenient to do so. Just your every day doctor will not know much about erythromelalgia, but they would be able to check out the jaw pain, headache, and fever. Yes I do it would always be more common for random burning to happen in the evening\u2026. For me things like getting in a car, restaurants, wearing a face covering, just walking into slight changes of temperatue, steam\u2026 from like a bath or cooking, but weirdly not a shower?? But Yeha it is hard to say what I think burns the most\u2026 probably say my hands, face ears and then feet( as I am always wearing shoes or walking maybe) but they can happen all at once or only 2 at a time etc", "Eating bringing on flares? Does this happen for anyone else, it is not the temp of food of the speed or any ingredients/components of the food\u2026 it is just the action it is makes me really hot where then my cheeks become splotchy red,burning, throbbing/pulsating\u2026 same with ears\u2026 it looks abs feels just like a random flare up does, but I am just checking because I am having other problems along this\u2026 another separate diagnosis which hasent been found yet\u2026 it is just hard knowing what is causing what I would look into Mast Cell Activation Disorders and also histamine intolerances. Absolutely. Eating has always been a trigger for me, however, the food usually has to be at least slightly warm. Even toasted bread for a sandwhich Okay thabkyou!! I was eating pasta at room temperature, Warner cold and wasent hot\u2026 had a massive flare and still in it 3 hours later\ud83d\ude44 not how it happens\u2026 is it the movement of eating? Or food entering the body\u2026 it is so so weird Are you diagnosed with any of them? It is weird for sure. Sometimes eating triggers flares even in my feet but it is usually just my hands Digestion is a process governed by the autonomic nervous system and it requires blood to be moved around so your body has the resources to break down the food.\n\nA lot of people with dysautonomia have a problem with symptoms flaring after they eat (called postprandial hypotension).\n\nDoes eating very small amounts help?\n\nAnd as stated above, I would look into MCAS as a possibility. The standard protocol is to take a histamine 1 inhibitor (\u201cantihistamine\u201d, so something like Claratin, Zyrtec, Allegra, etc) and a histamine 2 inhibitor (Pepcid or Tagamet). \n\nAnd if that helps and you can get a doctor to listen to you, you can ask about trying cromolyn sodium, which is a topical mast cell inhibitor that prevents reactions when taken orally about 10 minutes before eating. This reaction happens while I am eating, that is why I do not think it is the food and digestion\u2026 I have absolutey no idea why it happens wether it is the movements of eating or food entering, would the things you mentioned not work if this is happening during eating\u2026 like it happens before I even finish eating the meal Do your flares come on while your eating or after? Mine are during/instanly as I eat I think so, because the first part of digestion is the release of saliva into your mouth and the salivary glands getting activated and needing more fluid (so the movement of blood in those areas).\n\nAlso, putting the food in your mouth and chewing gets your stomach started on making acid and moving around to agitate the food.\n\nYou could experiment with if it gets worse with hard foods (these make my MCAS mad because of the friction against my mouth), soft foods (mashed potato type texture), or liquids (like a cool gazpacho soup or protein drink?).\n\nThere is also the possibility that anticipating the pain is causing you to be anxious (like it would for anyone, tbh) and making your heart rate go up and exacerbating any kind of autonomic issues. \n\nBecause anxiety plays havoc with our nervous systems, complicating fucking everything\u2026 and anyone who says they would not be anxious about facing significant pain would be lying (and a lot of doctors lie to themselves with how they would act if they were experiencing what their patients go through).\n\nSo if you have access to something like propranolol it might help to premedicate with it?\n\nOr if you have a med that you normally take to treat the redness, apply/take it ahead of time to keep the process from starting? I am in the process of doing labs for MCAS, it is highly suspected by my doctors. We have noticed that some antihistamines help with flares including an aspirin regimen. \n\nI have been confirmed diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy as well. THEM is actually a form of peripheral neuropathy as well. I am also in the process of talking to my doctor about looking into Trigeminal Neuralgia since that is a possibility for my symptoms. Eating can cause a redness called telangiectasia. Sometimes that is very specific, looking like little red lines where blood vessels are dilated. Sometimes that is a more broad redness. I actually have tried 2 rounds of propanol, both times did not work at all\u2026 had absolutely no effect what so ever which is quite scary to me as I have been told that pretty rare\u2026 they were just from gps so hoping the more advance docs I am seeing now can finally put things together\u2026 all of that makes perfect sense\u2026 am defenitly going to keep pushing especially with this great information\u2026 Thankyou so much !! Got a nice long list of conditions for my doc to look into, thabkyou so much for your help\u2026 I am sorry to hear you have so much going on too\ud83d\ude1e I saw that you have posted in the POTS subreddit\u2026 do you know if you have the hyperadrenergic variety?\n\nIt might help to watch some of the lectures from Dysautonomia International to get an idea of the kinds of medications that would be the next step for you. I think they even have lectures about how dysautonomia effects the digestive system (although it is more common to have problems with motility in the stomach and lower).\n\nBut having hyper-POTS might mean that you need a different beta blocker, or something like prazosin/doxazosin or clonidine.\n\nI do not have hyper-POTS, \u201cjust\u201d the variety caused by dead autonomic nerves (from small fiber neuropathy), but I know it requires a different medication regimen.\n\nAlso, if you fail beta blockers entirely your insurance might be willing to pay for ivrabadine (brand name Corlanor in the US), which is a sinus node blocker and the only drug of its class approved in the US.\n\nI used it to deal with an issue I had where my heart would pound out of my ears when I laid down, but it was $8/pill because my insurance refused to cover it due to the FDA only approving it in the US for heart failure (despite the fact that it is commonly used alongside beta blockers to treat POTS in the EU). \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEdit: I have found topical midodrine cream to be an absolute lifesaver for me, but if your BP is low enough and does not spike (spikes are common in hyper-POTS) they would could prescribe you the pill form.\n\nIt is normally used to raise blood pressure by constricting capillaries\u2026 which is why they work topically for THEM. Omg I was so needing to find somebody with both erythromelalgia and pots!!! I battle constantly knowing what symptoms caused by what disorder, drs have not been great I was told I have it and that was it, eveything I brought up got ignored as the subject was then changed or I was made to feel belittled, I was even told I would grow out of it or that he does not want to put me on medication because of my age (this is who I am currently with) I was prescribed the beta blockers by my gp, I actually asked for clonidine but my gp soad no\u2026 apparently I was at old enough and wasent used for my concerns I then brought up everything google told me about how people over 12 can use it abs what it is used for he told me it is wrong and the convo ended there!! So I am now refferd to someone new (still waiting for the first appointment) so no idea if I have that variety but looking it up it is not clear to me what it is? What is it?? And omg yes that is exactly what I get I cannot sleep beacuse I hear it in my ears, my insides literally throb and even my eyelids throb with my heart beat where I can actually see it\n\nEdit: that cream sounds exactly like what I need!! My vesssles are constantly expanding, with the them flares, anxiety, heat intolerance, and head rushes pots causes I am red more then I am not\ud83d\ude02and I actually have low blood pressure\u2026 I average within the 90s/over the 60s I am so glad that I can be helpful!!\n\nThose are such shitty doctors and you 100% DO NOT deserve to be treated that way, or left alone to suffer while you wait to see someone who might take you seriously. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nThe Dysautonomia International lectures are awesome because they are given by doctors who hyper-specialize in these things and so you can peek into the minds of what they are thinking in terms of how different stuff interacts (POTS, THEM, neuropathy, CRPS, etc).\n\nAnd they have a ton of lectures that are for laymen\u2026 and they sometimes put their powerpoint presentations online (and they are totally printable \ud83d\udc40).\n\nI have found the best way to get doctors to take me seriously is to bring peer reviewed papers, but not directly challenge them with it (doctor egos \ud83d\ude44).\n\nSaying stuff like \u201cthis is my understanding of this, so you think that is right?\u201d or \u201cbecause I did not respond to beta blockers twice I looked up what that could possibly mean and the medical specialists said this and recommended X testing, do you think that makes sense?\u201d\n\nOr if they say that Y treatment is not used, but you know it is, you can be like \u201chuh, I got different information about that, my understanding was X, but what is the reasoning behind what you know?\u201d\n\nOr giving them peer reviewed articles\u2026\n\nBut I also make a joke out of it. Kind of like \u201cI have always been a nerd and I want to understand things, and this is so complicated and at the intersection of so many different specialties that it seems like everyone only has some of the picture, and I want to be helpful if possible!\u201d\n\nAnd if the doctor is getting threatened by what you are saying you can always be like \u201cof course I know nothing about heart defects or cardiac arrests, I have just researched this little part of cardiology because it impacts my life a lot!\u201d\n\nAnyway\u2026 it sounds like your sympathetic nervous system (the fight/flight/freeze part) is WAY overactive and that needs to be treated!\n\nThe hyperarousal part of POTS can be misdiagnosed as anxiety, but it actually goes the other way around\u2026 because your nervous system is causing you to have the physical body changes of fear constantly, and then your mind is like \u201cwell, the body says we have to be on high alert\u201d and it turns into anxiety. Egos?? Right\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI brought up erythromelalgia to the doctor in an email and then the next appointment he said he was the one who figured it out and that I have it yet before hand there was no mention whatsoever?? You should see my notes\ud83d\ude02all possibilities quotes etc\u2026 but there egos may need actual printed articles like you say\ud83d\ude02 deffo agree on that woth the overactive nervous system!! I go red and all the symptoms of being nervous at the littlest of things, if someone knocks on the door or walking past people\u2026 do you know how this would be treated as I really thought that I would be stuck like this as the previous doctor quit on me after propanol did not work and just told me to search up counselling when this kind of anxiety is not going to be treated though that when it is clearly a medical matter when someone gets nervous to someone knocking at the door or someone calling me(which makes me think it is even just loud sound) and then refused clonidine when I asked I kind of gave up with the anxiety side as it feels as if I have too much going on that has to be treated singulary but maybe it really all does link together Dr Alan Pocinki has the best information about managing hyperactive autonomic shit. He focuses on EDS specifically, but even if you do not have EDS his stuff is really helpful.\n\nThis is a slideshow: \n\nVideo:  Saving this for later.  Fellow POTS &amp; EMer here!  Glad there a some well-versed folks on here since! Usually during Happens for me too. Eating activated the parasympathetic nervous system which can trigger THEM flares. This is something i looked into the past and I found it is common. Same !! Honestly Thankyou so much for this and your help!! Finally think I can get somewhere with this information!! Are you on any treatment? Life savers right !! Yes. It is worse with hot food (spice does not affect me much. If anything, I get more even flushing when I eat spicy food, and less directed at my nose and ears, where the THEM manifests).\n\nCarbohydrates also make it much worse. If you can, try reducing your carbohydrate intake and having one meal a day that is just protein/fats and salad/veggies. Switch up which meal it is (so that you test this for different times of day). See if you notice that the flaring is less likely to happen after these meals. It does not happen after the meals, it is the action of eating\u2026. Not temp or components because it is happend eating packaged food which has no temp etc\u2026 it happens during eating which is too early for it to be the components within the food Currently taking Effexor XR 75mg. It is not helping, next is IV ketamine, then IV Presnisone and/or IV lidocaine.", "Searching for answers.  Fair warning. I am not a doctor. I did not even play a doctor on tv. I did not even stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night.  I am just a guy with THEM and several other related conditions.\n\nI was reading some of your symptoms that you posted in the r/smallfiberneuropathy subReddit.\n\nYou mentioned subclinical Hashimoto's!?  This was a diagnosis from a doctor? Hashimoto's is auto-immune.  I will come back to that point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour photos show some redness, combined with some notable paleness in one hand.   This *might* be both Erythromelalgia (causing redness) and Raynaud's (causing paleness). These conditions sometimes occur together. These are sort of two sides of a worthless coin - THEM from dilation of blood vessels and Raynaud's from constriction of blood vessels.\n\nFavoring the possibility of THEM is that you described your feet feeling like they are on fire when exposed to warm water in the shower. Both standing and exposure to warm water commonly bring on an THEM flare.\n\nFavoring Raynaud's is your hand feeling colder and appearing pale.\n\nWhat seems a bit odd is that much of your THEM -like symptoms seem to affect mostly one side of your body. Most commonly THEM is bilateral, but not always.  I have one hand that turns almost purple at times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of your other symptoms - tachycardia and night sweats - make me think autonomic nervous system involvement.  Do you ever feel faint or pass out if you stand up suddenly after laying down a long time? If so the tachycardia might point towards POTS.\n\nAnd tying all this together...   THEM is very commonly associated with assorted other conditions. Not every THEM patient has the same constellation of conditions. Autonomic nervous system conditions and auto-immune conditions (tying in that Hashimoto's!) are some of these common conditions that accompany THEM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo evaluate for possible THEM it helps to find a doctor familiar with the condition. Few doctors are! The Erythromelalgia Association maintains a ( that lists providers familiar with THEM. There are Dermatologists, Neurologists, Podiatrists, Rheumatologists, Vascular Medicine Specialists, and a few other specialists listed.  IMHO being seen by a physician familiar with the condition is at least as important as specific specialty of the physician. That is the FIRST QUESTION TO ASK ANY DOCTOR.  Have you ever treated a patient with THEM?  Ask before you make the appointment and save yourself a lot of trouble.\n\nTo be clear - your looking for a main THEM doctor and then you will probably have to go out to other specialist.  The main doctor should ALWAYS have treated someone with THEM before.  The subsequent specialist having experience with THEM would be helpful but if you are just ruling out an underlying disease not totally necessary. Thanks for the synthesis! Yes, I am diagnosed with Hashis for 3 years now. I really appreciate the feedback. I have been bouncing around doctors for about 6 months and feel like I might have a lead now! Thank you for the advice!", "Questions for those with secondary THEM It is still early days for me in identifying what my THEM is secondary to and had some questions for those with their diagnoses figured out, if people would be willing to talk about it:\n\n- What is your THEM secondary to?\n- What symptoms does your other condition cause?\n- Which condition did you have symptoms of first?\n- How do your THEM and other condition interact?\n- What was the diagnostic process like for you in identifying your conditions? How were they    \n   diagnosed? Hey there, I am in the process of being diagnosed with Dysautonomia. Specifically hEDS and auto immune autonomic dysfunction. \n\nThe neurologist I went to for THEM was amazing and he actually asked me a ton of questions I did not realize were even related to my THEM and he believes I have Dysautonomia and I am now on a waiting list for a specialist in my area. Up until that point I had been going to rheumatologist and other doctors trying to figure out the auto immune issues as their own thing, ruled out lupus and Sjogrens. \n\nI have had symptoms of Dysautonomia since I was about 9 but never realized these things were all connected. My THEM began about three years ago and during this time I became progressively sicker all over my body as well- fainting spells, low BP, severe gastro paralysis, sun sensitivity etc. I also developed Raynaud\u2019s which often goes with THEM. We believe I have MCAS as well. \n\nIt took me 3 full years to get diagnosed with THEM, at first I was baffling dermatologists and they tried rosacea medicines which made things worse and the THEM spread from my face to also ears and eventually feet. Tried allergy doctors but they thought it might be lupus (THEM on my face makes a butterfly type pattern) so they pushed me to a rheumatologist and then another and then a cardiologist for the vascular aspect. Finally I found a neurologist who is incredible and knowledgeable. \n\nI am happy to answer any other questions I missed! It is definitely important to share our stores to help one another get better.", "THEM? Red/hot but no pain. Also have raynauds ", "My THEM has gotten a lot better, and I am not sure why. I wanted to talk about this for a few days but I did not want to make it sound like I am bragging or anything, but I am just so puzzled by how this thing works and I had to share. \n\nA few weeks ago, it started getting hotter around here, and I was bracing myself for typical THEM symptoms. You  know how it goes already. Well, it got hotter and hotter here, but my THEM seemed to get BETTER. \n\nWhat has changed? Well, the weather obviously. Here in Western New York it does not get terribly hot, but the temperature has been in the 80s and I did not get terrible flare-ups, which is WEIRD. I have also reduced my exposure to cold. I used to put my AC really cold so that my THEM would not bother me, but now I have been putting my AC slightly hotter. I have also started doing some cardio. Just walking on my treadmill, and when I finish, my feet are burning like crazy, but then it stops in a few minutes or up to half an hour. I have been trying to sleep less and be more active as well. I have also reduced my stress by taking care of some stuff that was bothering me, but at the same time, I have been very relaxed for weeks and months before and my THEM was still bad, so stress alone cannot be it, although mindfulness really helps with coping and continuing despite the pain.  \n\nI am traveling to Puerto Rico later this summer, and I just know it is going to get pretty bad, but what is surprising is that with this temperature here my and routine, my THEM seems to be peaceful. I can go almost a day without thinking about this, and at night my feet do not burn either. I do turn the AC and a fan, but I just know it is better.\n\nI am not saying that any of this will make your THEM better. In fact, it could make it worse, but this is just my experience. I have a feeling, and I might be wrong, that being in the cold actually makes THEM worse because my THEM got the worst during the harsh winter months. However, when I go to a really hot place like Puerto Rico, where I am weeks without AC, my THEM is still pretty bad all the time, so it is not like heat long-term makes it better, but I think cold might play a role in actually making it worse after a certain temperature or time. \n\nI also think that being sedentary, like I was, makes THEM A LOT worse. This I know because when I have been sleeping too much (I am in college and I get the whole summer) and I stand up from my bed, my feet burn for a while and my hands too if it is hot when I wake up, and when I was in Puerto Rico last year I was also very sedentary and my THEM became the worst it had ever been, but that was also the most sedentary I think I have ever been. So I think that is a clue. Sedentary/inactivity + heat = extra bad. \n\nIt is just all so confusing. I am always trying to pinpoint the one thing or combination of things that makes it better or worse, but I feel like I am getting somewhere with my specific type of THEM but at the same time not. In the end I am going to have to stop looking so much into it and just accept it. Mindfulness and some concepts in Buddhism like not wanting reality to be other than it is are extremely helpful to me because I can get through a day and not be whining or ruminating over my pain, so I think my ultimate strategy is just going to have to be acceptance and not wanting things to be different. THEM is not horribly debilitating to me, but it causes a significant amount of pain often, so something has to be done. \n\nLet me know if you guys know any weird things that seem to make THEM worse or better besides heat. Maybe we will get somewhere who knows. Happy for you! THEM can be a cruel mf lol I am so glad to hear this! I live in Chicago and it gets pretty hot/muggy in the summer (we also do not have AC and live in an old brick house). I had terrible, painful flareups this spring when the temperature first started climbing, but now that it is more consistently hot, I am having slightly less trouble, which is *strange,* but I will take it! I am still having daily flareups, but mostly on my feet and hands (it had been affecting my face and knees too) and they are tolerable. I wonder if my body needs time to adjust to rising temperatures, but then once it adjusts a bit, symptoms lessen? I have no idea. THEM is such a mysterious and aggravating condition! A lot of people who have THEM also deal with raynauds, even if you do not have the white fingers so much. I find mine is better (to a point) when the weather is a bit warmer. When the toes, hands, and or face get cold and then warm back up, it is almost like the body goes into overdrive to try and warm them up. I could be wrong, it is just something that kind of makes sense to me. I think there are different types of THEM. I thought mine was actually in remission, but then I moved back to a warm climate and it is killing me again. Winter was great I notice my THEM gets worse with fluctuations in temperature and I do not have Raynaud's.  The more consistent I can hold the temperature, within reasonable limits, the better off I am. My THEM has been better this year too!\n\nDo you think it has anything to do with having been outside less this year? I have cooccuring THEM and Raynauds. I am pretty sure I developed neuropathic THEM as a result of the Raynauds (low blood flow leading to neuropathic damage). So I often get THEM flares in winter when I come indoors from being out in the cold. But over the last few years I have also been getting it in summer. \n\nDue to the pandemic, I obviously was not going out as much this year during the winter. I was not getting so many raynauds attacks or them. I feel almost like my hands and feet had some chnace to 'heal' without getting aggravated by the bad weather and raynauds. \n\nPerhaps for some people it might be better this year because they are not going out so much in the hot weather now that it is summer. I am not sure if THEM flares are kind of cumulative, like if you have one you are more likely to have another on moderate heat exposure. If so, perhaps the lack of need to be outside going to/from work etc means that your hands + feet are having more rest time between flares, and so are less easily triggered too? My flares have gotten a little better the last couple of months too! I still get them \u2014but not as bad. Who knows why. I do know I get them really bad after being really cold (and suddenly heating up), eating certain food, taking a too hot bath, etc\u2026 This 100%. That is exactly how it feels like. I used to have this stupid/denial attitude toward THEM that I should just trigger it or not avoid anything that would cause it because I needed to \"get over it.\" But lately two things changed. I actually started avoiding triggers. Like if I am feeling one I would just turn on the fan, and also I have been having my AC much hotter. I used to have it really low at like 60, and now it is pretty much room temperature or a light breeze. The fact that I have had less triggers has made it so that when I am in a situation that would trigger a bad one, it does not get as bad. It is like you said, like my body had time to heal and now it is slightly more resistant to heat. \n\nI have a feeling that cold actually makes THEM worse, and so does constant flare-ups. \n\nI also have to add that I started taking a beta blocker for an autonomic issue I have that makes my heart beat a bit too fast, so maybe the beta blocker also has something to do, but I started taking it after I noticed my THEM was getting just a tiny bit better.", "Booster shot Has anyone experienced burning or stinging from the Pfizer booster shot right after?", "Would you say this is THEM? Happens from gravity/hanging down, walking, and gets worse with warmer temps from what I have seen. ", "Newly diagnosed, grateful for this group!  ** edited to say the paper in the second photo is for my cat! He loves to jump and play in Amazon packaging. LOL** \n\nI just want to say I am so grateful for this group. I have been newly diagnosed at 43 (in that, my doctor and dermatologist seem to think this is what is going on). \n\nFor reference, I have flares of burning, red hot hands and feet, made better by cold water/ice/ walking on cool floors. So far, all my lab tests are normal. My TSH for thyroid which was 4.0  uIU/ml, which is considered normal under Kaiser (they go to 4.20). No unusual blood counts, no RA (based on lab tests so far), other autoimmune conditions are negative, liver panel etc, normal. No family history. I have had occasional minor flares  since I was a kid, but always thought it was related to \u201cbad circulation\u201d or allergies or eating too much salt, etc. I finally went to the doctor because the flares are starting to interfere with work, cooking, cleaning, exercise, sleep (particularly worse at night). Flares got particularly bad after I received my first dose of COVID vaccine (probably unrelated, or just inflammation). Weirdly sometimes before a flare my hands and feet get ICY cold and white. Does this happen to people? \n\nIn the past year I have been having a lot of bilateral joint pain as well (knuckles, wrist, knees) peripheral neuropathy, etc. so I was surprised all the autoimmune tests showed nothing. Anyway. The only other thing I will note is: I got bitten by no less than 8 Ticks last summer!!!! Two were unfortunately  embedded. Took a lot of walks last summer before the flares started up. Docs put me on a 1 day dose of antibiotics, No bulls eye pattern. Right now I am just using 5% lidocaine (aspirin does not seem to help) ... and pouring over what everyone recommends here. Next step is perhaps to try some betablockers or gabapentin. So it is a mystery so far! \n\nAnyway, I just want to say how helpful it is to read your suggestions. It is nice to know I am not alone. This has been so awful! Ouch! Sorry to welcome you to the club. Looks like THEM to me too.\n\n&gt; Weirdly sometimes before a flare my hands and feet get ICY cold and white. \n\nThat is Raynaud's Phenomenon.  In Raynaud's the blood vessels abnormally constrict, forcing out blood. Due to the lack of blood the tissue turns white and cold. \n\nRaynaud's is sort of the opposite of THEM in which the blood vessels abnormally dilate and swell with blood turning the area red and hot.\n\nThough seemingly contradictory many patients experience both THEM and Raynaud's. Thank you for taking the time to reply. This makes sense to me. It is so bizarre but I guess it makes sense if it is some kind of vascular problem. This same exact thing happens to me! I get a tingly feeling and that is always raynuads and it is usually followed by a flare of redness. I literally just discovered this sub. Now I am not sure if I have psa or both? urgh.\n\nAre you doing anything for treatment? Good luck!! I am so sorry you are suffering! I recommend taking photos when it happens and getting with your doctor to check for various health conditions. For me, anything cool works but I try not to resort to that. Sometimes if my hands/feet  are cold, brisk walk helps\u2014but have to be careful not to trigger the THEM.  When that happens, sometimes I like to use a cooling lotion with menthol or something with lidocaine.", "So burning hands are not normal\u2026 It has been a few years at least since I have noticed that long walks and holding items made my feet/hands get red and burn, but I just figured it was normal. Recently, it is becoming more apparent that most people can use a broom or hold dumbbells without taking a break to let their hands \u2018cool off\u2019. \n\nSo right now, I am wondering if I should pursue a diagnosis. I am 25, and it seems like a fair amount of people that have THEM are older. Should I figure out if this is connected to some latent condition before things get worse? Also, now that I have got an idea about what this is, I physically feel worse, as in, my hands are burning while I am holding my phone to type this. Maybe that is psychosomatic, but maybe not.\n\nAt this point, I am rambling. Glad to have a lead on why I am uncomfortable most of the time, but just kind of upset to know that there is not a lot of data on this. Any advice on how to feel better/how to bring this up to a doctor/where to learn more?\n\nThanks in advance. My hands burn too &amp; it started last year for me (I am 21 btw.) My hands will get hot &amp; red &amp; swell up if I hold my phone or am walking my dog. I think being aware of yourself turning red can make it worse just because you become upset, at least that is how it works for me. I would say go for a diagnosis. Maybe you will find something easily fixable :) To aid a doctor in diagnosis,  take photos of your affected body parts when you are having a flare up so you can show the problem even if you do not flare during the appointment. \n\nFor THEM consideration take note of your feet, knees, cheeks, and ears in particular in addition to your hands.  If you have redness in those areas (without  an obvious cause) make a note of it even if it does not hurt.\n\nTake note of what makes things worse and what makes things better. Does heat or lowering your hands make it worse. Does cooling your hands under running tap water or raising your arms make it better?\n\nNote if either of your parents have similar symptoms. In about 15% of cases THEM seems to be genetic.\n\nWrite down any questions you particularly want to ask. Take someone with you to the appointment to take notes so your can focus on your conversation with the doctor and note forget the answers the doctor provides you. Not sure how connected it is to age. I am 19 but have had flare ups since I was 14ish but cannot remember exactly. I did not know about THEM until a couple months ago and before it felt like an itching sensation and after reading about THEM it only feels painful so I understand what you mean. I think it is up to what you want to do. In my case, I am putting off going to the doctor because there is no cure as of now and I do not feel at a point yet where I need to take medicine for it. I occasionally take magnesium pills which are supposed to help regulate blood pressure. This! As a doctor PLEASE take photos! I cannot remember when I first noticed the rashes, but I remember my feet, knees and upper arms going red and hot after showers. Since then it is developed to red, burning and swollen when it gets hot. I put it down to age.   I am 34 and had it since my mid 20s \ud83d\ude1e I had the same experience with assuming it was normal for years - mine probably started in my mid teens but it was only when my friends started to point it out and the pain got worse that I thought maybe it was not normal after all. I am 21 and just got my diagnosis last year. \n\nIn my opinion, it is good to get it checked out. Sometimes THEM is secondary to something else and the disorders it is most linked to are blood cancers so definitely worth erring on the side of caution, I think. If everything comes back fine and it is just primary THEM that is great and if you are in pain they can try some out some medications and see if any of them help.\n\nEven if nothing does help, I have found it is a relief to be able to say with certainty, \u2018this is what I have and now I can better understand how to manage it\u2019. It also explained a couple of other things that had not been concerning me exactly but it was interesting to know (mainly the icy coldness and purple discolouration after cooling from a flare).\n\nAs everyone has said, take pictures. You may have to specifically mention erythromelalgia as not a lot of GPs have heard of it. If you have tricky doctors who do not like being suggested a diagnosis you could mention that a friend in the medical profession mentioned it to you. Either way welcome and good luck! Mine definitely started when I was younger. It just got worse once I hit my early 40s. Like much worse \u2026. My THEM started when I was about 21... And has gotten worse as I have gotten older (I am almost 32). I am in an THEM FB group and there is parents of children with THEM there! I would not be surprised if the average age is older, but I do not think your age rules you out by any means.\n\nI def understand what you mean by being more aware and then it feeling worse. This has happened to me with several of my chronic illnesses. I think it is a normal psychological experience ~ having increased awareness brings the pain / discomfort to the forefront of the mind. Of course it def sucks!! But the heightened awareness does not last forever (if that is any comfort).\n\nFeel free to bring this up to a Dr, but unfortunately it is hard to find one that knows much about it :/ When I brought it up, they literally had to look it up in their database or whatever, they did not know what I was talking about... And then said \"Oh yeah that def fits.\" Lol. And then later I had to teach my primary care doctor how to pronounce it. So yeah... It sucks.\n\nBut maybe look for Drs who specialize in diabetes?? Because small fiber neuropathy (which THEM is a part of) is very common in diabetic patients. Idk, just an idea. Could also try to see a vascular specialist or neurologist, but both are hard to get in with. Do not mean to discourage you tho :/ This has just been my experience... Hopefully going into it with realistic expectations might help.\n\nI still have a naturopath recommended to me that I have been meaning to see! So that is another options to look into, if you are open to alternative medicine. (There are some naturopaths who are \"integrative medicine,\" which means they do Western medicine along with more natural methods! That is my preference.)\n\nThere is also a few medication options: Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN); Lyrica &amp; Gabapentin (same drug class). LDN is a newer treatment for THEM/SFN. Lyrica and Gabapentin can both have really hard side effects. But there are options at least! (I decided to try LDN, unfortunately it did not do anything for me... But maybe I did not try long enough.)\n\nI get the most relief from ice packs, fans, mobility aids as needed (shower stool and wheelchair). I can give more info on that if you want! Just let me know. This comment is already very long haha ;) But I hope this might help a bit!! \n\nOops I forgot not all THEM is necessarily SFN, but I think it is for me. Here is an article that may be helpful! THEM started as itching and heat for me! It was a long time (years!) before it became painful. Even when I got my diagnosis, I said \"well it is more burning than pain, but sometimes there is pain.\" And they said it did not matter, and that the difference between burning heat and burning pain is pretty subjective! Hope this might help :) If you use Facebook much, I def recommend the FB group! I think it is called \"Erythromelalgia warriors\"?? Let me know if you need help finding it. It is fairly active.", "Has anyone used Horse Chestnut Cream for THEM? It is used for varicose veins, hemorrhoids, and chronic venous insuffiency due to its vasoconstriction properties\u2026. I am wondering if anyone has used it on their feet for THEM. Never even heard of it to be honest. I was not aware there was a topical vasoconstrictor. Looks like it is herbal and reading a couple of reviews it may have a warming sensation for some people, so if you try it, make sure to just small spot test it before applying it to a large area. \n\nAlso, do you have Raynaud's? I read a couple of reviews where it seemed to help people who suffer from Chilblains (which can be associated with Raynauds). \n\nIf you end up trying it, please report back about your experience, okay? I have used it for hemorrhoids before and it is amazing for that. I do not recall it being warming though\u2026 haha. \n\nIt is herbal, comes from a tree. I cannot believe I never thought of using it for THEM before. I will report back! Definitely report back! Very interested!", "100% sure I have this Been getting hot when lying down for the past 3 years now and it is only gotten worse. The joints in my hands will get red and burn. My feet will do the same, except it is my entire foot. My face and ears also get red and warm. I can usually workout just fine in the morning but later in the day my symptoms are worse. Especially if I my body temperature starts to heat up.\n\nCooling helps, but if I use extreme cold it does not really do much. \n\nAre there any tricks I could try besides just cooling? Marijuana seems to make it worse because of the blood flow and warmness. It does help with the pain, but I have a breakout a few hours after smoking. I cannot live my life trying to stay cool 24/7. It is inconvenient and if the zombie apocalypse breaks out tomorrow I will not last. &gt;I cannot live my life trying to stay cool 24/7. \n\nAu contraire mon fr\u00e8re. We do. We all do.\n\n&gt;It is inconvenient and if the zombie apocalypse breaks out tomorrow I will not last.\n\nSwim for it. The zombies cannot swim and the water helps you shed body heat fast enough that your hands and feet do not get so hot and bothered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeriously, check the Physician Directory on the website of The  Erythromelalgia. Find a doctor on that list near you. Those doctors are familiar with erythromelalgia. They can help confirm a diagnosis and offer some treatment options.\n\nIn the meanwhile...  go barefoot as much as possible. Elevate your legs as you sleep. Use fans pointed at your feet and/or torso. Keep your feet out from under the covers. \n\nAnd whatever happens, **DO NOT** use ice cold water baths. THEM patients end up getting frostbite from overuse of ice. THEM sucks. THEM with frostbite sucks more. I never thought of swimming \ud83d\ude02 The other reason it is important to find a doctor (other than treatment to make you more comfortable) is because THEM is frequently a symptom secondary to another condition, most often blood or autoimmune conditions. And if you discover you have something else that is causing the THEM, it is important to treat the underlying cause.  \n\n\nI am also seconding the advice to use cool (not ice cold) gel packs in moderation.  Overdoing it can lead to ( which is when the flare returns even worse as soon as you stop the cooling, as well as the associated skin and nerve damage that it can cause. Interesting I will keep in mind the rebound flaring while cooling. I do have a high tryptase level that I have had for years but I have been able to keep my autoimmune under control without any meds. \n\nMy doctor thinks I am crazy for not taking antihistamines but every time I do they end up helping for like a month and then I start reacting to more things. Seconding this. Primary THEM is quite rare, especially if you are the only one in your family that has it, so the more likely culprit is some underlying issue causing secondary THEM (hear hoofs, think horses, not zebras).  If you are looking to prove primary THEM you can run a genetic test looking for the particular mutation that causes it.\n\nAlso Seconding the notion of over-cooling. I felt particularly useless one snowy day and decided the cold would provide an opportunity to be useful and shovel the driveway. Wound up with frostbitten toes. Do you know what blood issues? I am the only one with it in my family\u2026 and am having problmes with my heart and circulation as it is\u2026 I am within medical care but waiting times are so long the more advanced testing/looking into hasent happend yet I know it can be a symptom of a very rare (  Other than that, I do not know. I have heard of far more cases that occur secondary to multiple sclerosis, lupus, or other autoimmune conditions.    \n\n\nIt is possible that your circulatory problems are not the cause of THEM, but are making the symptoms worse. According to the above link primary THEM \"encompasses both inherited and idiopathic THEM.\"  Idiopathic means that there is no underlying cause that can be found, and this is the most common form. So if that is true, primary THEM is actually quite common, though I have have some doctors tell me it only refers to inherited THEM, which is estimated to affect only about 5-15% of THEM patients.   \n\n\nTo explain the \"hear hooves\" comment to OP, medical students are taught to remember that common things are common.  When they have patients come to them with symptoms (hoofbeats) that can be attributed to a common condition and to very rare conditions, it is much more likely to be the common one (horses) than the rare one (zebras).    \nSo it is much more likely that you have something else causing your THEM than it is that you have a rare genetic mutation, especially if you do not have a family history of it. Thankyou!! Try wild swimming - short walk and a cold swim :)", "Is this erythromelalgia? My twelve year-old daughter\u2019s hand last night next to her sister\u2019s and then mine  Are her hands cold or warm to the touch? Hmm, maybe. Hard to say because although the tops of her hands are red and somewhat inflamed, I notice that her fingers are not. I think erythromelalgia always involves the fingers and toes, when present in the hands and feet. \nI wonder if the redness is from constant hand-washing and sanitizing practices due to COVID ... Did she have this issue prior to the virus? Also, does she say it feels more like her skin is on fire\u2014or her veins are on fire? For me, it feels like my actual veins are on fire. \nOh, another thing: when do these attacks happen? If it is happening from specific triggers other than excessive hand-washing, such as exposure to heat, cold, exercise, stress, etc., then it could be erythromelalgia. \nGood luck! Very cold and if I touch her hands when they are like this there will be a white spot briefly where my finger was. She does not say her hands hurt at all. Sometimes they tingle. Her fingers do get discolored as well and her fingernails almost look purple. This has been happening recently in the evenings. Thanks for your response. The first thought that comes to my mind is Raynaud\u2019s syndrome? I am not a doctor but I think that is worth researching more about! Thanks very much for your reply. I will call her doctor today. Of course! Hope you all can get to the bottom of it. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffcYou are a great parent for seeking answers!! Oh, okay. I definitely did not mean to sound like I was dismissing your concerns, by the way. Could be the beginning stages of THEM or Raynaud\u2019s. I wonder if it is Raynaud\u2019s since you mention the purple fingernails. Only a specialist can tell you for sure. Good luck! :) Thanks so much, and you were not dismissive at all. I appreciate that you took time to respond! The doctor said she thinks it is Reynaud\u2019s, but was not certain. Of note many THEM patients also have Raynaud's.  So could be both.  Raynaud's is far more common, it seems, so her doctor may be more familiar with that and not THEM.\n\nRaynaud's characteristically exhibits with extremities going extremely pale as blood vessels contract.  THEM exhibits with extremities turning red as blood vessels dilate.

THEM is a neurological issue and it makes me wonder if there is a correlation. I had restless leg, but it was months before I developed THEM. My iron was pretty low at the time and once my doctor started me on iron supplements, the restless leg got better. I am curious if there is a connection, though! I have idiopathic but my restless leg syndrome runs through my moms side I also developed restless legs due to low iron. I am a nurse practitioner with THEM. I would ask to have iron AND ferritin checked. If it is low (optimal ferritin is between 40-70), feel free to message me. Many iron supplements are constipating and generally unpleasant, but I have found one that does not have ill effects. Once my levels were improved, my restless legs went away! Yippee! Interestingly, my iron levels are normal Not as normal as joe mama\n***\n^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Downvote ^to ^remove. ^( ^me ^if ^there is ^anything ^for ^me ^to ^know!

Twas fine.", "I think I have Erythromelalgia  For as long as I can remember, I have been having episodes of red blotchy skin that is super hot to the touch, on my face, chest, hands knees legs &amp; feet. Sometimes I think it is from eating certain foods or drinking alcohol, sometimes it is nerves that bring it out, if I am standing up for a while I get these weird spots on my legs that are white blotches and red. If I exercise I get it, go for a walk, stand at the sink and wash dishes, shower. I feel like I am constantly getting blotchy and hot spots. (Strangely enough I also get the opposite extreme where my hands and feet go stark white and are so cold, even if I put socks on and am under blankets my feet will not warm up, maybe reynauds?)\n\nI have never known what it was but finally did some research and I honestly think this has to be it. \nI have been having many symptoms that point to certain auto immune issues. Sjogrens, possible MS, and have family history of MS- my dads brother, my sister, and my mother has auto immune issues, Intercistial cystitis, mast cell disorder, among other stuff.\n\nI just emailed the Neurologist I recently began working with all of my symptoms in hopes she can help point me in the right direction. I went to my ENT last week because my parotid gland was swollen and painful and it is been reoccurring for 3 years now. It causes issues in my ear too. I also was diagnosed with dry eye syndrome after having a 2 week bout of severe eye pain. Those symptoms along with having dry mouth, joint pain. Fatigue, lead me to think it may be sjogrens or possibly stones in my gland. My ENt said no it is just TMJ and was so dismissive. \n\nI do not know who I would go to see for this type of issue but I know it seems to go along with other auto immune stuff. I think my body had been in a flare for a couple weeks now but finally starting to get a little better. Any and all advice welcome! I am a patient with diagnosed erythromelalgia, but am not a doctor or any sort of health care professional, so take this for what it is worth.\n\nLONG response ahead.\n\nSo sorry you are having such problems.\n\nThe hands going white and cold certainly sounds like Raynaud's Phenomenon.  Spot on.  RP usually starts from the tips of the fingers and/or toes, the skin going extremely pale and cold as the blood vessels constrict excessively.\n\nErythromelalgia usually primarily affects the feet, with some patients having symptoms in the hands and more rarely the ears and nose. Hallmarks are redness and pain, usually in both feet, with pain lessening if the affected area is cooled.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo...  as a sort of at-home quasi test you might want to consider briefly dipping you feet into cool (NOT ICY COLD) water when you noticed your feet redness and pain.  If the pain goes away within a few seconds then it is likely THEM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a member of an THEM specific discussion board.  I have not seen so many posters over there mentioning redness in the chest.  I can imagine it may be due to wonkiness in the control of blood vessel vasodilation and constriction.  So, maybe?\n\nYou mentioned possible relation of your symptoms to alcohol or certain foods.  Alcohol is well known to cause vasodilation and can worsen THEM symptoms.  Some patients mention problems after having certain foods, specifically spicy foods.\n\nMany Erythromelalgia patients also have  Raynaud's Phenomenon. That fits well.\n\nAs to finding a doctor...  finding a doctor familiar with THEM can be very challenging.  I found mine from a physician list over on The Erythromelalgia Association webpage.  (\n\nDoctors familiar with the condition are from varied specialties. Dermatologists, neurologists, and vascular medicine doctors seem to be frequently listed specialists on the TEA Physician List.  Mine is a vascular medicine doctor.\n\nGood luck getting a diagnosis confirmed.  There are treatment options that can help. Finding the right one for you may be tricky and take trying several options.  Do not get discouraged if the first treatment does not work.\n\nMeanwhile...  cool, but NEVER ICY COLD, foot soaks may help.  And a fan blowing across the affected areas may cool things off and relieve pain.  (Many patients who soak affected areas in ice water can actually cause serious skin damage. Do not do it.) Wow! So helpful thank you. I have been reading through the website and starting to look up docs in my area. I live outside of Boston so all of the docs are there. The Neurologist I just began to see is not on the list but I will bring it up to her since I have an already established relationship with her and see what she says/does. \nMy mother took so many pictures of me at my wedding because it was so bad the flare I was in. (That is what that chest picture is) it was down my shoulders too and on my feet and knees too. My feet knees and shoulders have always been a \u201chot spot\u201d.

My brother who is also a red head like me has the same issues. Has anyone had any issues having an MRI wth THEM? The last MRI I had I felt like my skin was burning and I had the red blotches. I was stressed because I am claustrophobic but eventually my breathing did calm down and I felt \u201cmentally\u201d better. I have read about other feeling like their MRI was burning them too. Being hypersensitive to, what feels like everything, I am not surprised this happened. Now that I have figured out it is probably THEM, I am thinking this could possibly have caused my burning sensation or made it worked. \n\nMy Neurologist emailed me back and wants me to get the MRI and pump and dump (I need the contrast she said and I am breastfeeding) \nI hate the idea of contrast because I am so sensitive to stuff. I have reactions to the stuff they inject me with when I get moles removed at my derm. Every single time I end up with a reaction where the site they inject swells up gets red and itchy.

I felt no difference at all with my THEM. No better. No worse.\n\nSo many THEM patients have many other medical issues. Perhaps it is other conditions being exacerbated by the contrast?  Not sure how the magnetic field of the scan could cause a change in your THEM condition. I felt the burning without contrast last year during the MRI.

She is stopped drinking alcohol avoiding spicy food and taking gabapentin, cymbalta, aspirin, and maybe another medication not sure. I just got her cbd tincture and bio freeze products that I read can help shes yet to try them. I know constant cold water/ air flow can cause damage. How do you all go about treating it? What helps you? Also she is about to go to a high elevation area (mammoth ca) we live in la county. Can high elevation make it worse? I am looking for any kind of help short/long term solutions anything would be appreciated. I am sorry you are all dealing with this horrid disease. Oh also so far for her(multiple tests done by numerous drs) this is not secondary it is just here by it is lovely self. Thank you all for any and all help. Sorry if I cannot provide much input as I do not know anyone with THEM, so I am not sure how severe it can get. In my case (I am 20M), I go about life without much care about triggering it. THEM has not debilitated me to that point yet. Not to say it is not very painful. I am just stubborn. If it happens I just go through the pain of it and somehow manage to move on, especially if I am busy, but if I am watching TV or just chilling, it is bad. In that case, I find that keeping the extremity elevated prevents flare-ups AND makes them more manageable. I find that if I have been laying down for too long and suddenly stand up or lower an extremity, I will immediately get a flare-up, and if the environment is hot, oh boy. I am in for a painful one. A fan pointing to the feet is a good idea if you feel a flare-up coming. Basically, when I am not doing anything, the flare-ups get bad. If I am in a shopping mall or working on college stuff and I get a flare-up, yes, my hands and feet have already reached the depths of hell before my sould does, but I can usually just carry on. It could be the case that my case of THEM is relatively mild, so again, I am sorry if these do not help much. Also, my flare-ups get really bad only during summer, so right now I am talking from a position where I have not seen the worst of my THEM in a while. When I think of my future with THEM, I just think that I am going to have to get deep into meditation and pain management. I am already playing with mindfulness and it helps the most. It does not reduce the pain at all, but it makes it so I can carry on with my life while I am in pain and not let it get in the way.\n\nAll of these just help me with my THEM. Hopefully they can be useful to someone else. In my case, I have found what works is primary THC strains pretty regularly along with daily antihistamines like allegra D (edit: cetirizine worked better! but it put me to sleep all day). And if it is a really bad flare, high strength benadryl and sleeping in a cool room under a fan. Antihistamines do not work for everyone, but if she has not tried them yet, then it is worth a shot.\n\nWhen it comes to cannabis and pain relief - CBD is for inflammation, THC is for nervous system.  THC is actually a neuroprotectant and works on the nervous system itself for pain relief.  The best pain relief is a combination.  THEM is a neurological disease, in that it is nerve pain, not inflammation.\n\n(\n\nThe reason why antihistamines seem to work for some people:\n\n(\n\nEdit::High altitude should not make it worse. If anything, the cooler temps should help make the symptoms a little easier to manage.\n\nI have primary THEM and mine just woke up as well. My sympathies. When I do not take my medication (cannabis and antihistamines) I am covered in a second degree burn which is crazy painful.  Exercise, sunlight, alcohol, spicy foods, anything that causes vascular changes really will trigger either a local or a widespread flare up.\n\nAlso, for me, the maximum temperature I can be at is about 68 degrees.  Once its above 75, the medication does not work anymore. Below 75, the medication keeps it in check. Without the medication, I am just in a constant flare.\n\nHopefully this info helps! Thank you so much for responding and being helpful. I wish you a good day and flare free. She is not really a fan of weed (panic attacks/hates the feeling) but she is used edibles in the past for sleep issues. I will mention this to her that it can help. She is just not big on the mental affects of weed unfortunately but the flairs may eventually outweigh the negatives. She has allergies and takes non drowsy allergy medication daily not sure if it has antihistamines or not I will mention this to her as well. Thank you so much for responding I really appreciate it. I wish you a good day and flare free. Start small.  Single hit, wait 15 minutes. She also had a frontal brain tumor 4ish years ago so smoking really bugs he nasal area so she will be strictly edibles. I take the same approach myself tho for smoking. Just a lil but I wait 30. You can always get higher but you cannot get un high. For me, CBD does nothing and it shouldnt necessarily because the nature of THEM wouldnt be alleviated by it. THC is the only thing that does anything for me other than a fan. As for gabapentin, it has been pumped into my system unnecessarily after an AMPS diagnosis. It does little to nothing for me and doctors other than the one prescribing it have told me it doesnt do much of anything for anyone. THEM is aspirin reactive in primary i believe. I never looked into it as i personally cannot take aspirin either way.\n\nI was prescribed cymbalta years ago and had an awful reaction in terms of mentally and i dont quite remember how i physically felt as i had a conglomerate of untreated issues at the time i was prescribed it but I have speculated it may have triggered THEM just because of the timeline. I started having sporadic flare ups after that point and eventually they became widespread, more painful and almost always going on in one body part at minimum within the last few months. My reaction to the drug was so bad that i initially thought maybe it could have. Take what im saying pretty lightly its different for everybody but always helpful to hear other stories. I would look in to how cymbalta reacts with sodium channels, you never know. Unless you find a doctor that is slap happy willing to delve into solutions whether that be a trial and error process based on the pathology of THEM or even pain management, idk if theyll do much. I would look in to that as im uncertain which medications they try other than gabapentin and sodium channel blockers. I dont think they give them very often. I dont know how successful the sodium channel medications are, i cant recall the outcome of the studies ive read off of the top of my head but they might interfere with her current prescriptions anyway and you will be back at square one. Its a crappy mess of an illness and a holistic approach seems to be the answer from what ive read about other people's experiences.", "Do your flares always have triggers? Is there always an obvious trigger when you flare?\n\nFor context, I can easily recognise triggers and they are pretty predictable (heat, exercise, alcohol, etc) in my three problem areas which are feet, hands and knees (in that order). \n\nA more recent issue is that sometimes at night I get what looks like flares but seems slightly different. They have no identifiable trigger, and are not always symmetrical, unlike my predictable flares. It is most noticeable on my face and my knees, because my face is not affected by my usual flares and the burning in my knees is much more intense than usual, as my knees tend not to get too bad.\n\nMy doctors do not actually know all that much about THEM - they would never even heard of it before I brought it to them - so it is hard to ask them about it without sounding like I am just describing classic THEM symptoms.\n\nAm I overthinking this? Can you always pinpoint triggers or do flares just happen sometimes?", "What season do you flare up usually occur? \n\n( Only time I have not had flare ups is during the summer", "Anyone develop this after having an ED? I think restricting calories led me to Raynauds which then has led me to maybe having THEM? Anyone else have this experience :( I am not diagnosed with THEM yet, but have all the symptoms. I unfortunately did not have any issues until I started restricting/anorexia. They did not start right away but soon after I started trying to recover. I think we put our bodies under so much stress that they are just reacting now. It is the only thing I can really think of.\n\nEdit: I had raynauds that now turned into more like THEM Wow, interesting to hear someone with the same! I definitely only noticed it after I started eating normally again - as if my body was trying to circulate the blood extra to compensate for months of freezingness \ud83d\ude2dHow long have you been experiencing THEM type issues? Yep exactly, it all started when I began eating again. I did not do it in a very healthy way either, I was so starving that I ate everything in sight to where I made myself sick. The typical binge and restric cycle. Oh the joys! I noticed the raynauds started about 2 or 3 years ago and the THEM about a little over a year ago. Yes! So horrible. I am just keeping a very small and probably misguided glimmer of hope that these symptoms will just faaaaade awaaayyy one day.. I think it is possible! If we can get our bodies out of this constant state of stress, I have a feeling these symptoms can greatly improve if not be solved entirely. Believing this helps me at least. Best of luck to you! Yes, I have. I suffered from severe anorexia and subsequent heart problems because of it. I have been diagnosed with THEM but it has not yet been linked by doctors to my past ED. I have always suspected they are linked, however. Yes! And somehow i can reduce flares by limiting intake, only eating clean foods. Some of the coping mechanisms have me walking a tight rope after completing defeating and conquering anorexia. I do love food now though, and i am a healthy weight ", "Does humidity make your guys THEM worse? Not sure if any of you have experimented with this. But just curious if anyone who is been properly diagnosed has seen if humidity or dryer climates affect them?", "Does anyone else flair if their limb is left dangling? My toes get really red when left below my heart. Same thing with my hands. I also get red toes, hands, and knees in the shower. Yep! My feet will flare if they dangle off the couch, too. Yep, mostly my hands. yea gravity can actually be a trigger and elevation can momentarily relieve some of the burning.  It is obnoxious. If I sit for too long, or cross my legs, my feet and ankles swell and start to mottle. \n\nIn the heat my toes, top of feet and knees go pink. As well as the mottling and swelling.\n\nIf it is hot enough it develops into pitting oedema. Dangling my arm turns my right hand purple sometimes.\n\nOverall elevating my legs helps, some. Being sure to stretch my legs and not sty in the same position too long seems to help.  Moving my feet in little circles by flexing at the ankles seems to helps a little too - maybe nothing more than distracting me from the pain? Yeah whenever I sit my feet look like marbled meat.", "do i have erythromelalgia? ive been having some symptoms that kind of resemble what i find online about erythromelalgia, but the pain isnt that bad to make me actually concerned about it.\nbasically, when i exercise or just am in a relaxation state or when i enter a warm room, my hands and feet turn bright red and when this goes on for long enough my feet start itching a lot and then it starts coming from the inside of my feet giving a slight burning feeling and it wont stop at all, all while being bright red. my brother has the same thing happen to him in the same situations too. but yeah i dont have any actual pain stuff and this doesnt bother me that much because its not actual pain but more like burning itch and its copable...\n\nis this erythromelalgia or am i normal lol Possibly. I have clearcut THEM but no pain, per se. just a throbbing red burning. But not \u201cpain\u201d. Take a photo next time it happens. Sounds like mine, i have no pain too. Extremeties turn red, where i differ is my viens in my arms and legs dilate huge too. But sounds exactly like THEM to me. I have a simular case to you but i find if i dont eat  food with \"wheat\" i can definitly cope and go about my day well", "Time to move to Minnesota?  As an FYI, they are super picky in their THEM patients.\n\nI applied awhile back (you have to apply to get a doctor's appointment) and they called me and essentially told me my case was not interesting enough for them.\n\nI wanted to be seen because my uncle died at 39 of a myeloproliferative disorder (associated with THEM) so I thought they would want to be super thorough but apparently not, haha.\n\nBut: they were total open to if my case got a lot worse or I struggled to get adequate treatment here (I have a formal diagnosis) that I should be in touch in the future and they would likely see me. I respect them for this and think this makes sense; they are a research hospital, they want the weird, bizarre cases to study. I respected that they were very upfront with me and willing to take me if mine changes/gets worse, or if I have new developments. My main motivator in being seen was the strong familial connection, not so much because I was super severe or what have you.\n\n(For the record, I am totally fine as of now and my THEM was quite manageable compared to most. We run tests like crazy every couple months but we are pretty sure my THEM is secondary to SLE or vasculitis. The only reason mine \"was\" managed well rather than \"is\", is because mine responded really great to NSAIDs. Until I was diagnosed with Lupus Nephritis and now I cannot have NSAIDs. I think I can still do topical NSAIDs? TBD, seeing doctor soon!) fascinating.  \n\n\nI have also got the strong family ties, but without the lupus.  In my case it started in childhood.  It is managed easily enough though through cannabis and antihistamines.  Mine is a little unusual in that its more widespread throughout my body, and may have been worsened by a negative reaction to plaquenil.  \n\n\nIn any case, I live in Oregon and am only on state insurance, not medicaid, so I will not be applying any time soon lol. The family ties only matter if you have primary THEM, so if not clear, I am the only one in my family with THEM, which is how we know its not primary! \n\nTHEM is usually a dead giveaway for a myeloproliferative disorder, hence why I applied to be seen at Mayo. Myel disorders are just about always fatal, so I did not want to fuck around with them. \n\nMy blood work is clear though, so now its just figuring out what causes mine. Prob lupus or vasculitis -- its a small list on what can cause it. \n\nWhat did they have you on Plaquenil for? We were trying to figure out what was going on.  Part of my weirdness was the appearance of really strange rashes. The first skin biopsy came back psoriasis. The second skin biopsy came back tumid lupus. And the third came back persistent bug bite reaction lol.\n\nThe plaquenil was to treat the \"tumid lupus and persistent bite reaction\".  It definitely did not help the THEM.  But after about a year on plaquenil the tumid lupus bumps went away and have not come back.  Still have to see if they come back in the summer.\n\nTumid Lupus is not lupus.  It is a weird skin disease that has an inaccurate name lol.  Its also possible that the skin biopsies were being affected by the THEM which seems to appear 'sometimes' in skin biopsies but in no predictable way meaning THEM cannot be diagnosed by skin biopsy.  In some of what I read, the skin biopsies looked like both \"tumid lupus\" and my \"persistent bug bite reaction\" biopsy results, but I am not going to press it anymore since they have essentially stopped. Even though I stopped the plaquenil months ago.\n\nAll my blood work is also clear.  In my case, there is definite family history of THEM and it began in my childhood.  The rashes started about 5 years ago, then slowly got worse over time. Then got really bad. Then I started the plaquenil and had a really terrible reaction.  Then we restarted the plaquenil, no reaction and after a while it stopped the rashes.  Stopped the plauqenil over the winter so that the rheumatologist could have an easier time testing my weirdness, and so far the rashes have not come back. Which is really weird. lol So, I am actually a Rochester resident and my wife is a Mayo employee with THEM. A couple years ago she went through lots of testing and they essentially gave her a prescription for a topical cream to treat it. I was pushing for gabapentin too due to nerve pain that had become near permanent from THEM flaring and borderline autoimmune disorder. I am also a health professional though I do not prescribe. They were not willing to discuss. She does not use the cream either as there is chance of seizure. That sucks. I am sorry for your experience there.\n\nI do not know how it is in Minn, but I have had extraordinary results with cannabis.  THC is a neuroprotectant and it (used to) shut off the pain entirely for me.  Now it does not shut it off as much, so adding antihistamines has helped.  THC still gives me a massive improvement in pain before adding any other meds though.\n\nGood Luck!", "Grateful to find this group! More info + a couple questions in comments. ", "Just recently learned about this condition after researching symptoms. This is what it looks like when I start flaring up. It becomes worse than this, but I just snapped this pic. I usually end up swelling up more, and getting more red &amp; hot. Do you think this is erythromelalgia?  Maybe? Does it *hurt*?\n\nIs that red dot on your ring finger something that comes and goes? It looks like a blood blister which is not common in THEM.\n\nCould also be Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, allergic dermatitis, mastocytosis, or palmar erythema among others. I mean it varies from being extremely uncomfortable to painful. It is been happening to me for most of my life, mainly feet &amp; hands, but i never really investigated it until it started happening more frequently and multiple romantic partners commented on the radiating heat.\n\n I know this sounds dumb, but I kind of thought it was something that happens to everyone because of the saying \"cool side of the pillow.\" The cool side of the pillow is often a source of major relief when I am trying to sleep, so I thought it was for other people, too lol...\n\nIdk how I got that blood blister, but no, that is not normal. Got it a week ago somehow. Any chance others in your family have similar symptoms?  One parent, grandparent, your child, siblings? \n\nIn about 15% of cases THEM is genetic. It can be inherited in a autosomal dominant pattern which just means you only have to get it from one parent. An affected person has a 50% chance of passing it on. It is *possible* that it could be genetic but you are the only affected person in your family as new mutations can rarely happen.\n\nPain plus redness, especially in the feet and/or hands, are hallmark signs of THEM. When you experience this redness try running your hands/feet under cool tap water (just a bit below room temp).  If the redness and pain go away within a few seconds and then return as your body warms up then that would be consistent with THEM. If the cool water does nothing that would be more consistent with some form of allergic cause.", "Erythromelagia  Been recently diagnosed with erythromelagia finally and a good majority of medication has not worked, does anyone have any similar looks and what worked for them? Your redness patterns look really similar to mine. Ugh. I was also just diagnosed so I do not have any medication advice, unfortunately. Do you know if your THEM is secondary to another condition, or did it just pop up?  It was primary Also primary here;  antihistamines and cannabis have helped me tremendously.\n\nAvoid sunlight.\nAvoid heat. Get an AC unit if you can.\nStay hydrated with cool drinks\nAvoid serious cold as you can inadvertently injure yourself. Just because yours looks similar to another's does not mean the same medications will work.\n\nYou said your THEM is primary. Some (not sure if most) of primary THEM is due to a genetic defect in the Nav1.7 sodium channel. There are medicines that are usually used to treat other conditions but which happen to block the sodium channel and are more likely to help such patients.\n\nSo no idea if you have tried one, but Carbamazepine (brand name is Tegretol) is one such medication which is normally used as an anticonvulsant for epilepsy patients but I have heard is sometimes helpful for THEM patients. Might be worth a try if you have not yet.\n\nA lot of sodium channel blockers are used to treat epilepsy or heart arrhythmia. Mexiletine is often used in THEM patients and is a heart anti-arrhythmia drug.", "How often do you have flare ups? \n\n( They have gotten more and more frequent.", "Questions to ask for first Rheumatology appointment Hello, everyone!  I am so happy to have found this community where others can 100% relate!\n\nBrief background - I have had Raynaud's for many, many years, same with my siblings.  I have been hypermobile all of my life and have dealt with many slow healing injuries, pain, etc.  Diagnosed with POTS back in 2016 (currently managed) and began experiencing terrible issues with not being able to control my body temperature.  Thought it was POTS related due to the ANS dysfunction &amp; the docs saying SFN is adding to everything.  I kept bringing up to my doctors why (mainly) my hands &amp; feet were getting red &amp; hot after eating, being in the sun, in warm temps, with activity, etc. but nothing really came from it.  Fast forward to last year, I got an official diagnosis (totally diagnosed myself in 2019) of erythromelalgia since I brought photos to show my hot, red hands &amp; feet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat questions did everyone ask at their initial appointment?  Are there any other tests that are suggested to rule in or out whether this is primary or secondary THEM? They are pretty good about knowing what kinds of tests to go with, but for your sake, --   \n\n\nAn \"ANA\" test can indicate autoimmune diseases, arthritis, and other issues that need to be ruled out.  \n\n\n\"C-Reactive Protein\" checks for inflammation issues like autoimmune diseases  \n\n\nmetabolism and blood count tests to rule out dietary causes\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPossibly allergy tests\n\n  \nBut basically they can see something is wrong, so they will have to disprove a few things before they settle. Thank you!  Great info! I forgot to say I my PCP did an ANA which can back low positive &amp; speckled.\n\nWhat dietary issues can cause THEM? \n\nI actually have an appointment with my allergist coming up due to possible food intolerance.  I will certainly see what their perspective is on this as well. its not that it causes THEM, its that you can have weird skin issues that 'looks like but is not'  \n\n\nif your iron is crazy or your other things are crazy, it can mess up your kidneys or liver, which in turn causes a problem that \"looks like\" THEM. Got it.  Good info for others to consider. You and your siblings have Raynauds?  Do any of them have THEM symptoms with redness and pain?\n\nHypermobile joints, THEM, temperature dysregulation, and POTS make me suspicious of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome. \n\nWould you say your physical features include hypermobile fingers and toes, unusual facial features (such as a thin nose and lips, large eyes and small earlobes)?  \n\nTHEM is hereditary in about 15% of cases. This is \"primary THEM\".\n\nEDS can also be hereditary. \n\nBoth THEM and Vascular EDS can can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern meaning you would only need to inherit it from one parent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for running off on this tangent, but for this appointment do not self edit. Do not fail to mention any signs or symptoms thinking they are unrelated. Mention hypermobility and ask if EDS could be implicated. yea its why its a rare disease, because a lot of the time it is something that looks like THEM that gets diagnosed instead. My sister &amp; I have always had Raynaud's and my niece seemingly does too.  My sister gets blood pooling in the hands &amp; feet but no hotness/pain.  My brother gets red &amp; hot ears but I was trying to see if there is pain.  The problem is that people think pain = ouch and forget pain can be a burning feeling.\n\nI do not have very hypermobile fingers (only failed Beighton test so 7/9) and no unusual facial features.

I have been experience more depression and anxiety than usual as my symptoms keep getting worse. \n\nMy MRIs show nothing remarkable. I am scheduled for an EMG and NCS. Doc\u2019s note also mentioned possible looking into autonomic nervous system.\n\nAnyone have any similar experiences to share? Hi! I am sorry you are going through all this. I have a lot of similar symptoms (numbness, strange sensations, twitches and jerks \u2014 I also have hypothyroidism, but it is been controlled with medication for a decade). I do not have tachycardia or muscle tenderness, but I do have joint issues and a balance problem. I also have microvascular disease in my heart, which is interesting since THEM is an issue in the skin\u2019s microvascular system. THEM came raging on for me earlier this year and affects my feet, knees, hands, face and ears. I am also in the process of being diagnosed \u2014 I have an upcoming brain MRI and a first neurology appointment next month. The waiting for referrals and tests is so hard. I am here to commiserate! If you do not mind me asking, what is the name of the microvascular issue in your heart? I am just now starting a calcium channel blocker trials for my THEM. My recent appointment with the doctor that helps me with my THEM said that they are finding more evidence that THEM is either vascular or neurological and knowing how yours originates is key to choosing potential drugs/treatments to help. \n\nAlso, OP, I have POTS (a type of dysautonomia) it causes bad fatigue, dizziness, and brain fog, though I have never had trouble saying long words just problems remembering words and with recall. Welcome to the club!  Sounds a lot like my journey.  37 male, issues went from barely noticeable to insane over about 5 years.   Chronic fatigue, pain, and other related issues.    \n\n\nDid you have any issues with hot water sensitivity when you were younger? Or did this just appear out of the blue?  Do you have any family with a similar issue?  \n\n\nIt sounds like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is mixed in there as well.  I also have that issue. With Secondary THEM, the Fatigue can be caused by the autoimmune problem. With Primary, you can just also have fatigue problems lol.  Interestingly, they were suspecting hashimotos with me too, but only my TSH levels are high, my actual thyroid levels are normal so they do not think treating my thyroid will help anything.  \n\n  \nI recommend that you check out the patients guide on (  They also have an (outdated) physician locator so that you can hopefully find a local specialist to help.  \n\n\nTreatments vary from person to person, but things you can try without having to wait for a doctor appointment:  Antihistamines.  About 40% of primary THEM patients have had success with antihistamine treatment.  It is not because there is an allergy involved, its because of the secondary effects that antihistamines have on your nerves and capillary blood pressures.  Cannabis.  Cannabis works directly on the pain system in your nervous system. It reduces the \"volume\" of the signal being sent on the Nav1.7 channel which is where the THEM pain occurs (in primary them anyway).  CBD and THC work best together to treat the pain, instead of just CBD or just THC.  Cooling also works to a point.  There is a magic temperature that is different for everyone but seems to hover around the mid-60s. As long as you are below that temp, you can avoid the more serious flares.  Cooling can also be an issue if you are triggered by \"rewarming\". You can also accidentally injure your skin if you go too cold for too long.  \nBlurry vision:  I have been there for the last couple years as well.  Intense dry eye that did not seem like dry eye.  (Now I have anterior basement membrane dystrophy and need surgery to fix BOTH my eyes).  My docs do not really know if the dry eye is because of the THEM, or because of my other health issues.  For me, its way too much of a coincidence in timing for it to not be related to my THEM.  According to my opthamologists, the only dry eye drops that are actually safe to use on a long term basis are: Theratears Dry Eye Therapy. It is preservative free which is the more important part for long term use. I have coronary microvascular disease. I started having chest pain while running or stressed out. (I felt it in my chest, left arm/shoulder, upper back and the left side of my jaw.) I had a stress test that was abnormal, then a cardiac MRI/stress test that showed I am not getting enough oxygenated blood to my heart muscle so it is not keeping up with demand. I asked my cardiologist if the THEM could be related to the microvascular disease and he said he wonders if there is a connection because I have microvascular dysfunction in two organs \u2014 my skin and my heart. It is all really interesting... aside from being a pain in the ass, of course! i had some issues with tachycardia during my THEM's \"waking up\", but now that I have THEM all over, my tachycardia has stopped...  so weird. It is interesting that you say that! My heart rate tends to be really low (upper 40s/low 50s) and I also have low blood pressure BUT it has been elevated a bit since my THEM started. Hi. I am sorry you are going through all that. I have had THEM for 10 years (the sudden onset kind). Every possible test came back normal, except for a 214 on my anti double stranded dna antibody test, which has flummoxed everyone.\n\nI also have extreme fatigue and migraines. I have occasional tachycardia, and \u201ccoat hanger pain\u201d which is pretty common with THEM. Also, I barely sweat, which makes hot weather brutal.  I have low blood pressure. \n\nI made my way from Kaiser to UCSF to Stanford, and their autonomic disorders clinic has been a godsend. I am so much better since they put me on a couple of meds. I hear that autonomic clinics are available in every state now, so hopefully access will be easier (but you might be in line with the new covid cases)\n\nI have been reading lately that THEM is a version of small fiber neuropathy.  I did have a nerve biopsy and it found mild degeneration.\n\nInterestingly, the doctor almost immediately said my calves were wasting (!). I thought I just had bird legs. After genetic testing, they found a VUS that is related to HSAN2D, which does have calf wasting. So I am just waitin\u2019 to see if someone surfaces with the same defect.\n\nThe things that saved me early on were an adjustable bed to raise my feet (you can buy just the frame, much cheaper than a hospital bed). Lidocaine cream worked ok, but I did better with just Klonopin to knock me out on a bad night. Capsaicin cream was BAD for me.\n\nI would advise keeping your chin up, and forcefully advocating for yourself. I lost a lot of time listening to doctors telling me I did not have THEM. I finally just went in to the doctor and said \u201cI cannot fucking take it anymore\u201d. That worked wonders. \n\nGood luck! I get rashly from hot showers and have always been heat sensitive actually! Thanks for all the advice. Check out \n\nFor info on primary erythromelalgia vs secondary", "What is the normal treatment for THEM? Obviously no cure yet (hopefully soon lol) but what did most of you get prescribed for? I was diagnosed mid 2020 and so far all I have been given is antihistamines, sedatives to help me sleep and low antidepressants. My doctor did not even give me anything, I found out that I take a medication that could be dangerous with THEM. So if anyone knows anything, please tell! There is not one \"normal\" treatment. If your THEM is secondary to another condition, treating whatever the underlying cause is can often reduce or eliminate the THEM symptoms. If not, various things can be tried to reduce the pain caused by it. What works for you is a matter of trial and error.  Personally, I have tried: gabapentin, low-dose aspirin, IV and topical lidocaine and IV and topical ketamine, cyproheptadine, capsaicin patches called Qutenza, mexiletine, celecoxib (Celebrex), meloxicam, and more I am probably forgetting.   \n\n\nI have also tried azathioprine (Imuran) and IVIg because my THEM seems to be autoimmune.   \n\n\nThe only one I still take is gabapentin because it helps a little.   \n\n\nI recommend showing your doctors ( if you are looking for options to try because it is a good overview of all the things that have worked for some other patients. It really is a trial and error process for each patient.\n\nI was prescribed mexiletine as the first thing we tried and it has worked quite well for me.  Damn lucky, I know.\n\nOthers struggle through one failed therapy after another. So sorry to hear that.\n\nSome patients get relief with some basic OTC drugs like aspirin or antihistamines. Does not work for everyone. Might be worth a try if it is not a problem with your other medication.", "My doc says I have raynauds but I am not fully convinced. I get this heat multiple times daily and in my toes and ears as well. Hands and feet and are completely red when I shower. Can anyone relate?  Me!! A doctor took a quick look at my ears, said Raynaud's and then did not give me any more info. I got hot &amp; red, never cold &amp; blue. I saw a dermatologist who recognized it as THEM. My ears are red and hot currently lol. Makes it hard to sleep Same my feet will literally be on fire and keep me up all night :( but my toes turn cold and blue/purple daily too so I really do not know You can have both. Many patients have both Raynaud's and Erythromelalgia.  Your photo looks more like an THEM flare.\n\nIn a Raynaud's flare the blood vessels constrict forcing blood out of the affected extremity which then appears very pale.  Patients often report cold affected areas.\n\nIn an THEM flare the blood vessels dilate and swell with blood turning the affected areas red. Patients usually present with burning pain. Feet are most commonly affected with some patients also having symptoms in their hands, ears, and/or cheeks. Thank you for the info! Thanks! I have both. My feet are frozen and purple 90% of the time and red and on fire the rest. Moderation is not my body\u2019s specialty haha. this exactly happens to me :( mostly after i am washing my hands or washing veggies or something. this EXACT pattern of red/white.. it burns too so bad It is like super hot and heavy and inflamed. Were you diagnosed w erythromelalgia? to be honest, i was not yet but I am 99% positive myself. i have been misdiagnosed under some misc rosacea category for 1 year. like I have had raynauds for a few years in my hands and feet, numb and purple mostly all day (esp feet) but.. now for the whole entire last year i have been experiencing these exact heat flares. my cheeks started and then my ear(s) and then my hands and feet.. all at different times.  so either numb and freezing or these extremely burning and hot inflammation. and yes i can def relate to the shower comment as well. it is a nightmare.. Literally same i am 99% sure i have it. i also have raynauds my toes are always purple but this is different. i get it throughout the day and always just before i go to sleep. but what do i even do now? is there treatment or anything to help? do i need to go to a new doctor and get diagnosed? im so lost lol i completely understand... :( i have the same questions, my current derm is the best of the best where i am from, but he had no idea about this. so i am not sure if i look for another derm? another dr completely? try to figure out what tests i need done :( from my understanding, if the person has both raynauds AND erythromelalgia then like some of the \u201ctreatments\u201d that can help JUST erythromelalgia like (lodocaine patch/ice cold treatment) might actually exacerbate the raynauds issue? so i have not done any. I get mine mostly at night as well. i think mine is centered around medications i take??? i am 26, it is pretty confusing to me rn. i have some ideas? but honestly it is so hard to say anymore.. msg me if u want to talk about anything, maybe we can see if we can connect any dots. &lt;3 good luck regardless", "Pics of my flares.. goes with my previous post \ud83d\ude02 ", "I have a few questions about THEM Hi guys, I hope everyone is doing well. I have recently found out about THEM, and I was wondering if any of you experience the burning sensation and warmth without your skin getting red. I have been experiencing weird symptoms for the past 2 months which started out acutely and my GP does not really know what is happening. \nOut trusty friend Google suggested I might want to look into THEM so that is why I am here. The very definition of THEM related to pain and redness.\n\nThere are other conditions that could account for burning pain without redness. Small Fiber Neuropathy might account for your symptoms. Not saying it is impossible that you are experiencing THEM, but without redness I am doubtful. Oh I see, thank you for the response! I will look into other conditions too then. I do not get redness almost at all, but the burning pain is there. I have had THEM for about 10 yrs. It started with just itching and heat in my feet. No discoloration at all. It continued like that for years.\n\nThen later there was occasional discoloration... Sometimes red, sometimes purple. And when it was a very bad flare, I would have pain. But mostly I considered it to be \"burning\" and not \"pain.\"\n\nThis is when I got diagnosed. I was concerned that I did not have \"enough pain\" for the diagnosis. The Dr said, \"Oh I am not worried about that. The difference between burning/heat and pain is subjective... What one person would call heat, another would call pain.\"\n\nIn the last few years, I have experienced a LOT more clear pain. A lot more discoloration (bright red, deep purple). It spread to my hands and face and rest of my body. (Although feet are the worst.) It feels / looks like textbook THEM now. But it did not for a long time. (I was misdiagnosed with athlete's foot in the early yrs.)\n\nSo yeah, I def think you could have THEM! Not everyone has every symptom. It does not look the same in everyone. I think when symptoms are more severe, it can make it more clear. So if your THEM gets worse, it might become more obvious. But not everyone is THEM gets worse (thankfully!).\n\nHopefully my story helps. Def worth talking to your Dr about! But be prepared that they often do not know much about THEM, as it is more rare. Do your own research. There are ways to manage symptoms. There are meds to try. Whether you have a diagnosis or not, you can still try things, bring up med ideas to treat symptoms. Good luck!!! Highly recommend ( Important Q: What part(s) of your body do you experience your symptoms? Thank you so much for all the info! Glad if I can help!! The bridge of my nose and forehead area mostly, but after doing a bit more research I think it is unlikely I have THEM. I just checked if my skin responds to any of the triggers for THEM and it does not seem to, not even to hot water. I think my problem might be dermatological or psychological in nature. \n\nBut thank you so much for all the information! Everyone on this sub seems amazing and so loving and welcoming. \nLearning about this condition has really opemed my eyes about the need for more medical research. \nI will be donating to the THEM association in hopes that will be of some help \u2665\ufe0f OH I see! Yeah dermatological sounds likely. If it gets worse in the future, I would still keep THEM in mind tbh. But hope you get it figured out! And that is so kind of you!! Aw my heart is so touched. Thank you for that \ud83d\udc97 I will definitely keep it in mind, thank you so much!

New to the sub, going through a diagnosis of Erythromelalgia. \n\nI have had a constant flare since early May.

I am 100% gluten-free.)\n\nWhat is everyone doing for exercise? Do you treadmill &amp; just blast yourself with a fan? Like, I am having a hard time just existing, I could not imagine doing hard cardio right now. But if this is my new normal, I have to figure out something. Gentle yoga in the basement? \n\nAny suggestions? I hope you find something that works for you.  I think trial and error is the best approach here. Personally, I cannot exercise at all, not one iota. Exercises of any kind is a trigger and yet I still do it. I have to have a fan while on a treadmill. I also keep a plastic spray bottle filled with ice water to spray my face or areas that are worse. I used to love distance but now I get my workout done as fast for the shortest amount of time. \n\nI mean if I am in a flare then I might as well push through but there are times when I cannot get out of bed. \n\nGood luck! Thank you for this! I do yoga, and small amounts of cardio. Like maybe 2-4 minutes at a time a couple times a day if I can manage it. But that is only when it is cool enough. Thank you!", "Them  Hello everyone,\n\nSo exactly one year ago ,I woke up in the evening post an afternoon nap and my palms and feet felt hot. \n\nI was suffering from a upper respiratory tract infection and had been taking some anti histamines for that. \n\nNow this flare up was sudden and took me by surprise. I thought I had temperature and that it would subside.\n\nThe initial few days were quite bad and the palms and sole felt like they were burning . Touching any other part of the skin with my palms felt hot. \n\nThere was also marked red colour in the above mentioned areas which was not present before.\n\nNow I have visited numerous neurologists and all my tests are fine. Not a single test has indicated any abnormality. \n\nThe only change that is happened is that the feeling of warmth has come down by almost 25-30%.\n\nHowever ,the discoloration is still persistent and so is the increased temperature.\n\nDo you think it could be a case of secondary THEM?\nAnd has anyone here ever been successful in treating it? Do your palms get sweaty? By the pictures they do not look super red, obviously it could very well be THEM and I know pictures do always pick things up! Hyperhydrosis causes warm and sweaty extremities etc. So just wanted to throw that out there too since it kind of looked like they were a little sweaty \ud83d\ude42 Hi...they are not sweaty... I have applied a moisturiser as it helps in easing out the discomfort and heat. My palms and soles are dry. There has not been any change in my sweating pattern too. Can you tell us what things tend to trigger flare ups for you? Any redness anywhere else? Nose, cheeks, ears, knees?\n\nThe crowd seems to be thinking maybe it could be THEM but maybe not. Not overwhelmingly convincing.  As u/justiceschadenfreude asked, knowing what triggers flares might help. Also anything that eases flares?\n\nYou mentioned that the moist appearance of your palm is from moisturizer but palms and soles are actually dry, but there is no change in sweating. I know they were asking you about excess sweating. I am going to ask the other way...  do the soles of your feet sweat at all?\n\nTry this test. Fold sheets of toilet paper and press them against the soles of your feet. Then put on socks and shoes for a couple hours. Stay in a modestly warm environment. After a couple hours take your shoes and socks off. If the sheets of toilet paper are still bone dry then you are not sweating at all from your feet and that is suspect for conditions possibly related to THEM. Nope...no trigger as such. It is present all the time .although at times the sensation of warmth is more compared to other times. But it is very random ... I have tried to maintain a log but there has not been a pattern. Hi there..  so I have gotten a sweat test done as well where they connect the electrodes to the sweat glands on palm as well as feet . The results for that came out normal too . I will still try the method that you have mentioned and let you all know.\n\nI have never had sweaty palms or feet in the past. So I have not noticed any change in the sweating pattern in these parts.", "Need Extra Cash Now | No References &amp; Credit Requirement!

Just started propranolol today to help with THEM. anyone else on it too? - any side effects or things to note that are not on the medication leaflet (which does not specifically mention THEM on it anyways)?\n\u2764\ufe0f I am actually on it for migraines but trying to kill 2 birds with 1 stone by being on it for THEM too. However, I am doing advanced pain management treatments now for THEM so it is hard to know if the Propranolol is actually helping the burning/flares or if it is only helping the migraines. Migraines, yes. THEM, I do not know.\n\nWhat dose did your doctor start you on? I started on 20mgs but now I am at 160mgs daily. I have been on it for about 2.5 years though so there is been a gradual increase over time. I take Atenolol for tachycardia since I may have some sort of dysautonomia going on, and my THEM had already gotten slightly better when summer started, but now... now it is almost gone. Not sure if the beta blocker had anything to do with it but whatever is going on with my body is being taken care of for the most part by the beta blocker.\n\nEdit: I do not get any side effects from my beta blocker besides bradycardia while sleeping. HR can drop to the 30s, but apparently that is okay. I also experience a little bit of fatigue. He said start with 20mg and then move to 30mg after a few days. Thank you for the reply (: My heart rate is already so high - resting does not go below 90 normally, and gets to the 180s and higher if I am walking about. So I do not think I will have bradycardia thankfully. Thank you for the advice ((: What advanced pain Management treatments are you doing? Ketamine Infusions Thanks.  My kid has Ketamine cream but her pain doctor does not do infusions. \n\nDo you mind telling me how long an infusion lasts and what type of doctor is performing the infusion?\n\nI am SO HAPPY you found something that works for you!!! How did the ketamine infusions workout for you? I may start those soon for my THEM. I have only done 2 so far. The 2nd one seem to be having a longer lasting effect than the 1st. Not sure when I will go in for the 3rd. My doctor is going to have me contact her when the Ketamine starts wearing off and it is time for another infusion. I am almost 7 weeks in since the 2nd one was done. The long-term goal is every 3-6 months. \n\nJust keep in mind that it is going to take time before you know if it is working. You may have to do a few infusions to figure out the right dose for you. It can be discouraging but do not give up and I pray that the infusions work for you if you decide to go that route. There are side effects to it that can be anywhere from mild to severe, but in my case, they are worth it and I have been able to manage them which helps keeps me from being afraid or hesitant to go back for another infusion. So that is something else to discuss and think about when it comes to Ketamine. Thank you, I am happy you found relief for your THEM. I hope I have the same success. My hands and feet started burning about a year ago. Do you have traditional hands/feet burning? Would you say you are in remission with the ketamine?", "Possible Erythromelalgia? Hi there! I am copying and pasting my post from a month or so ago from the askdocs subreddit just to speed up the process of my question. Does what I am describing sound like Erythromelagia?\n\n*Right now my feet hurt terribly and feel like they are on fire. From what I can tell, temperature wise they do not feel very hot, but I have a burning sensation at the bottoms of my feet and it is like a light pins and needle feeling. I am trying to press them up against the cold wall next to me but the cold kind of hurts it. \n\nIt is been an on and off thing for the past few years, but I have never been sure how to pursue it. It also happens when I am standing up for too long or when it is incredibly hot outside (it worsens in the summertime). My hands also hurt but not the same way my feet do, they just get red and a tight feeling internally. The cold usually helps bring it down if there is any swelling.*", "Do you guys take sleeping pills? I am brand new to the diagnosis, but have had symptoms for almost 3 years now.  I asked my physician for sleeping pills two years ago (zolpidem tartrate) to at least help with sleeping issues while I looked for a diagnosis.  Well as it turns out, sleep has become my biggest issue, with my feet flaring up majorly when I go to sleep/while I sleep.  Usually from being in an uncomfortable sleeping position, of which I cannot feel while I go to sleep, it just causes the redness/heat to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI HATE being on these pills, but whenever I try to get off of them, I cannot fall asleep at all.  For the past few weeks my flares have been pretty bad and I have had to take a higher dosage of sleeping pills, which then results in me feeling drowsy almost the entire day.  So my choices are to either take a pill at night and attempt to get some sleep, or stay up all night (most likely multiple nights) Oh man.  Sleep issues are common for THEM patients as the mere act of laying down helps blood vessels dilate which makes symptoms worse.  Then in general dependence on sleeping pills can become a vicious cycle where it gets to the point that it is nearly impossible to sleep without them.\n\nI am no doctor. Get that out of the way right here.  But I think you need to work on addressing some of the underlying causes of symptom flares in order to get you back to a more natural sleep pattern.\n\nCooling the feet directly *might* help. But overdoing it, too cold or for too long, can cause rebound flares. Ice packs tend to be too cold and do not last.  For a longer lasting cool that is not as intense but can last for a couple nights you might try ( Yeah, her webpage looks like something out of 1995. Yes, I have tried it. Yes, it works *for me*. No I do not get a commission. No, I do not have any financial stake in her business.\n\nAnother trick is to cool your torso. Instead of pointing a fan at (or only at) your feet, try pointing a fan at your torso. Cooling your torso just a little bit helps use your body's own control of blood vessel dilation and constriction to your advantage.  Cooling the torso makes blood vessels in your extremities constrict as your body redirects warm blood to your torso to warm you back up.\n\nAnd then deal with the pain. The pain THEM patients experience is related to nerves that are firing when sodium rushes into nerve cells. The regulation of this sodium flow is off and the nerves do not shut off as they should. Drugs that block the sodium ion channels *might* help. (They do not help all THEM patients.) Talk with your doctor about oral medications and if you can use over-the-counter ( I cut a patch in half and stick each half to the sole of a foot when I am having a bad night. It helps calm my nerve pain as lidocaine blocks these sodium ion channels.\n\nAnd lastly, talk with your doctor about *maybe* trying a topical medication to directly address blood vessel dilation.  I tried a ( a vasoconstrictor, that was prepared at a compounding pharmacy. It works for me. It is quite expensive. You would probably need to get pre-approval to get it covered by health insurance. It is costly.  I use it as my last resort due to the price. Try mirtazapine low dose \nOr h1 antihistamines Yep mirtazipine low doser right here. Developed terrible insomnia 3 years ago and it is the only Rx that worked. I still take it, though go some nights without it every week.", "I think I may have erythromelalgia in my face and ears  Had this \u201crash\u201d for about a year. Extremely hot and rises up in pretty much any situation. All my blood work is normal and I have tested negative for all auto immunes. Steroids knock it down and hydrocortisone makes it worse. Those photos are 2 hours apart. If I do not sit in front of AC, it flares like this and I cannot do anything without it flaring. I did start getting this rash after I had covid (several months later) and right around the time I stated doxycycline. I am off doxycycline for a week or so now. I put hydrocortisone on my face for a few months (3-4) which I now realize is very bad. I have not been putting it on for a while but it does make it flare worse. I have a feeling I might have this. Any hand, feet, neck, or collar involvement?\n\nFor what it is worth, my THEM is on my face and ears too, it is also in my hands, feet, etc\n\nIts definitely possible. \n No where else. Not past my beard line or hair line besides ears. Any skin biopsies?\n\nIt sure looks like it.  I would bring it up to your docs at the least.  Covid is so new and THEM is so rare and poorly understood that it is hard to say. \n\nSome cases are a post-viral reaction. So its possible.\n\nThis may sound silly, but have you tried high strength aspirin?  THEM caused by thrombosis and thrombotic injury (something covid does) actually responds to aspirin.  Its actually diagnostically relevant if aspirin helps.\n\nEdit: trial to viral I did have a skin biopsy and everything was negative. All auto immunes. I have tried ibuprofen and advil . I can try aspirin. What do you mean post trial reaction? Sorry, autocorrect changed post viral to post trial for some reason\n\nEdit: but yea try the high strength kind specifically. \n\nIf that does not work, try antihistamines like cetirizine. It is not an allergy, but the medication has secondary effects on your nerves and vascular system that can help reduce the burning.\n\nIf you can, cannabis helps with the pain. But since you get facial flares real bad, you should stick with Gummies or tinctures instead. Something with both Cbd and thc as the combo works best on neuropathy. I have been pounding every antihistamine imaginable for the last year with no effect. Doctors originally thought it may be an allergy reaction and we tried everything. I just moved to Florida so it is an option but it is so hot that I may not make it very long here. I relocated to get out of the allergy area thinking it was an allergy rash. It is been around 12 days and not much has changed so I am looking at other options now like them. Dude... that is rough, I am sorry you are going through this.  If it helps, it took me a long time and a lot of 'we cant find anything wrong' before my diagnosis too.\n\nUnfortunately, there are not many other home treatment options for THEM.  I hope the aspirin works.  I would definitely bring up THEM to your docs. You might need to see a neurologist to get this figured out I have seen that a few times. What makes the neurologist needed? Seems like it would be hard to find someone on my insurance or expensive. THEM is a neurovascular disease.  Typically it is a neurologist that treats it.  \n\nI dont really know how it will work with costs unfortunately. I am in oregon and things are different here. I took 500mg aspirin and lidocaine topical. I think it is down some. Still a good bit of heat but less redness. Good.  If you check out erythromelalgia.org they have a physician list of nearby specialists.  It might be out of date, but hopefully you can get a referral to one of them and they can help you out.  \n\nIt sounds like the THEM that comes on with thrombotic injury.  But, that is my \"I am not a doctor just someone who has read a bunch on this illness since getting diagnosed.\" Opinion.  They may have a better treatment than constant aspirin. I have another question. Is the spotted hands a common sign of THEM? I took some photos back around Christmas when I thought I was getting allergic reactions but I have spotty hands. My hands are basically like it all the time now. They do not get hot or really red though. Just like white spots all over. I can link a pic if needed. Its possible.  When my THEM was transitioning from mild to severe, it came with some really weird spots and splotches and sensations. I still get weird spots, but it is less frequent now that the THEM is severe.\n\nAlso, about 20% of THEM patients report itching instead of or in addition to the heat and pain.  I know I am in that group. It is like a prickling sense so it depends on your perception. Hm, white spots?  Do they get colder than they should be? Like you have been holding a cold drink?  No coldness or warmness at all. I mean they feel completely normal. Not even after showers. The only place I get any heat on my body is my face or my ears. Do a google image search for \"livedo reticularis hands\"  does it look like that? Definitely not that spotty or red. I linked a few pictures and I saw some other people on Reddit say what I have is common and just due to circulation issues at times. Then that is probably it, but I would still show it to your docs if you can and let them make that call.", "Was anyone here with THEM initially diagnosed with CRPS? And if you were originally diagnosed with CRPS how did your doctor differentiate your THEM from the \"warm\" version of CRPS?", "I know typically we talk about THEM being isolated (knees, hands, feet etc.) On top of this, I also get these spotty, blotchy patches. Just went my body temperature rises. Does anyone else get this?  I get this all the time in the same spots as you. Really?! Anything help with this? Mine just started a couple months ago. No nothing has helped me.  I have a migraine wrap that I will place around my shoulders when they flare that will help with the pain. The doctors i see do not understand the diagnosis. I have been going through this for over 4 year now. If I could you one advice is it just keep fighting. Xo Thanks! I appreciate the help. My battle started in 2016, mostly with the knees. Doctor experience has been the same. But this blotchiness only started recently. Glad to have this network for support. I have not been diagnosed but I get those same blotches on my arms like that. This literally could have been a picture of me. I just posted a few mins ago, picture of my chest and feet. Yeah, looks very similar. Unfortunately there are so many reasons people flush and nevee concrete answers for doctors. Have you had any success with diagnosis? No success yet I am hoping to get somewhere with my neuro. I am having all sorts of symptoms and issues that could be different auto immune things I hope you find answers soon. It is really difficult process to go through. I would say that the most success I had (with diagnosis) was dermatology. She was really the only one who had any time to try to figure it out with me. Unfortunately she cannot really do a lot about prescriptions and treatment plans, so now I am trying different specialists to figure that out. I am diagnosed with THEM.  \n\nI do get some redness outside of the typical feet/hands/knees areas, particularly with ....   ahem...   exercise.  Private exercise with my wife, if you follow me.  Alcohol does it to me too, though I rarely drink.\n\nMy chest and neck get really splotchy when that happens, but those areas do not hurt for me. Is it painful for you??\n\nMy THEM specialist (vascular medicine doc) put me on mexiletine and that has helped a lot.  \n\nI also see a pain management specialist for unrelated back pain.   She prescribed a prescription skin cream that include ketamine to help when foot pain from the THEM is bad. So that might be a possibility.  And OTC lidocaine patches help too, though take a couple of hours to kick in. I replied on your other thread, but adding here...\n\nMany, many doctors have NEVER seen an THEM patient.  I am a volunteer in one of the COVID vaccine trials and wrote down my THEM diagnosis on the forms. Two doctors in the clinic asked to see my feet. One, a doctor who looked to be in his 70s, said I was the first THEM patient he had ever seen.\n\nSo use the physician list over on The Erythromelalgia Association website to hopefully find a doctor in your area who is confirmed to be familiar with the condition.\n\nTake photos of your affected areas when you area having symptoms so you can show your doctor. That way even if you are flaring during the appointment the doctor can see what you are talking about. Thank you so much for this information I will check the  website out today Not really painful, other than the burning. But really difficult as you know. Thanks for the tips! I will keep those in mind for sure. Yeah mine is basically everything I do when my body temperature rises. Although it is not consistent whether it is my ears/hands/knees/ feet/arms etc. I am not sure if the blotching comes from something other than THEM, or if it all is relevant to each other. Frustrating!", "Does this look like Erythromelagia? It is accompanied by a burning feeling and pins and needles ", "Does this look like erythromelalgia or something else? I have had this issue for about 2 years now. Details in comments  Every night for the past 2 years, I will have intense flushing on one or more parts of my body. The effected area gets extremely hot, sometimes with a pins and needles feeling that is super uncomfortable. But the weird part is that the opposite extremity is very cold. There is only been a few times where both of my hands or feet get like this. Usually it effects one hand that looks like the pic, and the other hand will be extremely cold, and my face generally gets very flushed around the same time as my hand. Other times it is on my feet, and it is happened to my knees a handful of times. I also have hypothyroidism and Hashimotos. I have brought it up to my doctor many times but she basically just tells me I am too young to have these issues (I am 22). I take 3 medications currently; 50mcg synthroid for hypo, 20mg adderall XR for ADHD, and 60mg propranolol ER for migraines. Yes, that is what it looks like. Does it feel hot to the touch? Yes it is very hot. And my other hand or foot will be noticeably cold. Though sometimes both of my hands get very red and very hot, uncomfortably hot. Yeah, that sounds like it. All the blood is flowing to the hands or feet or whatever. I think you need to find a new doctor, if you can. Find a neurologist who has seen erythromelalgia before. It is documented that THEM can occur secondary to other autoimmune disorders and you have Hashimoto's.  Find someone who will take you seriously. I have to see my doctor in the next week to two anyway for bloodwork, so I think what I am going to do is print out the wiki on THEM and maybe some other helpful articles and show her along with the many photos I have taken during my episodes. If I want to change docs it is a lot of paperwork through my insurance so maybe she can at least give me a referral to a neurologist or dermatologist that knows about THEM if she still cannot help me after showing her paperwork and whatnot. Thank you very much for the advice. I am glad I at least know what it is now, for a long time I thought I had Reynauds (due to my opposite extremity getting very cold, though not white or blue) Fwiw, I often have one foot that is hot, red, and swollen while the other foot is purple, splotchy, and ice cold.  I do not have Raynaud's, but it is also possible to have both. \n\nGood luck!  You might also want to check out the information ( if you have not already. A published paper might hold more weight in your doctor's eyes than a wiki page.\n\nIt is also entirely possible you do not have THEM, but I think it is worth further investigation. I am in a similar boat, although my hands both get *very* red most of the day. I am on my second doctor that is told me it is Reynauds, but they have both said there is no definitive test and have not taken my concerns seriously, so I have tried to trust them. \n\nToday people at my work started calling me Hellboy :( I have already been embarrassed about it and I do not know what to do.. I came home from work and started googling again and stumbled upon this subreddit. It started roughly 2 years ago when I was 25 years old and other than this have had pretty typical health. I am desperate for some kind of direction towards answers. Could be raynaud's, propranolol can make it worse due to vasoconstriction. Could try a calcium channel blocker and taper off the beta blocker to see if anything changes. Any updates? Have you seen a doc? Treatment? How long have you been taking adderall? My THEM symptoms began when I started taking adderall daily. In 2016/2017 I did not take it and dont recall ever having a flare up. I ignored it thinking it was allergies, and find that if I take adderall the THEM symptoms disappear. This year the flare ups became semi daily which freaked me out. I am having a bad one right now, and have avoided adderall which seems to prevent the warm pain, but it takes a while to stop. I still have to avoid red wine, and beer. This sucks Hey friend. What dose are you on of the adderall? My symptoms have gotten a lot less bad/frequent since it is gotten colder outside. It is much easier to regulate the temperature in my room now, which I think was a big reason for flare ups. I have found that my biggest triggers are: alcohol (luckily I do not drink), overuse of my hands, eating spicy food, stress/anxiety, and getting too warm.\nI did not start have THEM symptoms til roughly 6-8 months on the Adderall, started taking it in..November 2016 I believe? Somewhere around there. I would say for sleep, try drinking a big glass of orange juice before bed. Vitamin C makes adderall not work nearly as well for whatever reason. It also makes me really tired. I have been taking Hydroxyzine to sleep, it is helped quite a bit..maybe ask your doctor for a lower dose of the adderall as well, and see if your THEM symptoms get any better or easier to manage. I kind of thought maybe the adderall had something to do with mine as well but was not sure.\nALSO I failed to mention, I have had Repetitive strain injury in my hands, and I am not really sure if that ever goes away, but when I overstimulate my hands for too long, it causes a flare up really badly. Idk if there is any correlation with THEM/RSI though.\nI hope your symptoms get better! And if you have any other questions feel free to ask Hey, I found out my grandfather actually has polycythemia vera, so I believe it is a likely cause of my THEM. My doctor referred me to a Cancer Center so hopefully I can find out the root issue I am so glad you are making progress in finding out the root cause of your THEM and I hope this can lead to effective treatment and relief for you soon.", "looking for some opinions It started in just my toes but then it spread to my entire foot, it is very hot when i walk with shoes for a while. Also it feels like the veins in my feet are swollen and i feel discomfort in my ankles and lower legs. \n\nI got hot feet shortly after developing sciatica which has mostly gone now, i think the hot feet has improved as well with it but I just want some of your thoughts does this sound like this condition? With the short hot coal like zaps or bursts of pain, that sounds more like a type of peripheral neuropathy. I do not know much about neuropathy to help, but this does not sound THEM-like just from your description. Yeah I figured it is intermittent claudication now, either due to mechanical artery compression or clotting/sediment in the artieres.", "Rashes experienced entire life I have had these kinds of rashes my entire life with no known cause and no consistent trigger. Repeatedly brushed off as hives until i recently saw a dermatologist after being diagnosed with THEM from rheum but rheum was especially concerned about it since it happened in her office and derm said it is absolutely not hives, its extremely hot to touch, and not raised or itchy and she expressed how incorrect my pediatrician was as a child for ignoring this and saying its hives when it is obviously not and expressed how concerning it was that i had so many negligent doctors in general about various things let alone them telling me it was nothing when i mentioned it asked about my health issues and it happened in front of their eyes. Recently, my THEM flare ups have been horrendous but this rash seems to be getting worse as well. I will note that im 99% sure which is which when my feet turn- pots does not particularly hurt me, and doesnt occur fairly often or if it does its happening at the same time as a flare up and im unable to tell since the triggers are standing and showering for both. The rash is obviously different than the two, the only commonality is the redness and heat. My THEM feels uncanny to its description and i already suffered from sf neuropathy before this occured. THC and using a fan is the only thing that helps me. POTS feet happened first occasionally. Was just sent for extensive bloodwork but the blood draw i had yesterday was for a lot of random immunodeficiency and red blood things which she didnt mention during the visit. Dont know what shes specifically trying to find. I attached pictures of the difference between the rash, an them flare up, my POTS feet, and i couldnt find a non invasive photo of what i believe to be livedo reticularis and dont know. If anyone has a clue or this has happened to them as well, please share your experience. Im concerned. This is all over my body consistently daily and just travels instead of stopping. It doesnt hurt, it just feels very draining if that makes sense. I seem to be fatigued and foggy after this gets widespread, when its localized i dont feel that as much. Its very hot, but not painful I will see it and look away and 30 seconds later it dissapeared in that particular spot. I also get these strange pigmented peppered looking rash that tends to be on my ankles and stays after an them flare. Takes a while to settle down. I was diagnosed with hashimotos when i was 11 years old, extremely active and athletic child and one day crashed and gained an absurd amount of weight and was absolutely exhausted. My stomach pain daily was insane which is what prompted the initial GI visit and i was sent to endo and diagnosed with hashimotos. Here we are now years later after a million specialists who ignored everything and insisted i was lying, finally found docs that are interested in solving this and raise a lot of concern, but they are still puzzled. I feel worse and develop more symptoms by the day and im at a breaking point. Petechiae and random bruising as well. This is only to inquire about possibilities of my visible issues, i have a host of other side affects alarming me.\n\n( \\*\\*My hands are much worse, just hard to catch well on camera, and i wanted to highlight the difference between what is obviously THEM and what is not. I dont think pots occurs in hands for me because they are excruciatingly painful and localize in specifically my thumb and pointer finger before my hand is in full swing flare. Hands go on for hours. Feet not so much. First, my obligatory welcome greeting to the subReddit and to our crappy club. You will find a lot of people with similar symptoms who understand and believe you. You will find others who have Small Fiber Neuropathy, POTS, and/or even livedo reticularis. Not everyone with THEM has these. Some of us have more than one. Key thing is, this is not foreign stuff to us.\n\nFinding doctors who understand what erythromelalgia is can be very difficult. I am sorry you had such a long struggle. Sounds like you are finally in good hands.\n\nYou have a lot going on, probably more than most.  Please understand that I am not a doctor. I am not sure if anyone who frequents this subreddit is a doctor.  But for the most part we are patients with THEM or family/caretakers/friends of such patients.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Was just sent for extensive bloodwork but the blood draw i had yesterday was for a lot of random immunodeficiency and red blood things which she didnt mention during the visit.\n\nThis is probably a check for 1) ( or 2) an autoimmune condition.  You might not have either one!  Myeloproliferative disorders are a group of rare and slow growing blood cancers. Autoimmune conditions occur when the body's own immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In the case of THEM that could be attack against nerves that control blood vessel dilation.\n\nHashimoto's is an autoimmune condition. I do not know if the fact that you have Hashimoto's makes it any more or less likely that your THEM is caused by an autoimmune issue.\n\nMoreover your GI symptoms *might* be related to all this too.  The kinds of nerves that can be damaged by an autoimmune attack that causes THEM are the same kinds of nerves that are involved in moving food along in your GI tract.  You did not elaborate more about your GI pain, but if the doctor used the term *gastroparesis* or talked about your stomach or intestines seeming like that are paralyzed then that might all be related.\n\nGood luck.  Be your own best advocate.  Be polite but persistent.\n\nIt can take several attempts to find medication that helps.  Hopefully they can find a treatment that works for you.", "I think I have had this for years and I finally just discovered there was a name for my red hands I have gone years (since a kid) getting made fun of for my red hands. The most recent being yesterday at my bridal shower \ud83d\ude43 I finally googled last night why is this happening and then found out about this syndrome. I also have raynauds fibromyalgia rheumatoid arthritis and a slew of other things. But anyway- I am nervous about my red hands on my wedding day (already having anxiety over it). Has there been any remedies that anyone has found ?", "Do you THEM suffers experience whole body heat when flaring? Or just on the affected extremities/areas? ", "Does anyone get hives/heat rashes aswell with THEM? I have been diagnosed with THEM. I suffer mostly from hives/heat rashes on my chest and arms. Does anyone know are they related or a seperate issue? lol I just asked this question a couple days ago   \n\n\n(", "Is this Them?  So when I go into the shower my toes and from half of my foot turns bright red under hot water. This is what my foot looks like 5 mins after a shower as it starts going back to normal skin color. I know it is blood cause when I push on it it goes white.... Is this Them or is this normally what is supposed to happen to feet under hot water... My toes literally all turn bright red Some reddening is perfectly normal.  The hot water warms the skin.  In an effort to shed heat the blood vessels dilate and the skin reddens.\n\nIf you have sustained redness with significant pain then exploring whether it is THEM might be warranted.\n\nFrom the picture alone I am doubtful it is THEM. If this is a flare, this is not erythromelalgia. This is how my feet started years ago. However there is nothing to treat or cause for alarm at the moment. If this progresses to intense burning that lasts long after that shower then I would be concerned.", "Can anyone tell me if this could be THEM? Burning sensations mostly at night or after showers ", "Is this erythromelalgia?  I do not have alot of pain with this but it can feel warm to touch when it is like this. Sometimes it has spread up to my face aswell and kind of looks like Im having an allergic reaction to something. What tends to trigger it and what time of day is it worse? Is it mainly just blotchy? Does it ever happen in your hands or feet? It could be! I would rule out allergic reactions first. Do you have any relief from Benadryl? Any triggers that bring this on? It used to happen in my hands and feet but not so much anymore, its mainly my neck and chest. It normally happens in the evening.\n\nMy doctor has diagnosed erthromelalgia and has prescribed amitriptyline but it doesnt seem to make any difference to it.\n\nThe reason Im doubting his diagnosis is because it happens so rarely and its just my neck and chest in small patches. \n\nIm also allergic to aspirin and certain skin care products. Should I be looking into allergies that might be causing this instead? How long does the flare typically last? About 20 minutes Looks like niacin flush. But that would only coincide with taking a B or multi vitamin. Any chance there is a connection there?", "Spero clinic Had anyone tried or heard of anyone that has went to this clinic with THEM and if so was it successful? Also wondering if anyone has tried medical marijuana. My daughter has this and it is debilitating. We have found no relief and her pain and burning never lets up. \nThanks. Cannot speak to the clinic, but yes to medical marijuana.  I use it every night in order to sleep.  Look for indica-heavy strains rather than sativas.  Indicas help more with pain, and sleep (if that is a problem for her). Thank you very much for your suggestion. I will be off to the dispensary today to find some things. Is there a particular strain you find helpful? I only use edibles and capsules now because THEM in my hands makes it impossible to break up the flower buds for my vape.  Back when I did use flower, two strains that were suggested to me were Oil Spill and Jah Goo.  But you can also ask the people at the dispensary for what they would recommend to treat nerve pain, something that focuses on a \"body high.\"\n\nFor edibles, I really like Korova cookies, Wyld marionberry gummies, and Big Pete's cookies.  Just be aware that edibles tend to be much more potent than flower that is smoked/vaped.  It works better for me because that means the effects last most of the night.  But be careful if you are just starting out with them. Start with about 3 mg and increase the dosage gradually.  Good luck! Thanks so very much.This is all so new to us. We just want her to have some relief. Bless everyone that deals with this. Feel free to DM me and reach out if you have any other questions or if your daughter wants to vent. Oh also, Kiva Confections Petra mints are good to start off with too, because they are individual mints that contain 2.5 mg THC each.  That might make it easier to slowly build up the dosage. The other ones I mentioned are 10 mg per cookie/gummy and harder to cut precisely. One of my best friends just got home from the Spero Clinic! She has CRPS, a disease similar to THEM, and she is in full remission! She just returned to work for the first time in two years :) I \u201cmet\u201d a girl in a knee support group who just got back from 12 weeks at Spero. She was injured 16 months ago and on crutches due to CRPS pain the whole time. She is now off crutches and in remission. My daughter is currently receiving treatment at Spero snd doing really well! It is an amazing place!", "Could this be THEM ?? Hands and feet are frequently red hot and full of these strange white dots. Was diagnosed with raynauds last November before the redness and heat started. The burning feelings in my hands and feet started not long after getting Covid, worse in the morning and at night and after weightlifting/running/exercising.", "Nightly flare in feet, knees and face. There goes a decent night's sleep...  Uh. Sorry you have to go through it. \u2764\ufe0f Yup. I feel ya.\n\nFan on feet. Lidocaine patches. Cold bedroom.  And still it does not always do it. During my sleep at some point I tuck my feet up under the blankets and that flares me enough to wake up.", "99% sure it is E.M...Biopsy in a week. I have never hit a 10 on the pain scale before. My toes are literally burning from the inside out. It takes everything I have to not itch, to the point of tears. Even if I do itch, there is no relief... Maybe a split second before indescribable rebound pain/itch ", "First thing in the morning? Hi all! Does anyone get really severe symptoms first thing in the morning? I woke up at 6:30 or so this morning to my feet and hands burning like crazy, enough that I could not go back to sleep.\n\nThis has never happened to me before, so I am trying to figure out what is going on.\n\nFor reference, I have pretty severe raynaud\u2019s, and it seems the two go together commonly.\n\nAlso, does the skin feel hot to the touch when a flare up occurs? Yes, the skin feels hot to the touch during the flare. And yes, it is common for symptoms to be worse early in the AM, including the hours you are sleeping after midnight. I have to take amitriptyline in the evening with dinner to help me sleep at night.\n\nI used to wake up around 2:00-3:30 AM and I stay awake until approximately 6:30am when the flares calms enough for me to either start my day or go back to sleep for another hour or so. \n\nThe reason it is worse at night and wee hours of the morning is because this is when our parasympathetic nervous system is more active (rest/digest system) it causes our blood vessels to naturally dilate more, thus causing flares or making existing flares worse since THEM is a neurovascular condition caused by over vasodilation of the blood vessels. Yeah. I too woke up in a flare today. I tried to get back to sleep but could not. It happens from time to time, especially if I shift my body and tuck my feet up under my blankets. My feet are just burning, hot to the touch, when this happens.\n\nWhen you sleep certain changes happen in your body automatically. One of the changes in the cardiovascular system that happens is blood vessels dilating, which is just the sort of bad news that an THEM patient does not want to hear.", "Does THEM affect your job in any way? Ive only just recently been diagnosed  and I have been wondering how it will affect me getting my first job, I have quite severe THEM so I guess it would be considered a disability Ouch.  So sorry.\n\nYes, it affects the types of jobs I have been able to do.  Work indoors in an air conditioned space is much more manageable.\n\nPhysically demanding work or work outdoors is generally too strenuous. I was diagnosed In March of this year. Luckily, I am able to work from home, but my work is still hindered specifically due to terrible medication side effects (I am VERY sensitive to medications) and mental distress due to the diagnosis. I guess it really just depends on the work you do and where you are in the treatment process. I would try to avoid a physically demanding or outside job, but just remember that depending on where you live, you may not be required to disclose your condition until you are hired. And then they are obligated to accommodate you (again, this depends on where you live).", "Anti Depressants Has anyone used them for THEM and does it make it worse? I am currently on Nortriptyline and it has not made it worse or better for me. This is the first type of drug my rheumatologist had me try for my THEM because of their potential impact on autonomic nervous system which is involved in THEM. I have now tried all kinds and types of antidepressants. None of them made the THEM worse, and only one has made a significant impact in tampering the pain and uncomfortable nature of flares and that is amitriptyline (the tricyclic type of antidepressant). \n\nEveryone is bodies seem to react differently to different drugs, so all we can do is try one at time. Doctors often try one at a time with their THEM patients, so do not get discouraged if some do not end up helping and you have to move on to something else. I went through four different types of antidepressants before I found amitriptyline helpful. Oops, I should have made it more clear as to what you are asking...no, antidepressants should not make your THEM worse. And in fact, they are often prescribed to help with both the mental hardship of living with THEM and the tampering down of painful flaring.", "Just want to make sure When a job application asks you if you have a disability, is THEM included in that? I would assume so but I just wanted to double check I do not think so, but now that you ask, it is a good question\n\nI am wondering where is it possible to look up a list or something like that of what is to be included as disability Every patient's experience with THEM is different but for most patients the answer is probably yes, THEM is a disability.\n\nThey are hinting at ADA compliance. The ( as an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. So you can be \"disabled\" under that standard if others think you have an impairment that limits a major life activity even if you are not limited.\n\nAs regards to THEM, important to the definition is that it includes conditions which are episodic in nature and which would be disabling when active. Further the employer is not allowed to take ameliorating measures into account when determining if a condition is a disability.\n\nSo a condition like THEM which comes and goes with flares is still a disability even if measures can be taken to eliminate flares while working. Think of epilepsy as another such condition that comes and goes and can often be controlled with medicines.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n( are those functions that are important to most people's daily lives. Examples of major life activities are breathing, walking, talking, hearing, seeing, sleeping, caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, and working.\n\nThose examples are not all inclusive. My THEM impairs my ability to walk, sleep, care for myself, and perform certain manual tasks.  It is definitely a disability for me. Yes, this.  It is a disability if it limits life activities.  And the application is also asking about disabilities because employers need to provide reasonable accommodations by law if you need them. It is up to you whether you want to disclose disabilities or not. I would not think so. In Canada it is not considered a disability, well at least it is not for me. I thought this too since I am in Canada but I took a look at this \n\nBut I am not sure how exactly it would work otherwise Do you also fill out an occupational health form? I think that is where I would put it. However, if it frequently interferes with your day to day life, then yes it is.", "My episode has been going on since yesterday night and it is absolutely awful I have never had it last this long, and I am elevating my feet and it is not really helping.

Will feel much better in the short term.  Fill a dish pan with cool water to soak your feet in while you watch tv or something. I know this is an old thread but I wanted to pipe in! I LOVE using menthol/lidocaine gels at night during a flare up. Helps me sleep! Look for the aloe burn gels! The kind with 4% lidocaine is my favorite!", "THEM symptoms got bad after starting ADHD meds!! HELP!!! Hello! I am a 22y/o  F and I noticed that I started having bad flare-ups with THEM after starting a medication called Concerta for my ADHD. None of the doctors I have seen about THEM have commented that I am taking Concerta and my psychiatrist swears it is not caused by concerta but now I am seeing online that stimulants can cause vascular diseases/disruption and besides my THEM i am otherwise completely healthy. Does anyone know anything about this?! YES. It is not only true and factual, my own experiences with Adderall and Concerta corroborate what you are saying. I already had livedo reticularis, Raynauds and THEM in my feet and hands as a child, but as an adult, after starting on these stimulants, it increased exponentially and spread to my face/nose/cheeks in a very rapid and painful way! When I now go off them, it seems to remain(went off for a year, and although it was better, it seemed to have already \u201cflipped the genetic or other switch\u201d and remained. For me, the other benefits(help with my cognitive issues and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome/dysautonomia\u2014as well as my intestinal dysmotility , etc) are worth it to me, as I could not function well at all without it(Adderall XR). I have chosen to go down to a lower dose(15mg) to minimize the worsening symptoms. I, too have tried to talk to doctors about this, and only recently do they understand about the possibility of Raynauds. I started taking this years before they discovered the connection. I think that for me, it was the triggering point for already genetically-possible outcomes. My older sister started having this issue a few years ago, and my other siblings have facial flushing, too. From what I can see, if the possibility runs in your family for this sort of issue, the likelihood of it \u201cflipping the switch\u201d for you is higher. NO ONE i know\u2014outside of my family\u2014who takes such meds has had such a reaction/outcome, so it must have to do with genetic predisposition. Thanks for asking this! I have never found anyone talk about this online! I would say though, since you are young and just starting the med, I would encourage you greatly to consider stopping it. The consequences for vascular disease are excruciating and disabling. It only gets worse. It 100% can be exacerbated by stimulants. I recently quit Vyvanse because of it worsening my erythromelalgia and POTS. I hate it because it was helping, but just was not worth the side effects. okay so helpful thank you!! So i started taking concerta back in like july maybe and then my symptoms started so its been about 3-4 months on the medication. Do you think its too late and the genetic thing has already been triggered? They put me on gabbapentin and I have not had a flare up in 2.5 weeks. Please let me know what you think you are so helpful!!! Did your symptoms go away when you stopped vyvanse? And how long were you on vyvanse? Thank you so much for your comment I feel so much less alone! it helps me so much and my psychiatrist says that it cant be causing it so I am just so confused. I obviously would stop it if it meant my THEM goes away. Its just hard you know? It IS hard to figure out. But first and foremost, trust yourself and your body. The psychiatrist obviously is extremely ignorant\u2014 and arrogant\u2014if they will not even look into the research on Raynaud\u2019s and the flushing that can come from such vasoconstrictor medications...so trust yourself! You know when something is happening to your body. If you noticed that the only possible trigger for the flushing is the medication(as it seems you did), then believe yourself. Secondly, if they are giving you another medication like gabapentin to take care of the flushing, that is terrible medical care! Gabapentin has its own set of common side effects that can cause a whole new set of issues (at least for myself and many, many people I know and have worked with in the mental health field). This is where you may need to do more research on these medications and Raynauds /Erthromelalgia and decide if the effects are worth it to you long term. \n\nAlthough I do not know whether anything was triggered for you permanently, I would suggest you determine whether you can accept the flushing and cardiovascular consequences. If you are okay with the possible issues with gabapentin and the Concerta, and the pros outweigh the cons, then trust your decision. If you do not think you are prepared to live your life with these side effects, and other new possible ones, then I would encourage you to trust yourself and work with your doctor to go off of them. I just wish you had a psychiatrist who was actually knowledgeable about these things and who did not invalidate or ignore you. Perhaps finding a different doctor(a general practitioner can prescribe such medications, you do not need a psychiatrist) who will actually take you seriously may be the optimal next step, but no matter what, trust yourself and listen to your body. Even if every doctor ignores your concerns and piles you with more and more meds\u2014LISTEN TO YOURSELF. Let your decision be because you listened and researched and know the truth of your own experience! I know it is hard to do this, but remember that only you have to live with the consequences. And please keep us updated on this situation! I would love to hear how this all turns out for you. :) Yes!! They subsided about 90% and now only really happen when I exercise or overexert myself. I was on Vyvanse for almost 2 years and it started within a week of me starting my first dose! I guess everyone is different! I noticed no increased severity since starting generic adderall, it is still pretty much the same and goes on the same pattern of going crazy every time I am in an environment with artificial heat. But I am on a low dose as it is. I do not think I have raynaud's associated with it but then again since I got the official diagnosis recently after like 8 years so I did not get to a specialist yet to even bring up the possibility. It is so weird in general, my primary care physician does not know what to do about it but she is very interested so I am hoping she can find me a good referral. Anyway I am sitting here with a red bridge of my nose, one ear and some fingers haha. Interestingly, adderall seems to help rather than exacerbate it since it happens at night hours after it wears off. Yes! It does seem to help\u2014until it begins to wear off, which is the vasodilation after the vasoconstriction. That is also why so many people get severe headaches as it wears off. It is all so weird, I know. That makes total sense!", "FINALLY GETTING TREATED I have had THEM for at least 5 years and it has gotten progressively worse, so I finally decided to go to the doctor for it (first time ever actually addressing it lol). I am starting on gabapentin and honestly, I am so excited!!", "Just diagnosed! Looking for any and all advice! Hi you all!\n\nI am a 30 year old female. I was just diagnosed with THEM today, and I am so happy! Of course not happy to have a painful syndrome, but I have been dealing with chronic pain and fatigue for close to a decade now, and every time I walk into a doctor's office, it is \"shrug shoulders, I do not know.\" \n\nA few years ago I was funneled into a CBT pain therapy program at Mayo Clinic, and it helped me get my life back and manage my symptoms. I am still in pain every day and can only work part-time, but the CBT has massively helped with my bundle of random pain symptoms - BUT my hand and feet pain never improved. In fact, it is gotten worse. Probably because I am doing more now, so there is more to trigger it. Mine is triggered by warm temps, exercise, folding warm laundry, etc. \n\nAfter stepping away from chasing specialists since 2017 and sticking with my CBT, Mayo encouraged me to see a specialist for this specific problem. And today a rhemutologist diagnosed me with THEM! I am 100% sure this is the right diagnosis. Every line about it fits my symptoms perfectly. It feels so amazing to have an actual label for one of my mystery pain things.\n\nShe is started me off on one baby aspirin a day. I would love to hear experiences of what treatments have worked for you all. I know it is a trial and error journey. I would also love to know if this has led you to a path of a fuller diagnosis - there is still a lot of other things going on with my body, so I have a hope this might be the first clue to getting a full diagnosis one day. \n\nThanks all! I am confused though. Mayo has an THEM clinic. Did you try the Mayo THEM clinic?  \n\nWe had all my daughters medical records sent and they declined to see her.  They said she needs to go to the diagnostics team first bc she has migraines and an EKG was weird (local cardio dr cleared her but did not know what type of vasculitis would effect the heart/did not recognize the disorder I gave as an example).\n\nSo I am glad you were diagnosed but I am kind of freaked out it seems you went to the Mayo Clinic and did not go to the Erythromelalgia Clinic.  \n\nUpshot: maybe it is not any good. :( &gt; I know it is a trial and error journey. \n\nYup. And every patient seems to respond differently. It can be maddening.\n\nA few at home things that might help:\n\n* Keep affected body parts out from under blankets while sleeping\n* Fans to keep air moving\n* Barefoot, possibly no socks too, as much as possible.\n* Elevate affected areas.\n* Cool, but NEVER ice cold, foot bath\n* OTC Lidocaine patches for feet\n* OTC anti-histamines\n\nAs far as prescriptions, patients have tried a lot of different medications. Some of the common ones include gabapentin, mexiletine, and amitriptyline.  There are several others.\n\nTHEM is often secondary to some other medical condition. It that other condition can be identified and treated the THEM may resolve itself. Figuring out it was THEM took a long time. It can sometime be quite difficult to figure out that other medical condition.\n\nSo no matter how long and extensive your medical history is, and no matter how unrelated you think some symptom may be, do not self edit. Lay it all on the table for the doctors to sort through.  And come back here to compare notes with other patients. Hi! I went to Mayo back in 2017, and at that time my THEM symptoms were barely apparent. I had pain issues with warm water, but because I was dealing with such debilitating pain in other ways, my THEM was never triggered (I was not exercising, going outside, etc.). So there was nothing there for Mayo to diagnose THEM. It was not on the radar at all, especially when I had a big list of other symptoms. \n\nMayo is \\*incredible\\* they were so kind and efficient and helped me when no one else could. I 100% recommend them. Perhaps I will go down to their THEM clinic in the future! Thank you for your response! I am hopeful one of the medications will work. I am wary of too many pain-coping practices because they have been a very dangerous slope for me in the past, creating way more sensitivity and a dependency on them. Though A/C is of course a must have. \n\nI have used gabapentin in the past for other pain symptoms and reacted well to it so maybe I will suggest trying that next if the aspirin does not work.\n\nThanks again! My daughter\u2019s is out of control. She is on gabapentin, amitriptyline, ketamine cream, gabapentin cream.\n\nYou may want to get in with a Pain Management doctor or go to the THEM clinic now so if it gets worse you will not have to wait.\n\nI hope it all goes well for you!  Thank you for your kind reply. I am so sorry to hear about your daughter, that is awful! I understand if you do not want to try again with them, but Mayo has been one of the only helpful resources on my decade-long health journey, and I do really recommend them if you all ever want to give it another shot. Wishing you the best!", "Putting Hands in Hot/Warm Water for 5-10 mins So I found out that when putting my hands in warm water for a certain amount of time, they improved a lot. However I will say that it feels like it is getting worse at first. Why is this? I know that sometimes capsaicin patches / creams are prescribed for THEM to decrease heat sensivitity in the skin. The water could be taking a similar effect. I personally find being in hot water (baths/showers) to be painful throughout.", "how can i build my credit up | Get Cash In A Click Up To $1,000. ", "Is there any end? I have had secondary THEM for a year now. No real clue about what it is secondary to, other than pernicious anemia. I have been given lots of vitamin pills, but supposedly I am not deficient of anything. I spent last summer in the grips of an THEM flare that lead me to stuff washrags in my mouth in order to not wake up the people around me. I could not walk, I could barely think, I got no sleep, and I was miserable. This summer seems to be moving in the same direction. I am 23 years old, and I can barely walk to the bathroom. Medications only seem to help in cooler temperatures, and no matter how cold I keep my room, I still have to apply ice to my feet in order to maintain some level of sanity. I have gained about a hundred pounds between Lyrica and immobility, and I want to cry whenever I see myself on camera or in the mirror. Has ANYONE actually kicked this beast to the point where they could stop Lyrica and actually live twelve months out of the year? Being stranded inside makes me feel like I am already a senior citizen and a burden on my parents. Ketamine is a possibility, but so far medical marijuana combined with Lyrica and B12 has not calmed anything down, so it is hard to believe I have a chance of ever getting  my life back. I really have not lived that much, and I spend every day with regrets about the things I have not done and may never do due to this disorder. I am seeing a pain psychologist who basically mansplains to me how I feel and retains very little information on my condition, and instead fixates on how well I sleep and relaxation techniques. I am thoroughly miserable. Again, has anyone here ever gone from this hell to being able to walk long distances and take vacations in warm places, or at least have a job? Please just be straight with me, because no else is. Welcome to the THEM club. Pull up a chair, stick your feet in the complementary refrigerated water baths, and let us talk.\n\nI am not a doctor. I did not even stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night. I do have THEM, so take these ramblings for what they are worth.\n\nIn short, yes, some have beat THEM. Not all by a damn sight. \n\nThose whose doctors can identify what it is secondary to can be \"lucky\" and beat THEM if the primary condition is treated. Unfortunately a fair number of those cases the THEM is secondary to some form of blood cancer, so not exactly rooting for that outcome.\n\nSome claim success with a heat acclimatization process known as Bob's Protocol. It was NOT designed by a doctor but has gained much traction in the THEM community.  I have not tried it but it involves what sounds like torture - warm water baths several times per day for several weeks. Some swear by it. Google it and read. Make your own decision.\n\nSome have tried intravenous lidocaine infusions over several days. This in-hospital procedure has had success for some patients. From what I have read it is a slow IV infusion therapy for up to a week. Getting insurance coverage might be a fight for something like that.\n\nRumors have swirled about ketamine infusion therapy. I have not seen a study or a protocol. I know ketamine is used in topical prescription preparations for THEM so I suppose there is at least some reason some doctors might consider it. I have no idea if that would be faster, slower, safer, or riskier than lidocaine infusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOtherwise, cooling but not too much. Some patients seem to have a narrow sweet spot for temperature where they are comfortable and just a couple degrees higher or lower and the pain returns.\n\nI have had some luck pointing a fan straight at my feet while I sleep.  And oddly I have had better outcomes lately pointing the fan straight at my torso and not at my feet.  I guess that cools my core a bit and my body reacts by constricting blood vessels in my extremities to send warm blood to my torso. YMMV. \n\nAnd FWIW I am a guy and am sleeping in just boxer briefs, falling asleep without a blanket or even a top sheet.  I wake up halfway through the night feeling a bit cold and just drape the sheet over my torso and fall back asleep. My feet felt the most normal they have in a very long time upon waking today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll the usual medical advice.  There are a LOT of medicines your doctor might try you on. Aspirin, anti-histamines, mexiletine, gabapentin, pregabalin (Lyrica) , duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor), Vitamin B12, and many more. As bad a rap as opioids get my pain management doctor was treating me with those for a while, morphine and fentanyl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had the talk with a doctor about seeing a pain psychologist.  I rolled my eyes and explained in vivid detail to my doctor what this pain is about and how it effects me. She dropped the idea of a referral.  This is NOT some small pain that i need to learn to not mind so much. This is about feeling like parts of my body are on fire, for hours and days on end. That is not something you learn to get used to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo...  jokingly, take up barefoot skiing and move hemispheres to stay in the winter?  Slightly less jokingly, scuba diving, snorkeling, or swimming can really lower that core body temperature and help you shed heat allowing some exercise to lose weight while you are not miserable. And hour each day in a pool makes summer more bearable. \n\n(I was actually working as a scuba instructor on a tropical island when I developed my first THEM symptoms and the constant cooling of my body made diagnosis more complicated. I can confirm that two hours per day in the ocean made THEM quite tolerable, even in the Caribbean.  Try that for a vacation.) Duuuuuuude! I am so glad you responded. I did not want to leave OP hanging, but am struggling with my own flare and mental health right now, so to come back and see your comprehensive response was water for my dry-ass soul! \n\nThanks for taking the time to write this all out. Thanks for being informational, unbiased and using a nice balance of validation and humor.\n\n Damn...bookmarking this to read to my new therapist who has me reading \"you are not your pain.\" I read \"freedom from pain\" with my last therapist. I am so sick of people just not getting it and telling me to meditate my way out of this. I used to be an avid meditator. It helped tremendously with my post car accident neck pain but has not helped with THEM. You put it perfectly...it is a different level of pain...and a different kind of sensory input. Our bodies were not made to ignore fire/heat. \n\nOP, hang in there! I am glad you reached out like we all need to do more of. While I cannot fix it for you and cannot really add anything else to this commenters' sentiments, I will say....we see you....we hear you....we feel WITH you. And you are not alone! Baby I hate to tell you this, but NO MORE ICE. It can cause a lot of nerve damage to force your vessels to constrict so abruptly during a flare up. \n\nI, too, have been utterly miserable and I empathize with you. I understand therapy is expensive, but my therapist has really been helping me to grieve the person I was before and find ways to be happy and live my life even with my new limitations. I would perhaps also look into occupational therapy to see if an OT can help you adapt more easily. \n\nSending you my love! This shit sucks so hard so try to find small things that make you happy. Respectfully I disagree on the ice. And I am concerned if OP feels like they need to stop using what may be one of the few treatment options that work.\n\nIce is my primary way I treat flares; without it, I would be in so much pain.\n\nFor some people, ice can help a lot; for others, it makes it worse. I have experienced both myself... It depends what type of flare I am having. Typically I use medical grade ice packs in Ziploc bags on the bottom of my feet. (I used to also put it on the top of my feet, but it started causing rashes.) Direct ice can def be dangerous... Also, I will move my feet on/off ice for hours. Or move it to different parts. But the skin is thicker on the bottom of feet, so it seems to be able to take more ice for longer.\n\nEveryone has to figure out what is right for them, what benefits outweigh risks, etc... I hope this may give more info for OP to make an informed decision.\n\nSide note: OP have you considered a wheelchair? I got one to use as needed and it is helped a lot! (I use while putting an ice pack in the footrests.) But your symptoms sound a lot more severe than mine, so it might not even make sense. But just wanted to throw that out there. So sorry you are going through this :( No. Life is miserable. I cry every night. I have a wheelchair but my house is not exactly wheelchair accessible. Also, since I am able to walk for about four months, it would be impractical to change like that. Plus, I am really REALLY hoping for a breakthrough. When I say I have not lived before this, the only experiences I have are going through the motions at school and family outings/vacations. I have no close IRL friends, and I have never been in a relationship or had sex. I lived one year on my own with roommates my age and it went wrong. I would finally changed things about myself personality wise that made me feel ready to put myself out there, and a series of medical/COVID shutdown things for me and my family meant I never got back out there. I have never even had a real job. I am sure in theory I could still enjoy myself as an overweight woman in a wheelchair, but it does not seem like something that will necessarily help with my social life, especially considering how insecure it is made me. In response to justice, with all due respect, I barely HAVE an old life to mourn. I cannot imagine spending about 60-70 more years of this. I am sorry to be so blunt, but this feels like the nail in my coffin. Like I am just meant to sit around waiting to die and being a burden on my parents throughout their senior years, until they inevitably pass away, and I am left alone. I have a BFA in Creative Writing, and I cannot see that panning out since I do not have enough life experience and will instead just parrot things I have seen before. I really am at the end of my rope, so it sucks that it seems like I am just deluding myself into thinking things will ever be better. I am really sorry :( Thank you for sharing your story, experiences, and feelings. I do not have any advice, but I hear your pain &lt;3 I am so sorry you are struggling like this, OP. I am also a writer and I just wanted to say that you DO have life experience. It may not be the \"typical\" 23-year-old experience, but who wants to read about typical! Your experience is unique and through your struggles, you have a perspective that others do not. I cannot offer any advice about getting THEM under control, but I did want to send you a nod of solidarity from one writer to another. Do not give up on the writing. Do not lose hope. THEM is an increasingly researched condition, there are many treatments that exist and no one treatment works for all. Talk to a neuro or a pain specialist who has treated THEM before. Check the erythromelalgia organization site for the doctors directory. Have checked there before; in my area there is one vascular doctor who did see for wound care, and a man who is either retired or been charged with fraud. So, since I cannot exactly fly to the Mayo Clinic in this condition, I have to hope the majority of my physicians are open to learning. I was diagnosed at Penn Neurology, and then dismissed after a genetic test showed that the THEM was not primary. A gene test can confirm disposition to having primary, you can still have Primary them without the gene mutation (SC9A usually). I just sent my gene test to Invitae to find out if I am carrying the mutated gene and my UCSF neuro already diagnosed me with primary THEM last week. It took me 6 months to get a diagnosis. I think if you are not close to a doctor on the THEM site then you may need to lean on therapies posted online in case reports and ask your doctor if certain treatments are right for you. I have doctors that know them and I am still doing that. This is super comprehensive and has case reports in the citations:  Also regarding Mayo clinic, I called them when I suspected THEM at first and they said the waiting period with a referral is a year at least. A lot of their treatments for THEM are posted in case reports online with Mark P Davis as the author, he is the head of the clinic over there. You can cite those reports when you talk to your local neuro or pain management specialists. I really feel your pain. I got diagnosed with something else at your age and felt like my life was over. It was not and there were periods when things calmed down enough for me to have some great experiences and enjoy life. And then there is been period where it is been really hard and frustrating and lonely and freakin painful!!! THEM came a bit later in my life and this has been really really challenging on top of everything else. BUT I do know that there is more resources and support and potential treatments than there were even 5 years ago. I know that is not much comfort right now when an hour in pain can feel like a week. You get to be sad and angry and grieve the life you envisioned.  That does not mean that good things will not happen still. And btw even with my jacked up hands, \ud83d\ude33 I actually wrote a book that did pretty well (ok better than pretty well!!) so those things are still totally on the table for you. Writers going to write! It will happen.\nI am sorry you are going through all this tho. It really does suck. But your life\u2019s not over by a long shot.", "I got ya homie! ", "Saw a neurologist who said \"you have it but you do not\" and a few other things and am lost - any ideas on where to go/what it is? Been around the houses, cannot cope and desperately looking for hope. Hello all,\n\nI am trying to put all relevant information due to primary and secondary, so apologies it is lengthy - I will do my best to put i in order. I write it order and have a more purely THEM type further after so hopefully it is comprehensive. If you have the time I would really appreciate any advice and guidance. \n\nAs a relevancy to this a few things, I have a condition that means I have a high sensory profile and in my case too much heat is not just uncomfortable and sensations are felt much more than in the average person (great huh?) I also react badly to most meds and cannot risk most as I have med induced and reactive tinnitus which really does not go well with having sensory issues so painkillers and such are out for me. \n\nBefore I go into it incase people do not read that far an antidepressant which stabilise neurotrasmitters and stop fluctuations in peripheral blood supply from happening - have you ever heard of such a thing? He mentioned one instance of this to me so am unsure if he just knew of one patient where their use of this coincided with symptoms getting better and no note of what else they took or other factors and said it was out of his area of expertise really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The full story - the THEM parts lacking the THEM details in the full story after the next bolded, but this is the fuller picture:**\n\nA few years back one day I was typing and my middle finger main joint started hurting and swelling a bit. I hoped it would go away but no breaks from things would cure it no matter how long. At first I would get be able to type maybe 10-20 mins in the morning after before it really kicked in badly but other than a small period of time where it did not seem to hurt (a few months, but it was not heavy useage, but still odd). The joint above it joined in down the line. Around this time my right knee was hurting and a burning sensation was felt when bent - this went away in the end, so I put it down to a random knee issue that walking/time improved. After some time the middle finger joint swelled and was very hot - the doctors did not know what it was and ran tests for gout and infection (negative, even though it seems gout cannot be ruled out by just bloods) it took about a week and a but to go down leaving me with a purple knuckle where it seems to have burst blood vessels for some time. As issues with my hand continued the NHS ignored the guidelines as rapid referring to an arthritis clinic and I was left waiting for a long time to see an unkind and unprofessional rhem who suspected psoriatic arthritis due to it being all on my right side as well as some other types. I had bloods and an ultrasound I now know is not the best for diagnosis and also dependant on the operator. I received a letter just saying it was not arthritis, no follow up, no going through bloods and left be. \n\nFollowing this I ended up at MSK after pleading that I could not be left and that I did not get a follow up from the rheum - the NHS, especially my doctors are often happy to leave you without anything or if one person says \"it is not this\" without going well it is something. It was now in two joints on the finger and sometimes pain was less but in lesser the pointer and rarely the next to pinkie digit but do not know if that was it compensating for the middle one. I was told MSK was multidisciplinary so MSK, physio and rheums could look at my case but this was not true usually. I think it was around this time the Erythromelalgia type redness and heat (minor swelling?) started happening badly in my hands, what happened next became more of a focus for doctors and with limited time was the more talked about thing sadly and it seemed they started close together so could be related and was not asked much about if at all even though I bought it up.\n\nAfter my initial MSK call before seeing them I payed privately to see a rheumatologist in Janury when like before there was huge joint swelling, but this time a year and some after the first instance and it was in two fingers (started odly in my next to pinkie finger which was usually good not long after a lump came up some called a maybe ganglion-cyst before 'spreading' to my middle finger. At first the swelling would start and then the knuckle would feel like it had been hit by a hammer and then the swelling would continue and the knuckle hurt less or less often - this instance lasted for almost two months this time and at the time I hot chills without a fever for a bit and my right elbow was hurting to bend (like cubital tunnel - the elbow remains and recently is now in both). I went for answers and to check if it was gout as this would have been a flare where they could take fluid. The rheum said without a shadow of a doubt what he was seeing was dactylitis and listed what could be causing it - multiple types of arthritis and then... gut health and mentioned diet and said changing my bad diet may resolve everything even as extreme as the dactylitis and he would seen it and that sometimes it happens for no reason. To be honest this is where I lost some faith as nowhere lists dactylitis as happening for reasons outside of auto-immune and other serious conditions and imagined as a private at times rheum he saw people who hurt, had the money to splash and a diet change did cure make them not hurt. He also mentioned foliculitis due to diet and lack of C, which I do not recall showing as low in a test if it was done and at this point I would had many so chances are it was done. At the time I had 1 pit in one fingernail and none since and did not know at the time but my left big toenail had stopped growing since summer along with a few others horizontally splitting. I felt like he would put those reasons there as he would not want someone to cry when all signs pointed to arthritis given dactylitis and pain/swelling even though his credentials were good - surely if it could happen for another reason it would be SOMEWHERE to be heard of.\n\nThe MSK hand specialist I saw (after calling and them seeing I was clearly an urgent and not a routine - thanks doc) was confused as to why I was not sent straight to her from rheum but I was there now and she cared and understood my case was affecting me badly. She thought my hand looked more of a rheum issue and ordered an MRI and set up a joint meeting with someone from rheumatology who I now know was not a consultant level) in their spare paperwork hour due to how the rheum there did not explain anything and how I presented. Sadly the Erythromelalgia type issues went under the radar more but they had the appointment and the man from rheum said yes arthritis can be rulled out via bloods, contrary to what I would been told by the private rheum and what I would read - he said if you look at it like puzzle pieces it can be done. He said it was not arthritis (which was a huge fear as I could not take the meds to even slow it and many other reasons) and that my finger does not look like dactylitis as it is usually the whole finger, not just a joint and the finger parts around joint and the MSK doc said dactylitis would look different on the MRI which I happened to have towards the end of the swelling. This seemed off as googling dactylitis or psoriasis arthritis shows some whole fingers and some just like mine, the joint and surrounding finger as well as describing it that way - as joints, not whole fingers often. I wanted to believe them but now the hand MSK who was thinking it was much more likely a rheum issue looking at my hands was going along with the man saying the joint pain was likley due hypermobility, which was more her area and which makes little sense as then why did it suddenly come on and how would strengthening exercises cure me if when it started my fingers were at their strongest due typing everyday. The putting hands in hot then cold water and repeat seemed to help once but then make my hands more sensitive to change, so stopped. The exercises made things no different or worse so I had to pause doing them and the Erythromelalgia like symptoms were just getting worse and worse so I was trying to seek proper help for my hands doing that. She was going to try and work with my GPs to reffer places needed and discuss my case but sadly she discharged me when they did not reply and she said if exercises did not help then there is nothing she could do (even though she was a hand specialist with sway) and would not keep me on to work on my joints whilst someone else looks at the Erythromelalgia type things. I sobbed and asked what now as she herself said if it was not rheum I should have gone to MSK as it was something and she said she did not know and she was so sorry and maddeningly said sometimes pain just goes away - I said why would it go away now after years and it had progressed and doing nothing did not help and doing what I was told did not help yet. I felt fobbed off and she would given up when I thought she would not and it seems gone with what someone who was not a consultant said over her own training in her area. Before this happened I contacted the man in rheumatology as he seemed kind and patient and said re-present if things change and the THEM symptoms were progressing and I knew a rhuem was someone who could look at Erythromelalgia - he said he would never heard of it, he could ask a consultant (how I found out he was not one)) and sadly I found out he had an opinion of me and my condition due to having mental health diagnoses. He had talked to the nice MSK doc before the consultation about my MH like it was a bad thing in this even though she seemed empathetic and caring and understood the cross over and my circumstances and was really trying to help understanding how serious is was - maybe that is part of what caused her to give up as she seemed to go with his opinion even over her own. I said surely it would be awful for anyone with my set of symptoms and he agreed, so given I have diagnoises and life circumstances (such as not being able to take painkillers and most meds) that make this even worse it makes sense I am not coping? \n\n**The possible THEM lacking the THEM type things mentioned above, but it is some of it as well as neuro (rheum and MSK above)**\n\nThe THEM type things in addition to what I have already said: Last year after a shower my feet were bright red and it all went down hill from there. \n\nMy hands - were the main reactive thing, especially my right for some time. Since the finger swelling episode around the time of the hand THEM really becoming noticeable my right hand was always noticeably pinker outside of a about 20 days this year where they matched. At times the biggest veins become very prominent and can hurt along with a more usual flare. Sometimes they are also helped by raising my hand(s) and the colour drains to normal before I take them down but this is not always the case or nor happened as often as the 'usual' flares by far. Now sometimes using them will make a flare, but sometimes not and they started not flaring every evening/day randomly (going out or getting into cars/trains makes them feel sore and a kind of itchy and they would be varying levels of red and heat up and swell a bit (at times). The patterns are changeable now and every time I think one bit might be getting better or changing pattern so underlying reason things get worse. Before this sometimes I would use my PC and my hands would go a tad red and swell and become sore as if I was allergic - this got more often to the point it always happened for some time and continued after the THEM type symptoms were more obvious. I have used a good emolient, dermatitis cream and eczema cream since last year when my doctor shrugged my hands off as just needing cream. I have had various red botches like rashes that show more when I get them wet around then so given the pandemic hand washing I hoped it was that, but sadly even after 5 months of good emolients/ceramide creams/exzema cream/dermatitis cream (all non steroid) it did not cure my hands and the barrier would not take that long to fix. I had an eczema type flare for the first time on my finger that it helped after a bit and sometimes it feels like the screams sooth or lessen flares a little but it could be in my head. I would not be surprised if I had a kind of skin condition on top of this and it was just helping that. Last night for the first time my left hand had one of the worst flares with the bulging veins on it is own for the first time, so that is not a good sign. I used fridge cool packs as relief.\n\nMy feet: I first noticed red feet after a shower one day and it may have happened before that at some points thinking back. I remember the veiny, not as hot as a flare sore feet after a very long day of walking in heat, but that is normal I think. They started flaring outside of showers randomly after my hands were more of an issue. I would feel the heat or an almost tingle sign and know it was starting or had started - this used to be every evening and most often is. Walking did not use to trigger a flare but as time went on less and less activity would leave me with red toes or red toes and feet (sometimes the redness would spread up the feet even after stopping walking) and heat. Painful bulging veins on my feet now after walking almost always accompany a walking induced flare and are less bad in lesser or caught flares (when my big toe or toes heat up and if I can cool them I can stop the flare or delay in sometimes... it seems sometimes to spread from big toes to thee others and up but not always - this was not the case before) or there more now with the current new almost all night flares. Sometimes a flare would wake me and happen randomly at night for a time but then they seemed mostly normal after the evening but now it is almost all night. They seems much easier to flare too, like sitting crossed legged which would not have done it before. As mentioned one big toenail stopped growing around the time I noticed the shower flare and other a couple of other nails were horizontally splitting ever almost 1mm - I wondered how much of an issue the toenails could cause as now flares can start there or be the worst there - it makes walking harder at times as it swells with the retracted cuticle and short length due to no growth, it is like it is almost being absorbed into my toe but not like a typical ingrown toenail. The two splitting nails seemed to have stopped growing now too for some months and the others slower. I also developed a lump under one of my toes that hurts sometimes. I saw a podiatrist who did not know what it was and mused it seemed like my immune system was doing it maybe and also saw photos of my feet in a flare and said she would never seen anything like it and Reynaud's would not be red. My GP said toe nails never stop growing and he is never seen it in all his years, so no luck there even though as the pod said so many things can cause it. Waiting on NHS pod call as she said maybe they' would know more but not feeling hopeful. Before this my toes were always cold and I spent most time barefoot and the cold did not bother them much and now outside of flares it is usual they are ice cold - you can have a toe or a set of toes ice cold and the others 20-30c hotter. Maybe of note: I had a bad MH patch and wore the same few pairs of socks say in day out for quite a while and the feet when they  go all red would be in the shape of the trainer sock and the line that was embossed in my ankle would be the reddest and where it stopped - months after stopping that that is still like that and the line of wear it starts on my ankle/foot is not as red but at times when you look is still noticeable and more red. The creams I tried on my hands I have also been putting on my feet since. It seems showering hurts less without them at times so wondered if I would gotten a skin condition there too where water dried it at made it more sore even though the barrier should be the healthiest it is ever been given I did not use cream before. Cooling with fridge gel packs would at times stop a flare and as time went on would not be enough and it alternates as as mentioned sometimes it can stop/delay a flare if I catch it in the big toe/toes in time. Sometimes standing will make the veins bulge so much and fast I cry, or it can do to a lesser extent and on odd occasion getting out of bed it can feel like the bottoms of my feets nerves are singed by a lighter as well as the veins suddenly filling.\n\nEars: used to get a bit hot one or both when really run down and tired for as long as I can remember for a while but that was normal I am told and my mum's did it too and it was not anywhere near this hot. They were the last thing to get involved it seems and is more often one ear than both and get so hot to the point it looks like small blood vessels have burst behind my ear and you can feel the heat holding your hand a distance away. When flaring also sometimes feels like my ear tubes are more blocked. It can be a bad flare or like I have had a week and a bit more than once where they would both flare lesser every evening and if I used headphones. Coming in from outside can cause a flare or being outside can cause a flare in one or both even though they were both subjected to the same. Cooling does not work as well on them or always work on them, but I try.\n\nKnees: my right knee went red a few times and would burns more and gives off heat at times, then on some evenings and now both knees give off heat but the left lesser every evening. I have the knee pain mentioned from before that went away that a triage doc over the phone said sounded like chondromalacia patella (wearing and or catching of under knee cartilage - often runners knee, but I bend my knees a lot when sitting so thought maybe that) due to the and burning pain behind the kneecap (at the time was less often actually hot to the touch) and the grinding cartilage. The neuro I saw said the knee was not tracking correctly and could cause pain. It seems like maybe I had this before and walking resolved it but now walking makes it and the chance of burning in the evening much worse, not that I can walk like I used to - seems like it could be the THEM and that. Oddly my left knee in the last few days has started hurting either not a s bad or as bad and is lesser hot.\n\nElbows: I had burning pain start in my right elbow around the time of the second finger swelling which was seemingly caused by bending it or it being bent. It seemed from where the pain was to be the ulner nerve and surrounding or cubital tunnel despite my fingers not tingling often or at all or just a bit like right now when I thought about it and my arms have been bent typing. Sometimes it feels like moreof the elbow is hurting than just that area and sometimes feels like it is giving off heat but do not know if that is coincidence. I tried the exercises for it at home (which either seemed to do nothing or make it a little or a lot worse) and slept with it straight. Sadly in the past week my left elbow suddenly felt the same but has calmed to being an issue but not as much, which makes more sense since the right one was bad first but still confusing. \n\nThe last two I know are things that can happen in arthritis.\n\nMy GPs are awful and would not do anything about things until they said they would ask a department I am not under to refer me to neurology even though I told them the hospital said they would not so anything and they could reffer. In the end I privately saw someone listed as  knowing THEM here in England and mentioned in some THEM forums. \n\nHe said I do and do not have it - given that the name means redness pain and heat and I have those, but it is not what he recognises as THEM as I am too old for primary and said secondary usually comes with an obvious primary cause and neurological signs that usually precipitates the redness and that I do not have any of these or indications of such a disease. He said that those with THEM usually come in flip flops and I explained they are not always flaring and how much walking it takes to do it differs. He also said how usually any heat would set off a flare.  He said I had some features that do not go along with this (following the statement of now having anything making it primary or secondary) , which I am not sure if he means are unrelated to THEM but he sees or are related in a way so means could be a secondary thing possibly - he said he saw the photos of the swollen red hot fingers and the knee and said he thinks they may be more significant and payment suggest palindromic arthritis (which in clinic he mentioned as a kind of pre-arthritis, but a search shows me it is a type of arthritis that goes from one part to another by the hour or days?) I think he will be referring to photos I included of the fingers in the swelling episode, not how they look in a usual flare. He said it is been called dactylitis which he put (inflammation of the finger) next to but does not think they are descriptive terms I carry or a diagnosis he can make (I worry he thinks they look like that often, although I explained in emails prior and there...) He said he did not think it was neurological and probably fits within rheumatology or pain medicine (although it is more burning than pain). He also said I may have Raynaud's which he calls a typically triphastic colour change and describe redness and dusky purple  - I do not get this as the redness goes with heat apart from when my right hand if just pinker/redder and my toes tend to be the purple thhings which makes sense as they are cold, but then surely they would go white and it does not cause heat?\n\nHe mentioned sometimes patients who have depressive of anxiety symptoms do quite well with meds like Venlafaxine or other antidepressant drugs which stabilise neurotrasmitters and stop fluctuations in peripheral blood supply from happening - have you ever heard of such a thing? He mentioned one instance of this to me so am unsure if he just knew of one patient where their use of this coincided with symptoms getting better and no note of what else they took or other factors and said it was out of his area of expertise really. \n\nSadly a number of things he wrote in the letter showed I either did not get a timeline and what happened across well or he did not remember or read what I sent so am not so confident if he is basing his findings on that.\n\nI am at the end of my rope and so lost and cannot go back onto antidepressants for a number of reasons, nor does it make sense to me and not being on one will not cause finger joints to hurt when typing always.\n\nIf you have read this far thank you very much - if you have idea idea of what it could be or where to go I would appreciate hearing it. I have so little fight left but I figured asking here is something I have not done. Thank you for sharing.  I think I can help you with some of your questions.\n\n1. Toenails:  Splitting, pitting, etc are typically caused by mineral deficiencies.\n   1. Yes, your toenails can stop growing, but it takes a while to notice.  Basically, this is what causes \"beaus lines\" in people with autoimmune diseases.  Your rheumatologist would have recognized beaus lines as they are a typical symptom of diseases like diabetes and lupus.\n   2. If you think your diet is rich enough in greens and such, a mineral deficiency can be caused by gut problems.\n2. Toe Lump: People with vascular problems, like those with reynaud's, THEM, and vasculities, etc, will get painful bumps on their toes.  These are called chilblains and they typically occur in response to cold.  I have these with my THEM/Reynauds mix. It can definitely be alarming.\n3. Antidepressants:  Actually yea. Antidepressants and antianxiety meds can help a lot with neurological pain.  It is not because it is making you less depressed or anxious, but because of the biological mechanisms involved.  Both of those meds improve nerve communication, which in turn improves a number of symptoms.\n4. Unfortunately, when you fall into the \"complicated\" box, it can take years to get a final diagnosis.  There is a lot of things that have to be ruled out or ruled in and those things require multiple tests over time.  It is just a slow process. Mostly because so many conditions exist across many, many, many diseases. And sometimes, those diseases can cause each other, or other issues.  And the only way they can get to the right answer is by erasing all the wrong answers.\n5. People with THEM will also tend to get Reynauds.  Not always, but it does happen. THEM is super rare, so few doctors will recognize it by the symptoms.  If you think that its THEM and not Reynauds, than push back on the heat and relief by cold.  Reynauds is not improved by exposure to cold.  A Rheumatologist can help you with this because they typically see Reynauds and THEM as secondary problems to autoimmune disease, just sometimes they can also happen on their own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit:  It is possible for secondary THEM to precede an autoimmune disease.  Usually by a couple of years.  So if its secondary THEM, and you do not have an autoimmune disease, that is something that can change over time.  Some diseases can take a while for the symptoms to become pronounced enough to start showing up in blood tests. This is part of why it can take years to get a diagnosis when your complicated. Thank you so much for your reply!\nWith toes\n1. It seems I am fine on all but inefficient but not deficient vitamin D and a folate that is sometimes low and sometimes the low end of the healthy range. The rheum I saw suggested I was low in C as he saw foliculitis of the skin, but figured a test would have shown that. My diet is not good due to health but figured if I had enough of what they test I was fine but maybe not?\n1.2 Since my toenail stopped growing in summer and it takes 6 months to replace itself it seems but I do not have anything that looks enough like even a mild beaus line. The cuticle receded so the nail bed is much bigger though, whilst the others that split horizontally have stopped/slowed :( I wonder why.\n\n2. I am sorry for your mix of too cold and hot, how awful. My knowledge of chilblains was someone telling me that is why the tops of my toes were itchy and sore for a few hours after coming in from the cold and sitting by a fire but looking at Google they can be much more than that. Do you think it could cause a solid mass underside of one toe that could hurt and be bigger some days but not others?\n\n3. Oh wow, so there was some truth there. You mentioned anti-anxiety meds - as I am already on Clonazepam/Klonopin I would hope that was enough as that is a strong med (although I am meant to come off due to risks after 2 years and should never have been on it this long). I did ask why would not it be a bipolar med as that is mean't to stabilise ups and downs but he said it was not really his area. It is a shame there is so much risk to taking them and they work badly in me as I would love a pill to help.\n\n4. Right now I am a you have nothing nameable apart and various symptoms like described like one rheum said he saw dactylitis which is as far as I know a sign of auto-immune things, although others said it was not that at all even though it really looks like it and. It seemed like it to me, it was there one year for a little then almost two later it comes back in two fingers much worse - a sign of things getting worse. As far as NHS are concerned they have erased all rheumatological conditions based on the puzzle blood work but the neurologist said it seemed more of that kind of thing :(\n\n5. He was one listed as good on the THEM database, so I had hope. He said only as he understands the condition so get it is not a definite and many medical people do not want to be. He said Reynaud's could include red hoand that just seemed odd as I thought that was white/purple and do not know if he meant along with the redness and heat. This man said he is used to seeing things like blood cancers and secondary type things and my bloodwork came back clear for all secondary causes (minus the hmm on my finger swelling)  - that is what the private rheum said when I was not there about just THEM, although he said blood work cannot rule it out and then the non-consultant agreed with the NHS consultant and said I do not have anything due to puzzle pieces and it left me lost. I do not get how to say it is THEM you must have redness, pain and heat (although I am not so much on the pain side unless it is the sensation of the heat being painful or the veins bulging), which he agrees I have, but it has to act flare based on even a little heat and the things I mentioned. I also do not get how he does not think there is anything secondary vascular wrong given the veins and redness. Can it still be THEM if it is not so much painful as it is red and hot with the more the veins hurting at times if anything, maybe a burning pain of a kind due to the heat - it seems like people are mostly in a ton of pain with this.\n\nOn their own would be primary right? He said I was too old for that to show up (29), could that be right?\n\nI heard about that and it was a worry, especially if you cannot control the THEM until the secondary cause is under control it seems. I am so scared because if I have something that requires auto-immune meds it is game over already as it is this bad and getting worse so fast :( I do not know if I should try for another rheum that knows THEM but I suppose they may not know the other things that can cause it (like the cancers and such and it seems that is usually clear on bloodwork or only specialists in that can find it maybe...) \n\nAt this point I would hope for it to be secondary to something cureable or something that can be controlled without meds... is that a pipe dream? Can a really bad diet cause the redness and heat that seems so much like THEM or even cause THEM do you think? Someone said if I got my diet in order such and such but it seems like a stretch.... one was a rheum who when the THEM type stuff was more hidden and the other a physio who believed in the gut a food medicine and told me to stop going down the medical route and go there and get therapy and it would fix it all....\n\nThank you so much for your reply, I am really grateful and sorry for the questions and please do not feel you need to reply. 3. It sounds like your neurologist and rheumatologist will have to communicate about this issue to work out what is going on.  Unfortunately this is the part that sucks about having a complex health problem.  I am sorry for what you are going through.\n4. It could also be vasculitis, gout, diabetes and a lot of other health problems.  THEM is basically diagnosed by figuring out what is causing it.\n\nPrimary is genetic. It \"starts in childhood and you probably have a parent with it.\"\nSecondary is when it is caused by something else. Such as an autoimmune problem or a neurological problem or something else.  \n\nIt probably will not get much worse for a while. And if it does, that will help them figure it out more easily, so keep track of your symptoms!  \n\nSometimes the best solution is mixing therapy, meds, and a better diet.  It at least helps the symptoms, even if it does not help with the diagnosis.  The mediterranean diet is one of the best diets for people with health problems. Also, if you do end up on autoimmune meds, its definitely not game over.  In fact, even if you do not have an autoimmune disease specifically, there is a lot of diseases that are treated by autoimmune meds and the symptoms are definitely better when on the med.  Plaquenil is not that bad if you are not sensitive to it.  And once you are on it, your life will get better.  You will have to take the med forever, but there is much worse outcomes. ", "First time looking into why this happens all the time, possibly THEM?  Hey, welcome. Pull up a chair.\n\nFirst things first, I am not your doctor. I am not A doctor. I am just a guy on the internet who has THEM and spouts on about it.\n\nThat photo is a definite maybe for THEM.\n\nA lot of things can cause skin redness, anything from an allergic reaction to the soap you use up to some more serious medical issues.\n\nTHEM is typically accompanied by pain. Pain is a hallmark of the condition. Without pain it is not likely to be THEM.  It *could* be, but is not likely.\n\nOther conditions like palmar erythema, mast cell activation syndrome, or even liver disease could be causing it.\n\nSo a quick, and not completely accurate, at-home test for THEM is to put your hands under running cool (room temp or slightly below) tap water. If the redness and pain quickly disappear that makes THEM more likely.  If the redness and pain return after warming back up that makes THEM more likely.  If elevating your hands over your head makes the redness and pain go away that makes THEM more likely. And if lowering your hands makes the redness and pain return that makes THEM more likely.\n\nIf none of those things affect symptoms then THEM is much less likely.\n\nIf after reading a bit more about the condition you do think you might have THEM then seeing a doctor who is familiar with the condition is important. Most doctors are not because THEM is rare. Really rare.\n\nThe Erythromelalgia Association maintains a ( with a list of doctors familiar with the condition. You can search that list for a doctor close to you. I would suggest seeking out an appointment with one of those doctors for evaluation regardless of their specialty. Various specialists are in involved in the treatment of THEM.\n\nGood luck. Thank you for all the helpful info! I will be definitely looking into seeing a physician. Ok so yes about the THEM but I am going to go over a few things. Of course see a doctor but this is pretty obvious. Rheumatologist might be an asshole but if you can get to pain management they might diagnosis you. I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO THE NEXT THING I SAY. SKIP CLEVELAND CLINIC. Duke has A doctor who is learning about THEM and has had two patients with it. Mayo Clinic will really push their pain clinic on you. That pain clinic is like three hours of exercise, no meds, and other bullshit that will not help. Do not drink the coolaid. There is also Boston pain intervention (I am heading there next). If you are a minor: CHKD DOESNT HAVE A SINGLE WELL EDUCATED DOCTOR ON THIS. The ERYTHROMELALGIA CAN SPREAD. SOMETIMES REALLY FAST. It is been a year with mine and it is almost my entire body. Nobody tells you that. You need to know. Pain meds I am on: Gabapentin (makes you tired but does help), mexiletine, and Amitriptyline. Emergency meds: ketamine gaba compound (insurances do not always cover this) and lidocaine. Also if you live in a state with medical marijuana or recreational that is a good option! ASK ANY QUESTION IM TRYING TO GO OVER EVERYTHING- Thank you! \nAnd actually the fact it is become a nuisance is why I finally decided to get not only a diagnosis but treatment as well. It is spreading like you mentioned so that was another concern. The pain and burning has always been there but it is now spreading to not just my hands and feet, but parts throughout my body to my face and ears. Its also gotten to the point that ANY heat flares me up. Exercising, hot water, the temperature outside to cooking, any exposure to heat makes me feel like I am burning alive, and so very swollen. \nI will definitely look into lidocaine for at least some relief. So far it is just been just cold water to at least calm it down for a second till it goes back to burning.\nAs for the medication, is it long term or is it until it is manageable? Yup that is THEM. Mines in my neck, face, ears, legs, knees, elbows, feet, and ankles as of now. It depends. For some people it goes away. But what I found was that everytime I got it to where it was manageable it continued to spread. I just got the mexiletine a few weeks ago. That is known to help so I will see. You have to specifically ask for that though because the other ones were suggested to me but mexiletine we had to bring it up first. Defiantly a possibility", "Same Day Loans With No Credit Check | Get Cash Overnight. Bad Credit OK. ", "Warm red blotches that appear randomly. Is this THEM? (3 red lines on neck are birthmark not flare up)  That is exactly what my THEM looks like! Sometimes I get blotches &amp; sometimes it is my whole feet or hands that turn red, face quite often turns red too. Looks a lot like it, moreso your fingers,  cheeks, and nose\n\nHands, feet, torso, knees, cheeks, and ears are the most common areas for THEM flares.\n\nIf the redness and heat is accompanied by pain that is a sign.  If you can ease a flare by running cool tap water over the skin and provoke  a flare running warm bath water over the area then THEM seems very likely. I agree with this! From what I have been told by my own doctor, a key diagnostic feature of THEM is that its provoked by heat. Sometimes I randomly flare up when I am cold (why, body, WHY?!) but  running warm water over my feet or hands will provoke a flare up 10 times out of 10. I am sorry you are dealing with this OP!  Yeah it appears in all of the places you listed aside from torso and knees. I dont have pain during the flare up, but my skin feels red hot and i know theyre there before even looking in a mirror. Warm showers turn my whole body red lol but I figured that is just from it being warm. My face doesnt get the blotches just from showers though. Yes! I never get them when im cold, it only happens when im hot. It not every time though. The blotches appear so inconsistently so i can never pin down what exactly sparks them Yeah unfortunately it happens most often on my face. My feet get bad when i wear sandals and its warm outside, and my hands seems to only have like 2 or 3 fingers flare up at a time.", "THEM flares stopped during covid?? So I have THEM and recently had covid.\n\nI have had nonstop flare ups for months that nothing alleviates, except THC for the pain aspect. \n\nWhile i had covid, and ONLY while i had covid- did these flare ups stop. Im puzzled. \n\nMy concern is that last year i was hospitalized for 6 days or so with unbearable pain throughout my entire body, even slightest touch felt like it was my raw muscle which i was told by my doctor that in retrospect they were somewhat certain it was covid. I had an \"unknown virus\" I was discharged with the hospital and have been treated with gabapentin since. It does nothing now but alleviated the agony i was in at the time i went to the hospital. \\*\\* I had already had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia given the day to day pain i was already experiencing, this wasnt out of nowhere per say.\n\nSo if i truly had covid last year, and the flare ups became rapidly worse from that point on, and then they suddenly stopped when i caught B117 covid this year... is it possible that it may have \"flipped\" on or activated the SCN9A gene that causes THEM. I know conditions from SCN9A are genetic in my case, but this is just odd. \n\nMy other thought is that this could have to do with how covid impacts endothelial linings. I am not a doctor so i dont know. Although im fairly certain at this point from my experience theyd have less of a clue. If anyone experienced the same random offset of flares during covid, or they were affiliated with it in one way or another im really curious if this is just me or this is something to question on my own. This would also mean maybe the vaccine could reverse my symptoms, but im 99% sure i will not be putting that in to my body regardless and risking the chance of more complications. I think there may be a connection, but not sure what or how, and my doctors have only found my story mildly interesting. I am pretty sure I had COVID in Feb 2020 from international travel before we were testing. By April, the THEM flares in my toes (lucky that I only get them there) were worst ever in 10 years. Debilitating at times and had lots of flaring through this year. After my first Pfizer vaccine shot, I flared nearly constantly for 3 weeks. After my second shot the flares stopped and have not returned for more than a month now. Most relief I have had in this last year. Recent bloodwork returned a positive autoimmune response, and I will be getting more testing to identify if there is an issue. So I think my THEM may be related to my immune system, have probably been a type of Covid \u201clong hauler\u201d and getting they full vaccine dose may have been what I needed to reset a bit. \n\nI am sorry you have had such a rough time of it. I can imagine the pain I have felt is only a slice of your experience, and so I bet that has been unbearable at times. I hope you find some enduring relief!! Unfortunately it is just too new and too rare to really know...\n\nI am sorry for what you have gone through.\n\nThe vaccine is far less likely to affect you than covid.  It is not the same thing, at all. Unfortunately t's just too new and too rare to very much knoweth. \n \ni am my most humble apology f'r what thee've gone through\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Hi! Thank you! :) By the question of the vaccine reversing my issues, im referring to the fact that since the covid vax is an mRNA replicator, that it may take the same course as the actual virus pathology and have the same impact on blood vessels. I think they would be similar in nature as from what ive read asymptomatic people experience the endothelial lining thing as well. I dont think its a symptom that is ill inducing as i kind of had to dig to even find it. Maybe other people just wouldnt see a visible change on their body because they function properly to begin with? Or its just not relevant enough to the general population to explain such a complicated thing and doesnt necessarily matter unless someone were to raise concern at that specific function. I thought someone might have insight on whether that is true or false because i obviously cannot apply what ive read as i know its not always easy to find a reliable source or study especially because our knowledge of covid changes by the day. THEM has been caused by flu vaccines and other vaccines before too. I was wondering if anyone's THEM had calmed down or stopped post vaccination. I really cannot afford to take the chance myself at the moment as i had covid so badly and the only thing that helped me recover eventually was an emergency room doctor advising me to take motrin every 4 hours consistently until i feel ive gotten better. First thought was \"that cant be good for you\" im sure it isnt good for you to take so much of it but that leads me to the conclusion that in my case given that im immunocompromised before i even count THEM into the picture, my immune response was a highly inflammatory one if that is the only thing that helped. I didnt take motrin once until she had advised that and i was better fairly quickly. Im hoping someone more well versed in this can reply and branch off on some things i threw out in the realm of possibility. I could sound like a moron, but could be on to something. I have put my pride aside for this one haha. I just dont want to deal with this bullsh\\*t anymore and ill try anything. i thank ye very much Ahhh! That is incredibly interesting. My pharmacist actually suggested the concept of the vaccine helping long haulers and that i may be one months ago. Recently he told me some of his other patients who had severe long haul GI issues.  Im going for many rounds of bloodwork this week and next for other issues and i informed them that it stopped during covid so maybe this will actually help covid research if we both receive a matching consensus, and thank you for your help and empathy. I hope the positive response sticks around for you! I cant imagine ten years of this. Ive been sick for 6 years and only had THEM for a little less than a year now but nothing tortures me like THEM has since for me its like all day in at least one spot or another. And thank you so much &lt;3. Dont invalidate your illness though!! Give yourself credit for managing it. It takes alot to deal with. Have you tried antihistamines? Sometimes they help.\n\nHave you seen a neurologist yet? If not you should push for that.\n\nCovid has been known to cause neurological problems, so it would not surprise me if it could also cause THEM, but that is the kind of thing that needs lots of research. It is been linked to guillain-barre syndrome.\n\nThem can be caused by autoimmune disease as well when the immune system attacks the peripheral nerves.\n\nThe vaccine isnt the virus, it is a protein target, so it should not have the same effect. It might feel sucky, might trigger symptoms. But so will getting reinfected.  Work with your doctor to get better info.  Theyll know you better than the internet. I have 2 autoimmune diseases (that im concretely diagnosed with, many are in question). I havent seen a neurologist in a year or so i was just given \"you have AMPS\" She wasnt thorough and didnt care but that was before THEM. I definitely dont have enough Guillain Barre symptoms to think about that too hard. Ive had such a wacky course of symptoms with everything the entirety of me being sick that no possibility would shock me anymore. Everything seems to not quite align. Antihistamines do nothing for me. What is strange to me is ive had these blotchy patches that get so warm and red my whole life and we brushed it off as sensitive skin for so long, the pediatrician said it was hives. This still happens, i have the flare ups in such weird places , inside of my forearms, stomach back etc. Saw an allergist/Immunologist and she said that it is absolutely not hives and it never has been hence her concern, it doesnt look any different that THEM and sometimes ill have flare ups that cover 3/4 of my body and it almost blends in color with the ones on my hands feet and knees. Typically the start of my constant nighttime flare ups is crippling heat and pain in my thumb and pointer finger and that is almost every time right on the money at 5 oclock. I spoke to one of my doctors who advised me to not get the vaccine until we fully understand my underlying conditions that arent diagnosed yet, but wasnt certain that it is cause for concern, so she didnt want to rule it out. Allergy/ Immunology is consulting with 3 or 4 doctors to see what conditions they need bloodwork to display and i believe one was a separate neurologist than the one i saw, im also seeing genetics tomorrow but that will take 4 months so that is crappy. Yea I am still waiting for my referral to turn into an appointment myself.  At least a year until I see a geneticist let alone a neurologist.\n\nTHEM is possible with all that stuff going on.  Have you seen a rheumatologist?  They typically recognize them as a symptom of autoimmune diseases.  With secondary THEM, treating the underlying problem also tends to treat the them, but not always Yes, Rheum is who diagnosed me. She believes it is secondary. I havent heard from her after i saw allergy/immunology so im not sure her opinion after what that doctor said or if shes even aware. It took me years to get this genetics appointment. Really crucial because my mom is adopted and we have no idea what she could possibly carry. Dissapoints me that this wasnt done so much earlier. You should schedule a follow up with the rheumatologist and ask about treatment options and such.  It sounds like they know what is going on.  At the least, they can help you understand what is going on better and can recommend things like neurology or autoimmune disease treatments My symptoms also got better after the second Pfizer shot, although I have had THEM for more than 3 years. This thing is seriously confusing.", "Self meta-analysis of who is getting better and who is getting worse in time with THEM. l think exposing the feet to ANY kind of cool/cold makes this disease go worse on the long run. Even during flares, lm pretty new to this disease but in this short time l've been able to read thousands of posts and stories and made a self meta-analysis out of them. The biggest common findings of mine suggest that %99 of the people who live under the fans and constantly avoiding heat and using meds or gels for sypmtomatic relief always have the air conditioning on are most likely to get worsen in the long distance. The literal only people who manage getting better in time are the people doing bob's heat desensitization protocol and avoiding COLD. Which makes sense alot as adjusting your nerves to be less sensitive against heat and keeping their heat at normal levels to prevent rebound flares as the body will less and less likely to want to rush blood as that part of the are does't need to be heated by the body which are the unwanted flares born of this anomality.The secondary THEM case is we all know about so no need to speak about it as it can be cured with curing the primary cause so nvm that. l know human body is extremely adaptable so force adapting it to get cool will always backfire as the body is already trying to make that area warm so keeping it cool/cold is like the worst thing ever even during flares as it will message your body that the heating is still not enough and force it to heat the area even MORE. lts just a theory but the results and the stories and the amount of people getting better with heat and getting worse with cold in the long run is extremely supporting this theory up. Also people with raynauds too get huge benefits from this protocol aswell. Cure rates are for secondary THEM patients are promising, for normal heat avoider 7/24 under the fan patients (which is the vast majority)are  really grim and unpromising and the only group will progressively get better and get closest to being cured are the people doing the bobs protocol. l also got to say there are people who do not get any improvement with it but we all know THEM's pathology differs from person to person. Using nerve supplements like lions mane ALA b12 exercising  and doing the protocol offers the ONLY thing that is closest to cure. The result of the rest methods are offering nothing but symptomatic relief with a devastating harm and worsening rate on the long run which is extremely unsatisfying. This is a self meta analysis of mine from the nearly all posts and stories i could possibly find on the internet.  Best of luck. l just got cured of CPPS as many had thought it was impossible by doing the same kind of meta analysis. l think with focusing the correct details one can have his life back from this disorder too.", "Genetic Testing? My daughter is a juvenile and has THEM. Tomorrow we are going in for genetic testing. Has anyone had genetic testing? \n\nAlso, my kid has lots of medical conditions which I will not list but this last one, THEM, is aggressive and is already moving north of her ankle.  It happens multiple times a day and she has a pain management Dr who is amazing BUT - this diagnosis, this disease, she knows is going to be with her everyday and she is going to be in pain and she is not going to get rid of it.  She is really angry and she has every right to be. My kid has other diseases that are more severe but this one (I guess bc of the extreme pain and unpredictability) is a hard pull to swallow.\n\nAny words? What are things others have done for you that make it better? What have you done for yourself that makes it better? By \u201cit\u201d I mean living with it emotionally.  I am all over the medical side of this. \n\nThanks in advance. I really appreciate anything you have to say. I participated in a few trials between Pfizer, Yale, and the VA hospital system. They were studying THEM because they could isolate it and study it and then extrapolate those results to more general chronic pain conditions. They were not able to give me the results of my genetic testing because they had to protect my information from those outside the study (including me); however, they were able to tell the geneticist exactly what mutation to look for and where to look for it so it made that side of things relatively cheap. I carry the mutation and can extrapolate now who in my family carries it.\n\nAs for dealing with it.... My onset was about 17-20 years ago. It is not debilitating or life-threatening, but it changes everything because I make decisions based on it. If my life were in danger I feel I would not be hindered and would be able to physically remove myself from danger. But it is the downtime that gets me. There is never any rest. It is always there. \"death by a thousand cuts\" comes to mind. It is just.... tiring. To have to always feel it and always know it is there.\n\n I do not hike anymore or snowboard or do much of anything active. It is disappointing to have to decline much of anything active not because I cannot do it but because I just do not want to deal with the aftermath of it. It gets tiring to explain it (because on a neurological level I struggle to understand what is going on too). It gets tiring explaining to family (yep, still hurts. No, they cannot do anything. Yes, I have tried that). Things that seem innocuous (bowling, ice skating, hiking, golf, walking long distances) suddenly become so burdensome. It gets tiring.\n\nWinter is deceptively tough because though there is always a source of cold around its cold enough to cause frostbite and necrosis.\n\nAs for what I do to deal with it. I stumbled upon carbamezapine during one of the studies I participated in. It still hurts sometimes when I take it, but it is not as frequent or severe compared to when I do not and the side effects are not enough to deter me. The gains outweigh the costs. Besides that I have a sedentary desk job and live a sedentary life. I wish I could be more active, but I do what I can when it does not hurt and stop when it does. For relationships, I decline a lot, and request that friends and family be patient.\n\n\nI feel like I may have lost my train of thought along the way, but hopefully this helped. Let me know if you have any specific questions. I really appreciate your response. You sound like a realistic and practical person which my kid is also.  I really try to listen and pay attention if I am needed or not and I am trying to work out communication so I give space when needed but that I am also there when needed. I hope to avoid adding more stress when trying to be helpful.  You described what it is like to be on the receiving end of helping loved ones very well.\n\nMy kid only liked one sport and was good at it. That has faded and it is painful. You also put that into words very well.  \n\n\u201cNever any rest\u201d - yes.\n\nThank you for going through it and for participating in the studies. I hope in 10 years there will be more options and that is a long time, everyday having to go through this but maybe the second half of my kids life can be the better part.\n\nI do have one question:  do you do anything that puts your mind somewhere else? \n\nThank you for your thoughtful response.  It makes me a better mother and I will use it to be more understanding and try harder. Nothing specific, just focus on something. I have a woodworking shop; that is not very strenuous. Other things I enjoy are video games, board games, escape rooms, recreational math, driving, cooking, and tedious/repetitive crafts like Legos, braiding/lanyards, and origami. I did genetic test for SCN9A which distinguishes primary THEM from secondary. It costs 250 USD out of pocket if your insurance does not cover it. \n\nIt was worth it for me to know so my rheumatologist and I could make treatment plans. \n\nHow did the testing go for your child? We had a long meeting with a genetics counselor before the blood draw who was amazing. He let my daughter know that even if it does not come back positive for the genetic defect it does not mean she does not have it.  He took a bunch of family history and filled in medical gaps for a timeline of her health/symptoms. He also told her in very nice terms there is not a cure and she said she knew that. The counselor was great and the way he talked to her as a caring adult with facts and he told her not to let this define her and it all made her feel more calm. She does not like being talked down to or not given it straight. \n\nIt was worth alone to have the genetic counselor talk to her but we will get the results in 2-4 weeks.\n\nThanks for asking! Wow! That genetic counseling session sounds incredible! I love hearing positive healthcare stories like that since there seem to be so many providers who just do not get it. \n\nGood luck with the results and future treatment decisions!", "Has anyone found an answer to/effective treatment for facial swelling? It makes me more self-conscious than any other symptom. I feel like I am baseline swollen almost all the time at this point.  I agree. Definitely my least favorite symptom. I find that keeping my face moisturized with lotion or body oil helps.  The body oil seems to help because have mild anhidrosis on the face and it the oil seems to have a cooling effect when I am out and about. I found intermittent fasting has reduced my swollen face. I noticed like the second week. Have you tried it? I normally do not flare in face, but it does swell. My flares are mainly legs and hands. i keep a face mist in my fridge to help, i have kidney issues too so it does not help with swelling but it really calms down my skin I have not tried intermittent fasting. What does your time window look like? Got it, thank you! Does your kidney issue cause swelling in your face? I agree, putting moisturizer on my skin definitely offers some relief. Thank you!! I like doing 20 hour fasts with 4 hour window, but I do vary it anywhere from 14-24 hours depending how I feel. Short eating windows are better. yes, they cause swelling all over my body For temporary relief on my face I use Be Koool kids fever reducer gel patches.

Left side is during flare, right side is normal ", "Biggest pieces of advice for newly diagnosed Hi all. I shared this as a comment in another post and thought I would go ahead and make it a post for all to read and add your own advice, too!\n\nAfter living with this for over four years (diagnosed three years ago), my biggest pieces of advice are:\n\n1) keep shopping around for care providers until you find one who is knowledgeable about THEM and compassionate to help you on the long road of trying different treatment options. Do not stay with a Dr or certain specialty just because you were referred there. Go elsewhere (rheumatologists generally have good knowledge of THEM but can take forever to get into, some dermatologists also do, so do not settle)!\n\n\n2) do not get discouraged when the first, second or third med does not help relieve flares. Everyone is body is different and reacts differently to different drugs. I, for one, did not find any relief until my fourth and sixth drugs in the progression of trying different things. What I take now helps me manage the pain of flares much better than I used to. \n\n\n3) there is no cure for this condition. Very few ever find full remission. I am not saying that it is impossible to go into remission. I am just saying that the vast majority of us never do. It is helpful to manage our own expectations going in...knowing the primary goal is to help reduce symptom progression and severity to the point that improves our quality of life. \n\n\n4) Try to partner with your doctor to learn as much as you can about the underlying cause of THEM. Some THEM patients never really know, but if you can at least pinpoint a general idea (primary vs. secondary THEM, autoimmune vs. myoproliferative disease, neurovascular only like a POTs or Raynaud's co-condition) \n\n\nThis greatly influences how your doctor and you manage the symptoms and how you go about choosing the right form of treatment. If we manage the underlying causes and triggers as best as possible, it really helps with THEM!\n\n\nAgain... disclaimer that not everyone has luck with trigger reduction or finding out the direct cause of their THEM. And in that situation, you just have to slowly work your way through the different treatment options until you find one that helps. Thanks for this post, I have not tried since the lockdown but I really should get back at it and search for a doctor... Honestly it flares up every single day the second the heat goes on in the winter and I just kind of gave up after a while. Whenever I eat/drink/move it seems to happen. The only thing that seems to help is showering when it does because I know it will happen again later so I eliminate one flare from the daily rotation :/ lol\n\nI am curious, what medication are you taking and are there any adverse side effects? I have gotten used to dealing with this so I am not sure I want to trade one problem for another. I second the comment above with asking what meds you have taken and what meds you take now?\n\nMy kid takes gabapention (300mg 2 x a day) and we use refrigerated lidocaine cream as well as refrigerated Voltaren cream.  She was supposed to take 900 mg of gabapentin but could not stay awake.  Her pain management Dr said a compound pharmacy could make a cream but it would be expensive and most likely not covered by insurance.  \n\nAlso, what about exercise for anyone?  I am thinking swimming and weight lifting....is this reasonable? What do you do for exercise?\n\nMy kids flair\u2019s are about 4-5 a day with excruciating painful ones about 2 times a week - where she thinks her foot may have permanent damage it was so painful.\n\nThanks!! I have previously tried gabapentin, venlafaxine, Cymbalta, aspirin, all SSRIs. Those all either had too severe side effects for me or were not helpful for tampering the pain of flares down. \n\nI still flare but they are not as painful on the following meds:\nLyrica at lunch and dinner and amitriptyline (2 pills) two hours before I plan to fall asleep.\nI flare every night from basically 2am-6am, so the amitriptyline is absolutely essential to help me sleep through the worst of the nighttime flares. \n\nI also just started taking hydroxychoroquine (plaquenil) to help with my lupus-like symptoms but my rheumatologist who also helps manage my THEM meds said that plaquenil should not really have an impact on THEM. \n\nI sleep with ceiling fan and other fans blowing on me. I also have a couple of cooling pads I use after dinner when I start to flare on my back.", "I hate the summer! That is it! That is the post.\n\nI cannot even stand up with this 97 degree weather.

Anyone else get this or know if this could be related to THEM?  Hard to tell from your pic.\n\nYes, my knees flare during an them flare. I think it depends how I am sitting; have not quite figured it out yet My knees are pretty much always red and purple. I am assuming it is because of the circulation issues from THEM, livedo reticularis, and dysautonomia(which can all be common in people with THEM). They can flare up really bad at times, especially during feet flare ups. Since ears, hands, noses/faces, and feet can be involved(anything that extends from the body), it would make sense that the knees can be involved, too.

THEM is characterized by redness and pain.\n\nDoes exposure to heat (running your hand under quite warm water) cause your hand, foot, knee, ears, or cheeks to turn red and hurt? If so, does running the affected body part under cool tap water make the redness and pain go away?  If so, THEM is likely. Nope, there is no pain, just extremely hot. Running it under cold water helps temporarily but they just get hot again. So maybe it is not THEM, i just have no clue what it is I get the odd splotchy hands too. Mine come on randomly with no pain. Could be mild THEM (without pain) by itself and it could be a sodium channel issue that is causing excitation and swelling, which can cause THEM and other things. \n\nCould be other things also but in this sub those are the go to explanations. Same. Elevation and cooling to alleviate burning/hot/red extremities is the hallmark of THEM. You may want to speak to a neurologist.

I want to tell my story. \n\nI am fifteen. In June of 2020 my first flairs started. In my feet. I thought it was at worst a spider bite. I was diagnosed. Then had the testing and it is not primary. It is idiopathic (at the time of this posting). Nobody told me that my mortality rate was increased due to possible suicide. Nobody told me that as an already mentally ill person, I would wake up every day wishing I could give up. It spread to my lower leg. Than to my elbows and face. 1-7 flairs a day. The longest flair was hours long. I used to be an equestrian. Obviously as heat and exercise makes it worse, I cannot ride horses.

Erythromelalgia or something else...? (Same splotches on both knees. Feel very red and typical rash-like look.)  I get THEM flares on my knees but they are mostly one, big red solid patch right around my knee cap and patella tendon area. They take a long time to go away and feel hot and uncomfortable, not as painful as feet flares.\n\nWhen I shower, I do get these same blotches as your picture, up my calf and around my foot and ankle. I always just thought it was the beginning of a flare but the small blotches go away much faster and do not really feel painful compared to solid flares (bigger flares) I might have  going on.  \n\nHow fast do these blotches go away for you? Fairly quick. I just have to elevate my legs and they almost immediately go away. The same with the blotches and redness on my feet. \n\nI have very mild flares. Of course showering causes beet red feet, but if I elevate them they recover within a few minutes typically. I also get flares after standing up from laying down, or from standing too long. That was the case with these spots on my knees. I stood up after watching a movie in bed and got rash-like flares in my feet, as well as a purple-ish blotchy situation on my lower leg and these blotches on my knees. As soon as I get back in bed and elevate them, it mostly returns to normal (though I still have the uncomfortable pressure feeling in my feet even after they return to a normal color\u2014that takes longer to go away). I know exactly what you mean about the uncomfortable pressure feeling in your feet and sometimes on top of that I even have a weird sensation that almost feels like a buzzing or tingling in my feet as they slowly return to normal. \n\nStanding in one place, going from lying to standing, showering or any exposure to humidity or temps about 71 cause flares in me. I also have POTs and Raynaud's. Mine is usually more solid. Do you ever have larger patches, or is it always smaller rash-like patches like this? I have Raynaud\u2019s as well! No POTs though\u2014my doctor just checked for it. My other conditions are Gilbert\u2019s and R-RCP, which are relatively unrelated, but equally as \u2018harmless\u2019 and more just annoying. Usually just smaller. I get patches on my feet as well, but the feet also of course just turn red entirely sometimes. \n\nI also get patches on my hands, though they are a bit different. More like redness with white speckles, or, more recently, redness in the tips of my fingers and the heel of my palm. What is R-RCP? Hmmm. Everyone is different, so I cannot say for sure. When my knees turn red, though, it is a solid hot patch of red. Retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction. I cannot burp. Physically unable to. Instead I get a gurgling sensation in my chest due to trapped air, which also leads to heartburn and general bloating. My daughter had patches like this for years randomly.

I have no idea if the two are connected but here we are. I think very likely. I have had THEM that bothers just my feet for a long time. It is relatively mild compared to some, but I have always referred to my \u2018angry feet\u2019 that swell and get very red when I am walking on them too long or in the heat.

My husband has had it since birth. He is turning 56 in about a week. He has worked most of his adult life and for the most part lived a normal life. Contact Dr. Stephen Waxman at Yale University, he is the leading expert in the US or The Erythromelalgia Association both can be reached online. Do not panic, all things are possible. Try to stay as cool as possible, invest in a fan and listen to your body and what it is telling you. Good luck and God bless. Hey! If you need a support sister, feel free to send me a message. I am 22 years old and I have had Erythromelalgia for years. I definitely know all about having your life turned upside down. I do not know what you have tried so far, but there is definitely options for pain relief! Have you contacted Dr. Waxman about this before, and if so what was he able to do?  My girlfriend has been diagnosed with Erythromelalgia. It is my husband who has this and yes. He is seen Dr. Waxman and Dr. Drenth in the Netherlands. There is nothing that has truly help. He stays inside when it is really hot and humid. Tries to stay in a cool environment, he always has a fan blowing on his feet or his feet on an ice pack. He used to go to all the trials for things that might help but nothing really has. We have found keeping ace bandages soaked in lidocaine alone gel works best for the flares. My husband's case is very severe others in his family have a milder cases. It is a trial and error to find what works best for that person. Being that person's spouse, girlfriend, boyfriend, etc. can be very trying. Take care of yourself, use every resource you can and be patient and calm with them, they are suffering. That is about all I have got. Any more questions hit me again. Good luck! Thank you for your reply!  When you say your husband has lived a pretty normal life, has he been able to be active at all?  Or is he just stuck between going to work and trying to cool his feet? No! We have taken great vacations, spent time at children's sporting events, dance recitals, etc. We have four children and 10 grandchildren, during the summer months we spend our outdoor time in the pool. We live in Alabama so the summers are brutal but he has learned to do yard work or outdoor things early in the morning because of the heat. Yes, we have had to cancel things, miss out on some things but for the most  part he is been able to live normally. We carry an ice cooler everywhere we go with ice packs, cold water and wash clothes just in case of an attack. You learn how to live around it. Thank God, none of the kids contracted it.

Hi everyone,\n\nFor the past 6 years (possibly longer, but I did not start noticing it until I entered the work force), I have been getting daily \"flares\" of hot, red, burning, and even itchy hands.  While I would describe a burning sensation, it is not painful.  Even if someone could interpret it as pain (I would not), it is definitely not the type of debilitating pain described in many articles.\n\nIt normally occurs around 11-1PM and lasts for 5-30 minutes each time, usually after I have walked around the building.\n\nI am a 27 year old female.  I have worked in an office setting for the past 6 years.  When I used to work in close together cubicles, which would make the environment very, very hot and gross feeling, it would happen several times a day.\n\nI would say it is an annoying, uncomfortable, almost gross sensation - just makes me feel overheated all over (even if I can physically tell the rest of my body is cold, but my hands are burning hot.)\n\nI am curious to know what people diagnosed with erythromelalgia think about this?\n\nFor reference, RA runs in my family.  Also, I had Lyme's Disease at age 15.\n\nThanks for reading! I would call mine debilitating discomfort, but not pain. Been that way for about 15 years steady. I get tingling and pins and needles, and migraine with facial THEM, but my \u201cnormal\u201d THEM is not painful per se, although it is a classic presentation. This was asked in one of then Facebook groups, and I think most people answered the same way as I did. For the first 5 years of my THEM, I would have described it as short episodes of itchy discomfort. And the episodes only occurred in the cooler months.  Then it turned into pain and the episodes started being more frequent and occurring throughout the year. Now my THEM symptoms are constant and I am a textbook case.\n\nI think your symptoms could definitely be erythromelalgia.", "THEM?  Is this THEM is probably the #1 repeat post in this subReddit, unsurprisingly.\n\nI see some redness in your photos, particularly in the third finger.  \n\nAny redness in the legs or feet? Any pain in hands or feet? How would you describe the pain?\n\nFrom what I see, and I certainly am not a doctor, it does not really look like THEM. The redness does not look as widespread as is typical for THEM. It sounds like Raynaud's. It is a side-effect of Vyvanse.", "My rheumatologist diagnosed me with THEM today. Exercising and showers are awful. The burning in my hands wakes me up at night. I have only had it a few years, but does it ever get better? Any advice is appreciated :\u2019)  It can definitely get better! Did your rheumatologist offer any guidance on what you can try? For some people things that constrict the blood vessels help, others need things that dilate the blood vessels. Showers are terrible for me too btw, I understand your pain. Thanks for your reply! She did recommend gabapentin but I have heard mixed things about it, if you know of any medications or remedies that have worked please share! Right now all she is told me to do is to avoid my triggers but I cannot really avoid heat in the hot summer lol Over the counter stuff you can try!!!\n\nCannabis helps some people.  \n\nAntihistamines helps some people\n\nOutside of that you need cooling like air conditioning to really help.  Everyone has their own magic temperature where the fire stops but its usually less than 70 degrees.\n\nNO ICE!! Its really easy to injure yourself. Thank you! Do you recommend anything specific over the counter? I have tried six antihistamines and nothing worked. Never heard that about cannabis, that is pretty interesting. I have never iced and I do not think I ever will, a fan usually seems to cool me down just fine If none of them worked, then a different one wont really help unfortunately.\n\nFor some people, believe it or not, high strength aspirin can help with the burning.\n\nCannabis actually targets the specific nerve gateway responsible for the pain, so it helps 'mute the signal'\n\nEdit: if you are not used to cannabis, then a \"1to1 tincture\" works well.  You do not actually need to get stoned to get the medical benefit. All right thank you very much! Welcome to our really shitty club!  At least your fellow members will not think you are nuts if you describe your symptoms. One or more of us will be able to nod our heads and go \"Yeah! Mine does that too!\" \n\nas u/ughsamesam noted there are a LOT of things to try.  Unfortunately there is not one magic solution for everyone with THEM. So it is largely a matter of trial and error.\n\nMy pain management doctor already put me on gabapentin for back pain before I was diagnosed with THEM. I have not had any noticeable side effects from gabapentin but maybe others have.  It is worth a try in my opinion.\n\nMy doctor who prescribed my THEM added Mexiletine and I did get a lot of relief from that. If I miss a dose the pain is definitely worse.  Unfortunately mexiletine does not work for everyone with THEM.\n\nWith the THEM diagnosis in hand my pain management doctor suggested lidocaine patches. I can cut one patch in half and stick them to the soles of my feet. Takes a while to take effect but helps. \n\nShe also prescribed a skin cream with ketamine in it but it was really costly and I was too poor so did not fill the script.  Others have tried it and it helps some.  It has to be prepared at a compounding pharmacy which drives up the cost.\n\nOtherwise...  elevate your legs. Point a fan at your legs and feet. And sleep with your affected parts of your legs out from under the covers. Anything that traps body heat in your affected limbs may make THEM worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, it can get better in some.  For some of us THEM is a condition that is basically caused by some other medical problem. The very difficult problem is to try to identify and treat that other problem. Thanks for your answer!! I am glad to know I have options to try at least. My allergist had me on so many antihistamines and steroids that were not doing anything and it was absolute hell. I think I might give gabapentin a try now and see how that goes. I appreciate the info!!", "Does this look like THEM or something else? Thanks all  Hey all- This was months ago. I am being treated for psoriatic arthritis. I wanted to know if this looks anything like THEM? Should I get more tests done?\n\nMy Rhuem is giving me Otezla which is helping with the symptoms but it does not stop flare ups completely. That makes me think that it is indeed psoriatic arthritis. Can Psoriatic Arthritis cause secondary THEM? Thanks all for any input. Just trying to figure out this disease and learn more about what is wrong.\n\nThe whole thing started randomly at age 31. This is the worst it is been. I do have psoriasis so that makes me think it is psoriatic arthritis as well. But then I learned about THEM and it sounds so similar to my symptoms- heat, burning feeling in toes and hands.\n\nThanks for any input you guys have I have learned so much from this sub. Stay strong! Looks a lot like my feet during an them flare for what it is worth. Have you noticed triggers like heat inducing flares? You certainly have something vascular happening and it *might* be THEM.\n\nTHEM flares are often triggered by heat and relieved by cooling.  If soaking your foot in warm (bathwater warm temp) water triggers a flare and soaking in cool water (a bit below tap water temp, but NOT icy cold) relieves the pain then that would tend to align with THEM. Thanks for the reply! What do you mean vascular? I am not super familiar with the terminology. The Otezla definitely seems to help because it has not been this intense in a long time. Do you have any suggestions for testing?\n\nAnd yes cool water helps hot water has become a huge NONO. Thanks again for your time!! POTS/dysautonomia? Vascular means something related to the blood vessels.\n\nWhen you press on your toes that pressure is enough to push blood away from that tiny spot for a moment. When you release pressure blood rushes back in.  It is normal for this to happen.  But in your video what struck me about it was it was an easy way to really see how very red your skin is.\n\nYour psoriatic arthritis is a condition of inflammation.  It might be related to what you are seeing with your skin turning red and feeling hot.  Not sure. \n\nFor now at home you might find the redness and discomfort in your feet is helped by elevating your legs as much as possible.  Prop your feet up on some pillows when you sleep.  And point a fan at your feet to try to keep them cool.\n\nSince hot water makes things worse and cool water helps be sure to tell that to your doctor. Show him/her pictures of your feet when red like this.  You can ask him if this might be erythromelalgia. Let the doctor check things over and make a diagnosis. Thanks a lot for your explanation, I get it now! I will bring it up with my Rhuem when we meet soon. I am grateful my feet have not been like this in a while. I do not think I have this because I have no problems with standing or dizziness heat definitely makes it worse I do not have either but I have dysautonomia from small fiber neuropathy. Is your skin red when dangling? If you elevate your feet does it return to normal color Not always, but I will ask my doctor about that! Was just wondering what I means if the skin is red when dangling and then normal when elevated? Is that typical of Erythromelalgia? No that is pots", "is this raynauds AND erythomelalgia?  \n\nHi everyone\n\nSo to give abit of background, im 30 yr/female and since I was about 16 years old I started getting extremely cold hands and feet. Mind you, im living in the cold climate of Canada. My hands/feet would get so cold and turn greyish/bluish in color to the point my hands looked like they had no life in them. My mom took me to the doctor to get checked out and also got blood tests done and the doctors didnt know what was wrong. My cold hands/feet at this time was not painful though, just freezing cold to the touch. By the time I turned 19 it got extremly bad, I would get these little red dots sometimes on my fingertips only (while my hands/feet were still freezing cold) that made it impossible to grab things because they were SO painful. From my understanding, though I could be wrong, I think they were digital ulcers on my fingertips. They would go away after awhile and then not come around again for sometime, but its rare I get those and its for a very short amount of time. By the time I was 20yrs I moved to a much warmer climate in the USA (Coming from a cold Climate, Canada B.C) and my time living in America I had ZERO problems with my hands and feet, not once for 2 yrs. I however had to move back to Canada and after 3 years of being back I had the same issue with my hands/feet getting cold.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs of now, I would say the last 2 years, I get EXTREMLY hot hands/feet now. At times my hands/feet will still be freezing cold but alot of the times now I get extremely hot and very very very red and flared up hands/feet. On occasion it will be on my face too, burning red lips and flushed hot cheeks but its more so my hands/feet. As of the last 1yr I live in California and I get BOTH cold hands/feet and burning hands/feet. It feels like I have Raynauds AND developed Erythromelalgia.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***A couple things:***\n\n\\&gt; I get burn ups when exercising, touching cleaning products and simply just sitting there reading a book ill get a flare up. I get flare ups just laying in bed watching tv and not even moving.\n\n\\&gt; When I was 19yrs when I thought I only had Raynauds, a doctor I tried seeing \"thought\" I had raynauds but wasnt sure. He put me on something called \"Adalat\" (a calcium channel blocker) for it to try and I tried it and it made me extremly suicidal so I went off of it right away. Not sure why that medicine made me that way when I havent seen any reports of that side effect online.\n\n\\&gt; Yes I do try and keep warm when my hands/feet are frozen. I avoid touching frozen foods, wear gloves etc", "Still not sure what is going on with me I get a stabbing prickly sensation all over my body when exposed to heat. It feels deep and internal. It hurts and it feels like I am being stung all over; especially torso, arms, back, and legs. But it is everywhere. Is erythromelalgia a possibility. I have considered neuropathy but it only happens in the heat so my neurologist said that is not likely. Do you notice any visible changes to your skin when you feel the pain?  Do the affected areas get visibly red and swollen?  That is a hallmark of THEM.   \n\n\nNeuropathy refers to a wide variety of conditions under the same umbrella and erythromelalgia is a set of symptoms. Sometimes THEM occurs as a result of a type of neuropathy. They are not necessarily separate. For example, my diagnosis is \"small fiber neuropathy and related erythromelalgia.\"", "Hey just a little help plz My girlfriend has enthromelalgia and it hurts to see her like this what can I do to help her ? Thanks In advance It will take some trial and error but what I have found that works for me is:\n\nCold therapy socks.\nElevating my legs.\nKeeping as cool as I can. \nFans pointing at my feet.\nI do not wear socks or shoes unless I absolutely must. I wear flip flops mostly unless there is a good amount of snow. \nCompression socks. Though this might not be related to the erythomelgia. \nLidocaine cream helps with the pain.\nAloe can help with the heat. \n\nIf I think of anything else I will add it. If you have questions I will try and answer. If you live somewhere it is available/legal, medical marijuana is also helpful. Be patient with her limitations and pain. I got a foldable cane stool thing I take on shopping trips, or to concerts or anywhere I know I will have to do a lot of standing. Standing in place is the absolute worst!\n\nFinding a physician in your area who knows about THEM and can help you with trial and error of meds that help tamper down the pain. I had good luck with finding a rheumatologist who knows about it and now  after a while of trying different meds, I have found two that help with the severity of my THEM flares pain and help me sleep through the night. \n\nBut mainly...just stay kind and compassionate. Learn about THEM as much as you can and just be a kind and caring companion to her. The most painful thing is when loved ones do not even try to understand the illness or dismiss our symptoms as whining. Thank you so much means alot to me it is pretty mild tho just hands and face Thank you so much idk bout the standing thing because it is on her hands and face Lmao we are kids and I will get her some thanks Cooling weighted blankets work well for me! And if you can afford it, have air conditioning. Alrighty thanks so much Just an option. Using an indica is the only way I sleep/rest at all. Lol yeah it has pain relief sleeping and help with appetite They have cold therapy mitts she might want to try for her hands. And for the face I would see if spicy food triggers or makes it worse. The aloe might help cool her face or a good thick face cream. I use Olay night cream because my face gets a bit red and warm if it gets dry. Do not know if that will help her but worth a try. Indica do not do anything with my appetite, but ymmv. Lmao I get hungry", "Been trying to get into a doctor to help with managing symptoms. I keep getting turned away because they \u201cdo not know anything about it.\u201d 4 years later... still have not seen anyone, even when primary car refers me. Anyone have any suggestions? I am so sick of this.  I assume you have tried a rheumatologist? I got pushed around until I found the right rheumatologist (third one). She did not know all that much. I was one of her first patients with THEM. However, she was willing to look up the possible treatments in the \"Up to Date\" medical research database and start trying them with me. Four years later and several meds in, and I have finally found a pill and topical compound treatment that seem to help. \n\nI would say rheumatologists are normally more friendly than neurologists and dermatologists and are more likely to try out different drugs with you. You just have to find one that is willing to be \"your quarterback\" as my rheumatologist calls it. They can also order bloodwork to help you assess whether you have the primary or secondary form of THEM and this helps influence what treatments to try. \n\nHang in there! It is a rough, long haul of a process but once you find a compassionate provider, it makes a world of difference! FYI Up to Date is the actual name of the database my doctor used to learn about THEM and see what list of drugs to try and which order to try them in. You cannot try everything at once because then if something helps, you cannot pinpoint which med was the game changer. It took me forever to find one and from what I have heard from others with THEM, we are all different, and so respond differently to all the meds. My dermatologist was the one who actually knew about THEM the most. They do not usually seem to know about it, but if you have not tried one maybe it is worth a shot? Yeah my dermatologist is the one who diagnosed, but she said she could not treat the symptoms. I assume because she cannot prescribe certain things or did not have enough experience. Thanks, I appreciate the advice. I have been turned away by almost every type of specialist at this point. Pretty frustrating but I guess we just have to keep trying Thanks again! Oh I see! Yeah certain dermatologists will prescribe and some will not unfortunately. I am lucky to have one that can and will prescribe medications. I hope you can find the help you need! Thanks! Gosh, I am so sorry to hear that! It really sucks how rare THEM is and how few specialists are willing to help you after all the effort you have put in!\n\nWhat I will say as a follow-on is that it is absolutely okay to take a break from it for awhile, and maybe even necessary for your own mental health and sanity. Having multiple bad \"run-ins\" with medical providers can be very traumatic and drainjng. So in terms of trying to get into other specialists and appointments, just remain compassionate with yourself and give yourself some grace to take breaks when necessary. It is so draining emotionally and physically and sometimes we have to just step back and refill our tank for awhile until we feel we have the capacity to try again. Thank you very much. I think I would be completely lost without this community. Everyone has been so supportive. It is nice to have a few people who understand. \u2764\ufe0f Same! It is encouragement from those who truly \"get it\" that helps me press on in my darkest days. I am always up for a direct chat if you need it. Hang in there! Choose your own specialist.  Then tell your primary care doctor who you want to be referred to (assuming a referral is needed for your insurance) and why.\n\nTHEM is vanishingly rare.  A real zebra in the medical field. Most doctors will not be familiar with management protocols.  And the specialists who are come from a variety of fields.  The best choice may be a rheumatologist in one city and a dermatologist in another.\n\nThe website of ( website maintains a ( of providers who should be familiar with the condition. When I hit puberty I developed really bad erythromelalgia on my hands, so I went to my mom\u2019s rheumatologist and she said I maybe had Raynauds or something. It was until a few years later I came across erythromelalgia on the internet that I finally figured out that is what it was. Kind Of shocking she did not seem to know about it considering shes a rheumatologist but I guess its very rare Yeah that is pretty much the story, is not it. Unfortunately I have both THEM and Raynaud\u2019s, it is a terrible combination. Knowing about both, it seems crazy that they rheumatologist you say did not at least know that it was not Raynaud\u2019s. Ikr? I think it was just cuz the room I was in was cold tbh lmao Ha! That is funny Pain Management is terrible these days. My kid has THEM and has a wonderful pediatric Pain Management Doctor.  \n\nHowever, I have a severe rheumatic disease and the pain med I take to sleep through the night was made a scheduled drug. The Rheumatologist had prescribed it for 5 years and then when this happened they broke off pain management and made patients go somewhere else.  I went to 3 pain management clinics and after intake they said they could not help me because they do not prescribe meds and physical therapy will not help me (it actually makes it worse as I am currently waiting for 2 joint replacements).\n\nI finally found a place but I have to go every month and I am drug tested for everything every month. I worry what is going to happen when my kid is 18. She is on 900 mg of gabapentin (sp?) and it is only working about 40%.  \n\nThe Mayo Clinic has a special clinic but you have to stay out there for 7-10 days. I do not know how it works when you go back to another state.  They have a compound cream with ketamine in it.  \n\nI think you need a main doctor for the medical side and a Pain Management doctor for the pain.  They can send each other notes.  Just my opinion. Thanks for that information. It is helpful for sure. I am sorry your kid and yourself are going to through these things. It is hard enough on yourself, but I cannot imagine seeing your child going through that. I hope you Kirk find the relief you need somewhere. I have not looked into pain management because my \u201cpain\u201d is not traditional. It is not achy, it is just burning really.", "Neuro says I \"most likely\" have it, but will not do skin biopsy. Who to see next? So my neuro is more of a functional or nutritional doc, and convinced all various my neuropathic issues are coming from micro nutritional definciencies, mitochondrial issues, etc.\n\nAfter looking at the pics of my red, hot, tingling, burning hands/feet/ears and reminding him I also have Raynaud's and confirmed hEDS, he basically said that I \"very likely\" have THEM and small fiber neuropathy but refused to do skin biopsy to confirm. :(\n\nHe thinks if we can determine my nutritional and mitochondrial stuff (via expensive testing, of course), that my autonomic issues will resolve.\n\nNow I have read some fascinating stuff on all that, but I also just want a doc to simply test and confirm whether I have SFN or THEM, so I can maybe take supplements or Rx to make life less uncomfortable while we wait to suss out all the other functional medicine stuff, which I am willing to entertain but you know, on the meantime I am pretty miserable. Sigh.\n\nWhat kind of doctor would be willing to actually order the skin biopsy? Dermatology? Or see a new neurologist?  I am so tired of doctor visits lately. Hmmm, this seems fishy for a neurologist. That said, my THEM was diagnosed by both a rheumatologist and dermatologist without any skin biopsy. It was enough for them to listen to my symptoms and review my \u201cphoto gallery.\u201d I am seeing a neurologist soon for other issues I am having and I am going to talk to him about THEM too, but the dermatologist got me started on treatments without a biopsy. Search online for the Physician Directory on the web page for The Erythromelalgia Association.  That is a list of doctors who are familiar with THEM.  Search for one local to you. They should be able to diagnose and offer treatment options.  Ok awesome, thanks \ud83e\udd1e From what I have read biopsy is not required for diagnosis. Yes there are histological changes that can aid diagnosis, but it is not required. The guides I have seen state it is a clinical diagnosis after excluding causes for secondary THEM. Could always ask for genetic testing as they have ID\u2019d the gene.\n\nHave they done nerve and skin conduction type studies? Theve done nothing. Sigh. Neurologist refuses to test, rheumatology thinks it is just part of my Raynaud's. I do have a lot of cervical hypermobility and whiplash injuries, so I wonder if it is autonomic nerves or arteries getting kinked. Which doctor can I convince to do nerve and skin conduction studies? Nerve conduction is via Neurophysiology. They can run all sorts of tests. A paper I stumbled across states autonomic nerve testing and QSART were abnormal in most of the study participants. Found ( which confirms as well. Biopsy would confirm small fibre neuropathy, but the above study found most THEM also have SFN.", "Does this look like Erythromelalgia? Read below  Hi there! I just want to start off by saying I am not looking for medical advice, but more so confirmation that I am not crazy. I am going to see a rheumatologist in July. This photo does not do it justice, but when it is hot outside (especially summer), I am standing for too long, and specifically at night/while I am asleep, my hands and feet feel like they are on fire, sometimes like the walking on hot pavement feeling, some tingling sometimes but not always, my hands feel tight and get red and my veins will pop out, my feet veins will pop out too and my feet will turn red, but not like a whole tomato. When I am not having a flare up, my feet and hands are ALWAYS COLD. I can still feel things and honestly I do not mind it, but I want the pain to ease up. I have a flare up maybe once or twice a day, but I do my best to stay in a cool environment. More recently I will wake up with my cheeks red, hot and a swollen feeling, as well as my eyes. My eyeballs almost feel like bulging, really tight and under pressure? \n\nDoes this look like and sound like Erythromelalgia? I have a positive ANA and I have been tested for Lupus, RA, and thyroid issues and all are negative. It does to me but your rheumatologist will know better.\n\nIf it is, with a positive ANA there is likely some autoimmune nonsense at play and hopefully by treating that you will have relief from whatever it is that is going on.\n\nYou want to be careful with cooling as if you go too cold you can damage your skin. Use cool water, but not ice cold kind of thing. If you are flaring, you might not realize how cold the floor actually is for example and you can end up with chilblains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGood Luck! What you describe in your comment is more compelling than your photos. The description sounds like it *could* be THEM.  \n\nDo try to get better pictures of your hands, feet, cheeks, and eyes during a flare to take with you to your specialist medical appointment. Close up views, particularly with a white background, make it easier to see the color contrast.\n\nAlso take pictures of your feet and hands when they feel cold, particularly if any of your feet or hands appears pale white. That *might* be Raynaud's phenomenon,", "My feet during an THEM flare up ", "Aspirin If aspirin helps with symptoms what does this mean? Also if it was helping would you expect 100% of symptoms to go or just an improvement? I really cannot comment on this, as aspirin did not help me at all, so I really never looked into it further. This does seem like a good question for a doctor. Have you had complete blood panels done and testing for things like antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and polycythemia vera? These are both blood conditions that may or may not be linked to THEM. \n\nBut do not go down that rabbit hole of worry until you talk to a doctor about what this means. It could just mean that the aspirin has a pain relieving effect to reduce the severity of pain you have when you flare with THEM and has nothing to do with the makeup of your blood. \n\nSo anything anyone responds with on here...always take it with a grain of salt because they will not have the blood labs and medical history your doctor has to help you interpret this trial of aspirin. Hi! I take aspiring for THEM everyday and it really helps me. When I did a quick google search it kind of scared me to see that sometimes aspirin respondent THEM can mean you have a deeper problem, but I just did a bunch of blood work with my doctor that all came back normal, so do not worry too much but def get it checked out! I recommend going to a dermatologist or rheumatologist if you are not already. Oh, also, it keeps me from having flares at all ever like 98% of the time, and when I do have them now they go away in ten minutes!!! A lot of the research has shown that treatment methods are very individualized for some reason.  For some people, asprin helps.  For some, antihistamines. For some, anticonvulsants and anti seizure meds. For some, nothing seems to help.  \n\n\nBasically, if you find a medicine that works, thank whatever pantheon you are into. How much aspirin do you take everyday, if you do not mind me asking? \ud83d\ude42 NSAID's kicked my THEM's butt when I was allowed to take them. \n\nI am suspected of having lupus-affiliated THEM, so, well, that is probably why, haha. I take two 325mg pills (or 4 81mg)One in the morning and one at night! Thank you! \ud83d\ude0a", "Does anyone else have flares all over their body? There is not a spot on my body that my THEM has not been on, i have not seen a neurologist yet (diagnosed in march 2020) I have only just stopped having freezing showers every night (thanks to the cold weather) but I was wondering if anyone has the same widespread flares ?", "I can control my THEM through diet I know everyone is different but if any of you are struggling, try to cut out certain foods and see if you feel any better. My #1 trigger is wheat. There are many others but simply cut out wheat and see if you feel any better, its a first step in diet and then keep learning from there. That Is how i began to tolerate my THEM Congratulations on finding something that helps!  Did it help with the burning sensation? For me it did yes That is brilliant... Well done", "A possibility of minoxidil inducing/worsening Erythromelalgia flares? Hey guys,\n\nI started struggling with burning, swollen red hands and feet 8 months ago. It started with an index finger on my right hand and eventually spread to my left hand and later to my feet. Nobody in the family nor any relatives I know of have this condition. I am working with doctors to try eliminate any possible causes while also doing some detective work myself to see what proceeded these symptoms. I realized I started using Minoxidil due to hair shedding (Telogen Effivium) around the time my symptoms started becoming noticeable and uncomfortable. Was wondering if anybody here uses Minoxidil and if so, does it affect your flare ups? minoxidil works by improving blood flow to the areas it is on. Thus, it is very very likely that it is directly due to that. Sorry, just to clarify, you mean it is likely that minoxidil might be the cause of flare ups? Thanks for your comment! yes (:", "Does anyone else get anxiety when they DO NOT have a flare up? My last flare up of the day is always when I take a shower at night, and tonight I did not have a flare up. Totally normal. The first time in... 14 years? 15? Gave me a damn panic attack lol", "I take aspirin daily to help with flare ups. Lately have been getting more and more, it seems the aspirin is not working anymore. Does anyone have any suggestions? I get flare ups on my feet, legs, hands, face &amp; ears. ", "Finally - I left a doctor's office feeling like I was in good hands. (And with diagnoses!) The TL;DR is: I saw an amazing dermatologist today who confirmed the THEM diagnosis, as well as neurovascular rosacea (the flares in my face). Ordered labs, trying a new med. He is also completely open to figuring out what is up with tons of painful subcutaneous nodules of the chest wall &amp; abdomen that have been getting worse over the past few years. \n\nLonger story is: My rheumatologist did not really know what to do with me, but he thought I probably had THEM. (I have kind of figured this for a few years.) He referred me to dermatology and I picked a doctor with some interesting outside-the-box articles about derm issues in infectious and autoimmune disease. I was hopeful he might be someone interested in zebras/puzzles/complicated patients.\n\nMy other conditions = Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, autoimmune polyendocrine failure (thyroid, adrenal, ovarian), idiopathic gastroparesis, etc etc.\n\nHe was completely interested in all my photos, asked all the right questions about symptoms, triggers, possible overlap with Raynaud's, noted some possible signs of dermatomyositis and ordered labs to look for the other scary things that can cause THEM. He said most people who come to derm as possible THEM are not, but that I could be in the textbooks. I also had a weird flare right there in the office that looked no other flare I have ever had and he took photos for my chart. He ordered nifedipine to try out, but said it is definitely going to be trial and error with treatment. He was not threatened at all by how much I knew about it and asked *me* if I had any wishlist labs I wanted him to order or if I thought he had the bases covered. (I could have hugged him right there or burst into tears - it just felt so huge, having someone approach things collaboratively and be interested in ruling out everything we can rule out.)\n\nBased on my photos, he thinks the facial flares are neurovascular rosacea (he pointed out how my eyes and mouth are spared, and telangiectasia on my chin) and wants to try laser treatment for that. He is even trying to lobby my insurance to get them to cover it because most insurance considers it cosmetic, even though it causes burning and pain.\n\nThen he was totally willing to tackle the weirdo subcutaneous rib/abdominal nodules (ideas in play have been Dercum's/adiposis dolarosa, or some other disorder of subq tissue) that my other doctors have all played not-my-problem with. They all feel them, see that my left ribcage is way bigger than the right, say \"That is SO WEIRD!\" - but then pass it off to the next person. I had an MRI yesterday that had a (frustratingly, shockingly) normal report, but he said my PCP needs to send them a history, more specific instructions, and ask them to look at it again. (I was wondering if that was the case. She just wrote \"neoplasm - other, not specified\" rather than like... \"multiple palpable subcutaneous nodules of 0.5-1 cm\" etc.) He said he will review it once radiology gives it another look. Yay.\n\nI see him again in 4 weeks. Some of my labs are already back and are normal (CBC, LD). I know THEM symptoms can show up years before a blood disorder/malignancy, so I am wondering if we will be checking things here and there? He also suggested a thorough workup from my GYN for possible malignancies. \n\nI am just really thankful to have someone who *listens*. And who did not see my long, messed up, chronic illness-having chart and decide I am a sad, malingering lady who Googles too much. (I am always trying to let them know - I am sporty! I hike and camp! I am totally Type A! I just happen to have an annoying, traitorous body!) I did not know how long it is been since I felt like a doctor validated what I have been experiencing and understood that I want to know the *why* behind it, if possible. \n\nFeeling hopeful, even though I just got a diagnosis for which there really is no cure or consistently good treatment. (Hah.) So thankful to add this man to my team. Just had to share with people who probably get it. Thanks for reading. Wow, I am so genuinely happy for you, OP. It makes a world of difference for your mental and emotional health to find a doctor who works with you collaboratively and does not dismiss or diminish symptom reporting and lab requests. I luckily found that in a Rheumatologist and I am terrified of her ever leaving the area because doctors like her and your derm only come around after years of heartache and white coat syndrome and medical appointment trauma with specialists who cannot wait to get you out of their exam room. \n\nI wish we could all have doctors like these in our corners for our entire lives. I have multiple chronic conditions, too, and just doing everything we must do for self-care and pain management is a full-time job, so we need doctors and a care team who support us. \n\n I know in some of the THEM facebook groups and a group called the THEM warriors, they like to have people share the names of their game changing/compassionate doctors so that people who need a caring physician can try to find one in their area. If you have not already, you might consider sharing the name of your doctor with the mods of those groups so they can add it to their lists. So happy for you I was thinking of telling my psoriatic arthritis group about him (well, putting him on the \"good doctor\" list) - I should probably join an THEM group and recommend him though. Those groups are really the only reason I ever log in to Facebook. The Addison's/Adrenal Disease group pretty much saved my life, and I would not have found my amazing endocrinologist without them. Funny, both of these specialists are in the same network and part of a large center/hospital system that is about an hour and a half away from me, but I keep choosing doctors from there because they have all been so much better than what I have found in my city. It is a long drive round trip, but totally worth it.\n\nI also just switched rheumatologists (to that system/group as well) and that was terrifying. My old rheumatologist was not stellar, but he was the first person to recognize I had EDS and I was so scared to walk away from him. It is crazy that we have to rely so much on the person, rather than the specialty. One of my friends texted me, \"Yay, someone who actually listened to you! Low bar, but - yay!\"  Yep. But, yay. ;) Did you have a final diagnosis for the nodules. I have some sort of similar really small subcutaneous bumps all over my ribcage and abdomen that my doctors dismissed as inflammation. They are completely invisible, but I can feel them. It is more like uneven fat, and painful if I press them a lot. I do not know what are those and fearing the worst all the time! That is what mine are like, except they are everywhere in my torso/trunk: my ribs, my sides, over my stomach. They are (mostly) not visible but they are palpable. And painful. The exception is my left lower ribcage - its visibly bigger and protruding when compared to the right side. And it is from the Whatever They Ares. \n\nSo far, no one knows what they are. My PCP refused to ask for a second read, but I see the dermatologist on Friday, so I am going to see what he can do/what he recommends. I actually got a copy of the MRI and used a reader program online to look at the images for hours. All I figured out is that I am definitely NOT a radiologist. If worse comes to worst, I am considering sending the MRI to a radiology consulting group that you can hire for second opinions. It is worth the cost to me, because at this point, the left side blobs (?!) are getting in the way and hurt a lot. I am kind of at the point where I want to say, just take some out and see what they are already!!\n\nI am going to ask the dermatologist if he will consider running the myositis antibody panel, since I have THEM and now, Cryoglobulinemia. I am wondering if the nodules are calcifications? (Maybe those are less squishy.) I will update you after I see the derm on Friday and get his opinion. Thanks for your answer in detail. Please do update me and I may DM you! Any update? The dermatologist is going to ask radiology to take another look, since my primary care doctor would not ask. He also said I need to get a new primary care doctor, because that is kind of unreasonable of her. \n\nHe thinks it is not a form of myositis, so did not want to run an antibody panel - but he was open to running serum compliments after I gave him a study showing that they can help monitor potential malignancies in cryoglobulinemia. I am hoping he is going to call tomorrow because my CBC is bad and I would rather he calls me before I freak out and message him to ask for a referral to hematology. (Obviously I am not a doctor - but it looks like I have polycythemia vera. Need an EPO level and bone marrow biopsy, which I would rather avoid if possible. Yeesh.)\n\nFun stuff. I will keep you posted!\n\nEdit: (a verb tense)", "Secondary THEM.  Wow.

Welcome and hugs \u2764\ufe0f Keeping a food/activity/etc symptom journal might help you identify certain triggers to avoid (when possible) in the future. For example, I have learned over time that gluten (well all grains, actually) is a big trigger for me, despite not having celiac disease. Most popular triggers often overlap with mast cell disorders: heat, anxiety/stress (literally just any stressor in daily life), exercise, and evenings. This is going to be super chaotic.

Do not over chill your body. NO ICE WATER. UNDERLINE THAT, put it on the fridge, whatever you need to do. ABSOLUTELY NO ICE WATER. For showers I slowly go down in temperature adjusting and then going down. It is that shock feeling we are avoiding. Also again, no ice water. Easiest way to loose a body part. Eight sleep and bedjet are great but expensive. If you can get the money for them I highly recommend them. If you are still having sleep problems think about sleep meds like trazodone. Start looking for clothing that works around your THEM. Also do not be afraid to push for a mobility aid. It took me awhile to convince my doctor that going out to the mailbox once a week was not enough activity for me (Sometimes the doctors are nicer if they have a teaching student with them). That is all I really have. Medicine is different for each person.", "Does this look like anyone else\u2019s them  So the pics are in order of how this flare started\u2026. One spot of my cheek and on chest to then ears started\u2026 where you can literally see the redness spill out/radiate from my ears which then  turnt both my whole cheeks like it\u2026. It is not lupus (that has been ruled out and it is not rosacea as my hands and feet get affected the exact same) I will say it is much more painful then it looks and the scribbles make it look less severe as they are covering mostly my normal skin How would you describe the pain?\n\nAnything you have noticed that bring on this redness? Like liquid heat filling up, I can feel it in the parts that it is\u2026 so like without looking I can tell the exact pattern if that makes sense, it is more then just heat\u2026 the ares go puffy they throb/pulsate and nothing brings it down what so ever. I get it a lot in the evening\u2026 always will it is much more common and then it just comes on so randomly in the day\u2026 more then normal, I have tired drinking loads, not drinking, not eating that day and nothing I do stops it coming on\u2026 my hands can start doing it and then my face will or other way round or other parts What you are experiencing *may* be THEM. \n\nThe next time a flare starts I suggest running cool tap water (NEVER ice cold) over the affected area to see if the pain quickly fades away.  That would be typical with THEM.  Unfortunately the flare usually comes back once the skin warms back up.\n\nIf you can, swimming may let you shed enough body heat that the affected blood vessels constrict, easing a flare.\n\nTHEM involves the blood vessels improperly dilating and their swelling with blood. That makes the skin turn red. The natural resting process as we sleep results in the blood vessels dilating a bit too.  Thus THEM patients are often prone to flares during the night as we try to sleep. Omg it is exactly that!! I will wash my face (if it is in the Evening near my pm routine then I will wash my face it will help but alway heat back up, and yes I wake up every morning knowing I have had one as I will wake up so red blotchy sweat and puffy and just so so so hot My THEM affects my face and when it flares up it looks exactly like this. For a while I thought it was rosacea but my doctor said that since I was also affected elsewhere in my body (hands, feet, knees) and I was feeling a considerable amount of intense pain that it was THEM. I have seen 3 dermatologists as well who confirm my diagnosis. \n\nYour best bet is to go see a doctor, either a rheumatologist or dermatologist or both. Tell them your concerns and what your pain level is/if it affects other parts of your body. Then go from there. Following on from this, swimming has been the ONLY exercise my THEM tolerates. I swim very slowly and the cool water helps the pain I experience. Have my 2nd appointment next week where he will speak with me on them (rheumatologist) as I emailed him I think I found what it is\u2026 are you on any treatment or found anything to help\u2026 so sorry your having to go though this too I would ask about small fiber Neuropathy and mast cell activation syndrome along with THEM. I have all three and mine looks like this. Thankyou for this!! You always have to go in with the answers for the Doctors\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f what is the test for these like ? For SFN they can do a tiny skin biopsy, often they will diagnose just based on symptoms if the symptoms are obvious enough. THEM is considered peripheral neuropathy from what my neurologist explained to me. If the rheum is not familiar, I would look for a neuromuscular neurologist. \n\nI had a rough time getting diagnosed for about two years bouncing from multiple derms to rheumatologists and all over the place leaving each doctor scratching their head until I saw neurology and they knew right away what was going on. \n\nFor MCAS there is blood sample and urine testing, that requires a specialist too but your PCP can order the tests if you tell them which ones and explain the issues. I know it is super frustrating to have this stuff going on and no answers! Feel free to ask me any questions, I am happy to help as much as I can. \n\nThere is also a FB group for THEM that is pretty helpful too if you are ever on there. I defenitly will be Thankyou!! Same I think my rheumatologist was very stuck he had no answers for me and just told me I will grow out of it\u2026 that was 2 months ago and it is just getting worse and worse\u2026 Atleast I have lots of information to give so Thankyou for that!! This blood testing? Is it diffnet to a normal blood test (I have had 2 lots and both took around 6/7 syringes of different colours) these both came back fine\u2026 Is there a chance I did not get the correct one/tested for that Yep that sounds similar to what I went through, most doctors are very narrow in their field and they have no clue about things just outside of their expertise. It is very frustrating to be suffering with no answers. I would definitely try to find a neurologist in your area. One thing that helped me the most was something called Alpha Lipoic Acid, it is an over the counter supplement that my doctor suggested to me for neuropathy and it costs about $12- it literally changed my life and brought my flares way way down. It has no bad side effects and you can find lots of research backed papers on ALA and neuropathy that show major improvements for people suffering with this. It might be worth a try while you are looking for a neuro or trying to get this figured out. My skin flushing and pain got so bad at one point I could not sleep, function, anything it was horrible and it is about 70% better now. I wish I had known what was going on sooner! \n\nThe lab work for MCAS is super specialized so I would think they did not test for it, they can also do urine testing for it. \n\nI hope you feel much better soon! 70% that is great!! Yes mines getting so much worse I had to quit work a few days ago\u2026 I am going to ask my rheumatologist to refer me if he has no help to offer, will bring those tests up to him Thankyou!! And hopefully this supplement helps!! I am glad you have found a solution\u2026 wish you all the best!! Thankyou once again:) Sending all the good vibes to you! It can and will get better! Thankyou so much!!! Same to you and more ;) It looks like mine - ears too, although I had mine on hands and feet for years before it hit my face. Do you find exercise or heat can trigger it? I started off getting raynards in my hands and feet and now it can go between this them burning and raynards, heat and excersise (dot know if I can even call it that, even walking to the end of my road makes this happen (it is flat and short too\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2c) but deffo makes me red, throb, burn, and sweat, and I am just very intolerant to heat\u2026 or maybe it is just the them causing me to believe I am hot (but it is not rosacea as my hands feet and ears do it along with a patchy chest) would you say yoirs sounds the same? It sounds like I am very overweight and unfit but I actually am not and I think it could be POTS making it worse That is good that you are seeing someone, that is the first step! I have tried loads of treatments as unfortunately different things can work for different people. What I am on now that is making it more stable (not gone completely but manageable) is clonidine and fluoxetine. Good luck. Thabkyou!! I am actually asking my doctor today (a different one just a gp) to change my anxiety medication to clonidine anyway!! So that is great 2 in 1!!", "Anyone's started or affects on the face? I have been struggling with horrible flushing on my face (malar distribution plus chin) that burns so badly that it hurts my eyes from the heat. Every autoimmune test is normal but I do already have an autoimmune vasculitis as well as POTS. Dermatologist thinks it might be THEM. My hands(palms mostly) and feet started flushing at the same time but they are not painful like the face. We biopsied the face and confirmed its not lupus or DM. Findings are mildly consistent with rosacea but the flushing never really leaves (does get much worse around 7pm but I do not have trouble sleeping) so there is not an obvious trigger. The hands and feet get red only when really warm like after the shower, the face gets redder then too but it also worsens without heat. \n\nI am already on high doses of gabapentin for my migraines. \n\nJust curious if any of you have it on your face, or if any of you started with flushing of the hands/ feet that was not painful. Thanks!", "About 4 months ago, I am having problems with the swelling in my hands. Especially in warm water. How do you deal with pain and tricks to help? Anyone experienced after a shower, swelling in feet bad, you need to sit and feel dizzy? This is everyday, I hope my neurologist doc can help find a sol.  I am sorry you are suffering. This group is really helpful! This is going to sound weird but I love the feel of cool stones. We have some marble tiles in our bathroom and it really helps. I try not to do too much cold water because I think I have rebound flares. Aspercreme works for some people, but it does not help me that much. I like menthol better for cooling and swelling. Also it helps if I raise my hands above my head to reduce the blood &amp; inflammation. Just for 20-30 seconds here and there. I noticed I have flares after drinking warm tea or coffee (if I hold the mug). Or after I do chores around the house. I find I have to stop every so often so the inflammation can decrease a little. Thanks! Im glad to have people who understand what I am going through. I feel like my feet cannot take the burning and painful swells at times. Im not sure if the condition will get worse over time. There are at times I cant walk because all the heat when I get up from sitting goes straight to my feet. Now I am going through treatment options, waiting for them to call me. When my flares get bad I go out on our concrete in the backyard. I have put my feet in cold water but my swelling does not go down and my blotches are worse but they do not itch so that is good. My feet do not ever go back to normal they stay a little bit swollen even in the cold. I do get a weird white blotches on my leg in the cold. I noticed hot soup, hot chocolate, chicken wings, basically anything hot or warm foods give me really bad flares. I have popsicles to eat after having soup to cool me down. Yes, getting stuff done around the house can be challenging especially laundry day. The heat from the clothes in the dryer flares up my hands, and eventually my feet start to swell. I went for a walk for about 2 and a half hours. And my legs would not stop shaking uncontrollably for an hour. Not sure if it has to do with erythromelalgia. I do have muscle spasms so that is probably the cause.", "Diagnosis of them  \nHi, I think I have had them since I was 16 now 23 and I am struggling to get a dr to take it seriously,\n \nCan anyone with this let me know if this looks like it. I have \u2018flare ups\u2019 after showers, if I have been stood up for a period of time or just at work?\n My feet knees and hands go bright red burning hot and swell I am sorry, but yes, this very much look and sounds like erythromelalgia. \ud83e\udd7a I am sorry doctors are refusing to take you seriously. A good place to start is getting a referral to see a Rheumatologist in your area. If you join the erythromelalgia warriors page on Facebook, I believe there is a log of providers in different areas that have diagnosed THEM, including other specialties that might be familiar with it like dermatologists and neurologists. \n\nPersonally, I have seen ALL of the above and several of each kind. I have found Rheumatologists to generally be the most knowledgeable and kind. They tend to spend more time with you and are even willing to help you treat the THEM if your bloodwork comes back normal for all the various autoimmune diseases they might test you for. \n\nThe most important thing is that you keep at it and not let doctors' poor bedside manner or limited knowledge of THEM deter you from eventually finding someone to provide a diagnosis.\n\nTake lots of pics and save them on their own folder on your phone. Keep a detailed list of triggers and what brings on flares, how long they last, what helps with the pain, etc. I have Raynauds, too, so I never have an THEM flare in presence of my Rheumatologist. She was able to diagnose me, though, from me describing the symptoms and triggers and then me showing her all the pics on my phone. \n\nBest wishes to you! Knowledge is power! I have been living with THEM since sept 2016. It helps to get the diagnosis and to plug in to as many support groups as possible. If you ever want to chat, feel free to DM me. The things that cause your flares are certainly things that flare THEM, but no one here can offer a diagnosis, obviously. I do not know where you are in the world and what kind of doctors you have already tried seeing, but I would recommend finding a neurologist. Neurologists are typically the ones who are familiar with THEM. Good luck. This looks almost identical to mine. I have been diagnosed since 2017, and still only am able to get help from my primary care doctor. You really have to be your own advocate. None of these doctors are going to do anything for you. It is really difficult. Honestly, it is all trial and error and you have to find what works for you. I have had to adjust my lifestyle dramatically. For example, avoid syncing in one place for long period of time. Use \u201ccooling,\u201d or moisture wicking pants. Do not shower too late in the day, otherwise your body temp will not have enough time to cool down before bed time. I stopped driving alcohol except special occasions, as it really increases flare ups. I m sorry you are struggling too\u2026 this forum has been a lifesaver and where I get most of my information. Thank you for your tips! Any cooling suggestions? I am in the U.K. going to try to ask my new dr for some sort of referral Fans!  I sleep with a fan pointed straight at me. Another fan is on my desk. In the car I turn on a/c and direct the air flow to my feet. And a cool final rinse in the shower can help a bit. Sure looks like THEM. Sorry. Membership in the THEM club kind of sucks. And the parties are not so great since drinking tends to bring on flares. \ud83e\udd2a\n\nBe persistent. I am not sure where in the UK you are. Another recent poster in this subreddit is from the UK and managed to get diagnosed somewhat quickly.  She might could provide her general location and doctor's name by DM. Calling u/Emily2398 .  She is from the UK and very recently diagnosed.  Maybe she can give some input.  Of course she may not be near you, but maybe can offer a little advice. Fans yes, I also bought these freeze sleeves on Amazon that you can slide right over your kneecap. You just have to be careful to not put it on when too cold. Frostbite is a manhole concern for people with THEM, because they e do not always recognize the true temperature of something. Hi, my diagnosis journey started out with lots of testing different doctors for a year and two months and recently diagnosed with THEM. I saw rhemotology, vascular twice, neurology, cardiology, circulation and autoimmune testing all normal. Your pictures are very similar to mine the knee flares, blotches and feet swelling. I would definitely first go to Dermatologist I went on google: doctor directory for erythromelalgia, click on the first website and put in your zip code. And a list of doctors show up specializing in THEM. As of today, I saw a dermatologist and now I am starting aspirin and so on if that does not work. I could not believe that I finally found a doctor who listened and he does specializes in THEM. I do have to say fir me when cooling outside with shorts on and go back into the house, I flare up more bc the house is warmer and all the heat goes straight to my feet and knees. Does not help when standing for too long. Showering brings out it is worse for sure lots of blochtes and swelling. With knee flare ups and blochty make it hard to wear any kind of pants. Good luck, hope you can find a doctor here soon. The freeze sleeves seem interesting I also have raynaurds so I have to sleep with socks on when it is too cold as my toes are prone to it which as you can imagine is fun balance \ud83d\ude05 I also have Raynaud\u2019s\u2026 but that is quite common with people who have THEM. My feet are always burning, but my hands get bad in the winter month. Definitely check out those freeze sleeves. There are loads of different brands on Amazon.", "*Cries in Erythromelagia* ", "how to bring THEM up to doctors? I am pretty sure that what I am experiencing is THEM - it is the only thing the symptoms really fit, I have done a lot of research and the pictures of other people\u2019s THEM look just like what is happening to me. \n\nI have been seeing my doctors about this and my joint issues, though they are more interested in the heat and burning pains because my joints are not too painful right now. The interest does not extend to diagnosis though, just treatments. While I understand this approach, it is very frustrating to not have a definite answer, so I have spent a lot of time doing my own research and talking to people with different conditions to figure it out. It is seems most likely to be a combination of RA and THEM.\n\nI do not know how to bring this up with my doctors. I typically have issues with getting doctors to take me seriously for a variety of reasons (none of them good ones), and I know they do not tend to like it if you bring a condition to them and say you think you have it. Usually my method is to describe the symptoms in detail, emphasise the ones I know are most relevant to the condition I know I have, and hope they pick it up and decide to do tests. Unfortunately, that is not working here and I do not know if it is because they have never heard of THEM or just do not care what it is - they have not referred me to rheumatology either for the joints. \n\nAny advice on approaching doctors with a possible diagnosis without them immediately dismissing you? Yeah I am on the same boat here. I think what I am going to do is explain my intentions. I am going to tell them that I want to treat the cause. Then tell them how it affects my quality of life and how long I have had it. I am going to avoid trying to bring other doctors into this conversation, because of confirmation bias. I am going to have a physical paper copy of what THEM is from a reputable medical website to show them, but that might backfire because I am \u201cgoogling my symptoms.\u201d But even with all that the doctor still might not listen and be dismissive but there is nothing much you can do besides find another doctor that will listen, which I am starting to learn now. It is annoying because you have to explain your story again. It is honestly trail and error and it sucks that It has to be this way. \n\nOr what you could do is lie say that another doctor diagnosed you and tell them to add into your records lol. Since doctors like to have a confirmation bias. I had a friend suggest that I say an acquaintance in the medical profession suggested it looked and sounded like THEM, and I should ask about it. Feels like a video game challenge - got to press the right buttons in the right order for them to investigate. \nWishing luck for the both of us in getting a proper investigation I had the same concern when bringing it up to my primary care doctor months ago. What I did was described the problem without mentioning the \"E\" word and then showed her pictures from when it was happening. The pictures helped a lot.  Thank God she knew exactly what it was and ran CBC and arthritis blood work for me but nothing showed up. She basically told me to take cooler showers and avoid my triggers, and prescribed me gabapentin which I never ended up taking because I had read about bad side effects. Funny story though is that it ended up mostly going away (sometimes still have very slight issues in one hand) after about 5 to 6 months. I realized I did not really give you much advice based on your situation - based on your insurance, do you know if you really need a referral to see a rheumatologist? I feel like they would be more thorough and would run some tests. I did not need a referral with my insurance and visited one myself just due to some muscular issues I was/still am having Haha that is a great one!! And it really is, One mistake you got to start from square one \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nGOOD LUCK TO YOU AS WELL!!! I am from the UK so I do not have insurance, it is the National Health Service - the way to get to rheumatology is through a referral by a GP.\nThere is a rheumatologist in my city who also specialises in THEM but I have to convince a doctor to send me there first. I took multiple photos of my feet during flare-ups. Then when I saw my doctor I told him all my symptoms, showed him the photos, and then mention that a friend saw my feet and said it looked just like what her sister has. I had a doctor who was listed on the THEM site that was in my network and asked for a referral. He looked it up in his online journal because he was not familiar with it. He agreed it seemed like THEM and gave me a referral. I do not mess around waiting for doctors to figure things out if I have any idea of what something might be.", "Pain without flares? Hi all, I was diagnosed with THEM about 5 months ago and have since done a bunch of testing to see if I have any other conditions (nothing has come up). \n\nI have noticed that I get pain in my joints even when I am not flaring.\nFor instance, it rained where I live yesterday and I was up all night dealing with so much pain in my feet, ankles, and one of my knees, and one of my elbows, but I was not actively red or flaring. \n\nIs this common? &amp;#x200B;\n\nThough THEM pain can be in the area of the joints, particularly knees and ankles/toes, it is not usually limited to joints.\n\nHmmm.   Could be arthritis? Arthritis can be auto-immune, as can be THEM.

My THEM is episodic and usually triggered by wine or drinking and I thought maybe pregnancy would be different for me as my THEM is only in short episodes and maybe I would get lucky but I am starting to panic now.

I am not a mother and do not plan to have kids of my own, but I wanted to stop in and just say I see you. I feel for you. And I am so sorry you are going through the trauma of constant, increasing flares while pregnant. I hope someone on here can provide good advice. Are you seeing any doctors for your THEM? If not, you might reach out to your primary care doc and see if they could help you get a telehealth appointment with an THEM doctor. They would have to ask around for you in the specialist network to find someone familiar with THEM who could help you make this tough decision. And also, I wanted to say that your pain and your quality of life matters. If you decide to terminate the pregnancy, I hope you will not be hard on yourself. As my Rheumatologist just told me while examining my flaring feet and knees in my THEM check up appointment last week, \"This disease is so cruel.\" Thank you for this!

What were your first THEM symptoms, how often did they occur, and how long did they last?  My 15-y-o daughter has odd symptoms and we are finally seeing an allergist/immunologist specialist next week.  We suspect MCAS but she is also had intermittent burning and redness in her feet and fingers as well as raynauds-type symptoms.  (She has a history of Lyme and PANDAS starting at age 9). My first issues were flushing cheeks, burning and heat there that was beyond description. Then it moved to my ears and feet and added tingling needle type pain. The flares would last days, hours, it just depended on what caused it. Extremely photosensitive and the sun and heat are my worst enemy. I also developed Raynauds. \n\nEventually I saw a neuromuscular neurologist who explained to me that THEM is peripheral neuropathy and he diagnosed me with small fiber neuropathy and told me I also needed to see a Dysautonomia specialist because he felt I had that and possible MCAS. It took over a year to get into the only specialist in my area for that, he diagnosed me with Dysautonomia, and MCAS. I am currently testing out meds for the MCAS, but I can tell you in the mean time I started alpha Lipoic acid as recommended by the neuro and it saved my life. I was at my breaking point with pain and I started the supplement and within a few days I felt some relief, I have now been on it for 6 months and it is gotten better and better to the point where I am able to have some quality of life. I would say it is about 60% better. The neuro told me that treating the nerves and helping them repair would be my best course of action so that is what I tried. I hope them helps some! Feel free to message me if you want to pick my brain further. Thank you so much! We have also waited a year to see this specialist who is familiar with MCAS.  I am glad that you are starting to feel better! That sounds like secondary THEM, mine is primary so I have had mine since I was born due to genetics, but yeah, first signs are redness and swelling, the triggers depends on the person, for me it is heat, movement, and if I have my feet off of the ground, it will swell. But some people, theirs get triggered by blankets, touch, and more I am at my breaking point with the pain in my feet. I have Sjogrens, neuropathy, fibromyalgia, now THEM. I am to the point where I am looking to move somewhere on the opposite side of the world for summers, which are their winters. I have to wear support shoes inside of the house, and every morning I am afraid of the pain once my feet hit the floor. I sleep with ice packs in socks that I found on Amazon and have been getting medical foot massages that help somewhat. I will try the supplement you mentioned as I am desperate and hope it works I am so sorry you are going through this as well. I understand, I have told my husband many times I feel we need to move when we can, I live in FL and the heat here is brutal and is one of the biggest triggers for me. I really hope the ALA helps, some people say it takes a month or two to feel the effects but my neuro said I felt them faster because my nerves were soooooo damaged and I hope it works quickly for you too.

Two weeks later I had my first flair.

If they do find out what your child has PLEASE let me know. I had Lyme and now have Erythromelalgia. They tried to diagnose me with raynauds but it was not caused by the cold. It happens when I stand for too long. However my tilt table for pots showed nothing. I Thank you!  I will let you know! Saw the specialist today - she feels pretty certain it is MCAS.  My daughter did some bloodwork and will start on the H1 and H2 blockers (Xyzal and Pepcid) plus Flovent.  She also believes she has dysautonomia, which would cause erythromelalgia as well as her raynaud\u2019s-like symptoms.  My daughter also used to have POTS symptoms but not so much anymore.  She also recommended that she be tested for connective tissue disorder with a geneticist (since there is a noted triad that has been recognized of EDS, POTS, and MCAS).  I would not really suspect a connective tissue disorder and my daughter but it is really interesting because my son has symptoms of that (like hyperflexibility and pectus excavatum) and it is genetic so I find it really interesting.

But could just as well not be.\n\nIt is normal for blood vessels in the extremities to dilate in a warm shower.  THEM usually most effects the feet, but can effect the knees, hands, cheeks, ears, etc...  But the redness in these areas usually persists well after such exposure to heat in an THEM patient.", "Easiest Loans To Get Approved For | $100-$1000 Personal Loan\u200e ", "Has anyone been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease with THEM? So my photos literally look exactly like nearly every photo in this sub. I have bad redness/heat on my hands, feet, face and more recently my forearms and sometimes upper chest/neck. I always joke that I have had hot flashes ever since I started puberty and my entire family will tell you I am constantly complaining it is too hot. But I have also had a swarm of symptoms over the years and tried so hard countless times to be taken seriously by doctors and often times nobody would even care to run a blood test. I even had a dermatologist ask what my heritage was once and when I said I was Irish he said that is it! You are Irish. It is typical and do not take hot showers and that was my diagnosis/treatment. \n\nI tried and gave up countless times and I have also suffered from car sickness and dizziness for my entire life. Not really nausea but more like vertigo nearly every day. I mean I am dizzy just driving ten minutes to the store and it is magnified 100x in the heat when the sun is out in the summer on a hot day. I just push through it and always have because I cannot get a doctor to take me seriously. I am 31 now and for whatever reason, face masks of all things became my new trigger. I actually started getting kicked out of stores for wearing a mask because people thought I had a fever and it scared them. And I could not get into the Apple store one day when I needed a charger for my MacBook to work from home when mine broke because my external temperature was too hot. I was fed up and made an appointment and since I had a mask on in the doctors office I flared up and my doctor looked at me like she saw a ghost and ran a ton of tests. My blood counts were all high on the first test so she repeated the test again but they came back within the normal range on the second test. My normetanepherine was also slightly high. She also ran inflammatory markers and called me back saying my CRP was high and my ANA IFA was 1:80 and had a specked pattern and that I have an autoimmune disease she just does not know which one so she referred me to a specialist. I am happy to finally have some answers even if they are vague but it is going to be several weeks before the rheumatologist can get me in. So while I wait I am just curious if anyone else has an autoimmune disease with any overlapping signs or symptoms? And if so which one? Any other tips/advice? Thx! I do not know how helpful my experience would be for you,  But I have autoimmune small fiber neuropathy with related erythromelalgia. I do not share your heritage or your blood results though.   \n\n\nAs for tips for coping with the pain, you can take cool showers or use cooling packs, but do not use them too frequently or for too long in duration. Otherwise you can develop reactive flaring, where as soon as you leave the water, the pain returns worse.  My only other tip for coping with the pain is to use medical marijuana.  If you have access to it, get a high THC indica. That actually is very helpful! My heritage likely has nothing to do with it I was more pointing out the craziness that a dermatologist would send me on my way after asking if I was Irish because apparently Irish people just flush more lol. The reactive flaring is interesting because it has gotten WAY worse this past year at the same time every day and it is typically when I take a shower too. And oddly enough even if I do not take a shower at that time or even on that day it will happen but I never put two and two together so that is extremely helpful. Thank you! I am currently being evaluated for an auto immune cause for my THEM.  I have a plethora of symptoms which I presumed were unrelated so I have had a tendency to edit out stuff for brevity when going to a new specialist.  BIG MISTAKE.\n\nSo I actually read here on Reddit of someone else's experience and diagnosis.  And it was as if I had written much of her post myself.  Dysautonomia, THEM, Small Fiber Neuropathy, and Anhidrosis. Quite an assortment, several of them rare.\n\nWithout mentioning have read this other Reddit post I just summarized my complete history when speaking to my neurologist who was confirming the positive biopsy for small fiber neuropathy. Her eyes lit up and she recognized this pattern. We are running tests for the same auto-immune issues that this other Reddit poster has.  Not sure, but may be my solution.\n\nPossible diagnosis for me is IgM vs TS-HDS.  Absolutely not sure. And there are other related diagnoses that it could be.  But it is basically when the body makes antibodies against a molecule that is on the surface of certain nerve cells. The nerves get damaged resulting in all sort of symptoms. Yikes! Well that is crazy because I used to get really hot and sweaty with these flushes in high school and my early 20s and my back used to actually sweat a lot just when working out in general. But the last few years I do not even think I could produce a bead of sweat on my face at all. Definitely not my arms either. They just get red hot and angry. Probably on my chest still but I am really not even sure about that. I have literally had a stranger stop me in the last year while walking/jogging my dog to ask if I was ok because my face was so red. Which did not bother me at all because they were genuine about it and I would be concerned if someone looked like me too lol. Their intent was sincere so I completely understood but told them I was ok. That is so bizarre. I have left out stuff at appointments too but there is so much stuff. I had a photo album I made called health and it was packed full of photos (because I was tired of doctors blowing me off and figured that might work better and it did!) and I even took some out of my hands and arms because I felt like it was way too many photos for the doctor to go through lol. I am going to look into that because it sounds very much like at least some of the same symptoms I have. Thank you! I have had fibromyalgia for about 20 years  and in the last two years developed THEM, Raynaud\u2019s and a bunch of other new autoimmune symptoms. \n\nI am getting tested for Lupus, Sjogren\u2019s and a few others things like Thyroid problems to rule those out as causes- I also have an appointment with neurology to do small fiber Neuropathy testing. It is been quite the journey trying to figure out what this was and now the root cause of it. \n\nIn the meantime while you are waiting, did they happen to test your b vitamin levels? Sometimes vitamin b (not just 12 but 3,5,7,6) can cause issues if they are not adequate. I would recommend getting some small travel fans to keep your skin cool, try out a magnesium supplement to see if that helps and aspirin me also helps during a flare up. \n\nI am so sorry you are going through this, I know it is dreadful. There is also a really helpful Facebook group for Erythromelagia that has a ton of supportive people who are willing to share their story and advice, I never recommend Facebook for anything but in this case the THEM groups rock. Hang in there! I have hashimoto\u2019s disease and I was diagnosed 2 years ago. Since I was younger I have always had hot flashes but no one took it seriously until I finally got it checked out. I would look into that if possible! I think that I do as well, but I cannot figure out which one either. Possibly Lupus, but I do not have any muscle pain. I think I have an autoimmune disorder bc I usually feel like I have a minor flu like once a week. This has been going on for literally ten years. I will feel like I have a flu (chills, headache, body aches) one day and be totally fine the next. I also have moderate THEM and severe Raynaud\u2019s. I think I might have some form of Lyme Disease. Possibly something called Babesiosis. It is similar to malaria. IDK if this has anything to do with my THEM, but just wanted to throw this out there. \nGood luck! It might be Lupus if you are that sensitive to sunlight. That is a major symptom of Lupus. THEM symptoms tend to be cyclical.  It is common that symptoms are worse at night.  If you shower before bed (or whenever it is worst for you, maybe you can shower at a different time?    \n\n\nYou can find more information at ( and there is some more info about THEM over at ( Yes I have. I was diagnosed with erythromelalgia and Raynaud's initially and then 6 months later I developed body wide rashes which were diagnosed as Lupus. I get THEM mostly on my face, cheeks, nose and ears and sometimes on my feet, knees and upper arms. Having Raynaud's as well makes it even more of a nightmare as I cannot get too cold or too hot.\n\nIn my case the erythromelalgia is secondary to the lupus. I am on hydroxychloroquine now and it seems to be helping the THEM flares, my ear flushing has at least completely stopped.\n\nThe rheumatologist and neurologist I see both agree that it can be quite likely for THEM to be secondary to an autoimmune condition and in that case the best way to treat the THEM is through treating the primary condition.\n\nHope this helps! Huh. I am not the OP, but I have both THEM and Raynaud\u2019s. My mother was just diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s a few years ago, but I did not realize these two things were connected. I have been wondering what autoimmune disease I have had for a while. I will look into this. Thanks! I have raynauds and i am 1000% sure I have THEM but my doc will not look into it haha. Definitely look into it, my mom has thyroid disease and it is genetic so I ended up with hashimoto\u2019s. I will. Thanks! I believe my mother and sister both have Raynaud\u2019s and THEM as well.", "Photos of my hands when burning? Could this be Them? ", "Update: I have been on aspirin 325mg for a couple of weeks and seen no improvement. I was at my doc appt today shown in the first picture and now I am starting gabapentin on Monday.  Crossing my burning fingers and toes that you have improvement with the gabapentin.\n\nhard to have patience while you are hurting.  There are several options to try. Did they test you for SFN? She said to take the medication at night and if no improvement and no side affects then 2 times a day. Hopefully this works and I only have to take it at night. I do not think so. She looked at my ultrasounds and blood work. I would definitely get checked for small fiber neuropathy. My neurologist explained to me that THEM is a form of peripheral neuropathy that can be caused from SFN and autonomic issues. I have Dysautonomia and suspected hEDS as well as MCAS and SFN. I have THEM on my feet face and ears. Once I started getting treated for neuropathy and MCAS my THEM flares went way way down and are much more manageable. this for sure looks like them- in my experience gabapentin did nothing for me pain wise after 2-3 months and the withdrawal is horrendous. they just keep adding more when i say it doesnt work and i beg them to take me off because its unnecessary and they wont. many people say the same but for others it works very well. i hope you figure it out soon :) try it out, not everyone is the same but a chance of relief is worth it My doctors said to take it at night for a week and if no improvement and no side effects. I take it morning and night. And lastly if no side effects and no improvement 3X a day. If I have effects or not working  I have to slow come off it bc you can get seizures. And if I get seizures I must contact my doctor. So I do not do what it says on the bottle only what my doc told me to do. I hope for the both of us we find something that is works. I will have to talk to my doctor about that, thanks. I do not think I was tested for that. I am currently weaning off of gabapentin right now because it gave me severe fatigue, brain fog, confusion etc., and it did not even seem to be helping my symptoms. I am now having insane nightmares every night since I started weaning off it. Glad to be done with it, but i know some people find it to be beneficial. I had the exact same thing. I would have lucid dreams whenever someone would wake me up (couldnt ever wake up i slept so heavily) I attributed it to Lamictal, but in hind sight that was definitely gabapentin because it was always when i missed my night meds. For the last 18 months of my life they have accumulatively bumped this thing up to 700mg 3x a day. It was bumped to that in october. It is ridiculous and i cant get them to tune it down. I guarantee its bc of $$$ Oh wow, definitely talk to your doctor before taking that high dosage. My doc told me if you give ur body too much, seizures can happen or if you do not come off the meds slowly. Mine is 100mg at my weight of 105 only at night to see how my body reacts. And bump the pill to twice a day if no side effects and no improvement and so on. Oh no, its not voluntarily, i have no choice essentially because i cant wean off , 600 and a 100 doesnt make that too easy Oh ok, that is great ur off the medication with no complications. I am still unsure if I want to start taking it. My body is sensitive and aspirin 325mg made me feel sick. I have fatigue, brain fog, bad headaches, nausea without taking anything. Being in the sun or a warm room I feel like my body is so hot. I do not know what to do, I do not want to feel worse than I already do. Oh im still on it, they wont split it into 300's so i can wean off, my suggestion is to make sure you trust whatever doctor prescribes it and if it doesnt work i wouldnt go up honestly. Its an awful thing to have withdrawal from. Even when im only an hour late past the time im supposed to take it its hell. Works for some, awful for others. Dont be afraid to try it, just know you have to have a voice. Thanks for the advice. I do trust my doctor he definitely knows what he is doing but Im just afraid to feel more sick. The girl explained to me the stuff about the pill and how to take it for me and what is not on the bottle. I will see how my first pill goes tonight and if I do not like it I will not take anymore. I should be fine not taking anymore after one.", "Medical marijuana for THEM pain Hello everyone! I am a 22 female who is been suffering from Erythro since I was about 11. I have tried different medications for the burning pain (Lyrica, Gabba Pentin, Codeine, Hydrocodine, etc) and some have helped but all have left me in a tired fog. I have smoked for pain management for years and a few weeks ago I was approved for my medical card so I was able to purchase a vaporizer. It is been such an improvement! I find my photosensitivity is a bit more tolerable and overall the burning is numbed. Has anyone else had success with using marijuana?  Yeah it makes be a cooler temperature and seems to help. But in the first place a big one for me is to not eat anything with gluten  I was just diagnosed but have been suffering for almost a year now. It has taken Doctors a long time to figure it out because most of them never come across it. I do smoke and it helps. My legs constantly burn at night now and I am taking just THC and it helps me sleep.  i take oil. does not stop the burning, pain or zapping sensations but i suppose it helps pass the time.", "Primary vs secondary? For those who have been officially diagnosed, was your diagnosis secondary or primary, and if secondary, what are the other conditions? Secondary. Even did the SCN9A gene test to confirm. I have POTS, Raynauds, rosacea, and undifferentiated connective tissue disease (most likely lupus). Can I ask how you did the genetic test? (Like, did a doctor order it? If you are in the U.S., did insurance cover it?) I just got diagnosed and my doctor mentioned a possible genetic test. Primary, I have been referred to a geneticist to confirm but waiting time is over a year.\n\nIn my case, they ruled out lupus, dermatomyositis, mast cell activation disorder, psoriasis, diabetes and myleoproliferative disorders (cancer).  In addition my mother has it and my grandmother may have as well while she was alive.  It also started in childhood for me, but recently \"woke up to my whole body\".  I also have chronic fatigue syndrome, reynauds, and bladder dysfunction.  Also tinnitus, visual snow syndrome and weird skin issues that are difficult to identify even with biopsy.   Also dry eye disorder with corneal damage.\n\nAccording to my raw dna in 23 and me, my scn9a gene has a lot of flags for THEM, but they are 'needs more research' flags lol.  In my case, they refer you to a genetic counselor who does the test and interprets the results.  I am still on the waitlist to get an appointment, but that is how it was explained to me. Thank you! I am guessing that is the route my doctor might send me down (unless he can order the test himself). Hi! 95% of THEM is secondary. It is rare for it to be primary and usually starts in childhood. I wanted to be tested because my feet looked discolored in my teens but I had no pain. I had the SCN9A genetic testing and it was secondary. I only recommend testing if you are looking to start a family and would not try to have a child if you had a likelihood of passing THEM on... I am a nurse practitioner with THEM. Otherwise, it is my opinion that the test is a waste of money. It lets you know primary vs secondary, but does not really change treatment. Labs bill crazy amounts... $10-12k for the test. I called the lab and negotiated private pay- only ended up paying $250 out-of-pocket. I too have Raynauds, a lot of autoimmune stuff in my family. The functional medicine route, dietary changes, and getting at the root cause driving all the inflamamation in my body was my ticket to reversing my THEM.", "Do I have THEM? I have struggled with vascular issues since I was 10 (about 14 years). I would have terrible itching and burning pain, so bad I could not sleep. It took 5 years of seeing every doctor under the sun and trying everything before I was finally diagnosed with Chilblains (triggered by cold). I was treated for it and it gradually went away. Then all of a sudden this spring the itching has started again but is seemingly triggered by heat now. The DR. Says its THEM, but I am skeptical because everything I have read says that pain is the hallmark symptom and I am having mild pain but the worst itching I have ever experienced and no medications are helping this time around. Does anyone else find the itching to be worse?", "Real No Credit Check Loans | Fast Approve ", "Does this look familiar?

I have secondary erythromelalgia. I believe mine is caused by undiagnosed autoimmune like Rheumatoid Arthritis. Self-diagnosed. I am planning to go to specialist for erythromelalgia at some point, even though main issue has to be treated first. I just get dismissed by doctors so cannot treat main issue. It is sad doctors do not know what it is. It is rare according to internet. Mine's triggered by standing too. Do they get hot &amp; itchy? Mine's gotten a little better with time, but has moved to knees, hands and face/ears. I believe it could be related to a neuropathy issue.  Building muscles in legs has helped me as well as primarily resting and elevating legs 24/7. I use to have to elevate every 30 seconds. Now I can walk 20 minutes at a time before elevation and stand for a few minutes. Have you seen a neurologist who specializes in autonomic neuropathies?  That is who ultimately nailed down my diagnosis as \"autoimmune small fiber neuropathy with related erythromelalgia\" because I had very elevated levels of FGFR3 antibodies. And FGFR3 is not typically done in an autoimmune screen. Just a thought.  \n\n\nTo OP: Yes, your picture looks like THEM. If it is hot and painful, is worsened with heat/exercise/having your limbs hang down, and is relieved with cooling/elevation, please get seen by a neurologist.  Neurologists are the ones who at least know about this condition and can diagnose and treat it. Yup.  I will join the chorus.  Looks like THEM. And yikes!\n\nDo not be surprised that specialists have not known what it is. Many have never seen a case before.\n\nSearch the ( on the webpage of The Erythromelalgia Association to find a specialist in your area who is familiar with erythromelalgia. Thank you for the information. I will look into it. Sadly yes. This is how mine started. June 2020. Does it feel like broken glass when you stand on it? Made worse by heat and exercise? Then ya. I want to tell you what I wish someone had told me. Having THEM increases your chances of suicide. Every now and then you will have to FIGHT to tell yourself that it will get better. Even though it might not. Yeah, I just want to second this.\n\nMy Rheum is entirely unfamiliar with THEM and I am at one of the top hospital systems in the country. She bounced me to dermatology who diagnosed me. I brought it up to my neurologist recently, in passing, who is now running a bunch of tests himself next month. I have had the diagnosis for years but I have never had the work up. \n\nIt does not actually seem to be strongly related to rheumatological issues other than vasculitis which honestly makes sense. When I thought about my diseases (SLE/RA +AS) it really does not fit anywhere despite most websites saying it can be associated with SLE/RA. The pain and interactions is 100% different and clearly seems to be of different sources. I think there is just a bad habit to put all things to do with inflammation in the same bucket even if they do not quite fit. \n\nI am sure the diseases that cause THEM are probably closely related to autoimmune issues, but I do not think THEM is itself, if that makes sense. Wow, what are the odds.\n\nI have had my THEM diagnosis for ages, from my dermatologist, because my neurologist was uninterested. It is totally possible I did not explain it well enough back when I started to realize something was wrong.\n\nLast week at my routine neurologist appointment I brought it up in passing and my neurologist was like, *record scratch, what did you just say?* and seemed to actually get giddy when I showed him photos and explained. He ordered a bunch of tests I have never had before. I kind of downplayed my diagnosis for years until recently, hence the lack of tests.\n\nAnyway, he is the only doc in my entire state on that directory. There is probably 50-100+ neurologists and tens of thousands of doctors in my  medical system. What are the odds he was already my assigned doctor, has been for the last five years for unrelated issues, *and* is on that list?\n\nSmall world. He is even listed as a researcher and not a doctor. Fascinating. Crazy coincidence for you, for sure!\n\nI am in the J&amp;J COVID vaccine trial. When I went in to get the shot I had to answer a bunch of medical history questions and wrote down THEM.\n\nWhen the supervising doctor came in to review my medical history that the technician had gathered he too was giddy. A history of THEM did not matter so it was not medically necessary, but the doctor almost sheepishly asked to see my feet. I was in full flare and he was just fascinated.  He had never seen a case before.\n\nHe went to get the one other doctor at the testing center. This other doc flat out said I was the first THEM case he had seen in more than 40 years of practice.\n\nOn the other hand I found my THEM specialist on that list, one of only two in a metro region of more than 1 million population. He is a vascular medicine doctor and has seen multiple cases. His nurses took my case history and are totally familiar. This is old hat to them. I was diagnosed on my first visit, no problem.  Finding the right doctor makes all the difference in the world. Mine started with my knee unhinging in 2018, next swollen ankles in 2019, then swollen knees, then swollen body, hands in 2020. I felt like I weighed a thousand pounds and my joints were all locked. I still get burning red flares on my ankles and achilles at night. I noticed the blood pooling a month after I swelled up to twice my size when I was trying to shower.  The blood rushed to my feet and I felt like I was going to faint. Four months later it spread to my knees. Almost a year later spread to hands, face, ear. My skintone is about 4 shades darker than it use to be, especially in legs and hands. I have heard mushroom poisoning can cause THEM, but that recovery is about a year. I am going to be a year with my pooling now. I have seen a lot of doctors that just keep referring me to specialists that cannot help me. My next stop is the THEM specialist because the pooling really is what interferes the most with my daily routines.  Uh, please do not take this the wrong way, but this does not sound like THEM and it also sounds *a lot more serious* than THEM.\n\nSee a vascular doctor or a neurologist ASAP.\n\nTHEM is just pain. It is not even blood pooling, its the widening and constricting of blood vessels, which is what causes the burning pain. But not actual blood pooling.\n\nI am not sure what you mean by knee unhinging, but also not RA -- RA is inflammation in your joints that eats away at them. No joint locking.\n\nThis sounds neurological and a bit serious -- I think you should take them up on the specialists. From an internet stranger with the diseases you (think) you have -- you sound *very* different from myself. This is why self-diagnosing is very dangerous; please follow up with your doctors. There are easy tests they can run to confirm these things. Thank you. I have seen over 20 doctors in past year. Maybe not RA, but my cartilage is worn off in knee and shoulder. I was originally diagnosed with chondromalacia patella.  Not being able to bend my elbow or knee is like RA. So is stiffness. I just have something other than RA. It affects my muscles too, so could just be a combination of things. Many tests. Went to PT three times. I also went to two vascular doctors, a neurologist, two rheumatologists, dermatologist, had ultrasound on legs, mris of cervical spine &amp; shoulder. I have inflammation and tears in the cartilage around shoulders. Tears in cervical spine. They just send me to pain mgmt. I do not mean to scare you. I am at 80% now. I have gained some muscle and am independent. It is just mostly the blood pooling. I do not have primary THEM. I believe I have secondary. They get hot, itchy and painful if I do not elevate in time. My ankles and achilles burn at night mostly, sometimes during the day. I get electric shocks in hands and face if I do not elevate. Maybe it is not THEM, but THEM is the closest I have seen. I originally thought I had venous insufficiency, but my veins are normal. &gt;They get hot, itchy and painful if I do not elevate in time. My ankles and achilles burn at night mostly, sometimes during the day. I get electric shocks in hands and face if I do not elevate.\n\nI would speak to neurology again. This is not THEM. It is not in the right spots. THEM is unrelated to elevating and pooling. THEM is not a circulation issue, THEM is an issue with vascular constriction. Elevating in the legs can be things like diabetes, POTS, kidney issues -- a whole bunch of things. I am not an MD, but from one sick person to another, I think you might be missing obvious signals. Remember THEM is super rare -- &lt;4,000 people in the USA have it. A lot of people who post in this sub do not have it. A lot of things look like THEM, but very few actually are. This is not to be gatekeep-y at all, it should be more of a relief than anything else.\n\nHow did they diagnose the inflammation in those specific areas?\n\nre: RA: RA is really not about bending. People with RA can bend. When you cannot bend anymore with RA like you are describing, its because your bones have fused together. This would show up on an X-ray and MRI's, which you said you have had. Sounds like you have had the blood tests. If you have RA, the blood tests would show -- CCP and RF would come back positive (or at least one would).\n\nI think you might be confusing RA and osteoarthritis, but the latter would still show up on x-rays, CT's and MRI's.\n\nA lot of what you just listed is use injuries -- but seriously, you need to get that blood pooling checked out. That is dangerous and it is not THEM. Please take care of yourself and work with your doctors. Thank you so much for the information.", "Does this look like THEM?

It looks like it could be THEM. The symptoms you described are from THEM. I have both. Raynauds and THEM. They are the opposite of each other. You should definitely show those pics to your doctor. As far as I know the only way to diagnose it is thru the signs (what you can see-the pictures, the redness)and symptoms (what you feel-the pain and heat) . If they check for autoimmune diseases or anything that can cause THEM then that would be a way to dx as well. My hands and feet look the same exact way if I am in hot water or I am outside and the temperature is 75 F and up. My feet also burn really bad. I had a neurologist appointment last week and they diagnosed me with small fiber sensory neuropathy. They say it is idiopathic, however I had Covid in February of 2020 and I believe it was caused by it. I was 100% healthy until becoming infected with Covid. The photos and your description are consistent with THEM.\n\nRoutine blood tests *might* point to a possible cause.  For many patients their THEM is secondary to something else. What that *something else* could be varies a LOT. \n\nIn some cases that is a myeloproliferative disorder, fancy medical jargon for certain kinds of blood cancers. A routine blood count would pick that up Obviously they would want to identify that early on, even though it is NOT the most likely possibility.\n\nIn some cases that is an auto-immune disorder, your immune system attacking certain kinds of nerve cells. An elevated ANA level might hint at that.\n\nIn MOST cases it is not clear what causes THEM.\n\nDo ask about THEM. Many doctors are not familiar with it at all, or have only heard about it and never seen a patient with it. I participated in one of the COVID vaccine trials. The local clinic is managed by a doctor who has been practicing for 40+ years. I disclosed my THEM diagnosis on the intake form and he told me I was the first patient he has ever met with the condition. He even politely asked to see my feet even though it was entirely irrelevant to the vaccine trial. Just medical fascination.  A different doctor, my pain medicine specialist, told me I am her only patient with THEM.\n\nDoctors have the maxim, *when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras.* It is a caution to consider common causes of symptoms first. THEM is more of a unicorn, something so far out in left field and so rare but unfortunately THEM is real.\n\nIf your doctor is unable to diagnose you or help then consider getting an appointment with a doctor from the ( If outside the US, there is a link under the search box to Search by Country &amp; State/Province. Those doctors are familiar with the condition. \n\nIMHO being seen by someone familiar with THEM is more important than the exact specialty of the doctor, and it is something well worth paying privately if you must.", "Fatigue One of my other health problems is chronic fatigue syndrome.  I have noticed a correlation on here between people with THEM and dysautonomia. and CFS is a part of dysautonomia. So I thought I would ask more officially:  \n\n\nDoes your THEM seem to come along with fatigue attacks?  When my face is flaring, for example, I get exhausted and 'goo-brained' and have to go nap for an hour or two to get back to normal.  This does not seem to happen when it is just in my hands and feet though.  Maybe it is just the heat from THEM triggering my CFS lol. Yes!! I never had a word to describe it but \u201cgoo-brained\u201d is a really good way to explain the feeling. It does not happen every time I have a face flare but it does quite often, I feel so spacey and out of it and it can take quite a while for it to go away. As far as I know I do not have chronic fatigue syndrome or dysautonomia (although not quite sure what that is I will have to look it up). But I definitely can relate to the flaring fatigue. Yes! But I always thought the fatigue correlated more with my POTS (type of dysautonomia) than the THEM. \n\nBut now you have me remembering a recent spell where I was in the sun/humidity too much and the THEM flares made me so tired I was sick. I know it could not have been the POTS as much since I was just sitting in the same position the whole time so my heart rate was consistent. \n\nSo you have me thinking my THEM could be contributing just as much to my fatigue as the POTS and together, they are a chronic fatigue tsunami! \ud83c\udf0a Nice! I mean... its not nice... but shared experiences mean I am not just crazy lol  Lol...I know exactly what you mean. We do not wish this THEM and other conditions' suffering on our worst enemies, but yet it helps we are not the only ones trying to survive this very painful and exhausting way of life! In fact, I feel so strongly about not passing on this life of suffering that I made the personal decision to not have biological kids. And I might never have the energy or wherewithal to have adopted/foster kids either because I feel like between work, life chores, and dealing with my multiple chronic conditions, there is nothing left at the end of the day for anyone but my partner, plants, and cat! I definitely understand.  I also have inherited glaucoma, inherited depression, and a few other things.  Between the absurd costs of having a child, and the genetic problems I would be handing to them, and my own limitations due to my disabilities... it would just be a bad idea to have a biological kid.    \n\n\nI found fish to also be pretty fantastic pets for living with a disability.  Some fish have remarkable personalities. I have only ever had a betta fish. What types do you have? Sorry to hear you carry multiple conditions, too! I also had a betta.  She was pretty unique for a betta. Did not mind sharing her tank with other fish (as long as they were not bettas).  A pair of freshwater angelfish (one gold, one platinum) in a 55 gallon with dwarf chain loaches and golden plecos.  The betta tank had a bunch of albino corydoras, amano shrimp, and some nerite snails. And I have a cherry shrimp tank that is overflowing with babies.

I took a drug called accutane and ever since I have been getting this My hands do not burn they just pool blood I do not have any pain either I have had it about 10 years. I never took accutane and really do not know what triggered this.  \n\nI have had an underlying dysautonomia for as long as I can remember.

It was relatively unchanged for many years but suddenly got quite a lot worse over the last year.", "I think I might have THEM I am starting to flare up in my hands and feet and it is super hot itchy red and tight. Last year was the first time I ever felt this weird sensation and then a day after it became extremely painful where i literally could not sleep without having bowls of ice water on my hands and feet and during the day and while I slept.. it lasted about a week and a half. It was one of the worst feelings in my life where I just wanted to cut off my hands but I told myself it would go away and it eventually did. I recently went to the doctors for a check up about 2 months ago and got bloodwork and she said there was nothing wrong with my blood besides being a tiny bit vitamin D deficient. Now that this tight hot itchy feeling is coming back I am scared and it is making me worry. I do not know if I have it and I will be seeing a dermatologist in October but I do not know why this started happening now in my early 20s. Can someone let me know any remedies to ease the pain? My flares come on from eveything, excersise, heat, anxiety, randomly and even just using them especially when I am carrying something like if I have a bag in my hand, my blood work came back fine too yet I still had this, someone recommended to me 600mg alpha lipoid acid capsules\u2026.

Most everyone has their skin turn a bit red. With THEM that redness causes *pain*.\n\nAnd if you are experiencing a flare run you hands under cool (NEVER icy cold) water in the sink. In THEM the redness and pain should go away in seconds.\n\n**PLEASE STOP USING ICE WATER ON YOUR HANDS!!!!!**   Many THEM patients are only diagnosed after suffering frostbite injuries from the use of ice water.  Frostbite only make things MUCH worse. I am sorry you are going thru this. We can all relate. It is painful, and very unsettling. I have heard alpha lipoic acid helps some people. Keeping a pain and food diary might help you figure out triggers. Beyond the obvious like heat, friction/touching, leaving hands dangling below heart for too long (ex. Walking for periods of time)....   For me, beyond those triggers, I have learned medications and diet play a big role. Ibuprofen and other NSAIDS always make my hands flare, once the medication wears off. Also, gluten for sure, (though I am not celiac) but really any type of grain (oat, corn, barley, etc) will make my hands flare up more, later in the day. If I avoid all grains, I do better. Also, wearing compression calf sleeves, and loose cotton socks. If my feet turn red, I take socks off immediately, lie down with feet up in the air for 5 mins, and it is gone. Though I think it is because I probably have dysautonomia (primary suspects), which can cause blood to pool on extremities instead of evenly distribute when upright. I think I have it as well. Would someone knowledgeable be able to clarify my only concern:\n\nWhen episodes happen does it have anything to do with a change in blood pressure. Like does your blood pressure get high or low? I am more concerned about it getting high. \n\nOr is blood pressure not effected.", "If I think I have THEM, is there even a reason to see a doctor about it? I guess it is just what the title says: is there even a reason to get a diagnosis? There is no real cure and all the treatments can be done at home (except for medications obviously but it sounds like most people use non-medication treatments anyways), so what are the benefits of getting a diagnosis?? \n\nI have just always had this problem ever since I was a little kid and I am 99% sure it is erythromelalgia and while it is a giant relief to finally figure it out, I just wonder if it is even worth seeing a doctor about. Idk. I am just feeling frustrated maybe?? \n\nI guess tbh I already have an appointment with a neurologist in about a month for a different reason, do I just bring it up then? Is it even worth it to say something? Idk Some of the prescription medications can be very effective for relieving pain. Mexiletine is a sodium channel blocker medication which can be quite effective in patients with hereditary THEM caused by a mutation to the SCN9A gene.\n\nSome patients have THEM as the result of having another condition. One of the possible \"other conditions\" are  **Myeloproliferative diseases** , which is a fancy way of saying certain kinds of blood cancers. So THEM might be what brings someone into the doctor, but finding the root cause may be the more important issue. And treating the root cause can effectively cure the THEM in some patients.\n\nAnd even if the first prescription medication does not work a good doctor can help you trial various options to try to find something that will help the pain. &gt;So THEM might be what brings someone into the doctor, but finding the root cause may be the more important issue.\n\nAhh that is definitely a good point that I never thought of or considered. I guess it is important to make sure it is not caused by anything really bad like that :\\ \n\nThanks for your reply--it helps! Seconding the advice to see a neurologist and get an official diagnosis anyway.  If by \"treatments at home\"  you mean cooling your feet in cool water or flowing air whenever you have a flare, you should know that it is not recommended to do that often. Repeated, prolonged exposure to cold air or water can lead to skin irritation or breakdown. You can also have rebound flaring, which is when a flare returns worse as soon as you stop the cooling.   \n(  \n\n\nThere CAN be effective treatments. For 5 years, gabapentin basically brought my THEM pain to 0.  I had been screaming and not sleeping at night previously. For me, doctors have unraveled that my THEM stems from an autoimmune process. Even if my neurologists and pain doctors have not found the exact right treatment for me yet (gabapentin has lost some efficacy as my THEM has spread and worsened) we have a lot more information now.   \n\n\nLastly, having an official diagnosis in hand can allow you to participate in clinical trials for THEM patients so researchers can find new treatments for us! &gt;If by \"treatments at home\" you mean cooling your feet in cool water or flowing air whenever you have a flare, \n\nAhh yeah that is what I meant but reading the info you linked I can see that is not a great idea \ud83d\ude05 I had found websites saying that is a good way to treat it when you are out of the house but I can see how that could make it worse and also damage the skin. \n\n&gt;Lastly, having an official diagnosis in hand can allow you to participate in clinical trials for THEM patients so researchers can find new treatments for us!\n\nThat is also a really good point. I feel like I could probably manage the rest but that is a good reason to get it checked out and maybe have a chance at helping other people People are not touching on the main reason.\n\nTHEM is often associated with deadly diseases that need proper treatment ASAP, as well as life-time monitoring.\n\nIt would really suck if you ignored this and then got diagnosed with late-stage Leukemia in three years.\n\nIt is, by far and wide, the most important part of the THEM process. Most cases of THEM are secondary (aka caused by another disease), not primary. Primary is a dominant inheritance pattern, so if you have primary THEM, your parents do, too. This does not seem to be the case with you.\n\nThe worst that happens is you see the doctor, its not THEM, and then you have no cancer risk. Easy. (Most people who think they have THEM do not have THEM, IMO, so I hope that brings you some ease. But it should be checked regardless and ruled out). &gt;Primary is a dominant inheritance pattern, so if you have primary THEM, your parents do, too. This does not seem to be the case with you.\n\nYou are right, my parents do not have any of the symptoms/signs of THEM, so I guess it is a good idea to get it checked out \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nThank you for bringing up your points, it is definitely the more serious side of getting a diagnosis and probably the most important Yeah, I totally know how you feel with the hesitancy, but it is super important to get done. I felt ridiculous because like, its just this funny kind of painful rash? \n\nMy doctors dismissed it until I showed them photos (take lots of the best photos you can get). I could not even get one to look at it and when he finally did, he was like \"oooooh woooooaaahhhhhhh wait a second\".\n\nMy dermatologist personally diagnosed me. I am not sure why everyone recommends a neuro -- mine kind of acted like this was beneath him/out of his specialty -- but hopefully you have a better experience.\n\nDo not be discouraged, though, seriously. Only &lt;4,000 people in the USA have it, it is an extremely, extremely rare disorder. Hopefully its just some rash, but I do encourage you to get it checked out just in case. It is totally a situation of you would rather be safe than sorry. \n\nGood luck :) Thanks for the info/tips!

She is on gabapention and we keep prescription lidocaine and Voltaren in the refrigerator to use.  The Dr said not to use something cold on it - to use something cool. Yup, that is what it looks like. On my hands it sometimes looks more mottled than my feet. Do they feel warm to the touch? Thanks for the info. For me the pain is manageable, it is more so I am concerned and I guess embarrassed by how red it is! Yes this looks like it to me although a doctor can formally diagnose. Does it hurt at all? To be honest, this does not entirely look like it to me, but in any case it is definitely a good picture to bring into a dr. Does temperature ever trigger the redness? I would say it tends to occurs more frequently in warmer weather. The odd thing is I feel like when it is red, it is not always hot or markedly warmer than other parts of my skin. Often it is cold or cool. Hmm. I am not saying you do not have the condition, but in this particular pic it looks like just your external skin is irritated. When you have a flare, does it feel like your veins are on fire (not just your skin)? That is what the condition feels like to me.

This is one of the only way he find relief. He keeps them elevated and cool most of the day - has not slept under a blanket since mid January from the weird feeling. It is progressively getting worse and worse. Does anyone have any idea what this is?? Has also developed a rash on ankles (I think it is from soaking in cool water and then not putting on lotion after - but lotion clogs up his pores and makes them heat up quickly). Please help. It is agony for him. My Dad's feet get like this, but his is from (most likely, but who knows) a spinal cord injury. Some people on here have said they have spine issues, so might be something to look at. Does aspirin help at all? Also blood thinners like sulodexide have helped as well, which is a drug I am going to be looking into. We tried aspirin and it seemed to help - but then it also seemed like it spurred it on. My daughter has a erythromelalgia.  The cream we use for her feet is a mixture of Voltaren, Lidocaine and Gabapentin. The gabapentin is a compound cream specially made by the pharmacist with a prescription. We add in the Voltaren and Lidocaine cream ourself (cheaper).\n\nYou could try the lidocaine and Voltaren and REFRIGERATE the creams. We bought a super mini fridge and put it right by her bed.  When she feels the tingling start, she puts the REFRIGERATED cream on her feet. It helps take the attack down but does not always stop it.\n\n\n\nYour husbands feet look severe.

You can put the cream on and then if you have to walk around you can wear the socks.  They have grippers on the bottom but are made to breath.  \n\n\n\n\n\nGood luck. This is extremely painful.

I definitely think the rash is from cold damage. He was icing his feet and then went to a cool water soak. Started doing it tons. I really think it damaged his skin barrier.

Experience w topicals? I finally got diagnosed after 15 years of symptoms and discovering erythromelalgia on my own.

Welcome to our unhappy growing club.  \ud83d\ude33 You are definitely not the only one who had to find THEM on your own. \n\nThe ketamine topical is commonly prescribed, but AFAIK it is a compounded formula and costs a bit more than I could afford.  I have seen mention of ketamine compounded with a few different drugs so the formulation you get may not be the exact same as other try.  Still, it is definitely worth a try.\n\nPain signals from nerves are transmitted when sodium ions enter the nerve cells, primarily through the NaV1.7 sodium gated ion channel. Ketamine blocks another path that allows sodium ions into the nerve cells, the HCN1 (potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel ).  Yeah. Details not that important.\n\nThe important part is that ketamine can stop or reduce pain signals from nerves before they start.  Too much ketamine is NOT a good thing as that same HCN1 protein needs some activity to regulate other important stuff. I am a researcher so this kind of detail is interesting to me. I would have liked my doc to order genetic testing but he did not.\n\nI am curious to know if anyone has seen the Mayo derm that treats erythromelalgia and what their experience with him is.

My current derm definitely is aware of THEM though.\n\nI am curious to know if I should be worked up further for a myeloproliferative disorder, as itching, especially after bathing, has been a symptom for me in the past few years. CBCs have been normal and I cannot find much clinical guidance otherwise. It is been a highly effective topical for me. I just mostly use it only in the summer or when I really really need it since it costs so much. \n\nRe genetic testing, you can check out the test from Invitae for SCN9A to rule out primary form. This is helpful to know in terms of treatment approach. \n\nRe Mayo doctor, check out the erythromelalgia Facebook group (searching by Mayo keyword in search bar), and it brings up a lot of folks comments on this very topic. It seems like Mayo really only helps if you need a diagnosis. However, it sounds like you are already near Mayo. If that is the case, then if I were you, I would try it out. \n\nSome helpful advice my Rheumatologist is using as we work our way through trying various meds is to try and figure out if your root cause is more neurological or vascular. This might only be figured out by seeing how you respond to different meds. \n\nRe Myoproliferative disease, my Rheumatologist just monitors with biannual CBC. I cannot remember if there was a more extensive initial workup of blood labs to rule it out for now. But it is something we always at least do CBC for since it can develop years after THEM onset. \n\nHave you been able to identify potential root causes yet? Voltaren.

In the study, 27 of 36 patients experienced improvement of their symptoms.    \n\n\nI am currently trying a compounded amitriptyline-ketamine-lidocaine cream.  No results yet, but I have not had the chance to try it consistently until now so I will apply it regularly for the next two weeks and reevaluate.  Ketamine (and lidocaine) should work immediately, but amitriptyline can take some time to build up, so it is important to try it for some time before giving up. That said, compounded meds are rarely, if ever, covered by insurance so it can be pricey. My cream cost $116.  \n\n\nIn good news, topical medications like this are very unlikely to cause side effects. I was recently diagnosed with THEM, but I have been diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy since 2018 and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome since 2012-ish.\n\nMy pain doc has no clue how to treat either THEM or SFN, but I have been getting ketamine infusions for the EDS and I describe it like hitting the \u201creset\u201d button on my brain.\n\nBasically, I have a bunch of nerve endings missing in my skin and my brain is like \u201c!!!!\u201d and trying to get me to please fix it, using pain to bring attention to it. But there is no way to fix it\u2026 and my brain gets all spun up into a tizzy\u2014like a laptop with way too many processes open\u2014just causing more pain from the existing pain.\n\nIV ketamine is like hitting that \u201crestart\u201d button so that all the lag-pain is resolved\u2026 until it builds up again (because there is no way to fix the underlying hardware issue). There is a bunch of stuff with sodium voltage gates, toll-like receptors, and NMDA receptors, but I am not a neuroscientist (that was my ex, lol).\n\nPersonally, the topical I have found the most helpful for me is midodrine, which works by constructing blood vessels. It is usually used to raise people\u2019s blood pressure, but I have found it amazing topically.\n\nBut I do not just have THEM, I also have reynaud\u2019s, as well as general autonomic dysfunction\u2026 and my THEM is primarily triggered by pressure (??).\n\nThe midodrine cream also seems to have helped my reynaud\u2019s?\n\nThe way I have explained it to my therapist is my body is like \u201cok, we delivered blood to the skin!\u201d and I am like \u201cexcuse me, but the distribution is a tad bit uneven and it HURTS??\u201d and my autonomic system is just like \u201cSKIN DELIVERY OF BLOOD HAS HAPPENED ALREADY NO RETURNS.\u201d\n\nBut when I constrict the blood vessels in my hands the icy cold patches in my upper arms resolve?\n\nAnyway, I hope some of my rambling was helpful. \ud83d\ude05 My THEM is \\*really\\* triggered by pressure too. Heat also sparks flares and I flare up every evening, but for me, pressure is what causes the really painful episodes. I have Raynaud's as well and I suspect I may have some type of small fiber neuropathy going on too. A rheumatologist told me I have benign hypermobility syndrome -- I wonder if there is some connection between THEM and hypermobility issues? My doctor ordered genetic testing through Invitae for SCN9A (I was negative for the mutation). My insurance covered the test, but I think it was something like $250 if you have to pay out of pocket. (I may be mistaken about that, though.)\n\nThe advice about trying to discern whether your THEM is mostly neurological or vascular is good! My doctor and I are also working on figuring this out. I use the topical compounded cream but it has become less effective for me over the past few years. \nI joined a Facebook group that has talked in-depth about their experiences going to Mayo for THEM. A lot of people said they were given the topical cream and aspirin. This is helpful. I have been on many of the drugs used for THEM for other conditions in the past but unfortunately cannot remember if any worked for my feet, just know to avoid gabapentin now, lol. \n\nI have a CBC quarterly so that is good to know. \n\nANA has always been negative. I think it is primary given family history and onset of symptoms in late high school but I could be mistaken. It feels very vascular personally. \n\nI have a history of migraine &amp; EDS, along with lots of the typical associated disorders. Do you know the aspirin dose? Yeah I am on ketamine nasal spray for migraine and it is $150+ :(. \n\nThe cream was $65 but no lidocaine. I have never seen this referenced anywhere. My doctor messaged me this morning saying they reconsidered genetic testing and want to pursue. \n\nHas anyone used genedx? What were costs like? I was told 325mg a day. the pressure triggered THEM (but also just whenever they feel like it too) and cycling with raynauds is definitely what i have experienced as well. \n\ndo your hands and feet sweat a lot, too? this has been a frustration for me lately. i will get out the shower, feet will cycle cold, get clammy, and then they bring the heat and then my feet feel gross. it happens in my hands as well, but i guess i notice it less because they are not just chillin' in mittens all day like my feet are in socks.\n\n&gt; The way I have explained it to my therapist is my body is like \u201cok, we delivered blood to the skin!\u201d and I am like \u201cexcuse me, but the distribution is a tad bit uneven and it HURTS??\u201d and my autonomic system is just like \u201cSKIN DELIVERY OF BLOOD HAS HAPPENED ALREADY NO RETURNS.\u201d\n\nplease stop describing my hands I also used Voltaren gel and lidocaine patches for pain relief fairly effectively. Very helpful!\n\nI was just at my pain medicine doctor this week and have to go tot he compounding pharmacy on Monday. Doctor told me she is happy to look over real scientific articles, not just ramblings of Dr Google.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I found this ( I know it is not the same, or as powerful, as a research paper.  But it was published in JAMA Dermatology back in 2015. It showed quite promising results from application of a midodrine topical cream in THEM patients. 11 of 12 in their sample show immediate relief.  \n\nThey used a 0.2% midodrine cream suspended in ( lotion as a carrier. I am ready to buy a mortar and pestle and grind the pills myself if that is what it takes. Just need the script for the pills. Should not take many for an 8oz bottle of lotion. That is the exact study I found, and I am on Medicaid, which pinches every last penny, and they covered the compounded midodrine for THEM 100%!\n\nThere are also some studies out there of success with a topical ketamine/amitryptaline cream for THEM.\n\nI had really bad side-effects with oral amitryptaline, but the cream does not show up in serum levels while still offering relief.\n\nThe Erythromelalgia Association has a good patient intro book that goes over the typical treatments, and it is a good jumping off point for knowing what search terms to use when trying to find evidence-based treatment options.\n\nOh, I am not sure how helpful this will be (depends on the cause of your THEM), but one supplement that was recommended to me for nerve pain was ALA, and it is helped a bit with calling everything down. \n\nOf course I am also on close to the maximum dose of gabapentin (it gives me aphasia and has fried my brain a bit, but not being on it makes me feel like all of my nerves have been stripped of their protective coating \ud83d\ude2c), plus ketamine, so I am kind of to the point where my pain only responds to the heavy stuff. Im going to be asking my pain doc about Prialt or a spinal cord stimulator, but first he needs to acknowledge my SFN and THEM are not \u201cfibromyalgia\u201d \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (my PCP is trying to call a meeting with him and my derm, so the derm can explain THEM to him, because he will not listen to me\u2026).\n\nBut topical lidocaine can also be helpful (you can get a 5% lotion OTC). Unfortunately I am lidocaine hyposensitive, so while I can have dental work done with a lidocaine injection as long as we wait for a while and I get a double dose, the topical stuff just does nothing for me. But it works well for most!", "Nostalgia Does anybody else reminisce about the times before you had erythromelalgia/raynauds phenomenon? Like how much easier life was where you could just pick up and go and not have that constant anxiety in the back of your mind worrying that you might experience a flare up during an important event, work, or when you are out trying to have fun with your friends/family. Or even trying to date and meet new people who have never heard of this rare condition. Idk, like I have just been really struggling lately thinking about how I am only 22 and I have to go my whole life with this disease, among other pre-existing mental health issues:( About three months ago, I had a dream that I was able to enjoy playing golf again.  By far the best dream Since I do not know when. :(((( I sometimes wish I could be as active as I used to be. I really miss the gym so I can empathize with ur experience It can even be harkening back to an earlier time when I was having symptoms but they were not so bad.\n\nI long for going back to my old job, scuba instructor. Working in a pool and/or the ocean for several hours every days was SOOO much better for my symptoms. yeah, absolutely. I miss being able to actually use my phone on my morning commute without my hands just being in agony, and I miss cooking anything that involves an oven. you are not alone &lt;3 Oh absolutely. It is a constant presence really, the anxiety and the symptoms. And there are moments when I remember what it is like, so poignantly, my life before THEM. I am a 29M and I have been dealing with this for about 4 years. Do not know if I have much advice except to say that the struggle for normalcy or normalishcy is worth it. And by that I mean experiment, and keep tabs on what triggers you. I ardently believe that we can have some control over our THEM. So do not give up! Keep trying to find those things that help (vitamins, certain foods, yoga, meditation etc) and find those things that make it worse. We likely cannot go back...to a life before THEM, but that does not mean our life is over by any means. There is lots out there to enjoy. As far as dating, I get the struggle. It is hard to find someone our own age who deals with something this consuming, but there are people out there who do. And who are struggling through similarly difficult things or have the capacity to understand and empathize with our situation. And there is just damn good people out there who are not going to care if your face, hands, feet, get all tomato-y. Good luck mate! Thank you so much for this! I cannot tell you how much this helps:) Yeah, I miss cycling. This all showed up last fall and I spent all summer trying to figure out how to stop my feet from getting overheated and numb while cycling. I would get 3 miles down the road and spend the rest of the ride unclipping and shaking my feet out.. Changed shoes, got my bike fit correctly, got more new shoes, etc. All to finally realize it is just not going to work. Time to find a new hobby, I guess. 3 miles is 4.83 km 3 miles is the length of approximately 21119.95 'Wooden Rice Paddle Versatile Serving Spoons' laid lengthwise. Yea. My entire life (I am an older teen but still) I had dreams of going to a high level in my sport. I cannot do this sport now because of my THEM. I have not had THEM for longer then 2 years. Mine is fast progressing. I remember feeling like I was good at something. Like I was talented. It is like reaching out for something that is being dragged away from you. Sorry I know this is not helpful. But I most certainly know what it feels like to be stuck in this hell wishing you could go back in time even if it was just for a day. This hit me deep. I have also had this condition for about 2 years now and it is gotten a little better but I still have days where I am constantly flaring, especially as the temperatures change. Some things I have found to help (even just slightly) is to take one 325 mg aspirin and 5ml of black seed oil in the mornings. I also noticed that after receiving the covid vaccines (both doses and the booster just yesterday) that my symptoms improved a little bit\u2014although Im not sure if it is some sort of placebo effect due to the fact that I  suspect my THEM/raynaud\u2019s is a long term side effect of having had covid back in Dec 2019-Jan 2020 while I was attending a large university. I hope this helps at all, and I am so so sorry for what ur going through, from one young adult to another. I am so sorry to hear this.  I do not have THEM, but daughter (20) has it and Raynaud\u2019s.  Her triggers are mostly stress, but exercise does trigger her.  I sincerely hope you get can get back on your bike soon! Aw, thank you!! Yoga has been working pretty great for me. I find I have to move slower through transitioning from being on the floor or bent over to standing since otherwise the lack of circulation can cause me to black out, but it is been a type of exercise I can do. And kayaking! So those might be good options for her! I am 60.  I have learned that everyone, yes, everyone has issues to deal with. No one has the perfect life as depicted on social media.  Like you, my daughter struggles with THEM and Raynaud\u2019s, along with two other autoimmune diseases.  She is a university study, works in a lab, is applying for internships and is active in a school club.  She has found that almost all her club friends have some kind of physical or mental health issue.  So, she is not alone.  Consider finding a group.  \n\nMy heart goes out to you.  I have three autoimmune diseases as well.  One is celiac disease which makes dining with friends hard.  I have learned to adapt.  I either host events or we find non-food things to do.  You will find your way.

It helps more than aloe but costs so much money, so I only use the cream when I really really need to instead of every time I flare.", "I need help. THEM is a bear Hello all, \n\nI have been diagnosed with systemic lupus for 5 years now, and I thought all the shit I went through with that disease was bad until I got diagnosed with THEM in October of this past years. The flares have been literally living hell. \n\nI get such severe, rapid onset this sucker drops me in my tracks so that I have to race towards any free bathtub in search for ice cold water. I am medical marijuana legal for my lupus and taking it has helped tremendously with my flares but it is only temporary. My feet are swollen, itchy, extremely hyper sensitive to pain and become so painful during these episodes that I cannot even walk without causing myself excruciating pain. \n\nI cannot wear socks, or shoes and most times I have had to drive places I have to wear flip flops ( it is winter here in NY) and blast the AC on them just to keep the burning pain at bay. I am allergic to gabapentin so I am currently trying amitriptyine.\n\nI am miserable. My whole day revolves around soaking and/or icing my feet and I cannot do anything I enjoy ( or do not enjoy, it is incredibly hard for me to even do housework) . I am 25. Please tell me there is more out there for treatment. I have seen a vein specialist and my rheumatologist for this issue and they do not seem to know anything about it. I am following with neurology but I cannot be seen my them for another month. Prednisone keeps my lupus at bay, and eliminates my THEM attacks so it is been the only thing keeping me alive. I know this one is not as popular (sounds effective, just not as researched I do not think) so this is why I will say it; sulodexide has been used for THEM and I have been looking into trying it soon. My 15 year old has it bad too. She is able to use gabapentin but it is only reducing the smaller episodes.  We are going to try Amitriptyline.  I asked her Dr after reading on here it helped some people.\n\nWe are interviewing for an inpatient program in March for pain.  I will let the page know if it goes through and we learn anything.\n\nJust asking but do you have any issues with your spine?  Someone else mentioned a tethered spine and I am going to see if we cannot get her spine checked out as well.\n\nI know how fucking tough you are because I see my daughter do it everyday.  I also know how isolating it feels.\n\nHave a good night Mr. Tough.  Hope we all find what we are looking for.\n\nKeep sharing the info. I am sorry you are going through so much suffering. If you are not already a member of the THEM group on facebook, I suggest you check it out. It is the largest group of THEM people I have seen and there is a lot of information shared on there every day. I am so sorry you are going through this first of all! \n\nI have THEM as well, mine is on my face and about 6 weeks ago I was in a miserable place. I had to keep fans on and ice 24 hours a day and could not do anything without flaring up, I was really close to having a nervous breakdown because of the pain. I am also in the process of getting to a neurologist, rheumatologist ordered blood work but knows nothing about THEM. \n\nI have seen a cardiologist, immunologist, allergist, rheumatologist, two dermatologist (trying to figure out the cause of the THEM) I was at my breaking point when my husband looked up acupuncturists around our area and we found one who is very knowledgeable and certified, I figured \u201chell I am in so much pain\u201d- it could not hurt to try this right? \n\nI am now about to go for my 7th treatment and this has been the only thing that has given me any relief. I have less flares, less intensity and it is also reduced my Raynaud\u2019s attacks down to almost nothing. Before acupuncture I had been in constant excruciating pain for an entire year without ceasing. I know it is not for everyone and it might not work the same for everyone either but it is worth a try if there is anyway you can. It is sometimes covered by insurance but more often it is not, for me the cost of copays for all these doctors and tests with our insurance is far higher than the cost of acupuncture. I cannot say enough good things about acupuncture. I have to keep my bedroom cold and my feet sticking out from under the blanket with a fan pointed on them.  And still I have problems sleeping from the pain.\n\nMy specialist started me on mexiletine and few months ago and that has helped tremendously. I apply lidocaine patches (4$ strength is OTC available at drug stores or WalMart) to the bottom of my feet and that helps too.\n\nTHEM can be so maddening because what works well for you might not work at all for me, and vice versa.

I have done acupuncture in the past for my lupus and it always helps for a short while. It is so tough. I am single and 25 and although I am blessed with parents who help me whenever I can, my medical bills, bloodwork, medical marijuana, copays, medications just bury me. I can barely keep up every month. I stopped doing acupuncture in the past because I could not afford the extra $200/ month but something I will seriously consider again.

No one really realizes how expensive it is to have chronic illness until you are there. \n\nMy husband and I pay for insurance and have coverage through his work, the plan we can afford has a 10k deductible for us so we never reach it and our plan only pays like 20% until we get there... so for years I put off even dealing with my health and just tried natural over the counter type solutions, fish oil, b12 etc but it finally got to a boiling point where I could not ignore what was happening to my body and I have had to head back to doctors, tests and all the crazy expenses that go with it.

I have always had this problem, and my mom even took a six year old me to the doctor because of it. My hands and feet sometimes get so swollen that I cannot walk or write. The worst is when I get in/out of hot tubs, stand in the heat, and switch temperatures quickly. I used to take vitamin B pills for it, but I never noticed it helping much. I wrote it off until now, thinking it was just some weird thing my body did. It just hurts so badly, and it is been really bad recently. It was a lot better when I was on a low-carb diet/exercising more, so I am worried it could be erythromelalgia and caused by diabetes. Is this a common relation? Because THEM is characterized by abnormal circulation in the extremities, some ( but actual research like ( and ( suggests that it is actually pretty rare.  However, THEM is known to occur secondary to autoimmune disorders like MS and lupus, so if you are T1D, that piece might fit too.  \n\n\nTo answer your question in the title, I was diagnosed by a neurologist specializing in autonomic disorders. Ok, I will definitely have to talk to my doctor. Thank you! I had burning pain symptoms for *years* with totally normally blood glucose levels.\n\nI went through steroid injection treatments for unrelated back problems. A known possibly adverse effect of such steroid injections is damage to the pancreas that can cause T2 diabetes. And though my HbA1c and blood glucose were normal just prior to the steroid treatment within 6 months I was diagnosed with diabetes with BG of 400+ and HbA1c of 12.5.\n\nSo, of course, nearly every doctor I had seen since then pointed to my foot pain and said it was diabetic neuropathy. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI was diagnosed with THEM about 18 months after the diabetes diagnosis.  It took an offhand comment from my elderly mother asking how my feet got so sunburned. Odd, I thought. I work nights and sleep all day. I had certainly not been out in the sun recently. I had certainly noticed the pain before but never really paid much attention to any redness in the areas that hurt. I started reading about any possible link between redness and the burning pain. Et voil\u00e0\u202f! I found THEM.\n\nSadly patients far too often have to find the possible diagnosis and then search for a doctor who has any familiarity with THEM to confirm the diagnosis. That was my case. I found a local vascular medicine specialist who was listed on the Physician Directory of The Erythromelalgia Association's website. A flare started during my first office visit. It was a rather perverse fascination for both of us as we watched but made the diagnosis easy.\n\nWithout such fortuitous discovery of the condition by the patient the \"normal\" pathway of diagnosis is to go from doctor to doctor for *years* without finding any diagnosis. And then through some chain of events the patient gets put in contact with a doctor familiar with the condition. \n\nI just ready an article about a patient who went through the diagnosis process the hard way. He saw about 12 doctors in 18 months, all of whom were stumped. One specialist referred him to another and so on. Eventually he was referred to the world-renowned The Johns Hopkins Hospital and their specialists were stumped.  Only when another doctor at Johns Hopkins overheard some discussion in an elevator about this patient's case were the necessary connections made to put him in front of a doctor who was able to diagnosis THEM. \n\nDoctor chat in an elevator.  Yeah.  That is what it takes sometimes. Crazy What can be done against it ? Is it curable? There are MANY different treatments of varying efficacy. Unfortunately it is a bit of a trial by error process, particularly with medications. A medication that is effective for one person may be entirely ineffective for another patient.\n\nCommonly prescribed oral medications include aspirin, Vitamin B12, mexiletine, amitriptyline, and others I am forgetting. Topical treatments such as lidocaine patches, or skin creams infused with drugs such as ketamine or midodrine might be ordered. \n\nOther lifestyles strategies help. Avoid heat, including strenuous exercise. Use fans to circulate air. Use cool water soaks but NEVER ice cold as THEM patients sometimes overdo this leading to frostbite! Go barefoot. \n\nSome patients find flares are provoked by some particular food or environmental exposure. Avoiding those triggers can help. Unfortunately a trigger might be something as basic as taking a warm bath or shower.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCurable?  In a word, maybe.\n\nIn some THEM patients the condition is secondary to some other medical condition. For these patients it might help to think of THEM as a symptom of their other disease, though that is grossly oversimplifying it. If doctors can identify whatever that other disease is and cure it then the THEM often resolves itself.\n\nSo what other disease might cause THEM?  The most commonly cited are myeloproliferative disorders. And what are those?  That is a medical mouthful to describe certain kinds of blood cancers. If such a cancer is identified and cured then the patient's THEM may resolve itself. So THEM patients usually are monitored with regular blood tests to look for signs of a myeloproliferative disorder. \n\nAnother possibility is an auto-immune disorder/ Just as type I diabetes can be caused by the body's own immune system mistakenly attacking the pancreas, THEM can be caused if the body's own immune system mistakenly attacks certain kinds of nerves. THEM patients might have blood tests for signs of elevated immune system activity. If such abnormal activity is found then further (rather expensive) tests might be run to try to identify if the patient is making antibodies known to damage nerve cells. If so there are treatments but that might not be an outright cure.\n\nHowever the majority of THEM patients do not have a myeloproliferative or autoimmune disorder. Sometimes THEM resolves on its own eventually. It just goes away as mysteriously as it came on. For others it is a chronic condition that never goes away. You may be helping someone very much. I will contact you again tomorrow. Thanks dearly. Hey me again, I have based upon my research made the list as in following\n\n1. Immunologist\n2. Haemtologist\n3.rheumatologist\n4.

I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and highly suspect THEM based on symptoms and photos. I guess THEM is a common neurological manifestation of hypermobility and collagen disorders. I had no idea. Just thought I would share a journal article and ask around!  It is not always listed on common issues related to EDS and hypermobility. Usually they list things like POTs, Raynaud's, MCAS.  Study:  Oh wow.... a rheumatologist *just* diagnosed me with a hypermobility syndrome and THEM! I am going to give this a read \u2014 thanks for sharing. Me Your rheum diagnosed THEM? That is great. I thought only neuro or vascular did it. I need to schedule. Yep! So, first I went to my primary care doctor. She did not know what was going on, but referred me to rheumatology. While I was waiting for the rheumatology appointment, I saw a dermatologist for an unrelated thing. I asked him about my burning feet/hands/face and showed him pictures of my flares. He asked a bunch of questions and then said, \"this is erythromelalgia.\" I saw the rheumatologist the next week and she confirmed that diagnosis and also diagnosed the hypermobility syndrome, which explains a lot of my joint and tendon issues over the years. I actually have an upcoming appointment with a neurologist too because I am also having a lot of nerve issues (tingling, balance issues, numbness). I keep thinking it all has to be connected somehow, but who knows. Bodies are mysterious! A Rheumatologist is who finally diagnosed me, too. She was the third Rheumatologist I had seen, along with two neurologists, a dermatologist, and several primary care doctors. Finally, I found someone who will listen. Okay, so help me out here...what is the difference between \"classical EDS\" and hEDS? And if I suspect I have a form of EDS but my Rheumatologist says it is not helpful to know if I do or not from a treatment standpoint, which type of specialist would I even consult and how? A geneticist? A vascular doctor? \n\nI plan to share this paper with my Rheumatologist just for her to know about. I appreciate you sharing here on our THEM sub, OP! I have undiagnosed joint pain but I am pretty sure I am not hyper mobile. Though my jaw does get stuck out of place every day usually a few times Maybe.  The physiatrist recommended I be evaluated.  I do not have many features of EDS, but might fall into one of the subtypes.  Not sure.\n\nI am a 48yo man and can easily bend my legs to touch the sole of my feet to my face.  I did that during a doctor's appt to show that it was not moving my hips that caused pain, but nevertheless I have sharp pain in the hip area. The doctor thought it was significant. Geneticist/genetic counselor That is unbelievably expensive. Yeah all connected! So hypermobility is not just about joints, the issue is defective collagen. Collagen provides structure and support to basically everything, including blood vessels and organs. So, things with blood vessels can get really wacky and strange, and autonomic functions can go a little haywire. I am still learning but my Ehlers-Danlos diagnosis explains so much about all my varied issues. Not necessarily and it is the answer to their question. Insurance should cover it or they can help you fight to get it to. There are also organizations that can help you get it covered or ways to pay for it (if vascular EDS is suspected there is a specific organization just for that). There is also invitae and places like them that you can order testing yourself or they can connect you with a genetic counselor and the self pay rates are not bad at all. (Side note: invitae testing does not cover the gene for classical-like EDS.) Also almost all places have self pay discounts. Thanks for this! I am still learning about hypermobility. I was really surprised when the rheumatologist mentioned it because it was not remotely on my radar. I just mentioned some joint pain and clunking! She had me do a bunch of mobility things and said I have a high Brighton score. She did not seem too interested in any further testing, but did give me some good tips about exercise and strengthening muscles that support joints. I am glad you found someone familiar with THEM. I think I got pretty lucky because the two doctors I met in quick succession were both knowledgeable about the condition \u2014 I know that is NOT the case for most folks. I was initially diagnosed by a physiatrist and then it was confirmed by a rheumatologist. (They are iffy about whether I am classic EDS or classic-like EDS.) It is been over 10 years, but I am finally going to see a geneticist for other things, so maybe they will check what type of EDS I really am while they are at it. I have cEDS (or classic-like, the docs debate back and forth), diagnosed 13(?) years ago - but only after 8 years of testing/misdiagnosis circus. Of course.\n\nI have also had THEM for a long time, but only recently got officially diagnosed. I have been hypermobile all my life was was officially diagnosed with JHS about 8 years ago after injuring myself doing very normal activities and having super slow recovery.  I have POTS &amp; Raynaud's in addition to the THEM but was told a few years back that POTS could be caused by SFN which is fairly common in JHS/EDS... my THEM was not as prevalent then as it is now, so did not know about the connection.\n\nThank you for the info! Hey, never saw your comment to my OP until now. So hEDS and classical EDS are very similar in terms of clinical presentation, yes. I was lucky enough to find a new primary care doctor in my insurance network who has hEDS herself (!!) and confirmed my Diagnosis via extensive clinical history, office evaluations, etc. But genetic testing would help rule out classical, if I want to pursue. It does not change the treatment plan, though. \n\nI found this doctor by joining my home state's EDS Facebook Group. There are a bunch of Facebook Groups dedicated to each U.S. state, so if you live there, try doing keyword search for your state, or state initials, with \"EDS\" or \"Ehlers Danlos\". \n\nOtherwise, the EDS Society has a directory on website of doctors who know about and can help diagnose EDS. Note Some do not take insurance, but some do ... You will have to check.\n\nGood luck!", "Is this a erythromelalgia flair up or a mixture of it and hives ? My face started first and then 10 mins later my knees went too  Do not mind my Ugly face I know I look 12 \ud83d\ude02 but I am actually 19 Also as you scroll across you will see how it spread on my face like how quickly. All happened randomly when I was sad on my bed. Depressing times :( Cannot say that its 100% that. But I can say that is similar to how my THEM affects my face.  It is at least worth including in the box of symptoms as probably related. Or maybe I really am allergic to something like a relatively serious one. As I had one yesterday that was according to the doctor I could of had my throat and lips swell up. He thought I reacted to the cream but he did not bother to ask me afterwards which is silly cuz I think it is pretty serious.

Would love any thoughts or advice you can provide. \n\nadditional note: both cymbalta and gabapentin reduced the number of flares I experience each day and prevented neuropathy. Frankly, the bad far outweighed the good and I was far too miserable to go on with those medications. \n\nPlease let me know if you need more info! What was your experience with magnesium? I hated Gabapentin with a passion, but cymbalta has been fairly helpful.  Tramadol has helped me but many doctors may not want to prescribe it because it is an opioid. Mine may not be as severe as yours, but weeks after COMPLETELY DISCONTINUING the use of Advil, I have had very minimal flare-ups. I forgot I had THEM for a minute. Are you still taking it at all? Honestly I did not notice any difference with it  I am still taking one a day! That is so crazy that stopping Advil helped you so much. I think I am going to stop taking everything pretty soon. Any ideas why stopping advil helped? Not exactly a treatment per se but when I do not drink alcohol I do not really get flare ups, and if I do, they are mild. Something to consider if you drink. Same for me with Advil! I am fine while it is in my system, but once it wears off I will flare later that evening. Red, burning, itchy hands and bottoms of feet. Like clockwork. Try looking up vitamins that regulate blood pressure. I take Cal-Mag Zinc pills and they seem to do the trick. If those type of blood pressure regulators do not work then your THEM is most likely caused by something else (I believe it can be vascular or neurological?)\n\nEdit: another option I have heard is compression gloves, socks, etc I cannot drink at all, unfortunately. Even the \u201cnon-alcoholic\u201d drinks with less than 0.5% alcohol cause flare ups for me Gabapentin was created by the devil lmao I hate it so much Ha !   The devil WISHES he was evil enough to invent gabapentin.  \ud83d\ude09 You know what... I do not know. I discontinued Advil but began taking Ubrelvy for migraines periodically and then recently had my first Ajovy shot. They are CGRP inhibitors and I wonder if that helped with the THEM as well.  \n\n\nThe period of time between discontinuing Advil and starting the migraine meds though I had no real THEM complaints either. I used to have multiple daily flare ups that were publicly embarrassing but now it seems like obvious triggers like wine are the only thing that makes it happen.  \n\n\nNot a doctor but I would still say discontinuing every medication is a good choice unless you need it, so you can narrow it down. It really seems like Advil was the culprit for me personally.  \n\n\nI hope that helps somewhat. I am still figuring this out myself and trying with my doctors.", "Could this be THEM?

Even in the top photo, you can see how RED my photo is, despite being blurry as heck: (\n\nNinja edit: also, standing is a bizarre trigger that makes me think there is something else going on here. Actually, according to both my own experience and the Erythromelalgia patient guide, standing is a trigger.  I am diagnosed. \n\n( Unfortunately, with THEM, the best we can say is \"its possible\".  There is so many similar issues that its usually diagnosed by excluding all the other options, or by finding the underlying cause such as lupus.  In my case, I have had the best luck with getting diagnosed with THEM via a rheumatologist as they see secondary THEM with autoimmune diseases.  A dermatologist who specializes in rheumatic diseases like cutaneous lupus can also be helpful.\n\nIn my experience, all I can say is, \"maybe\".  I have primary THEM and mine just went through its \"sudden dramatic awakening\" so I had a variety of different skin weirdness as the THEM \"woke up\".  Depending on the random noise of the universe, it will show up in unusual ways.  \n\n\nWhat symptoms come along with the redness and pain? Is there itching? Burning? does it feel like standing on broken glass?

Starting in my mid 30s it went from being a mild annoyance in my feet after a shower and irritated ears to full blown 'man-on-fire' syndrome (face, ears, hands, feet, ears, eyes, shoulders, neck, even my scalp!).  That said, standing was always a trigger for swelling and pain in my feet.  I was stuck in minimum wage jobs and they were an absolute nightmare of pain by the end of my shifts. Emily, \n\nYou appear to have erythromelalgia.  That is based upon your description of the pain, the triggering events, and the appearance of your skin in the photos.\n\nI am formally diagnosed with THEM and have had similar, though not as severe, symptoms for years.\n\nAs the ( notes THEM is most commonly bilateral, affecting both sides of the body, but can be unilateral.  I have both, with bilateral presentation on my feet but unilateral involvement of only my right hand. Please also consider seeking an evaluation from a physician familiar with THEM.  THEM is rare. Incidence rate is not certain, but something like 1 in 100,000 is an often cited figure. If that holds there are only about 3300 of us THEM patients in the entire United States.  MANY doctors have never had a patient with THEM.\n\nI oft post the link to the ( The doctors on that list are experienced in helping THEM patients. I had symptoms for something like 9 years, bouncing from one doctor to another. One 20 minute appointment with a vascular specialist I found on that list and I had a diagnosis.  I was very fortunate to have a flare start right there in front of his eyes which made the diagnosis easy for a trained eye. Look for a diagnosis in small fiber neuropathy, Hashimotos and/or pre diabetes. SFN diagnosed via skin punch biopsy. Hashimotos is diagnosed via any amount of  TG and TPO antibodies.Pre diabetes is best diagnosed via oral glucose tolerance test 2 hours. Glucose should never go above 139 mg/dL, because if it does, then that is pre diabetes. Pre diabetes causes SFN. Also do not let any doctor convince you that fasting glucose or HBA1C is accurate enough at diagnosing pre diabetes cause it is not. I cannot emphasize how essential the oral glucose tolerance test is at diagnosing pre diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance.\n\nA lot of tests come out normal for patients who are sick because the proper tests are never performed and conventional ranges tend to be big, while functional ranges are more narrow. The narrow ranges tend to constitute a healthy individual. For example, conventional ranges for glucose levels are generally 60-99 mg/dL when it should really be 85-99 mg/dL.\n\nA good amount of THEM can be caused by pre diabetes. \n\nBtw these doctor rarely perform these tests so you have to ask for them, and sadly you may have to be pushy cause you might get back lash.\n\nThen if it turns out your positive for Hashimotos or prediabetes then with lifestyle changes, you can get better management of your THEM. I was tested for diabetes- negative. I had different doctors telling me the swelling will go down and goes away over time. But I knew something was wrong and now it is so much worse. I notice the redness and soon came the swelling and progressed quickly over night. Talking showers flares it up especially the blotches. They do not itch at all, they just appear. In the last photo is my foot after being in cold water, still has blotches and swelling. My leg foot actually never goes back to normal it stays a little bit swollen even in the cold. My nurse called today and I got diagnosed for erythromelalgia and have an appt with neurologist waiting for a call  toamrrow. I have problems sleeping at night due to it being so hot. Fans and my window helps a little but summer is on its way. When I flare up I get a blotchy of red, purplish even in cold water. Elevating does not help anymore. Compression socks hurt and I swell right through them. A diagnosis is a first step.  \n\nThere may be more tests but hopefully there will be options for medications to try. The first one might not work. Maybe not the second or the third. It might take several tries.  Do not give up. It is a process of trial and error.\n\nOn a bad night I use a few strategies. Fans, keeping my bare feet out from under sheets or blankets, elevating legs on a bolster pillow, and applying ( all help a little bit. Combined it helps quite a lot.\n\nI basically have given up wearing socks. Elevate my legs as much as possible. Keep showers brief and the water as cool as reasonably possible. \n\nHang in there. I have this and unfortunately the doctors are convinced it is idiopathic hives RE: Rarity -- For many people in the US, going to a doctor is a non-option due to the costs involved. THEM can also be a very minor issue for some people, meaning that they do not even think to get it checked.  The gene that helps to differentiate this disease against others was only very recently discovered. So this illness was frequently misdiagnosed as lupus, hives, and other unusual/atypical presentations of more serious diseases. (As an example My grandmother was diagnosed as ANA negative lupus instead, but that was in 1974.  Modern med would have told her she does not have lupus. But her diagnosis is counted as seronegative lupus because that is how science works. We cannot assume what is not codified through research and examinations.)\n\nLong story short:  That incidence rate is an extreme undercount.  As genetic testing becomes more prevalent, we will definitely see that number rise.  The gene responsible for the inherited version of the disease can be traced all the way back to neanderthals.  Neanderthal dna only spread to certain regions outside of the US, but because of the way the US population has multiple ancestors from multiple regions and because this genetic change is autosomal dominant, this gene \\*should\\* be much wider spread than has been reported.\n\nAlso:  Population count is not the same as statistical probability.  Basically for those reasons above and because \"the whole of the united states\" is not the pool of probability to begin with. Has any one experience the swelling in there feet that gets so bad that your toes start to tingle and pinch? Like pins and needs to your toes. Especially at night. Thanks for the advice. I was tested for lupus and etc for autoimmune. All came back negative. I do get burning especially the bottom of my feet, warm, pins and needles. I have no problems with itching. The swelling is painful and burns. Standing for a short time triggers my symptoms and hard to stand without having to sit. I tried elevating but takes too long. I tried sitting on my bedroom floor and putting my feet up and makes them worse or does not work. I am not sure if I am ding the elevating right or not. But I have elevated in the past and it worked but not anymore idk why. a good example of raising your feet.  Sitting in your computer chair with your feet on top of your computer tower which is on the floor.\n\nSometimes though it might not be enough.  It depends on temperature and activity and the random fluctuations of the universe. This is really interesting because my THEM flares got much worse after I fell off my keto/low carb diet last fall. I only did keto/low carb from Jan to September 2020, but once I reintroduced carbs and slowly went back to 75-100+ carbs a day for the last 6 months, my body has been falling apart. Including daily THEM flares on feet and hands every evening. And hypoglycemic episodes (headache, flu like malaise, fatigue) if I wait more than 2 hours between meals. I did plant base keto and it did help my neuropathy/THEM a bit then I later stopped doing it. After stopping my symptoms continued to progress. But then I found out that the best way to manage diabetes neuropathy is with the following: low fat (10-15% total calories from fat), low-to moderate protein, and high carbohydrates. However no process foods, eating only plants, no animal products, eating fruits and vegetables that are low in the glycemic index. Also not eating past 6:00 or 7:00pm (intermittent fasting) After making these changes my neuropathy/THEM has significantly got better. My feet rarely flare now, the neuropathy/THEM stopped progressing, I can walk farther without pain and with little to no breaks.\n\nI wrote more about it on this post down here:\n\n", "Anyone else in the same boat?

It probably seemed like it was taking a long time, too long, but you made it.\n\nI hope that your doctors can help you try various medications and therapies until you find something that works. And then there are probably going to be several tests to check for underlying conditions that might be causing your THEM. Thank you for the response! It is definitely been a journey of the unknown. Doctors would take one look at my pictures and said idk, swelling will go away in a few months, or could not help me. I am so glad that I found a doctor who was willing to do further testing and turned out to be a rare condition they do not normally hear about. I have my neurologist appt. next week and see what they say and then get back to rhemotology and hopefully when they talk they can find a solution or start treatment of some sort. Probably more testing. Definitely bizarre and I do not know what to except when I walk into my doc appts.

That is terrible! \n\nThere are MANY medicines that can be tried.  \n\nIt *really* is trial and error.

After such a struggle to get diagnosed you really deserve to have some things go your way. Thank for the support, I appreciate it it is been frustrating with these doctors here, I hope this one is willing to listen. And if not I will go somewhere else just like the last one. In the 13th photo It looks like bruises but that is what my feet look like in the cold sometimes. But mostly they look purple. I was in the doc room and my feet were purple bc I was sitting on the bed with my feet dangling and I did have some red and purple blotches still there but she still would not listen or look at any of my lab testing. I am not sure if this is a symptom of erythromelalgia but when the house is over 72 degrees and I did not know, my body reacts like its 90 degrees and I feel like I have to pass out.

I have the exact same as you but doctors told me it was hives and I could not possibly have erythromelalgia cuz it is so rare they said it was hives cuz of the blotches you mentioned The 4th one is exactly what I had and she said the yellow bits around the bits under your knee indicate it is hives. I also had the very red knees too that burned but they also told me it only effects my knees to it cannot be however I have showed them pictures of my feet before and hands but noooo. I even tried to get a referral to see a dermatologist and they said no and I said well if it is hives can I see an allergist and once again they declined saying hives is not caused by allergy\u2019s which is bs It could be hives from some other condition but idk. Yes, when I first started seeing doctors they said hives or rash. I started blood work for autoimmune, rhemotology, and so on all came back normal. So they had to think of other specialists to see. They did not take it seriously which is frustrating for a year and two months of pain. In the fourth picture is after a shower and standing.

And if so, how long did it take to glean results, if any? Thanks in advance for replies!

Gluten is one of my triggers. It is an intolerance I developed with age. So I avoid it. Sometimes sugar and corn trigger me as well but not always. Alcohol is a big trigger for me also. Avoiding gluten helps me but does not stop it totally. Thank you for your reply (and best wishes managing your symptoms!) I have actually been gf for a decade and was asking for my teen daughter who eats like a teen (and has erythromylagia).

While it is fine for some I really began wondering if anyone with erythromylagia has benefited as well. Thanks for your encouragement! Yes, that is why i went carnivore: the ultimate elimination diet . 70% improvement after 3 months!!\nNo eggs, no dairy, no chicken, no porc, no spices, no tuna. So basically beef and organ meats and sometimes cod liver  or sardines and salmon. Sounds drastic, but erythermalgia was destroying my life. Three suicide attempts. It was either trying everything or die.", "Did you acquire genetic testing? Any advice? I posted here back in January after my diagnosis and you all were wonderful. Thank you for that. My initial diagnosis came from a dermatologist who is not familiar enough with Erythromelalgia &amp; is not interested in trying treatments for it. I am on aspirin since January and it is been helping. Today I thankfully saw a geneticist (the Derm reluctantly sent the referral) and he said he will send in a requisition for genetic testing. I am wondering what to do if I do not get approved? I am 21 years old &amp; just looking for a plan of action. What specialty of doctors do you guys see? I have still got some underlying health issues that possibly triggered this to sort out &amp; no one else in my family seems to have THEM. I would just like to figure out what is wrong inside my body, ya know? First - I am not a doctor. I have THEM. I have an undergrad degree in genetics. I have not done genetic testing for my THEM.\n\nIf no one else in your family has THEM (or similar symptoms but at undiagnosed) it is *possible* but less likely that your THEM is genetic. Inherited forms of THEM are called Primary THEM. FWIW, primary THEM is inherited in an *autosomal dominant* pattern, meaning only one parent has to pass on a bad copy of the gene for you to have the condition.\n\nOtherwise, non-inherited forms are Secondary THEM, occurring as the result of some other condition. Sometimes identifying and treating that other condition can resolve the THEM.\n\nSo those other health conditions may very well be linked to your THEM.  Many conditions are often seen in patients with secondary THEM such as Autonomic Nervous System disorders, autoimmune disorders, POTS, Ehrler's Danlos Syndrome, Small Fiber Neuropathy, or myeloproliferative disorders (e.g., chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera) among other things.\n\nIf your dermatologist is unfamiliar with THEM you *really* need to seek care from another specialist. At a bare minimum blood work must be done to rule out myeloproliferative disorders, which are blood cancers.\n\nSpecialists who are sometimes familiar with THEM include dermatologists, rheumatologists, Vascular Medicine specialists, and Neurologists among others.\n\nThe Erythromelalgia Association maintains a ( with the names of doctors who are familiar with THEM. I suggest searching your area to find a doctor familiar with THEM. IMHO finding a doctor familiar with THEM is more important than the exact specialty. They may need to work in collaboration with other specialists to find the best treatment option for you. Mine clearly runs in my family so I never bothered. I would make sure they have ruled out all underlying causes of secondary THEM. Much easier to treat those! \n\nThe gene affected is known, so hopefully it will not be difficult or too expensive. I am wondering if a 23andMe would show the alteration\u2026 The lab used for my kids test had a flat fee if insurance did not cover it and I think it was 250.00 but our insurance covered it.\n\nIf it does not put you in financial extremes, I say do it so you can have that answered.  But that is just me. From my research primary THEM does not have to be inherited it can be of course but sporadic primary THEM also exists It does not... yet...  it does not seem like it can, a lot of my genes in scn9a were 'not genotyped' in my raw dna.  The ones that were though, upon deep digging, came back \"more research needed\" instead of an explicit yes.\n\nI have been referred to a geneticist, but it is going to be some time before I see them. That is a shame. I guess they cannot be seen as giving medical advice.. No they are just booked solid for a ways out Oh I meant 23andMe 23 and me does very different type of genetic testing than a medical grade laboratory would do. Thier testing is not comprehensive and when they do report out variants in genes, it is usually only the common ones. Your best bet it waiting for the geneticist :) What blood work beyond a CBC is usually done in a typical workup? A CBC is mostly looking to see if you have signs of a myleoprolieferative disease. A sharply elevated white blood cell and/or platelet count would be such a sign.\n\nThere are some auto-immune conditions to rule out.  An elevated ANA level (a cheap and easy test) indicates a possible auto-immune issue that *could* be causing your THEM. *Maybe*. A positive test is not a guarantee that your case is auto-immune.\n\nBut *if* you have an elevated ANA level then there are some more exotic (read as expen$$$ive) tests to try to identify if a particular auto-antibody is present that is associated with THEM. TS-HDS or FGFR3  are a couple such auto-antibodies that could be a sign of a root cause of THEM in some patients.\n\nTests for TS-HDS or FGFR3 are not commonly done in a typical hospital lab. Testing would likely require sending a blood sample to a research university hospital such as the Mayo Clinic or Washington University - St Louis. If such a test is positive then treatment with IvIg infusions may be warranted. I had a negative ANA in 2018 and 2019 and my docs kind of gave up on the autoimmune path after a host of other blood tests (but not those) came back clean. \n\nI am diagnosed with hEDS, migraine, raynauds, dysautonomia, gastroparesis, and PCOS\u2026. So my involvement with the healthcare system has been long and varied. Spent 6 wks at Mayo in 2019. Even saw a vascular cardiologist that was like \u201chuh, no idea\u201d about my feet. \n\nThat is helpful to know though re tests - I am at a major academic medical center now with my care that ships to Mayo\u2019s lab and am quite lucky in that regard. \n\nDo you have any thoughts about genetic testing for primary THEM? I have read it can be helpful for targeting meds that effect the sodium channel, like nifedipine etc. \n\nI appreciate the information. You could repeat the ANA but is probably pointless.  Your history indicates that you have been dealing with THEM long enough that if it was not a positive ANA test in 2019 it is unlikely to have changed.\n\nThough I have a genetics background I do not jump to genetic testing right away. Only about 15% of THEM patients have a recognized genetic mutation that is known to cause THEM. \n\nSo, if you test and test negative what treatment path would you take? And if you test positive how would that information change what you do going forward? Would it affect reproductive decisions? Might that information help other family members be diagnosed earlier?\n\nIf there are other family members with similar symptoms the genetic causes are more likely. If not, it is still possible that yours has a genetic cause. There are *de novo* mutations and since the SCN9a mutations can cause THEM in an autosomal dominant pattern it only takes one mutation to cause the condition.\n\nAs far a helping choose a treatment...  I am a bit ambivalent. THEM already requires a bit of a trial and error investigation to find the best treatment options. And frankly sodium channel blocker drugs, which is what a positive genetic test would tend to highlight as a treatment option., are already high on the list of medications to try. I am not sure that genotype confirmation adds a lot to the treatment picture.  \ud83d\ude23 Neat thanks for the info. I have two direct family members (parent and sibling) with symptoms. That certainly gives rise to the assumption that you may have a genetic variant. Genetic testing may provide information about likelihood you or your siblings (both the one with symptoms and any siblings without such symptoms) could pass the condition on to any children you may have. \n\nIf you have siblings, kids, nieces, or nephews who are not showing symptoms establishing that you have a genetic variant could emphasize the need to closely monitor them for any symptoms.\n\nAnd as I (DISCLAIMER: I am still not a doctor!) speculated, you *might* fare better with a sodium channel blocker. Mexiletine seems to be a favored option based upon patient reports.", "Trying to find answers I (21F) have had flare ups maybe once a month or so (a lot more in the summer) on my feet. \n\nThe soles of my feet go red and blotchy - these red/purple patches are incredibly sore to the point where some days I cannot walk without tearing up. It feels like I have bruises that burn all over my feet and honestly my feet are so so hot when this happens! It usually occurs when my feet have been too hot in a shoe, after lots of walking around and especially after swimming or having my feet wet for long periods of time. I have been to doctors and pharmacy\u2019s and they cannot seem to put a finger on it. I have tried creams and all kinds of lotions and potions and the only thing that seems to help is numbing cream and ice water to take the pain away so I can go to work. I have been hunting around online and this seems to be a possible answer? The flare ups typically last over a week, getting a little sore the day before (so I know it is coming) and then super painful for a few days until it gradually tapers off. \n\nIt is ruined holidays, festivals and numerous other things because I physically cannot walk in shoes or it just gets worse. \n\nDoes this sound correct ? I am thinking of presenting the idea and some of my research to a doctor? It is been going on for over 8 years now and I am so sick of it. I think it is worth making an appointment with a neurologist to discuss the possibility of THEM.  Take pictures of your feet when they are flaring and bring them with you. Second the advice to document your flare ups with lots of photos on your phone. Also...is it something that is worse in warmer weather? Is it worse in the late afternoon, evening and night versus the morning? Does it improve with elevation? Start documenting all of this and get yourself into a specialist...maybe book both a neurologist and a rheumatologist. I was actually diagnosed by a rheumatologist after years of fighting with bad specialists who knew nothing and did not help me at all.  (20F) I am late to this but omg.. It sounds like I could have written this. I experience the EXACT same symptoms as you like down to every last detail. I have never met someone who understands what it is like so this is crazy for me. It always is worst in the summer and I totally ruins my vacations sometimes because of the swollen painful hot red patches on the soles of my feet. I had the worst flare of my life this summer and taking 800mg of Advil helped a lot. Cannot believe I never tried ibuprofen until then! Give it a shot next time! Elevation helps tons too, when I flare up it is painful for my to put my feet below my knees so I always lie on my back with my feet up against the wall. Also mine gets triggered by my feet getting hot in shoes as well! Thanks for sharing I feel less lonely now", "1 Week Payday Loan | Fast &amp; Easy Process - Bad Credit OK ", "Meds and Side Effects? My vascular doc and primary have spoken to me about possible medications to treat my THEM. I have used Voltaren on my hands when I flare and it helps for a little while, but they are getting worse, unfortunately. \n\nFirst, of course is the lidocaine pill. How have some of you fared with it? I tend to have a sensitive stomach so I am worried about that one.  What side effects have you experienced? Was it worth it?\n\nMy primary doc was talking about biologics (no name specified). The term worries me because they usually mean expensive. If any of you have tried it, it love to hear your experiences. By \"lidocaine pill\" I assume you are referring to Mexiletine.  That is an oral analogue of lidocaine.\n\nMexiletine helped me.  It has a short half life and clears my system quickly. If I forget a dose or am late taking a dose I really notice it.\n\nI have also used lidocaine patches, available over the counter at most pharmacies, on my feet. That helps me sleep when my feet are burning. Be sure to look for lidocaine. Most cheaper patches have menthol and not lidocaine as the active ingredient.\n\nLidocaine and Mexiletine are Sodium Ion Channel Blockers. These ion channels are holes in the cell membrane that open to let sodium into the cell. It is this inrush of sodium that triggers the nerve to send a pain signal. In many THEM patients there is an abnormality in how the sodium ion channels in nerve cells work. The channel sticks open and/or stays open too long, letting too much sodium in, and thus prolonging the sending of pain signals. Sodium Channel Blockers, as the name implies, help block these channels which reduces the flow of sodium into the nerves.\n\nThe list of possible side effects of mexiletine include nausea and vomiting. I have never had those. But it also includes tiredness and I have that, but it is a side effect of another medication I take (Neurotonin). There are other possible side effects that I have but I chalk those up to other health conditions I have.\n\nMexiletine is normally used to treat heart issues, to better regulate arrhythmias. So your doctor might want to monitor you more closely if you have any history of heart issues. Cardiac side effects are VERY rare at the doses used to manage THEM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBiologics are expensive. Yup. Probably talking about Intravenous immune globulin (\"IVIG\"). About $1000 per infusion, roughly. I have not had this treatment. The regime I read was up to weekly treatments for a month, every two weeks for another two or three months, and then monthly indefinitely. This treatment suppresses your immune system and can make you more susceptible to other illnesses.\n\nIn some THEM patients the root cause of damage to their nerves is an auto-immune condition. The first sign that this *might* be the case is an elevated ANA level ( a simple, cheap blood test). IVIG helps suppress this auto-immune response. \n\nMany insurance companies require pre-authorization before they will consider paying for such treatment. They would almost assuredly require an elevated ANA level and a positive specialized (*expensive $700+)* test to confirm presence of auto-antibodies before considering paying for IVIG. Thank you so much! How did you get a vascular doctor? I have been struggling to get one. Also by lidocaine pill do you mean Mexiletine? It is not lidocaine but is similar. I only experience appetite loss. I am going up on it. I cannot tell if it is had an effect or not because my THEM advances so fast. I found her through the erythromelalgia.org physician directory.  It took months to get that first appointment, which was frustrating but she was worth the wait. \n\nShe did not tell me the name for the pill, just about the lidocaine type aspect. She wanted me to try the volataren gel and do some other tests to get a baseline on me and we would discuss it on my next visit. I am supposed to go back after 3 months, but it is ended up being 4 because she is so booked.", "I have been lurking and reading long enough, here is my \"You all think I got THEM?\" Post.  Well, hey. Do not worry about somewhat, uh.... *revealing*, photos. We have the least sexy set of pictures of feet (and other body parts) on all of Reddit. Definitely no judgement. Pictures really help the members of this subReddit offer some advice.\n\nFair warning and disclaimer...  this is a motely crew of people who tend to look like we missed a few spots when applying the sunscreen. We are not doctors. Not even close.  But you will find a lot of people chiming in who have been diagnosed with THEM.\n\nThat said, the other thing that helps the peanut gallery offer comments is descriptions of how you feel.\n\nI can see redness on several of your photos. In particular your cheeks and toes look quite a lot like THEM redness. THEM most commonly affects feet, hands, cheeks, ears, nose, knees and sometimes torso.  (Hmmm, that does not leave out many body parts, does it?) \n\nIn addition to redness THEM usually causes a pain that is often described as burning.  Anything like that for you?  Burning pain? Tingling? Numbness? Pins and Needles?\n\nTHEM is a disorder which includes abnormal dilation of blood vessels. Blood vessel dilation is one way everyone is body responds to thermal changes. So *some* redness when you have been out in the heat can be perfectly normal. But that sort of normal flushing redness does not usually hurt and it typically goes away quickly when you cool off. In THEM patients that redness *with pain* can persist.\n\nIn THEM flares of redness and pain can seem to come out of nowhere. But if you know what to look for some patterns may develop. Flares are often set off by heat, such as a warm shower or being outside on a hot day. Laying down to go to bed triggers a normal systemic dilation of blood vessels which often triggers a flare in THEM patients.\n\nOf course other things can cause redness and itchiness such as allergic reactions. One at-home test is to run the red body part under cool (NEVER ice cold) tap water. If the redness and pain quickly, in a matter of seconds, goes away then it is likely related to blood vessel dilation and may be THEM. If that does not affect the redness at all then I would not suspect THEM.\n\nSo, next step...  get in front of a doctor familiar with THEM. And they are fewer and further apart that I am comfortable with. Patients often bounce from one specialist to another for years without a diagnosis. The simple reality is most doctors are not familiar with THEM. Many have *never* seen a case. \n\n( maintains a ( with contact information of physicians who have treated THEM patients.  I am sure there are other such doctors not on their list, but IMHO I would first go to someone who is confirmed to be familiar with THEM. It looks like you mentioned you are in AL (Alabama, I presume) and I only see two doctors in the entire state on that Directory. Yeah. Not many doctors are familiar with THEM.\n\nTake pictures, lots, so you can show the doctor what a flare looks like for you. Take notes about what triggers a flare and what relieves the redness and pain. \n\nAnd good luck. Confirming a diagnosis is an important first step. Yes, yes, sorry about that! I could not figure out how to also add a text introductory along with the photos. \n\nThis all started about 3 days ago. I was playing with my toddler outside, at a local festival when my ankles and toes started bothering me. It was like 88 degrees (F) out, I was definitely heated but I am used to it. I WORK outside (electrician).  I describe it as more of an itchy-ness or tingling at first. When you give in and scratch it, THEN it feels like a bad sunburn and stays that way. Anyway, the night went on, started pushing her in the stroller - that is when it started bothering my hands. And thennnnn, it went all over, by the time we got to the car I was slinging my socks and shoes off.\n\nI got home, looked at myself and thought I was having an allergic reaction to something. I tried calamine, cortisone, witch hazel, etc. Tried taking benadryl, allegra, zyrtec, and claritin. None of those helped. My feet and hands had swollen so much, it hurt to walk. It hurt to make a fist, or to write. I had to take my wedding ring off. I was waiting for my fingers to just pop. So I missed work yesterday to go to urgent care, where ofc, they just glanced at me and said \"eh, contact dermatitis\" gave me a Decadron shot, and a prescription for more steroids. Neither of which helped... at all.\n\nI have done the cold/warm water test. Cold packs/gel packs help, running whatever area under cold water helps. I got up at 1am this morning to soak my feet in some cold water, because they wound up under the covers in the bed.\n\nI cannot take hot showers anymore, I have to use luke-warm at best to wash my face in, or else my hands experience instant pain.\n\nHow can I go from working in 110-120 degree temperatures daily, to not being able to cover up at night? What the ever loving heck?\n\nMy plan today is to go to work, and tell them I need some accommodations... I almost KNOW its going to flare up there, and when they send me home, I am stopping by my doctor's office to straight up tell him what I think it is, and if he will refer me to the doctor in that directory. \n\nI have read that most of the time, it progresses - the pain/burning that is. Has that been the case for you? Or anybody you have spoken to?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Sorry if there are grammatical errors or typos in this, I had to write it up in a hurry. Hmmmm....  wow! Seems to have come on really fast.  And frankly that makes be a bit suspicious that it is not THEM.\n\nReality is that every THEM patient had a first flare up at some point in time.  This could be yours. But most often THEM patients have had a \n\nAnd yes, the first thing doctors would likely assume is a contact dermatitis of some sort. But there are usually other things a doctor would consider before jumping to THEM.\n\nYou may have heard the medical axiom *When you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras.*  It is a warning to medical students to first consider the more common and obvious causes for a particular symptom before considering a rare diagnosis.\n\nWhen it comes to redness on the skin several possible diagnoses would be considered the *horses*, the common things to consider. THEM is like jumping way past zebra and straight into (  territory. THEM is a way into the weeds level of rare.\n\nI AM NOT A DOCTOR but your doctor probably should run some basic blood and urine tests to check kidney and liver function. Problems with those can cause redness, itchiness, and/or a rash. The puffiness feeling you described in your hands *can* show up in THEM but it can show up in other conditions where you are retaining a lot of fluid.\n\nOther conditions can cause redness as well. A dermatologist might have a better idea of what your rashes might indicate.\n\nNot to alarm you but COVID can even cause red toes similar in appearance to what showed in your picture. \n\nStay hydrated. It is a hot one out there. And get checked. I hope it is not. BUT at the same time I want an answer. I have had my hands and feet do that sort of thing before on several occasions, but never as bad as this time. Always was triggered by being outside/heat or exercising and lasted a few hours if I did not try to remedy it. \n\nI just hope I can make it through at least half of a work day. Thank you for your response :) Mcas maybe ? The rash along your hip looks raised. I do not know if THEM would cause that. Is it itchy?\n\nIf you have never had these symptoms before go see your GP. Just to get basic blood work. That looks more like hives (my kid has THEM) and I have mast cell activation syndrome/urticaria (hives).  I get both cold urticaria and bouts of chronic autoimmune hives (I have celiac disease, Hashimoto\u2019s and autoimmune gastritis).  Either one of my autoimmune diseases can trigger chronic hives which last for over six months.  My hives are very itchy.  My daughter has THEM that presents on her ear, hands and feet.  It occurs with stress heat and oddly, she also has Raynaud\u2019s.  One hand can be red, white and cold (or just two fingers) and the other lobster red and painfully hot \u2014 on Fire).  She is under the care of a GI and rheumatologist.  No medications at this time. Avoiding heat, cold and stress help.  \n\nI am not a doctor, but I would see an allergist who can test you for Mast Cell Activation Syndrome.  Normally a cocktail of antihistamines can help but not cure MCAS or a rheumatologist who can screen you for autoimmune diseases.  One poster was correct, COVID can also cause comparable symptoms.  \n\nDo not use very cold water.  It damages the skin.  Elevate your feet and hands to help circulation and avoid the heat.  Use fans.  I wish you well! Just an update : (I had stupidly high hopes of not having a \"flare up\" at work..) I wound up having to leave work early today, and am currently waiting to be seen by my GP. \n\nI will mention allergy testing, along with the blood work to check for liver function. (He recently thoroughly checked my kidneys)\n\nI was working like usual, and it did not take long at all for my hands and feet to start burning. My job is very labor-intensive, with no air conditioning at all.Thankfully, what my job does entail is having my hands above my head most of the time, (wiring lights/fan fixtures \n)so my hands improved. My feet did not get any relief until I  was able to prop them up on my ac vents in my car. \nI am glad, at least, that I KNOW that brings me relief. Cause I could NOT continue working as I regularly do.\n\nETA : Blood work was done for kidneys, liver, gallbladder. They also checked my A1C. They want an ultrasound in two days. They also checked for autoimmune disorders. \nI want to keep this updated, no matter what (if I get one) the diagnosis is, in case someone else stumbles upon this reddit thread, and lurks like I did before asking. \nYou have all been helpful.\nI am starting to wonder if the rash occurring after my feet/hands get angry is something else entirely. It seems to pop up with the slightest change in temperature. From hot to cold. From cold to hot. \nBesides Blood work, they wanted to try another shot of Decadron, and some extended release prednisone. I think the shot helped minimally with the itching. Thanks for providing OP such a comprehensive support comment! You rock! Usually THEM is not one spot on your leg, usually it covers your whole leg or body part that the redness is Very itchy. It is actually not raised, just very red and very hot. I do get welts with it though. And it does not start until after my hands/feet get angry. This looks like contact dermatitis, not THEM. Heat often triggers CD too. I am wondering if it could be prickly heat. Do your feet and hands bother you similarly (the burning) to someone with THEM? My daughter has THEM.  She does experience burning.  Her rheumatologist has been sympathetic and supportive.  It is not severe enough for my daughter to use any medications.  She knows heat and stress can cause flares.  Avoidance is her best defense.  Like super short showers, elevating her feet immediately after.  keeping her room cool at night.  But simple fun pleasure, like hanging out with friends will cause a flare.  So stress can be fun based!  \n\nYou can have multiple issues, so do not look for just one diagnosis.  Keep advocating and researching.  The Mayo Clinic is the most knowledgeable THEM medical staff and there is a Facebook group for THEM as well.  I lurk but do not participate.  I like anonymity because I am talking about more than myself.  \n\nI really think THEM is not as rare as once thought.  I am still learning.  Ask me about celiac disease and I am pretty knowledgeable.  Keep a journal of symptoms and events.  Your hives/rash could be related to heat, stress (plenty of physical and mental stress on your job, exposure to things while you work.  You might be able to identify triggers.  \n\nI can not stress enough about having multiple issues. I have THEM. This looks like mine. But mine is very specific so others might not recognize it. That is why there is more defined borders and it is on the back of your legs. It is called secondary atypical erythromelalgia. You neee to get into a doctor now and try to get a referral to Mayo Clinic\u2019s THEM clinic. Avoid Cleveland clinic. This is at the severe end. It can cause inflammation in some areas. THEM works different in different areas. My face gets inflamed but my foot does not. Hey I would like to correct you. Secondary atypical erythromelalgia does. I have it. Back of my legs, elbows, weird spot on my ankle, face, feet, and knuckles. Very defined border. It is important not to use this as a \u201cyou probably do not have this\u201d as atleast in my case, once it is spread that much it is getting pretty bad.", "To those who have erythromelalgia affect their face, how do you cope while you are out and about? I use cold packs when I have a face flare up at home, but I am at a loss what to do when I am out of the house and my face starts burning. Is menthol or lidocaine cream safe to put on your face? What do you all do to help the heat/pain? I am sorry you are going through this, it really sucks does not it. When I am in my car even in the winter during a flare I will blast my AC and point it at my face. I will bring my ice packs to work and also carry a small hand held fan in my purse. It is soooo hard to control my facial THEM on the go. It seems like there is not a ton of information out there for facial THEM. Here is what I have found so far. My doctor prescribed me a lidocaine cream I keep with me all times. I have also purchased a MASSIVE box of first aid kit ice packs from Amazon. I understand it is not very environmentally friendly but when my face goes nuclear it is phenomenal relief. Lastly, aspirin! I hope this helps. It is especially hard with masks! I am all for masks, but having facial flares while wearing a mask is miserable! I second what everyone has said about pain gel/cream. I have an expensive ketamine-amitryptyline hybrid pharmacy formulated cream I have to use sparingly due to cost but it helps with the worst of flares. The everyday ones I just use cool fans and spray bottle to mist my face and use power of evaporative cooling. I cannot use anything colder because I also have Raynauds. I have pretty severe facial THEM and it is been insanely hard with masks. I believe in science and masks but I literally cannot wear one without an instant, severe and prolonged attack that lasts sometimes 24 hours or more. The heat and tingling gets so bad that my eyes water and her blood shot, my cheeks skin gets rough and sometimes blisters from the heat. The immunologist advised me to wear a face shield until we can get the THEM under control. The best thing I have found are portable fans for on the go, stay out of the sun at all costs and bring a cooler for ice packs. I used to be a super outdoor active gal and now I cannot get over heated in the FL sun or I am going to die with pain for the next several days. There are lidocaine compound creams your doctor can formulate for you but I personally have not found any success with that route.  I am sorry it is so bad :( I have not found that a mask makes mine worse, but I work from home and am hardly ever in a situation where I need to wear one for more than a minute or two. I am in the same boat with the lidocaine cream\u2014it has not really done anything to touch the pain. Thank you so much. Luckily I work remote or I would probably be unemployed lol but on the occasion I need to run to the grocery store to get supplies or pop into a gas station I have to either mask up or do a face shield. I know people automatically assume I am anti mask because of all the noise around it but I cannot wash my face, touch it with a wash cloth or sleep with my face touching a pillow either so it is not isolated to masks- it is literally anything touching my skin. I have had to sleep elevated on my back only so I do not have my face touching any pillow for about two years now. It sucks. :-/ I am not diagnosed (I either have this or something similar I guess), but if I can I will go to the bathroom, get some paper towels wet with cold water, and use those like you use the ice packs \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "just another day in the life :))))  I get the same thing :( Ouch. I feel this pic Does your hand still do this, if so could I see another angle if you have a pic, I sadly suffer from the same issue", "Bruise-like foot pain after standing? I was diagnosed today by my doctor after years of wondering why sometimes my hands and feet got intensely red and swollen, and I am trying to figure out what all this extends to. I know after a walk on a hot day, my feet will be swollen and painful, and that is related. But if I stand for a few hours (barefoot or in shoes) or if I walk for a few hours, the bottoms of my feet feel an intense bruise-like pain. If I take a warm shower after, that pain intensifies and feels like knives stabbing my heels.\n\nI dunno if that is a normal thing, something related to erythromelalgia, or something else entirely. Does anyone here have experience with that? Thank you! This is consistent with pain from erythromelalgia (THEM).\n\nWhen you stand, gravity pulls blood towards the feet. The normal response is the the body signals the blood vessels of the feet and legs to contract and force that blood back up towards the torso.\n\nIn THEM the blood vessels in the extremities dilate and do not constrict normally. This is made all the worse by blood pooling when you are upright. This makes your feet feel swollen. The excess blood is warm, making your feet feel hot. That swelling can make your feet feel heavy, and many patients experience a burning pain.\n\nTypically when a person experiences swollen feet from lymphedema the doctor recommends compression stockings. Unfortunately many THEM patients have a hard time wearing any type of socks as the fabrics traps more heat and causes more pain. Thanks for the detailed answer! It is a bit of a trip going through past experiences and realizing that I felt pain and struggled to do things because of THEM. My doctor does not want me on a treatment plan for now (which is good because I also do not want that at the moment), but it will be really nice being able to name what is going on when it comes up for me with friends and family in the future. This is going to be a lot of info but you CLEARLY have THEM and I think it is helpful to have the info. If you have had it for years, yes I would expect this. It is not like this in my feet yet. But in my legs it is started BRUISING after big flairs. I People do not clarify or talk about this so I will clarify. There is the pain from flairs that is not constant (unless your THEM is so severe that you are flailing 24/7) but there is also the residual after painful flairs. But the examples you have might not be that. THEM is triggered by heat and exercise. Personally mine is Extremely triggered by exercise (cannot walk to the mailbox). For me the pain in the bottom of my feet feels like shards of glass. If you want to reduce a flair DONT add more heat. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT SOAK IN ICE WATER. But using fans, reasonably cold showers, ac, rest, and ice packs with a towel in between the ice pack and your skin should help. You are also at the point where you should probably see pain management. Gabapentin makes you tired but can be pretty effective. There is also mexiletine (it is like lidocaine but much more effective in THEM patients). I just started on it. 1 pill for three days, then move up to 2 for three days, and then 2. The gaba and this do not interact so you can take them at the same time. You can also get Gaga and ketamine compound but not many insurances cover it. If there is any other questions do not hesitate to ask! What you are describing is EXACTLY how my THEM started out. Thanks so much for this; I really appreciate the detailed response. Honestly getting this diagnosis is at least helping me tie a bunch of things together that I thought were completely separate. I get what I thought were heat rashes as well, but now that I know more, I am thinking that is related. I am pretty good at managing those and so now they happen less frequently.\n\nI am actually pretty lucky that I am rarely in too much pain to walk (only after standing or walking for a few hours, which I seldom have to do), and by some miracle, other forms of exercise do not trigger it. Alcohol does, heat does, and changes in weather do (it is been alternately stormy and sunny where I live lately so my hands have been a bit of a mess), but even then it is rarely so bad I lose any amount of function and it is more heat than pain. So I am hoping to stay off medication for as long as I can. I think I started getting the bruising feet pain after standing when I was 13, started getting the heat flares and mild swelling in my hands and feet in my late teens and early 20s, and now I am 32 and while the flares have been more frequent, they are not worse. So I am hoping it stays manageable for now. But it is really good to know treatment options are available-thank you so much for that info!!! No problem! And ya I started getting heat rashes and like \u201chot flashes\u201d. Not flairs but more like \u201cmy entire body feels like it is 90 degrees but it is only 74\u201d. I am so glad you are good at managing it! If you need ANYTHING do not hesitate to ask! Thank you!!! I will probably reach out in the future \ud83d\ude0a"]
