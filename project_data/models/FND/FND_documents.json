["saw a question on r/neurodiversity and it was along the lines of : is FND Neurodiverse. So do people thing FND is apart of the ND community of not?\n\n(", "Help? Advice please? Hi everyone\n\nI am new to Reddit and to FND community so please be kind :) \n\nMy mum is 53 and in the last few weeks she has been suffering from what a doctor has told us may be FND. Since researching this we believe it could be this and are looking for some help and advice from others who may be experiencing something similar. \n\nShe suffers from episodes where she physically cannot open her eyes for periods of time. She is fully aware during this period. This was starting at about 10 minutes at time but currently  she has not been able to for 2 whole days. However last week she had none for 5 days. Has anyone else suffered from this symptom? Is there anything we should be doing to help her try to open her eyes? \n\nThis all started about a month ago, after she had an attack after being at a spa where at first we thought she had a stroke but that has been ruled out. There seems to be no triggers and she is not under any stress. Has this come on as quickly for other people? \n\nHow can FND be treated or managed? Has anyone stopped having seizures? We are so worried as she has lost her independence and probably will not be able to work with theses seizures and in such a short space of time and we are just trying to gain some answers and knowledge in this. I was diagnosed with FND in 2018 and it is a tough disorder to treat but not impossible. I am working with a doctor from FND Courage, Dr Afra Moenter. She is been tremendously helpful for me. Some people also go to Mayo Clinic where there is a program for FND. Finding doctors that actually know what this is and how to treat it is what makes this so challenging. Good luck to you and your mom! She is lucky to have your support.", "Anyone have functional symptoms as the result of migraines? So about eighteen months ago I had my migraines (which I have had for 20 years) suddenly turn chronic. They went from once a month to 3 a month to 2 a week to every day in a very short amount of time for no apparent reason (kept getting asked if I was stressed - no I was not). Then I had what was very definitely a hemiplegic migraine - I went to A&amp;E and the options were a stroke or a hemiplegic migraine, and it obviously was not a stroke. Pretty sure I had a few more after that with a very clear aura pattern before a migraine, but then everything blurred into each other and basically all the symptoms (limb weakness, numbness/pins and needles, aphasia, vertigo, Alice in wonderland syndrome -sometimes I go big, sometimes I go small) have never really gone away. Some of them have changed a bit - my left side numbness/weakness moved also to my right; mostly now I get it both sides but a little worse on my left - and I have developed some new ones like nerve pain. Beginning of this year I developed trigeminal neuralgia (does not seem to be a typical FND symptom?).\n\nAnyhow, after finally getting to see a neurologist she has labelled them as chronic migraines (thankfully these have reduced considerably) + functional sensory symptoms (that does not encompass all my symptoms obviously but whatever) and concurred with the TN (medication works really well for that and as a plus, works really well on the nerve pain I was getting in my arms and legs). Been left to it after that really, waiting on a next appointment (last one six months ago on NHS). I am not 100% sold on the diagnosis because I think there is a lot that does not fit (and other people seem to get a lot of tests? I have had blood tests and then I had to push for an MRI -normal, that is all the report said, which I guess is good -and that is it) but it is the best I have got so far and I have been trying to focus on relieving the symptoms by pacing myself etc.\n\nBut anyway, I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience? I notice from looking online that there is a lot of focus for FND on psychological factors and stress (and depending on the resource some people consider it just a renamed conversion disorder) and I just cannot relate to that at all. :/ So, I had a sudden increase in migraines very similar to yours - before I had my FND diagnosis - and I have ended up having botox treatment through the NHS for it, which has worked really well.\n\nIn regards to the FND diagnosis....I am in the same boat. I was diagnosed with ME 2 years ago, but despite pacing, and the CBT, I kept getting worse. I started getting pins and needles in my arms, hands, legs and feet, among other symptoms (not listed on any of the websites I have found re FND). My husband and I were concerned that I was \"ticking the boxes\" for MS, so went to the Dr and asked for a referral - due to the lengthy wait for NHS, we were advised to go private, which we did. The Neurologist seemed quite dismissive, and said its FND, read the website - which I have, but it does not seem that many of my symptoms match up! \n\nI am sorry, as I know none of what I have said really helps (I am still new to the diagnosis myself) - but I read your post and wanted to let you know you are not alone in the symptoms you have re migraines, and no stress. Yes, that does sound very similar and it is good to know other people have similar things going on. I was worried it might be MS as well, especially with the TN which can be a red flag for MS if you are under 40. But with my MRI coming back clear I guess that is one worry off my mind. \n\nThankfully my migraines have gone back to being much more sporadic/less intense, I am managing them with lifestyle/trigger management and painkillers when needed. Constant balancing act, most days I still have to try and head one off before it can develop, but given what they were like before, I will take that, I do not want to go on a medication merry go round again.\n\nI am the same that some of my symptoms do not line up with FND and some of the symptoms I do have I do not experience in a way that is typical for FND so ?? I was really unlucky, in that pain relief just stopped working for my migraines - I had to try a whole bunch of meds before they would consider trying the botox. I had to come off every medication I took that had pain relief as a side effect, let alone main function, for just over a month, to try to reset my system. It did not work, and triptans did nothing to relieve the migraines. I am glad you are able to manage yours - multiple migraines in a week were pure hell! Botox has been an absolute game changer for me (something I never thought I would say!)\n\nMy symptoms do not align with what a lot of other people experience with FND - but, the Neurologist was adamant it is FND. He also said it was FND alongside ME/CFS, and a number of other conditions I have, so I do not know if that makes a difference? It is just all a big question mark for me I have a lot of migraine issues since my FND diagnosis. Mine seems to have started because of a medication induced Bradykenesia, but since then the FND and migraine symptoms have persisted, where I did not have migraines before. I mostly have nearly constant occular migraines, but some painful ones 3-4 times a month as well. I also do not identify with the trauma/stress factors normally associated with FND either. I do have bipolar disorder, but it is well controlled and the medication for it is was triggered the Bradykenesia that started all of the neurological problems. I have since changed medications and still have not had issues with bipolar symptoms. However, since I have a history of mental Illness, I feel that doctors easily brush everything off as psychological when I really do not have any anxiety/stress triggers that seem to be associated with the FND symptoms. It is very confusing and frustrating.", "Newly diagnosed Hi fellow humans\n\nI have just recently been diagnosed with FND after a TBI and I am having a really really hard time with it. Just this past month I have been in the hospital in a coma and having numerous fainting spells, seizures and paralysis episodes. I just wanted to know what others do to try to get through the day... I have really bad paralysis, absence seizures and fainting. Any tips would be a God send. That is awful to here. FND is shit. \n\nRemember you are loved. Prayer and reflection help, especially when you cannot do much else.\n\nManaging energy and protecting yourself is hard. I find noise cancelling headphones help keep me active.\nAnd when the shit kicks in, sleep is a good go to or wasting away in front of the TV Sorry to hear your going through this \ud83d\ude14.\nI guess try to keep positive, and find something you really love doing without spending to much phisical energy on it. And selfreflection for the long run.\n\nFnd is Indeed shit! \n\nBig hug! I am sorry to hear that! Welcome to the group!\n\nCheck out neuro symptoms.org and FNDHope, both are good websites with lots of great info.\n\nI have found a couple things that help. I swim at the YMCA 2-3 days/week. It helps with the body pain and gets me out of the house. My sister taught me to knit, which is surprisingly fun. I am teaching myself Tunisian crochet, it is easier and goes much faster. They also keep the part of my brain that ruminates quiet, so triple point score there!\n\nCheck in whenever you need something, or just to say hi. This is a great group. Also check out r/PNES. I love knitting!!!! I really got into it after my concussion and I love it! I tried crochet but I just cannot get the hang of it \ud83d\ude2a  I was wondering about swimming I would love to go to the ymca again. Thank you so much! Oh good! I find that it keeps my mind busy and distracted with something that is not really difficult. I have to pay attention, but it is not taxing, just enough to keep the anxiety at bay.\n\nI do not know where you are or what your situation is, but I had to quit work, go on Medicaid, and the insurance that I got pays for a YMCA membership. That is how I am able to swim. Check it out! I know I totally get so entranced by knitting I could be at it for 6 hours and have no clue! People have to be like yo eat something. It allows me to get out of my head while resting.\n\nI tried going back on the 8th for a reduced modified shift but could not even hack that... had a telephone appointment with my Dr and she is like wtf are you working... you need to quit. So now I am back with my parents and trying to sell some of my knits. Next step is the YMCA. I think the hardest part is that I had a vision for this year and because of this everything has changed. Just goes to show how life can go a different way in the blink of an eye", "What should I be doing or avoiding? I have been diagnosed with FND by a neurologist, but he lacked the knowledge to give any useful advice as to what I should be doing about it. I am waiting for a referral to a specialist FND team, but it could take months.\n\nFor instance, if I go for a walk, it makes my symptoms worse. I am usually very dizzy and nauseous afterwards. I usually walk like I am drunk towards the end of a short walk.\n\nI asked if I should be pushing myself to the point where it makes me ill, but he did not know. He suggested I try team sports instead \ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26 I have had the same symptoms as you and had a special physical therapist for it (not fnd team) At first it was horrible, but they really knew what they were doing and i did get better. I was also B12 deficient wich really started all my problems. Might want to look in to that too. Same symptoms here, if I do to much I crash hard and cannot really do anything. My physio says I have to build up on energy and not do to much even if I feel good.\n\nIf your body says no, you probably should not do it. It seems like every FND use different and what works for one person does not for another. I was diagnosed with PNES (FND where you have seizures) and the primary treatment for that is therapy, which surprisingly is actually helping.\n\nI would work on trying to figure out your triggers. Like, what is going on just before your symptoms start? That is a key thing for this stuff. If going for a walk makes you dizzy and nauseous and you have trouble walking by the end of it, what happens during that walk? Can you walk that distance in a different environment and be fine, or does it not matter? For example, I get walking issues if it is inside because fluorescent lights are a trigger for me, but outside on the bike path is fine. That sort of thing. \n\nThere are also a number of websites you might find helpful, as well. ( has some good stuff. ( also has a few things you might find helpful, in particular, they have got a free web conference this upcoming weekend (link goes specifically to that).\n\nThe hardest part about this stuff is there are so few specialists in it that you can wait forever to see somebody. The second hardest part is that inevitably, you somehow have to reduce your stress level (yes, doctor, I will just \"reduce my stress,\" perhaps you would like to waive your fees to start helping with that?). my neurologist said id get physical therapy later on! maybe trying that will help you as well? It does not seem to matter where I walk, it seems to be that the distance is the issue, not the location. I can walk better if I have someone with me, or if I am talking to someone on the phone.\n\nI agree that waiting is hard, I have been referred to a neuropsychiatrist, but I have not even had the letter yet to set a date. Fortunately I am in the UK, so all treatment is free at the point of service. I had to wait for 12 weeks between seeing a neurologist and the neuropsychiatrist. I have a similar thing where my symptoms get worse with fatigue (and I can fatigue very quickly). The trick is to try and keep your activity within a window that you can tolerate. When you are feeling good, do a bit less than you feel like you can (ie do not push yourself and then have a big crash). When you are feeling bad, do a little bit more than you feel like in the moment (do not overdo it, but do not do zero when you could try for 1, if that makes sense). Remember that social, physical, emotional, cognitive activity can all potentially count toward your energy usage for the day (you might find some things more or less taxing, and it can vary from day to day). \n\nBasically the approach I have outlined is a kind of retraining for the nervous system which allows you to slowly to tolerate a bit more over time.\n\nLearning how to listen to my body, relax as much as possible, and not expend energy on things I do not need to helped me a lot too. \n\nAlso, the fact that you have noticed that talking and socialising helps your walking is great. Distraction techniques are a known way of helping rehab movements in FND. It is because it helps the parts of the brain that are involved in automatic movement take back control from the parts of the brain that are misfiring. You can experiment with other techniques. I count in a second language in my head, or tap rhythms with my fingers to help my walking. \n\nDefinitely get professional help when you can (your current neuro sounds like a tool) but just thought I would pass on a few things that\u2019ve helped me, as our symptoms sound quite similar. I have tried to distact myself with physical sensations (rolling 2 conkers round in my had, squeezing a stone etc), but did not see any difference. I will give the tapping or counting a go, I appreciate your input. I do not know if they checked that or not. They did say my cholesterol and lipids were really high, and I have raised inflammatory markers. I know this was posted a while ago, but if you have raised inflammatory markers have you been tested for autoimmune diseases (lupus, sjogrens, arthritis)? They can cause similar symptoms to what you are describing.", "Venting about my trouble swallowing :/ So my swallowing issues are getting pretty bad, I can barely eat anything except for cereal and graham crackers and things like that, and only if I have water. And even then I choke on it sometimes or cough it back up at some point, usually while eating, which does not help at all when I am trying to swallow :/ It is been like this for a few weeks and I am feeling bad and kind of losing weight which sucks cuz I was already kind of underweight last time I was weighed. At that time my pediatrician just said that it would get better and I was fine, it feels like as soon as he heard my diagnosis he got so much less concerned. I would tell my mom how it is affecting me but I do not want her to get mad at me again, they are both kind of frustrated with me for being like this. I want to tell my physical therapist but every time I try my parents downplay it until it seems like nothing or interject and stuff, and I do not want to push back too hard against them. It is pretty frustrating and I do not know what I am supposed to do about it.", "UK friends Hi guys. I (19M) got diagnosed with FND about 3 months ago after years of confusing symptoms. I live in the UK and was just wondering if theres anyone in this group from the UK too? \n\nI do not really have a support system to help me cope with my symptoms because they do not understand that there is not a definitive reason for them to happen. I am just looking for someone to talk to and share experiences with. \n\nThank you in advance! Hey I am 19F and I was actually also diagnosed a few months ago and live in the UK as well. You can talk to me about it if you would like! I would honestly also like to talk to someone with similiar experiences. You do not have to but you are welcome to message me anytime ^^ Hi I am from the UK. My husband is the one with FND. His manifests as pain, stroke symptoms and cognitive difficulties.  Are you on Facebook? There are some good groups you can join for support and information. Hiya, I am on facebook. I had a look at some groups but i have found this reddit one to be more informative. \n\nI have pain, cognitive difficulties, tics, limb weakness and disassociation episodes. If you do not mind me asking, has your husband had any help or assistance through the NHS or the like since his diagnosis? He is still getting a formal diagnosis with a neurologist. He has had an EEG and we are waiting for the results.  He has been referred to neuro OT, neuro speech therapy and neuro physio which has been really helpful. The physio really understands his issues and has pushed for an mri of his hip which the normal physio did not want to do. \n\nIt has been a slow process. 1 year since the first attack where he was rushed to a&amp;e with a suspected stroke. He has not been the same since and unable to work. Does not help we have a 2nd floor flat with no lift. \n\nHow are you doing? Bless him, I bet it is hard on the 2 of you :( I have had a few attacks over the years that we are put down to a bunch of different things. I went to a neurologist on the NHS who told me my symptoms fit FND, but after that appointment I have not had any help, especially with my limb weakness since i use a walking aid during episodes I think you can ask your GP to refer you to the neuro teams.  My husband should be on the list to go to an FND clinic. I am not really sure what they can do.  I have heard a lot of people are discharged from the neurologist on diagnosis. \n\nI just want him well enough to be out of pain and enjoy being with me and our young son. Aww how olds your little boy? \n\nMy GP told me that my FND was caused by improper diet, they are not very good so when i asked for a referral they said to try changing my diet instead \ud83d\ude44 What a joke! They do not have much of a clue about it.\n\nI heard FND is very similar to long xovid so hopefully more research will be done. \n\nMy son is 3 and I wish my husband could do so much more with him. Aww he is really young. I hope your husband recovers soon, and that research catches up. Thank you. Good luck to you too. Hey I recently have also had this come up and would be great to talk to others experiencing similar things. Mine isnt diagnosed yet but FND thrown around as a potential. Experiencing limb weakness and tremors mainly.\nI cannot believe GP said this could be caused by a bad diet Hey! I have had tremors and limb weakness for a few years, had other symptoms jumping up in the last 12 months. My GP is a pretty naff anyway. I am not even 100% sure that the neurologist officially diagnosed me with FND or just threw it out there Oh I am so sorry to hear that. Do you feel like you are getting any help or are just left on your own? Before this happened to me I never would have thought people could have such severe symptoms and just be left on their own to deal with it. How are you feeling Its pretty s**t tbh, which is why i jumped onto online communities. My symptoms get really bad when my anxiety is acting up, and sometimes i have a flare up with no explanation. I started CBT to try and help me understand my behaviours a little more, but aside from that i feel pretty isolated since people around me do not understand that it can be debilitating I am from the UK. We think my mum has FND. It started about 3 months ago so we are really new to this as well! Her symptoms are that she physically cannot open her eyes. Sometimes she can with sunglasses on but it is not guaranteed. Her MRI and CT of the brain were clear so this is what doctors have suggested \n\nIt is so new to us aswell never heard of this condition before this! There should be more awareness. It is so life changing and debilitating. Happy to chat to you about it! I do not know many people with eye symptoms, but I have heard of it. Is her's a light sensitivity issue? I would only heard about it when i was looking into my tremors and limb weakness. Hopefully more research gets done, because too many people are left with symptoms that cannot be handled without debilitating someones quality of life Hey, I am in the uk, I was diagnosed in 2018. Before my diagnosis I thought I was going insane. Feel free to drop me a message I have many complex symptoms. I also have another condition called idiopathic intracranial hypertension (high pressure in the brain) which is currently in remission \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb I also have an autoimmune condition RA. All of this was found in 2018 along with the fnd diagnosis. I cannot fault the treatment and help I have received, I am under Atkinson Morley (st George\u2019s) the top neuro hospital in the uk and I also have treatment at kings collage. I have a direct email for the gentleman that is in charge of my case professor mark edwards. He specialises in FND and has some videos on YouTube, there interesting &amp; helpful. I have never ever been told any correlation between food/diet and FND? Like I said feel free to message me, I will try and help if I can and if not it would be nice to chat to someone in the same boat! it is a lonely condition that is hard for us to understand let alone loved ones and friends, Take care. Hey, do not suppose you know how to go about getting some referrals or requesting tests do you? My local hospital is pretty naff, and the adult neurology department only has neurologists who specialise in parkinsons and alzheimers, so its hard to get across that i want some tests to confirm my diagnosis I am sorry to hear you are struggling to get the right help and treatment. Are you under the care of a neurologist at the moment? I do not know where you are in the country, but you have the right to request a referral to another hospital or get a second opinion they have a duty of care to look after you and provide the best treatment for you. Outline to them what tests you would like done, so for instance my bloods consistently had positive antinuclear antibodies/ high inflammatory markers amongst other things, St. George\u2019s told me that there are some early indicators that there could be a connection between FND and some autoimmune conditions (they are a research hospitals also) You have the right to live not just exist, and you can live life with the right treatment. If you are under the care of a consultant ask if you can get a referral to see someone at St. George\u2019s if it is not too far away from you. I will add it did take me 10 years and changing to another drs to get to when I am now, but once my new dr listened, looked me over went through past history/test results he referred me to my local hospital neurology department and then I went from there and I cannot fault my team, Reading other people\u2019s stories I am incredibly lucky with the treatment I receive and I will always say DO NOT GIVE UP keep fighting you will get there. The NHS are really up against it at the moment trying to get through backdated appointments/procedures so things will take longer but hang in there! I am sorry if this was not much help , feel free to message me if you have any other questions, I will always try and answer the best I can. I am based in Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire. I have not heard from my neurologist or GP since the initial appointment, so i am not sure where i stand for asking for more help to understand myself. I know my neurology department has a lot of backlog going on currently too Oh I see! Have you tried emailing your drs surgery? You could outline your concerns and or any changes/new symptoms you are experiencing, how you would like to go forward with this matter and asking if you are being referred or what is happening regarding your initial appointment. That Is really helpful! I never know what to ask or what is appropriate to ask. I am going into my doctors tomorrow, do you think if I were to ask a receptionist they would be able to tell me if there is a referral in process? Anything is appropriate to ask when it come down to your health, and the best thing you can do is keep pushing for answers! Yes the receptionist should be able to tell you if a referral letter is on your record and if not ask for their email ad, address it for the attention of your dr and ask everything you need to ask and keep going until you get the answers. Never be afraid to ask anything or to outline how this is making you feel. If this is affecting your quality of life it needs to be addressed for your well being. I am glad I could have been some help and I really hope you get the answers and treatment you deserve. Thank you so much!!! This has really helped Hi friend I am also 19M and I was diagnosed in August with FND. I suffer from memory issues, dizzyness, visual snow, and a couple of other things too. Memory issues suckkk, especially when you try and explain why your memory is bad. How did you go about getting diagnosed? Well I got referred to the local neurologist after a plethora of tests etc. And then I had a MRI and EEG plus autoimmune encephalitis panel and they all came back negative she believes they are \"functional neurological symptoms\" by there is a couple other tests I might request to confirm this is my diagnosis. Yeah it is been one hell of a ride to say the least! Damn that is a lot of tests Trust me man it is never easy but it does eventually get better/easier. Where abouts are you based? Im in nottingham/derby I am in Sheffield - I am seeing my GP this afternoon and asking how to be referred to this department in Sheffield Teaching Hospitals:\n\n Hi I am from the UK and was diagnosed with FND 3 years ago when I was 26. In late 2018 I developed daily migraines and fatigue, then I developed Trigeminal Neuralgia (not sure if this is FND related, controlled with meds and in remission for 2 years), and then finally a few months later I developed both motor and vocal tics basically overnight. I have also had a couple of strange episodes which I am told may have been pseudo seizures where I briefly lost consciousness and then could not move when I woke up. I am currently being treated for my tics by a physio and a psychologist specialising in FND. On two meds for migraines, neither of which work. I have been extremely fortunate to have moved to an area where there is an FND clinic not too far away and to have had some doctors who take my symptoms seriously and do not just tell me to get therapy. While I do have trauma and mental health issues, all of my symptoms started after I was hospitalised for a severe kidney infection.", "I had one of my FND attacks during one of my matchmaking games and my teammates assumed I was trolling..

", "Double edged diagnosis? Two for one? Hello, I am writing on behalf of a close friend who has recently received a diagnosis that we cannot find anything about anywhere else. \n\nHer symptoms were originally labelled as Functional neurological disorder (FND) but after insisting on tests after a few months of being ignored she got confirmation that she has mild axonal sensorimotor neuropathy but they have left FND on the table to explain some other symptoms. \n\nWe have not been able to find anyone else with this double barrelled diagnosis and are struggling to help her tread the line between the two. \n\n Movement helps keep her muscles conditioned and boost circulation which can help with the neuropathy but moving for any length of time causes a flare in her sensory symptoms that have been attributed to FND. \n\nAnyone else out there? Any thoughts?\n\nWishing everyone a comfortable day. I am very sorry for your friend. I have similar issues after a couple of spine surgeries and an autoimmune disorder that gives symptoms everywhere. They cannot figure out which thing is causing what symptoms, even though I can feel the subtle differences. After awhile, I tried swimming - it is the only exercise that I can do that makes me feel better instead of worse. It feels good sometimes just to get in the water and float. Other days, I swim some laps and then stretch. When I was in my 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, I used to swim a mile 3-4x/week. Now a good day is 10 laps! \n\nIf there is a YMCA near you, check it out, their pools tend to be warmer than gyms with pools. Some of them work with Medicaid to give free memberships also.

Thank you so much for replying! That is so interesting about the autoimmune piece- after months of pestering and chasing she finally got tested for that last night as we were sure there was an element of autoimmune reaction in what happened to her.  So fingers crossed this next batch of tests turns up something useful that might open the door to more treatment options than just pain management. \n\nAnd that is a great tip about the swimming, and so encouraging to hear you progressed and were able to build strength and stamina. Thanks for your insights and good thoughts \ud83d\ude0a My autoimmune does not show up in my blood work. It is a \u201cseronegative\u201d spondyloarthritis. It attacks the tendons and ligaments, I also get uveitis (inflammation in my eye). It took about 17 years to get diagnosed. I took naproxen every day for all of those years.

Life may never be what it was, but that does not mean that it cannot be wonderful! \ud83d\ude01 I believe BPC 157 would help your tendons/ligaments repair a lot Thanks for the thought, but it has not been proven to work in humans yet, only rats, so I am good for now. BPC 157 is very likely to help and is a safe drug, it is used regularly by a decent sized community worldwide.", "Does anyone get migraines? I have been developing migraines for a few years now, but recently I have just had one kick me in the ass.\n\nThe pain is still coming and going, but if I am honest, it seems to be triggered by moving around quickly, or bending over, or something like that.  Anything that gets the blood pumping.\n\nHas anyone else had anything like this? I mostly get tension headaches. However, last Friday I had my first migraine. Sudden pain to the right side of my head and lingering pain for a few hours. Worst part is that it triggered a major flare-up on my right side (eye, arm, flank, leg). Hope you find a way to manage it. We are all on the strange trip of pain. Ah man, sucks that tension headaches are a thing for you. How do you manage those?\n\nHopefully the migraine does not being a regular thing, for either of us.  :/ yup, i get migraines a lottt, my migraines started in middle school(ish) i am not exactly sure when they started but it was definitely before high school.

I cannot even imagine, they are quite debilitating.  :( Oh dang, that sucks man. How do you deal with it?\n\nGood info, I will try being better at that. Posture is not my strong suit, for sure. yess i hate them, i try not to miss school too often because of them but sometimes it is needed Yes I do and I usually see a black spot on the side of my vision during migraine episodes Man, this sucks. For both of us. It does suck but remember that we adapt and are stronger than we think. I have been struggling for like a decade now with various things. I have pain daily and get severe spasms that turn my muscles to rocks with weakness. But we have to stay optimistic. \n\nMgh in Boston just created a FND dept due to the increase in diagnosis. I am going to be offered new treatment and referred to the clinic. Some with virtual reality as the treatment.  Remember that this is now getting more attention and funding for research.  Hang in there Yep I struggle with migraines and it is a big trigger for my fnd symptoms. My neurologist is helping me find the right meds to keep them at bay and stop them when they start. I had a FND diagnosis for severe headaches causing left sided weakness - go see a physiotherapist or get some acupuncture done believe me this thing is curable so much of this shit is actually from poor posture and compressed nerves Yeah ok, I will give that a go!\n\nThanks man, it is appreciated!", "Functional Weakness So, i am just looking for a little insight. I am a 20yo F. I apologize for the long post, I just want to give all the info. Mid August of this year after about a year and a half of testing and many doctors I got diagnosed with FND by a neurologist at Duke. The reason I sought testing in the first place was because of progressive muscle weakness. I should also say, for context, that I have several diagnosed autoimmune diseases (Sjogren's syndrome, psoriasis, and raynaud's phenomenon). Ill list the series of events that led to the FND diagnosis. In Dec 2019 I had a flare of my Sjogren's that caused a swollen lymph node or maybe a fluid filled cyst, no know really knew. Anyways, my rheumatologist decided to put me on the slow release version of prednisone, 10mg (this is late Jan 2020). He said it should not cause any side affects and indicated that it would be a long term medicine. So, I start taking it (Min Feb 2020) and within a few days started having a \"burning\" sensation in my thighs and shoulders. After a few days of that, I switched to the regular version of prednisone and the burning sensation went away. \n\nI was relieved and went on living my life as a senior in high school. However, within a few weeks I started to have a little bit of trouble getting up off the couch. I would get 3/4 of the way up and then it was like I hit a brick wall. I did not think much of it though. A few weeks after that I started to need someone to give me a hand getting up from a sitting position. Then I started noticing that I was a little off balance while walking and I just felt weaker over all. As all this is happening, the pandemic is starting (Mid March) and my senior year was cut short. I was sitting around at home for months and started to attribute my problems to deconditioning. By June, I was completely unable to stand up from a sitting position without immense effort and was struggling to walk any long distance. I started having tests and seeing doctors and physical therapists. Head MRI, EMG/NCS, and EEG all came back clear from the neurologist. Was sent to a physical therapist (july-aug 2020), who was very concerned about my situation. I got a walker, which helped and did a month and a half of physical therapy. Which did absolutely nothing according to the therapist. At this point I need a wheelchair full time except for in the house where I walked very short distances with my walker and someone right next to me. I got a new rheumatologist (oct 2020) who ran a million blood tests, nothing unusual from his perspective. He did a thigh MRI (nov 2020) and a muscle biopsy (dec 2020), which showed nothing. I went to an endocrinologist (Feb 2021) who tapered me off of the prednisone. I started to feel a more energy, and maybe a little more strength, but I think I was just better able to use the muscle strength I did have. \n\nMy rheumatologist gave up and sent me to a rheumatologist at Duke (May 2021). During the pandemic I did not see many doctors in person. When I went to this duke rheumatologist he was visibly shocked by my condition and basically said something was obviously very wrong and the previous doctors must have missed something. He suggested something genetic, maybe a muscular dystrophy.  He sent me to a duke neurologist (Aug 2021). This neurologist came in, saw me \"walk\", and ordered some blood work and another EMG/NCS. He said he was testing for some specific things. Apparently everything came back fine and he said FND. \n\nI trust the doctors at Duke and this doctor seemed very confident. However, I cannot help but doubt this diagnosis when I look up the condition I do not seem to match it at all. I have had several doctors say my strength starts out good and then dissipates or that I need to take several attempts to get to full strength. I also have lots of atrophy in my hands, legs, ankles, and in my neck. Everything I read online indicates that functional muscle weakness usually comes on suddenly (mine was gradual), effects one side (mine effects both sides), and tends to come and go (mine is consistent). Can anybody offer there thoughts or there experience with functional muscle weakness? Thanks in advance and apologies again for the long post. Interesting, our timeframes are fairly similar.  My symptoms first presented with tinnitus and loss of balance, then after getting all sorts of tests to rule out vestibular disorders, was referred to a neurologist.  Before I was able to see one, the functional muscle weakness began suddenly and then in addition to the loss of balance I could not stand or bear my own weight.  After a hospital visit and a battery of tests (bloodwork, head, neck, cervical, and thoracic MRIs with and without contrast, head CTs, EEG, spinal tap, nerve conduction) everything came back normal.  I also have the functional tremors that I am able to suppress with clonazepam.  I was wheelchair bound for about a month (July 2021), then was able to progress to a walker after some physical therapy.  After about two months (now October) I can now sorta get around with a cane, but not very well since the loss of balance is still present.  Getting around the house is me mostly just holding on to walls and stumbling around.\n\nI have also been diagnosed with anxiety, and the weakness tends to get aggravated when I am more anxious as well.\n\nIt is frustrating that since this diagnosis is still fairly new as far as actual studied disorders are concerned that there is not much in the way of treatment.  I have mostly just been pushing myself to move around and go up/down stairs (despite the pain) whenever possible and hope that it will resolve over time.  To prevent falling I am always super aware of where my center of gravity is but that is difficult when my gait is not normal like it was before this all started. How long were you in physical therapy for and how many times per week did you go? I have tried to push myself and continued to push myself to regain ground the entire time I was getting worse, but it never gets better. The more effort I put in to walk the less I am able to do because I drain all my energy quicker. I currently cannot walk more than about 10 steps with a walker and someone walking with me. My anxiety has never effected my weakness and the weakness has never gotten substantially better. This is why I doubt the diagnosis. Thank you for sharing your story. 4 weeks, then the insurance ran out.  The effort/energy ratio is way off, it takes forever to do anything.  I am sorry that you cannot walk more, I needed assistance to even go to the restroom when it first onset.", "Just wondering a few things. PTW I am not sure what triggers people so I am puting that but nothing really should. So recently my docs have suggested I have FND or some kind of of FD as I get dizziness ect all unexplained I have had multiple bloods, I had mri scans xrays ect and they all showed up clear so now they are pointing towards that this is from ENT and audiology they have both put in a referral for neurology to see if they can work out anything so I have a few questions:\n\n1. Do some people with FD/FND suffer from chronic nosebleeds?\n2. What can help?\n3. Where can I find more info (I like to do my research on things)\n4. Could me having unexplained gastro issues (my body hates all food even if its something that is 'free from' I still have a bad reaction too it) link in with this?\n5. Having FD/FND is it common to come along with HSD, tics (not tourettes), RLS, Sleeping problems, Autism, ADHD ect\n6. Not really a question but recently I have been having dreams of me having a seizure and then waking up feeling like I cannot move but my bodys acting like I am haveing a seizure, like being all tense, shaking, jolting ect (ik what a seizure is like as I have had one in the past due to the docs basically giving me an od of my medication)\n\nIt will be greatly appreciated if anyone can answer any of these thanks, kay Also heads up I am only 16 but also have other medical issues and suffer from chronic pain, HSD and PCOS. \n\nAlso anyone know any good and not rly expensive mobility aids?\n The NHS are refusing to get me anything, I struggle with walking get complete numbness in my left leg alot and in constant pain, orthotics have tried lots of things and have nothing left to try, curently the mobility aid I use is my 'normal' crutches I got like 4yrs ago due to breaking my leg (well kind of I had a trampolining injury where my knee hit the metal frame of the trampoline when I did a back flip and my kneecap shunted up into my thigh, I was in a spring for 4 weeks and on crutches for 6 weeks after) but the crutches are getting harder to use and hurt my hands like hell especially cuz I have to basically put all my weight on them when my leg goes numb and weak and cannot hold my own weight and lots of mobility aids I look into are expensive and seem \"not right\" so can anyone help wiv that or advice on it?? Try trekking poles. They really help with balance, and they are not crazy expensive. \nAsk for physical therapy, it is often recommended for those of us that have walking issues. Swimming really helped my chronic pain.\n\nAnd yes, many of us are Autistic, do not know about ADHD.\n\nWhen I was your age, my body hated all food too. Later on, I found out that I have a non-celiac gluten sensitivity. NCGS has been (possibly) tied to PCOS and HSD.

How do you tell whether you are experiencing an epileptic seizure or a dissociative seizure? I just wish I had a surefire way to tell if my seizures are putting me in danger or not- it is been confirmed that I experience both PNES and Epileptic seizures, but we are not sure if I experience one more often than the other. \n\nI am going back to work in 2 weeks after almost 4 months off work and am hella nervous - you all know that FND seizures tend to last over 5 minutes, but if epileptic seizures are longer than 5 minutes that could kill me. Do I just go to the hospital every time I hit the 5 minute mark as a precaution? I asked my neurologist and she did not really have an answer for me and admitted she does not know- she just said if I have back to back seizures or a tonic clonic (I so far only have focals of both disorders) to go to the hospital. I would see if they will prescribe you a rescue med. my brother has a nasal preparation of Valium (diazepam) for if he has a tonic colonic seizure that lasts over 5 minutes. I would also add that he is already had 1 tonic clonic that lasted over 5 minutes and he is totally fine other than a concussion You cannot really tell. My wife was diagnosed with epilepsy for 2 years until someone finally hooked her up to a video EEG and found they were pnes and not traditional ones. I wondered the same thing every time my wife had a seizure. Should I take her to the hospital or not? We personally decided to go anytime the seizures lasted longer than what was characteristically normal. She normally had seizures that lasted 3-7 minutes long and there was one time she had a PNES that lasted almost 15 minutes. Regardless what type it was I felt more comfortable taking her to the doctor than risking it.

Just because she is sick does not mean she is not abusive- you can be a female and abusive, you can be sick and abusive, you can be a sick female and abusive.\n\nYou deserve better. I hope you are able to get to a safer place soon. No it most definitely does not make one violent. However in a lot of cases (not all) fnd is caused by a history of trauma, stress etc at different severities. Some people can have a car crash and develop fnd others like myself can have a large link of traumas at different severities.\n\nFor myself it is my many traumas and other mental health Conditions that make me lash out.\n\nI was where your wife was in April my partner felt the same way you did.\n\nHe did not give up in fact he fought for me and brought me stuff to the psychiatric ward\n\nIt is a horrid place and so often you are not cared for well in those places so keep an eye on her.

In my limited experience FND came alongside BPD (borderline personality disorder) which can be in some people be violent. Possibly an avenue to investigate? My partner was violent and tried to murder our child because of BPD. As far as my neurologist and psychiatrist tell me is it gave me ptsd which in turn caused my fnd. Its a reactionary disorder from trauma among other things. Please keep you and your kids safe. Sounds like your partner just have a personality disorder. Hey person here to stand up for BPD as someone who has the bloody thing and FND. Yeah it can have some dark parts but she needs someone who understands and helps and if the other half cannot give that then quite frankly do her a favour and split.\n\nNothing just about a personality disorder just like someone saying fnd is all in your head or your faking it FND does not make a person violent, but BPD can That is what I have concluded as well.

It should be, but apparently it is not. Maybe share this website:\n \n\n\nwith your neuro and let them decide. I think it depends on the area.

Well, even if it turns out to be something else at least I have made my friends and family read up on a condition that deserves more attention. that means the world. thank you for helping spread the word &lt;3 I have been dealing with FND for 8 months. There is a place called Re+Active that has a program for FND. It is in LA and is run by a neuro PT. I am starting my outpatient treatment soon. I do not live in LA so I will be in a hotel for 4 weeks. I am extremely happy to go where the health care professionals have heard of our condition. They have a great YouTube channel! Best of luck with their treatment program Thank you for mentioning the YouTube channel! I just looked it up and I cannot wait to watch their videos! when i was diagnosed, I went to Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. I was having tic attacks so bad i could not walk, so they did a full work up on me. I am talking MRI, Spinal Tap, EKG, the work.

However, I do wonder if some of these functional symptoms were at play and just not yet diagnosed because that is not a typical bipolar symptom.", "What am I supposed to be doing I am not quite to the point of being diagnosed with FND but my doctor has mentioned it and from what I have looked up it sounds extremely likely. She has scheduled me to see a CBT and to do PT but I worry that it will not be enough. I have non epileptic seizures, tremors, numbness, drop attacks, gait freezing, weakness, and a hell of a lot more. And I just dont know what to do. \n\nI want to try applying for disability but being 20 I dont know the process nor how to go about doing it. I currently still have a part time job but its hanging by a thread what with all my problems. Everyone I talk to about applying for disability is very discouraging because my family has one belief in life and that is that your work ethic tells a lot about a person. But I cannot work? So they will see me as lazy. And I worry that I will apply and be denied because I still live with my mother. I dont want to live with my mother for life and force her to care for me. I feel like a burden and it is making my symptoms worse. \n\nI dont know what I am doing or if I am even doing the right things. I have been getting worse all year and my doctor has not been that great to me. Life is just really scary right now and I dont know where to go from here. I am also 20 and I have always been a hard working person! Not working has been really hard but I wish I had applied for disability sooner, it is been difficult for me because I did not have a diagnosis when I started but if working is making your symptoms worse or your symptoms make work too difficult it is worth it. I had a really hard time getting out of my head about feeling like I did not deserve to get money because I was not working but you have to do what you have to to survive I wish i had some words of encouragement. Feels like most of the medical industry have never even heard about it. Im sorry so many people are suffering from this. Its a nightmare. We are more than our physical bodies. We are smart and funny and creative and inspiring, and we are even stronger than the others we judge ourselves against, because we still rise and still strive to achieve even with our bodies misbehaving. \n\nWe are powerful! The breaking down of our body makes our minds so much stronger and more open to wisdom and insight. We feel weak but it is only because we compare ourselves to the wrong kind of success. \n\nKeep your head high and know that what you endure makes you one powerful being! The fact that you wake up and still push forward is alone a feat to be celebrated. Excuse the language, but fuck family and friend opinions when they do not physically experience what we do. You know what you go through. You know how it feels and how hard you push. Fuck their view of success - succeed on your own terms and if they are truly there for you, they will cheer you on regardless. \n\nIn regards to disability or any kind of help - We are not weaker for seeking aid to help us move forward. Knowing your limits and knowing the help you need and going to get it... most people who are well cannot even do this. It is just common sense to get support when you require it, like a crutch when your leg is out of action. They do not understand because they have not lived in your shoes, so they assume you will carry on without any help like they do. But it does not have to be that way and we can teach them. We ask for help BECAUSE we are smart and we never give up. We do not push our limits but instead we push forward with wisdom and elegance, and we are stronger, still. \n\nMuch love to all of my fellow FND warriors. Keep your bodies rested, and your mind and will fixed and firm. I believe in a better future and healing to come for us all! Xx  Hey there! I am in a very similar situation, so I want to lend some validation. I am 24, and have been on state disability twice in the last 2 years for very similar symptoms. I have had little luck finding a diagnosis for, what doctors coin, \u201cunexplained cerebellar ataxia\u201d. Because of my mental health history, I have been told to consider FND, since my MRI, EEG, and CT scans from last year show nothing unusual. My game plan is to rule out as many diagnoses as possible at a doable pace, while self-validating &amp; managing my depression! In the case this is FND for the both of us, internalizing deprecating labels like \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cunproductive\u201d or \u201cattention-seeking\u201d may unfortunally exacerbate symptoms, especially if they occur/flare up without known cause. If you are needing disability, come up with a financial game plan first- make sure you can still afford basic living expenses &amp; healthcare for minimum 3 months. Then, if it is doable, go for it. Sending you lots of support. I can totally identify with what you are going through. I hope that you know that you are not alone and there is a community of people out there experiencing similar things. It is a terrible diagnosis and docs can be dismissive or unhelpful in creating a treatment plan that is cohesive and has good outcomes for us patients. I am 35 and i am getting mixed diagnoses from different doctors and specialists. Whatever the diagnosis is not as important as being treated like an individual and being given the steps to try to heal. If you need to take a break to focus on your health and get on disability it is worth a try. The goal is getting better and reducing all stressors! Try not to let the judgement of others determine your worth. We are worthy. You are worthy. I also had unexplained cerebellar ataxia until I was diagnosed with \u201canxiety\u201d at a movement disorder clinic. Through my own research, I learned that the correct term is functional gait disorder. I found physical therapy to be a godsend for me. I would be happy to DM you with exactly what I did to not cure my gait, but make it so I walk normally 95% of the time and when it does return, its very mild. Wishing you the best Physical therapy (in my experience) can help with the tremors, weakness, and possibly the numbness and gait freezing. CBT can help with the dissociative seizures and drop attacks. CBT and PT are the treatments for FND and with a good team, you should be able to improve. Try to find a physical therapist who knows about FND if you can, though my PT knew nothing about it and was able to basically cure my gait issues. Good luck with your symptoms. Living with this condition is so hard but getting through the diagnosis was the hardest part for me. I am so glad you have found something that helps! My next step is a movement disorder clinic, &amp; a couple people have begun asking me if I have been diagnosed with FND (not sure if that is similar to functional gait disorder). Some resources would be awesome! Thank you so much. A movement disorder clinic sounds like a great idea. Functional gait disorder is a type of functional neurological disorder, so if you have functional gait disorder, you also have functional neurological disorder. I wish you luck!", "Was my mom ableist or just a b****? Warning: cursing\n\nSo last night I (17 ftm) was having what I call an \u201cepisode\u201d. For context, an \u201cepisode\u201d is basically when most of my cognitive function goes out the window and I have the comprehension, emotional control, and motor ability of a 3/4 year old. (However, I still have understanding of more adult concepts like sex, drugs, etc.) also have memory loss and speech troubles. Because of the memory loss, I try to hold onto stuff I know for certain like my name, age, partner, and my own gender identity.\n\nSo now onto the story. I was in my episode, and my mom suddenly asked how old I was. I thought she was trying to help me so I slurred \u201cseventeen\u201d. I was so confident, and then all of a sudden my mom says \u201cno you are not\u201d. This really confused me, because I KNOW I am 17, but after she said this, I was not sure. So I whined and said \u201cyes I am\u201d. \n\n\u201cNo you are not\u201d\n\nWe went back and forth like this, with my little brother joining in (i do not blame him cause he was just following mom\u2019s example) and they kept laughing at my reactions. I felt so stupid. She asked me again how old I was and I again told her 17. She told me no again and I started crying. They continued to deny it and then when I started crawling upstairs to get away they said they were not being mean. They were just joking. \u201cYou allow us to joke about it!\u201d\n\nSo I went upstairs and was super proud I inflated my bed in that state (i am sleeping in her room cause i have symptoms in my sleep and could hurt myself). My mom essentially says it is my fault because I allow them to joke about it. It took me sobbing and saying they made me felt stupid for her to finally apologize.\n\nLater on that night, she said I was half male and female (she is partially accepted my trans identity, just cannot accept me being a boy since it means \u201closing my little girl completely\u201d), and when i protested the girl part, she ignored me and kept saying it.\n\nAm I wrong for thinking she was being ableist or is she just being a bitch? Ableist, transphobic, a bully, take your pick. My word, that is flipping awful!! That is not a safe environment for you at all. Im pretty certain that your mom is a big reason as to why you have a lot of symptoms The answer is yes.", "New to this\u2026questions, thoughts, opinions, help?? My husband was just diagnosed with FND a couple weeks ago, and since then I am trying to wrap my head around this. I am questioning the diagnosis because of the things I am reading, and posts on here. His spirits have been down since the diagnosis, when we both previously thought his issues could just be from B12 deficiency. \nEarly this year he noticed a spot on his lower leg that was numb, did not think anything much of it and went on his day. It went away, but came back a couple days later and his whole lower leg went completely numb, including the top of his foot, but not the bottom of the foot. He cannot lift his foot up, so he had to stop driving (though he has learned to drive with his left leg as of recent). Eight months later, that is still the case. The only thing that has changed is that the rest of that leg is now weak also, from the hip down. He is had bloodwork, X-RAYS, MRIs, EEGs and EMGs, and they have determined he has one nerve that is not functioning 100% that is affecting the lower leg. He was also low B12, but has been on pills for almost 7 weeks now and his level is just now back up. My understanding of FND is that there would be no finding from the EMG at all. The doctor did not even want to wait to see if anything improved after B12 supplementation before the diagnosis. There was only one other \u201cepisode\u201d where I called 911, early on after he had traction on his lower spine he had tunnel vision and nearly blacked out, but it seemed directly related to the traction and has not happened since. He stumbled and fell a couple times early on, before he realized that he could not move his leg, but he does long long walks now with a cane and has adapted, but not gotten any better, according to PT evals. \nSo, I am asking, does this sound like FND? Have any of you had/have similar, unchanging symptoms? Can we expect his feeling to come back at some point? Are there any alternative therapies, other than PT and therapy, that I should look into with him? I should also add that his neurologist had seemed like she \u201csuspected\u201d a diagnosis early on, but had to order a second EMG because his leg was too cold for the first one. Once the results came back showing there is loss of function in that singular nerve, she said it is possible it is not related to FND, that he may have injured his leg on top of all this, even though that was his first symptom. In some cases B12 pills do not seem to get absorbed well by our body's ive been told by a specialist I am B12 deficient and have tried pills but only got worse. I got shots now and I am doing a lot better. Still have neurological issues though nobody can explain, so that is where I got the FND diagnosis He requested B12 shots but she refused to give it to him, saying that if the numbers went up then absorption is fine. So now that the numbers went from less than 190 to 500, she definitely will not let him get the shots. \ud83d\ude1e I am sorry to hear that i had the same issue. And many with us unfortunately. I do not know why there is so much \"hate\" for shots they have helped me a lot. Where are you from? US. This is a military doctor. I think the problem was that she did not think a number in the 100\u2019s could cause what is going on, but from what I have read about B12 deficiency, it absolutely could. So she did not want to jump to shots, but time is of the essence with neuropathy and B12 deficiency, so it is upsetting to say the least. I want him to push for a second opinion from someone else, but he feels so defeated now. Yeah I completely understand that. I had really bad symptoms at value of 180. Try look up Drs who are experienced with neurological problems and B12 deficiency. It could be something else ofcourse but the treatment for B12 is harmless and really worth a shot. Might not fix it all, but any improvement is one to aim for. It is worth fighting for. It is hard to say from a post. If you suspect something else is up, keep pushing for further investigation. I have found explaining that I am happy to accept a diagnosis but that I would like to keep investigating in case it is not that, has helped with doctors (but I am in Canada so maybe that only works here).\n\nIt is possible a nerve was injured from an accident caused by FND, but it sounds like you are already doing the right things for recovery. \n\nI had an episode where I lost vision in my right eye and it never came back fully. Sometimes the after effects last for a long time and I am sorry you are both trying to navigate this. So sorry your going through this,\nI do not know if it is FND, probably no one knows really. Even with tests it is just such a weird diagnosis, if I was in your place I would also be unsure of his diagnosis.\n\nI also do not believe 100% in my diagnosis, and I tell my dokters, but also doing al the FND work.\n\nTill now nothing really helped, but I saw that acupuncture could help with nerve problems, FND or something else. Thank you. I will definitely look into acupuncture for him, and then try to convince him. Good luck! It is a shit diagnosis and I understand if he is tired with all of it. If you look up acupuncture and nervepain or something with nerve problem you can see it is should be super effective. So sorry to hear about your vision. That is truly awful. \nI guess the hardest thing right now is trying to push him for further investigation, without stressing him out. The numbness on his leg was his very first symptom, so it just does not seem to all line up. He just seems like he is given up. I mean, I get how frustrating it can be to wait 8 months for a diagnosis. I have dealt with countless ails throughout my adult life and it has taken me YEARS to figure out what causes my issues, and doctors have been mostly unhelpful. This is all so new to him, he is always been healthy and active. At the moment, we are stuck with military docs. Once he is out (soon!) I am hoping he can find someone who is not just going to write off our concerns.", "Trying to find people who have experienced this rare combination from FND Hi,\n\nMy sister was diagnosed after her symptoms went ignores by hospitals because it was so hard to diagnose.\n\nHer symptoms include:\n+ Full body paralysis\n+ Total memory loss\n+ Mental regression\n\nI have lived with knowing her diagnosis for years and I have not ever reached out to others who have also been affected.

", "Hemisensory Syndrome post anxiety attack on top of minor fibromyalgia. So, last year I went through an undiagnosed fever for two months right when COVID peaked in my country. Initially when the fever came I thought I had COVID after multiple fever panel tests showed no usual suspects (malaria, dengue, typhoid). The doctors did not help me calm down too. I got referred to several doctors: general physicians, gastros, neurologist, and the medicines/tests made me weaker. I had two panic attacks during that time and I was living alone which did not help. The morning after my second panic attack, I woke up and found that my left side limbs felt weird, not weaker in strength but more out of control. I went to a neuro and he suggested a 3T MRI which came clean. In my blood work the only thing off was my B12, went through a 6 months course of B12 injections and now my B12 is okay. But the thing is that even after all that I still have that left sided 'weakness'. It is a weird feeling that comes and goes. My neuro suggested that I take Duvanta-20 which is an anxiety related medicine, taking that for 6 weeks made me better but I had 'brain fog' and could not focus while on medication. So I stopped taking that. And the 'left weirdness' came back. Also, when I wash my hands my fingers prune really fast, it does not happen often but it does happen. It is been a year now and I did a lot of research on my symptoms, the only thing that could do that was a stroke, a cancer, or this thing I found called 'hemisensory syndrome'. I read all the reasearch available on Hemisensory ( there is not much) and it either happens usually because of a stroke or anxiety. I am sure it is FND, what do you guys think and what should I do next. Did they ever look for the reason your B12 was low? B12 deficiency not treated well can give massive neurological problems. I am saying this as a deficient patient not treated well for years. They gave no reasons as to why my B12 was low, I am a non-vegetarian, so ideally that should not have happened. Anyway, now I am keeping my levels in check. Complaints should be leading in treatment for B12 deficiency is what I have been told by a b12 specialist. Your bloodlevels can be high but if you still have complaints should continue treatment. My lvls are sky high but i still get shots every 48 hours for the past 5 years. If I get less i crash back in to old complaints that are gone now. I am not an addict my body just does not handle B12 well. Did not know this, thanks for this. It is really helpful. Most of the doctors that I have been to do not really do any follow ups or give reasons about the ailment. I did a 6 months B12 treatment, I thought that would have been enough, but apparently not. Thanks. Good luck and no problem. I have had the same problem, keep looking for a doctor that takes you seriously.", "before seizures do others get the glassy eyes look as my mum describes it My mum describes my eyes as looking like glass.", "I am a 14 yo male and I need some advice... I have never been diagnosed formally with FND, but the symptoms are clear and it is what my doctor thinks it is, soooo... So yesterday my dad visited and it is complicated to say the least. So by 3 pm, I snapped. I found out 3 hrs later (when I woke up in an alley and was covered in mud) that I was in a disassociative Seizure and was phisically violent with my parents and then ran off... I do not want to hurt my parents (my mom especially) but my dad has a job 2 hours away from where we live and he is not around much... Any suggestions on how to manage this would be great... Oh I love them seizures :)\n\nWell I say\n\n1. Control your stress levels. Know its easier said than done.\n2. Know your triggers\n3. Do you recal how you felt before. Do you have an Aura. If you do then I would recommend noticing it then trying to get a handle on these feelings before it goes to a full on one and getting some techniques in place to get you back down.\n4. Go to a neurologist. Only they can help. Only scans can say for certain also\n\n\nI had a bbbbaaaad seizure like your one in November? I think. It was very nasty very dangerous. My trigger was from past domestic abuse in that exact situation I felt threatens and scared so it then led to me being physically violent etc.  from what I have Been told anyway.\nBut the funny thing is you recal something very different. You will need to have a whole load of other stuff ruled out, you will need to see a neurologist and likely have bloodwork and scans performed. As far as I know the main treatment is psychotherapy. Thank you", "What is the difference between FND and PNES??  (This is just my understanding- I could be wrong) \n\nFND encompasses all things functional/dissociative- anything from a tremor to paralysis to seizures to pain.\n\nPNES specifically refers to dissociative seizures and does not include other symptoms of FND like paralysis or pain PNES is a symptom of FND. People can have PNES without FND you can have FND without PNES. My understanding is that functional neurological disorder is an umbrella term and PNES refers specifically to dissociative seizures, similar to how functional gait disorder is a more specific diagnosis for something that falls under the functional neurological disorder umbrella. I do not really understand sorry Ok so candy is a term for all sweet things. Lollipops are a sweet thing, but they are on a stick. Lollipops refers to a type of candy. Functional neurological disorder is like candy, it is a broad term. PNES is like lollipops. It is a type of functional neurological condition. That is a great metaphor 10/10 So just a question if I have pnes can I say I have fnd? Or not? Yes, if you have PNES, you have FND. Thank you I find it really confusing tbh You can have pnes as a symptom of fnd and you can also have epileptic seizures with it", "Do symptoms progress? I just saw a photo of someone who uses a wheelchair from muscle weakness after an FND episode and I should not be projecting on them, but I am freaking out. \n\nMy FND is a result of post concussion syndrome.

I noticed from the very first day I became ill my right pupil was larger than my left. I saw a video on youtube where a neurologist stated this was a common symptom in FND and a good indicator to be able to diagnose someone. Does anyone else have this? Thanks", "Does having functional seizures mean that I am likely to have FND? I have been investigating my health problems for years, and I recently went to hospital after a particularly bad seizure in front of some friends. I have been having seizures on and off for about 6 years now but they have been getting worse over time. The doctor I spoke to in the hospital that day said that he would describe my seizures as functional seizures, since I am awake and fully conscious during them, and usually remember them pretty well.\n\nSince he mentioned functional seizures, I looked into it and learned about FND. I obviously have not been diagnosed, but I match so many of the symptoms. As well as the seizures, I experience things like tremors and muscle spasms (particularly in my right leg), numbness and pins and needles, I am often falling over and some days my legs are so weak I am unable to walk. I have had rare moments of paralysis in my limbs, times where I have just been lying down unable to move, sometimes with my hands stuck in a weird tense position but I cannot move them at all. I have dealt with a lot of brain fog/confusion too. I saw a neurologist a few years ago and he said it was an essential tremor, but that does not seem to match up, especially not with the collapsing and violent spasming in my legs.\n\nI am trying to see a neurologist privately now for a second opinion, so I will be doing that as soon as I can afford it. In the meantime I am just desperately trying to make sense of things. My doctors have told me to get counselling for my anxiety to help the seizures, and I have, I have been having counselling for years due to anxiety and depression, but I feel like I am handling that quite well now and I am even doing mindfulness meditation, things like that. Almost all my anxiety right now is being caused my health issues. I am pretty much at a loss as to what to do. Not a neuro but yeah, having functional/dissociative seizures is what led to my diagnosis of FND. They are also under the term PNES- Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures ( r/PNESsupport is a great resource for that)\n\nMy neuro recommended this website/webpage to me to learn more about it and I have found it super helpful:  Thank you, I will check those resources out! I am pretty confident that my seizures are non-epileptic, but they are still horrible to deal with. Hopefully I can get some sort of official diagnosis soon, just to have a name for it would be such a relief. My family has a major essential tremor that we have passed on through several generations- mine manifested when I was 13 or 14 and has persisted (I am 31 now.) The thing about an essential tremor is that it does not typically result in dystonic spasms/issues with walking/full body symptoms. For the most part it is hands/head/mouth. \n\nI would recommend advocating for an MRI and MRA of your head/neck to rule out a vascular issue like MoyaMoya. That is what I thought, unless I have that and something else like FND. I do get very shaky hands and shaking in my jaw, but the full body symptoms have to be something else I think. I am definitely looking into getting an MRI done Uhh I think my neurologist said something that nead is in the UK at least undergoing a transition to going under the fnd label", "Doing a little poll thing so i have noticed tourette's and fnd go along with each other, and i wanted to make a chart to see how common they actually go together. so, if you have fnd, do you also have tourette's or any tic disorder?\n\n(", "Hi, new here.

To others it seems like I am constantly tired, but it happens no matter how much sleep I get, and it is involuntary, I wish I could stop it because my back hurts and my jaw does too. Also yawning makes my eyes water, so in days where it happens more, the salt in my tears actually causes the skin around my eyes to blister. I do not know how to explain to a doctor that this stretching is actually harmful, expecially when my nurologists never keep me because they discharge me as soon a I tell them I have fnd.

So different dokters have different opinions about what I have. I got diagnosed with FND on my second neuro dokter. But my first neurologist is not agreeing because I had a clear positive Babinski reflex and clonus, I still have clonus in my whole body.\n\nIn getting treated for FND Andi will just go with what they ask me to do. But I am curious if other with FND know if those hyper reflexxes are something that belongs in FND? What other symptoms do you have? I think you can have hyperreflexia and have FND but I always heard babinski is always bad. But maybe you can have a false positive. What tests have doctors done? I sometimes have a gait, poor balans, weakness in arms and legs. Headaches. It comes and goes.\nTests I had are MRI and just the little hammer to check my reflexxes. You should ask for an emg to check for neuropathy and stuff like that. The fact that your symptoms come and go though does sound functional. How did you doctors explain the babikski? Are your feet really ticklish or sensitive? Sometimes you can get a false positive if you jerk away. Have your vitamins been tested? I have had issues like these when my B12 levels were very low. Although B12 is known to cause neurological issues, it is often missed as a cause. At least where I live. Even if your levels are borderline \"good\" it can still give you issues. Yes they have been tested. I have celiac disease so they test all vit. But my vit D was super low, now it is better again and I do feel a little better, less brain fog. But a lot of my symptoms are stil there Brain fog sucks so bad, I am sorry you feel like this. Keep an eye on your vitamins, if I have learned anything it is that they are pretty important and can make you really sick if out of balance. The first time he checked I really felt the uncomfortable stretch reflex and the fanning of the toes. Second time he checked it a lot and then still it was very clear it was there, even brought a different dokter because my MRI was clean but also having Babinski. So this neurologist send me to a bigger hospital and there it did felt more ticklish and less of that heavy stretch flex. And he was not really impressed with the weak kind of Babinski. And so he said because your MRI is clean we think it is FND.\nNow yesterday I was going to my first neurologist again and he could not find my Babinski anymore, indeed maybe a little upworth because it tickled. \n\nIt is been a long process but I am sure the Babinski was there. Not sure why and how it is gone now and if that is even possible. It is been such a confusing time.\n\nThe first time my neurologist saw my reflexxes he thought I have MS.

I really understand, it was like that for me in highschool (in college now). I coped with it by knowing that people cared about me enough to pick me up when i fell, and that we could have a laugh about it. even though it was miserable for me, making light of the situation in the moment really helps.

FND is a somewhat difficult diagnosis in which doctors cannot really reccomend any courses of treatment unless they have ruled out other conditions. If you see a neurologist to get evaluated then they can give you a plan of treatment, etc.\nIn the meantime I think you should try sitting down with your parents and explaining/talking through your condition and the ways it makes you feel, emotionally and physically. Living with FND can be isolating when those closest to you do not know how to support you (trust me, I have been there). Look into getting a wheelchair if it hurts to walk. Rest and know your limits, but do not let this condition stop you from living your life by ignoring your symptoms. It sounds like you need a full medical team to do a full workup at this point. Conversion disorder is not even its actual name anymore, so any doctor using that is not going to be up on the latest anything. I agree, definitely see a neurologist and get MRI tested if you have not already, and try to avoid making it worse by taking breaks and resting as needed (it works for me.) You know your body best, you know what hurts and what feels better. Prioritize your health &amp; wellbeing over others\u2019 opinions. And find a doctor who believes you! Yes I have gotten an MRI and some things like that done, though I never really got an EYE like I thought I might since I mentioned things that are like seizures but they idmedeatly went to that they were caused by stress (not saying they could not be tho). I am honestly not sure how Is even explain it to my parenrs, they never really listen to me and my parents seem to think that it is my fault and that I can work through it somehow :\\ I will try resting, though kind of hard since I have to get up to get things and stuff. Thanks! Though I am not sure how to convince my parents that it is not my fault and that I cannot just push through it? I will try resting as much as I can though. I saw a neurologist before and I have had an MRI done too, they all agreed on the diagnosis I am not sure how to do that :\\, and if its not called conversion disorder what is it called? Functional Neurological Disorder. \n\nConversion disorder is an outdated psych term, and it is been proven wrong. \n\nFND is basically a software problem in the brain. If they prove there is nothing wrong with the hardware (MRI of brain and spine are needed for that, plus blood tests to rule out rheumatology diseases), that leaves the software, and we do not know enough about that yet. For getting a medical team, you have a couple of options (obviously based on where you are). \n\n1. Talk with your doctor about all the tests you need and which specialists should be involved. If they blow you off, get a new doctor. \n\n2. Call up the referral program at the closest big medical center and see if they will take your case. You see all the specialists quickly, get all the tests, and get a diagnosis quickly. Oh okay, thanks! Oooh okay, that makes sense, thanks again", "Does anyone feel guilt or shame over their diagnosis? Does anyone feel guilt or shame over their diagnosis ? I really did not before but I am struggling with it now. I really do not have anxiety or trauma in my past, but I feel like my diagnosis and symptoms are causing me stress and emotional pain. Actually, I have a Fitbit that tracks stress response and as soon as my flare started my stress got worse on the tracker so there is even data to back up what I already know feeling wise.  My psychiatrist kept putting off giving me an actual diagnosis. It was suggested and hinted at, but I had to insist on him actually giving me a name for what was wrong. I think this is part of why. Like it was so bad he was ashamed to even tell me what was wrong, or possibly even lying. I do not shame others for having illness, and already have a highly stigmatized mental illness, bipolar disorder but it seems like the FND stigma is even worse, even by doctors. You are not alone. I struggle with trauma, cptsd for me and mega mega tress and anxiety, when FND was triggered I felt shame and guilt thinking it was me, my fault.\n\nOver time, bit by bit as I worked on my trauma, how to deal with stress and anxiety and what triggers it, doing this I could connect and see where these triggers were actually causing FND reactions.\n\nBy working on the trauma and my mental health and my responses to difficult things, I realised that my body and the FND was not shameful, was not a blame or guilt thing, FND was my bodies overload mode.\n\nIt was and is trying to protect me from everything I struggle with and also talk to me, its trying to tell me when there is a trigger so that I can understand, learn about it and see if there is there is way I can respond to the trigger that is better for me, all so that I can heal.\n\nLet go of the shame that isnt yours, listen to what ur body is saying, you will improve, you will see change and you will slowly slowly see how ur healing.\n\nMuch love, keep going, it does get better even during the times u want to scream xx All day, every day, and I swear that makes it worse.", "How do you use a wheelchair with one hand?

I do not know what is happening or why.  Symptoms of FND vary from person to person - you and I may have entirely different symptoms yet have the same condition. \n\nMy neuro told me to go to this website for more info about FND as a whole. Under \"symptoms\" you can find symptoms that may present with FND, though rarely will a person have all of them. Under \"Causes\" there is \"how has it happened\" and \"why has it happened\" which are key reads. Take your time going through it, try not to panic, and know that even if it does not seem like it right now, you are going to be okay.\n\n The neurosymptoms site mentioned and the FNDhope.org site are great resources. This YouTube playlist can also be helpful for movement disorder issues: \n\nIt may be difficult to pin down exactly what caused your FND as there is not enough research to fully understand the mechanism or pathogenesis. FND can happen out of nowhere, following a medical procedure (surgery) or vaccine (like flu shot), after an infectious illness, etc. Some people in the FND Hope Facebook groups have mentioned developing FND after a COVID-19 infection or a covid vaccine, so it is a possible trigger. neurosymptoms.org is a great site! \n\nTake your time, breathe.

For the love of god, go back into that office and demand that he write down the reason he is denying you medication, against other doctors medical advice. And tell him you want to see those records as he signs them. Watch him suddenly go quiet real quick and change his tune. i wish i could! they keep moving my outpatient appointment. was supposed to be within 3 months then got moved to november. i did not realise that you could ask to see your records? all i have ever had is my discharge papers which are useless tbh. he said that there is no evidence that medication helps fnd and it was just emergency doctors &amp; icu over reacting so it is left me feeling very confused the past few months on whos opinion to trust :/. i will definitely be making sure he writes it down in my notes that it is him refusing it!

Hi there, I am new to this sub. \nJust wondering if anyone tends to experience a worsening or recurrence of symptoms leading up to or during menstruation? \n\nIt is a consistent thing for me, and just wondering if others experience it. Yes. I am 34 now, experienced FND symptoms (unknowingly) as young as I can remember and my period made it worse (prior to my IUD). I was first severely and uncontrollably and unpredictably presenting FND symptoms starting before (but increasing) with menstruation at age 13. I qualified for Mirena in the early 2000s and only had gap in use in 2016, during which my symptoms tanked. Personally my IUD helped me gain minimal FND symptom control. I am honestly terrified about pregnancy. I can not tell if removing my IUD would trigger a relapse\u2026much less if a pregnancy would result in a similar situation resulting in fetal/baby/personal death or complications. Hey, thanks so much for your response. I could not find anything about it online (I guess not surprising, as there is so little research into FND). But if symptoms can worsen with physical or emotional stress, it makes sense that hormonal changes could impact things. I admin a independent 4k plus group on Facebook listed on NIHs website as an approved support group. Mostly central to North America but we strive for inclusion. Come join us! ( Thanks! Will check it out My FND is anxiety related so if I get worried about stuff like leaking, am I going to get the chance to change pads etc. Then yeah, it can spike up Thanks for your response! Looking back, I think they were my first FND symptoms, and i was just diagnosed Nov 2020. \n\nWhen I was 16 (in 1982), I fainted every month when my period started. I would be sitting in chemistry class, at 10:00 in the morning and jump up and run to the bathroom, then I would faint. They would call the nurse, put me in a wheelchair, call my mom and she would have to come get me. At first my chem teacher (who we all loved) was freaked out. Eventually, he would not even break his stride, just kept teaching. Wow that is quite a story, thank you for sharing! \n\nOne theory I have is that menstruation can lead to worsening symptoms because menstruation increases inflammation in the body, and one theory for the mechanism behind FND is that inflammation causes the nervous system to misfire. \n\nThen there is also the emotional/ stress component of both FND and hormonal changes, for those where emotions are connected to their symptoms (I know that is not everyone, it surely is for me). yes mine was way worse around my period! i would suggest going on birth control and skipping the placebos. that prevents you from getting your period and has worked for me for 8+ months! Ah interesting! I found that going on sertraline helped (SSRI). I went from having symptoms a week leading up to period to just a day. \n\nI tried birth control 10 years ago (before FND) and it gave me severe anxiety. Awesome that it is working for you though! i am on an SSRI too! i am so sorry birth control did not work for you! i do not know how old you are but i am quite young, i am 14, so maybe it had something to do with different hormones\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\ni am glad you have found something that is helpful! Yeah maybe! I am 30 now and was 20 when I tried.

Hey everyone! Hopefully I can find support here as I need some help figuring out whether what I am experiencing now may have been exacerbated by my recent use of delta8. \n\nI am planning on seeing a doctor soon to talk about everything going on, but wanted to also post here and see if there is any insight I can glean.\n\nI am a 25 year old female who is suffered from depression most of my life. However, within the past year I have developed something really unsettling and I need help figuring out what it is, what is going on, and how to treat it (if possible).\n\nI have been on six different antidepressants from age 18 to 24. But it all started after I started taking Wellbutrin SR (Or, the instant/faster release than Wellbutrin XL). I took Wellbutrin SR 300mg for about two days. The first day, I noticed feeling a little bit odd, but nothing major. The second day was when things got weird.\n\nI was going about my business, and around 7pm at night, as I was skyping a friend, my mind went completely slate blank, I forgot what I was saying, my tongue started feeling really numb/lazy and I immediately told her, \"I need to be right back\", and went to my parents in the other room and told them what was going on.\n\nShortly after I arrived in the room and sat on the couch, I started experiencing uncontrollable tremors throughout my entire body. I also had difficulty speaking and difficulty swallowing/moving my tongue. \n\nMy parents, obviously worried, told me to stop taking the medication, drink water, and lay down in bed. They stayed in the room with me and brought our dog to comfort me. The tremors went on for about an hour and a half, maybe more. It was not until I went pee later that night that I felt world's better.\n\nI went to my doctor several days later and told her what happened and how I did not want to take the instant release medication anymore, so she put me back on Wellbutrin XL. Unfortunately, now Wellbutrin XL started bringing those symptoms back so I weaned off my antidepressants completely.\n\nIt is been roughly six or so months since that incident and I am still experiencing \"episodes\" of that night to this day. Personally, ever since then, I really have not felt the same.\n\nIt is been periodic. Sometimes happening once a week, sometimes happening once every several weeks.\n\nSometimes it manifests itself in just a weird, lazy tongue feeling, difficulty swallowing. Sometimes it manifests itself in me having a hard time breathing. Other times, I experience a weird dull headache followed by full-on body tremors like usual and difficulty speaking.\n\nHowever - ever since a bad experience with delta-8 gummies, it is been pretty bad.\n\nI took 25mg of a delta8 gummy from a reputable place on Saturday of last weekend and I had an extremely bad panic/paranoia episode from it that lasted at least 8+ hours. The store I went to and purchased it from said 25mg would not be too much, and it hit me like a brick.\n\nEver since that incident, I have experienced body tremors at least four times this week.\n\nMost of the time, these episodes do not last long. But, as of recently, like the other day, the body tremors and difficulty speaking lasted at least an hour and a half.\n\nI do not believe it is anxiety because I am not an anxious person, however, I have noticed my anxiety increase recently. I do not know if it is seizures. \n\nEither way, I am really earnestly looking for some advice/help on the matter as to what could be going on because it is starting to really concern me.\n\nI stopped taking Wellbutrin right after that incident and am no longer on medication. So, I was not taking Wellbutrin when I took delta8 last Saturday My depression surprisingly is okay, but now I am left with these troubling symptoms.\n\nAs of now, this is what I experience daily (some of these symptoms happen all at once, sometimes they happen independent of one another):\n\n- uncontrollable body tremors (especially worsening when stress or overwhelmed)\n- numb/lazy tongue feeling which leads to difficulty speaking\n- mind blanking/going blank\n- mild forgetfulness\n- tightness in the jaw/jaw clenching\n- random body aches\n- random dull headaches\n- sometimes pain in my back", "Help How to get out of this hell hole\n\nI am an 18 M. Got sporadic nonpainful twitches 2 weeks ago starting from legs and mostly on the left side of the body. Got a clean EMG of the limbs a few days after the twitches started.\n\nWell a few days after my voice was definitely raspier not perceived. I could not sing high notes like I used to or sing long. I would lose breath easily. My jaw would also get tired while eating and I eventually had so much trouble swallowing. My smile also looked shorter then compared to old pictures. My mouth turned numb. I do not slur at all but my voice is weak.\n\nWent to an ENT 3 times and they had no answers so I got nervous as hell. It is like why the heck am I having all these throat issues and fasciculations. My neck started to tighten. I got fasciculations in my neck when eating or smiling.\n\nSo then I go to Mayo Clinic the best hospital in the world. The neuro did a clinical exam and I did perfectly. But these fasciculations keep spreading. I now have increasing fasciculations on my right side. I literally have it on my calves, eyes, face, cheeks, jaw, feet, abs, back, arms, throat, and it is spreading across my thighs. Btw I also found out I had a cellulitis infection in my neck so idk if that increased the twitches. But the cellulitis does not cause swallowing or other issues.\n\nAll the doctors at Mayo have ruled out that disease. But why do I still fear it. These twitches keep spreading everywhere. My jaw gets tired after a few bites. Btw I have no vitamin deficiencies so I have no clue where the twitches started from. I have had three neuros and multiple doctors saying it is not neurological. I also got MRIs and CTs that were normal. When I rest I get more twitching. Can someone give me advice I am just spiraling downwards. I even have twitches when I am calm.\n\nSo then I get diagnosed with FND. But like I am not even anxious when I get these symptoms. They are so real. The twitches keep spreading. I have literally never had issues like this in my life. All these things just happened so suddenly. Can anyone give me advice. I am so sorry that is happening to you. Nothing is more painful than not being understood.\n\nI can give advice for what helps with my twitches spams all beit they are not continuous or like yours I might be able to help?\n\nI do not do any physical exertion or very minimal. I have found that makes it worse. I do very slow stretching yoga and that can reduce my pain. I then focus on good things like ill read a book or watch my favourite TV that just distracts me. Some peoplw with fnd find their symptoms can ease when they do not focus so heavily on them and instead focus on good things. It does something to the brain.\n\nThat is all I can say really just try to distract yourself when you are resting like books maths I am dojng a math course cause of this illness and it helps keep the brain distracted and I have found it very therapeutic. If maths are not your thing then art or sewing or soenthing with your hands you know? Yea it feels like no one understands me. They all just put it to the anxiety category. I literally have videos of these twitches. But like I have no clue what to do now. I have never had medical symptoms like this ever. It all happened this month. I have had no history of anxiety and depression. Man I do not know what to do. But ty for the advice. Awe God im sorry. I hate hate hate people that put it down to anxiety! It is so so overused! It makes me so angry \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude20I am in that boat now to trying to get answers it is all made so hard and you feel so alone during it all. Maybe try to find a fnd specialist who can help? Some say we will my neurologist said that physiotherapy and CBT can help. Often caused by a stress, physical or mental. There is a you tube of a gymnast who knocked her knee before getting it, but ptsd type stuff can also do it. It is just a bitch.\n\nIt used to be called conversion syndrome and possibly hysteria.\n\nI recommend looking at FNDHope website\n\nI often have ear phones on a listen to intellectually interesting stuff to keep my mid occupied while my body can get on with everything else.\n\nNoise and bustle are 2 large triggers for me, especially excessive shaking, but I can also freeze trying to cross the join between two paving stones.\n\nIt is bizzare I have constant twitching all over. I also have pain and tremors. Clean emg and mri. I hate this. A lot of your throat and mouth problems sound like tmj or really bad anxiety. My throat gets tight sometimes if I think about it. Did this happen after taking any antibiotics? I am sorry they are saying it is anxiety. The more research that is done, the more they are finding that it is neuro. Just in pathways that are not completely understood yet. A lot of FND patients do have a history of PTSD, abuse or anxiety, but not all. Some have a history of a concussion, or very painful surgery, or some other event that aggravated the pathways in their brain.

I have no idea what is wrong with my body.  \n\nDesperately need help!! I have been chasing a diagnosis for the past 2 years and I am losing patience.\n\nA bit of info about me/my medical background; I am a 20 year old woman from the Netherlands, diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma (at the age of 13) and Type I diabetes (at the age of 14). Since 2020, I have been chasing a diagnosis concerning multiple symptoms but I have reached a dead-end. It all started in mid 2020 when I suddenly lost control over my toes (left foot), I could not bend them which left me worried. I went to my GP the following day, they had no idea what was going on so I was sent to a hospital. The neurologist has ran multiple tests, an MRI and an electromyography (EMG), the MRI results showed the following: small area of increased signal intensity in the myelum at level C6-C7, dubious white matter lesion periventricular right, small non-specific white matter lesion at the center semioval/nucleus lentiform junction on the right (the MRI was done with contrast). Apparently the results were cleared and not relevant enough for further investigation. Hence the doctor referred me to an academic hospital where rare conditions are diagnosed, so I presumed I would finally get a diagnosis and stop living with this uncertainty. This time around however, the neurologist mentioned a \u2018functional disorder\u2019, but never really elaborated on what it meant and any further steps I should take. To me, this was a last resort as upon further investigation of what the diagnosis actually meant, there was absolutely no mental health consideration or questions regarding any psychological issues in the past. My neurological symptoms progressed from myoclonus before going to sleep to toe twitching, fingers moving involuntarily, right arm twitches when my right toes twitch, head/neck twitches at times, facial twitching (lower eyelid, eyebrow), brain fog, the sensation of something crawling on my skin and slurred speech at times.\n\nThroughout this entire process, from mid December 2020 until begin 2022, I have had many monthly blood tests which all of them (literally every single one of them) showcase high levels of infection/inflammation (CRP, thrombocytes, leukocytes, ESR etc). The neurologists had no idea as to the reasonings behind the elevated levels and asked me to request an appointment with my doctor in charge of my diabetes. I asked the doctor why the results were elevated, he had no idea and resorted to \u2018It is probably just your diabetes\u2019, when my HbA1c levels were fine. Until this day, I have no idea what is going on inside my body and why I feel so restless and sick all this time.\n\nAnother reoccurring symptom I requested an appointment for was a high hear-beat than rest. My average heartbeat is 111 seconds per minute at rest, so I was diagnosed with sinus tachycardia but \u201cno significant arrhythmia objectified\u201d so no further investigation. So I was once again cleared home with the exact same excuse of: \u2018you are young, you seem healthy you have nothing to worry about\u2019. Again, I I regularly have pain behind my eyes and eyebrows, sometimes reaching the area behind my teeth, which was diagnosed as a migraine and I was given birth control to treat it (crazy) which did absolutely nothing and I was once again sent home without an answer, without investigations as to why I have certain symptoms, absolutely nothing. But I am in pain every single day, and it just gets worse overtime. These are some more symptoms I am experiencing:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Lower leg pain often, sometimes it travels up to my thighs (super painful burning feeling, cannot move my legs)\n* Episodes of 2-25secs of pain in back of head and face close to ear\n* Episodes of sharp pain below my smallest toe on my left foot\n* Painful shock in nerve (sometimes) when using force like picking something up\n* Very recent; pain in ear accompanied by tinnitus and popping sounds\n* Pain in wrist area to the point where I cannot use my hand, veins swell up\n* Headache (possibly migraine) accompanied by sensitivity to sound and noise\n* Not sure how relevant this is but I get extreme period cramps which resulted into having to go to the ER (went to the GP regarding a possible endometriosis diagnosis; was offered birth control (the pill) instead)\n* Cold sensation in face (behind eyes, mouth, eyebrows)\n\nI feel like I am constantly suffering and constantly in pain without any medication or relief. I have gone to 3 different hospitals, multiple different doctors but I am slowly losing hope. I am only 20 years of age and I am worried that it will progressively get worse throughout the years. I am not taken seriously due to my age and the doctors constantly shift whatever symptoms I am experiencing to alleged stress because I am a student. Although stress is a factor in my life, it is not as prevalent to the degree that it has caused all these complaints. I do not really know how what my next step should be, whether I should contact doctors abroad or continue seeking answers.

Also, a good massage can do wonders. As others have mentioned, water is good. Take a nice bath with epsom salt.  \nI personally take CBD orally and have a natural CBD ointment, and rubbing peppermint oil on especially tender spots works well. Curcumin (turmeric) and ginger have painkilling properties as well, and I usually have those as tea.

But you can try skullcap tea for spasitaty. It is a natural herb. Ok thank you! I took baclofen at bedtime for a while. It was wonderful, it helped me sleep, and calmed some spasms in my neck. At first it can make you a little sleepy during by the day, but that gets better. Definitely worth asking your doctor about it. He/she knows your condition best and can give you the best advice. I have been taking Baclofen regularly for about 6 months, it has helped with my tendency to muscle lock in my sleep and helps me sleep comfortably. I do not take it during the day at all though, so cannot speak to daytime usage. Thanks appreciate your input! Thanks for the info!", "DAE experience symptoms like these? Hey! It is my first post on here, so I am sorry if this is weirdly formatted or something. \n\nI have been diagnosed with FND for a while, and just wanted to know if other people experience similar symptoms as myself.\n\nFor me, my symptoms are more mild.\nI experience: \n- tics\n- brain fog and memory problems\n- stuttering\n- functional dystonia (limb \"locking\")\n- PNES (the staring and unresponsive type)\n\nDoes anyone else experience these symptoms? If so, what helps you manage these symptoms?", "Tonight be like... Went out for dinner tonight, then walked 550 yards and back to for ice cream. I am so fricking exhausted and out of breathe wtf I feel you. *Internet hug*\n\nI am in a pain program right now, and some of the best advice I have gotten is to stop doing something before I start to feel the effects and slowly build up. So, around the house, it is timers (wash dishes for ten minutes, rest, that sort of thing). I am still learning this part for myself, but I am finding it really helps. \n\nYou likely were at your limit at the restaurant (lots to ping the nerves there!), so the walking and all were too much, let alone the stairs at the end. \n\nInstead of saying you are getting weaker, it is more that your nervous system is getting more sensitive and needs more breaks. That is all. It is not a bad thing to need rest. Next time, what if you sit and rest while the others get ice cream and you focus on deep breaths and calming your nerves down, resting until they get back with your ice cream? Sometimes I can do that and recover after about 5 mins of rest. Sometimes that will be so much my legs will feel like they are not really legs, just jello in place of them. Climbing the stairs alone is absolutely terrifying and it is amazing you did that, even tho it felt terrible afterwards. I like to think that when I do things that pushed too far past my limit, it just means that in an apocalypse I will be able to do it too and maybe I will survive just a bit longer. Idk if this helps you at all but I am 100% with you on just how much it sucks Morning after, my legs feel weird. In a lot of pain, tingly but numb and extremely weak. My fienc\u00e9 is coming over soon to help me today. This is agony.... I have that with my legs. They are telling you to rest. Do hot Epsom salt baths help? Or at least really warm? I guess I cannot complain. The worst that happened to me was I dropped a tub of mini tomatoes at the grocery store because my arms suddenly went numb and I had to wait in the parking lot for a while before I could feel them well enough to drive home. Epsom salt baths seem to help in a situation like yours though. I hope you feel better soon! Wow that is a lot of stuff!

My mom was very upset and confused and actually chewed me out for two hours straight when I first started having symptoms because she thought it was somehow my fault or I was on drugs or something. However, she gets it now and brought me a warm cup of tea the other night and helped take my trash out when I was having a relapse. It may take time for everything to come around and your family to understand. But, their behavior now is not ok.

I hope your situation improves! i am really sorry that happened! thank you for the support, i am very hopeful that will be the case as well. DO NOT start using a wheelchair, your body will have a harder time doing more.  she is right, you need to press yourself more, not start using a wheelchair due to things being hard.  some never get back out of it once they lose muscle tone.\n\nshe is wrong in saying she wants you to go back to normal, but using a wheelchair will most likely cause you to decline faster. sometimes i literally have no other choice, my legs are sometimes completely paralyzed and i have no way of doing anything whatsoever. my legs get so bad even when i do try to walk to the point where i fall down the stairs and injure myself very badly. i try my best to walk whenever i can, i like walking around. it is just way too painful and impossible sometimes. i have never been in a wheelchair except in a school one when my legs were paralyzed and they had to take me to the hospital because of a seizure. i try to not be in a wheelchair i just think it would be wise to have one when needing to get around when my legs do not work.", "How can I help my friend who has just been diagnosed with FND?

That really sucks, I am sorry. Know that those few months were not for nothing- they still matter! You still went that long without a seizure- that is a positive thing!

I was just diagnosed with a Functional Movement Disorder after a few months of progressively worsening symptoms (uncontrollable spastic head, shoulder, arm, mouth, and tongue movements), and although my doctors have been very supportive and validating, because this was presented to me as a \"psychological issue\" has me spiralling. I have had major depressive disorder, anxiety, and either BPD or bipolar type 2 (no consensus yet from docs/therapists) for 20 years, and I have been working weekly with a therapist for the past 3 years. Things were going really well and I was getting better, until I had another major depressive episode right before my FMD started. I feel like a failure for not managing my mental illnesses better, and I keep thinking that if I did not slip into a depressive episode, if I had only fought harder, this would not have happened. Anyone have any tips on dealing with feeling this way? That whole psych issue thing is highly problematic with this disorder. They are a lot of people who have the exact same symptoms and the exact same disorder as you who do not have a history of trauma. There is absolutely no way this is your fault. It just happens, and we do not know why. This is not your fault love. You cannot control the ways in which to ur brain responds and reacts to stress. you are doing your absolute best with a terrible hand you have been dealt and i am proud that you are still going and fighting so hard while dealing with all of this. I relate 100%. I have functional gait disorder and when I was told that is what it was, I had this overwhelming sense of guilt like I had caused it and I had made everyone care for me and worry about me for no reason. The truth is that this is a neurological disorder, an electrical issue in the brain where signals are being sent down the wrong pathways. The right pathways are there, but the brain has gotten stuck using the wrong ones for some reason. While psychological issues play a role in the development of the disorder, they play a role in the development and worsening of all disorders. Try to think of a condition that does not worsen with anxiety. It does not exist. Autoimmune diseases can be brought on by periods of severe stress alone. In addition, there are many other factors that predispose a person do developing FND that have nothing to do with psychology. Just like your depression and any other condition you may suffer from is not your fault, your FND is not your fault. Nobody wants this. Period. It is been proven that FND is not psychological. Just because science cannot track/detect/diagnose/treat the symptoms does not make the symptoms self created. We have no control over this. 1. It is not your fault\n2. It is your brain not communicating with the rest of your body well. Kind Of like it is talking in a different language\n3. Not everyone with fnd has a history of mental illness or traumas.\n4.

I am learning them and how it affects them etc. However, as its an ever changing condition and symptoms can come out of no where, I was wondering in general what things I could do that would help. \n\nIs there anything that has helped you?\n\nSome of her current symptoms are:\n\n* Seizures (non epileptic)\n* Tics\n* Blindness (cant open eyes) at times, currently only during seizures\n* cant talk/stutters a lot\n* Struggles with mobility\n\nI want to make things as easier as possible on her and learn more about this condition myself. First of all, believe them. That is the most important thing.\n\nSecond, it really helps if you do not put all of the chores or cleaning or anything on them. Help out. Do the laundry, sweep the floor, that kind of stuff.\n\nLastly, if the tics and seizures start ramping up, there is usually a cause. They might still be trying to figure that out, but it is often overstimulation of some sort. That would be the time to turn TV off, turn music off, use a quieter voice, stuff like that. One of the things that helps me most is just trying to make the most of all my day however I am feeling. So on days when I am getting blurry vision and cant watch TV then it means a lot to me if my friends are willing to come over/call on the phone to chat for a while so I can still enjoy the day. It also helps a lot to know that people care...whether this means they ask how I am or ask how appointments went or come with me occasionally or are intrigued to find out how my FND affects me.\n\nIt is worth asking them if they have any particular triggers egbright lights . You may know anxiety/stress can also be linked to FND, and for some people like me I feel particular topics are triggers and are best to avoid.\nIts good for them to try to be as independent/responsible as possible but it may really help them to have someone help them out from time to time with household stuff... Cooking a meal or other chores... And also just encouraging them when they are feeling low or struggling to get out of bed.\n\nThanks for asking, it shows that you care.\n\nP.S. Hope I have not waffled on too much I have similar symptoms and my partner does the following to help me. (Not sure if it will help your partner, as you know, the symptoms affect everyone differently, but I hope it does!)\n\n1.\tHe will ask me to tap on something if I am not already tapping, as tapping helps me regain control of my body. \n\n2.\tHe will ask if I can sit, look straight ahead, put my back against a seat, and my hands on my knees. This is a position I learned in physical therapy that I have asked him to remind me of in times with certain symptoms. In PT they said it has some sort of reset effect on the nervous system.\n\n3.\tHe will use a surprising prompt that triggers an automatic reaction. For example, \u201cOh, it got on your shirt.\u201d It momentarily shifts my focus, which helps me direct more attention into staying focused. Thank you. \n\nI have noticed that sometimes if I say or do something silly then it can bring her out of a light seizure or stop some tics so I will keep that up. \n\nThe tapping sounds like an interesting one. I will definitely see how she reacts to that. Thank you for the detailed response. \n\nFor sure any anxiety or stress does seem to flair up her symptoms. But also over doing it, she had seizures that were like every 30 minutes for like 4-5 days straight a few months ago. \n\nPart of the problem I have with helping with chores etc is she is very stubborn. I think partly it is because she does not want to let FND stop her doing \"normal\" things. Otherwise, I would offer to do things like clean for her etc even though we do not live together. \n\nDo you have any advice on how I could approach that? I am already planning on doing 99% of the household chores when we live together. I work from home, so it is easier for me to do most while I am working anyway. \n\nOn the overstimulation, that is interesting. I will need to see if there is a pattern to what triggers them. Maybe with a bit of work we can reduce their frequency. Thank you! Sorry for delay\n\n&gt;she had seizures that were like every 30 minutes for like 4-5 days straight a few months ago.\n\n^That sounds really tough \ud83d\ude41\n\nTbh it is hard knowing how best to approach it. Because in a way I can relate to the feeling of not wanting to have everything done for me. Partly because I felt like a kid being looked after and partly I  felt like a burden if everyone is doing stuff to look after me. In the end I (25) kept getting annoyed with it so I just sat down with family and had an open conversation. I told them how it made me feel and since then I have felt a bit better.\n\nIt might be worth just telling her you are happy to help and asking her if she would like you to do any chores when you come over? And if she says no you could try ask her why or chat about it. But if she still says no, best not push it.\n\nFeelings about being disabled/having a long term health condition are complex. It is very easy to end up feeling like you are just a burden to everyone. I have found having people I care about being emotionally supportive has helped.

That is a really good question that I am not sure the answer to but i know that FND seizures are usually dissociative and dissociation can cause trances which look like someone staring off into space, not moving, and unresponsive. What are your symptoms, if you do not mind me asking? Oh I see! I often have trances like that as I heavily dissociate. As for symptoms I have temporary paralysis in my legs randomly, migraines, dissociation, joint paint, numbness and tingling, weakness. Tics and twitches, muscle spasms, tremors. Thank you for your help! Well I am not a doctor so I cannot say much but your symptoms could certainly be due to FND. Hi!\n\nDissociative seizures were the first symptom of FND to appear for me- or at least the first that I recognized to be an issue. My seizures mimic focal seizures- they only affect half my body and I am fully aware during them, I just cannot do anything to stop them. \n\nDo you get auras before yours'? If so is the aura more emotional- sweaty palms, fear of death, rapid heartbeat- or is it more physical - seeing something, blurry vision, odd smells? If it is more emotional that may lean your neurologist towards FND rather than epilepsy. Ooh I see!! I definitely feel the aura it is exactly the sweaty palms, fear of death, rapid heartbeat. I feel like I am having a heart attack. Same. That horrible dread in your stomach really makes you recognize how fragile life is does not it? Know that as much as these seizures suck they will not hurt you- you are not going to die, the seizure will end, and you are going to feel better after. Thank you that means and helps a lot. Not trying to be pedantic, when you say \"feel better after\" do you mean that you feel OK because you are no longer seizuring or that the seizure gives you a spell of relief from your other FND symptoms? No worries! I should have specified: In my case I feel better after because I am no longer seizing - it is so nice to be able to control my body again after losing that ability for a while.\n\nI have read that for some people they get relief from other FND symptoms after their seizure, though that is never been the case with me- mine seem to worsen actually That why I was asking really. I have not been diagnosed with FND, but it is erie how well the symptoms fit and I tick all of the risk factor boxes.\n\nBefore my 1st seizure I had dizziness and nausea for a couple of months. In the time immediately after the seizure I felt the best I had in months, was able to eat well, felt steady. The dizziness and nausea all came back, and I have not noticed that phenomenon after any of the subsequent seizures that I have had. I just wondered if that was a common phenomenon. I have never had an unconscious, fall-on-the-floor, tongue-biting, mouth-foaming type of seizure. Mine are jerky and I sometime make weird groany/moany noises. I can hear what is going on around me including the weird noises I am making, and hear people talking to me (usually saying 'Are you okay!?!') but I am not able to process my thoughts and turn them into words/speak back to tell them I am fine. And obviously I am not able to control my movements, I just jerk til its over. It is a weird feeling, being aware but having no control. Same! But it is eye lid fluttering for me or full body spasms.

I do not have paralysis, just weakness. I also do not have seizures, just tremor events where part of or my whole body shakes but I am aware and cognizant of what is going on.

CBD helps. yes, you can have it without paralysis. to have FND, you do not have to have paralysis. weak limbs is a symptom of FND. coping with seizures is hard, i have a supportive system so it is more bearable. strangers staring at me is very annoying and scary for me, but i just have to remember i cannot really control it. also, yes! i feel like this a lot, including my TS. that is called imposter syndrome.", "A discord for everyone woth seizures (epileptic, non epileptic and unknown) ", "Need support I got diagnosed with Conversion Disorder back in august and I was just wondering if anyone else experiences this when they have their seizures but whenever I get them everything around me goes white and I sometimes have an outer body experience and I will have pain in the top of my head and the tips of my toes and fingers and sometimes I cannot breath or move but I am conscious of the entire them and usually when it happened I lose my vision and everything goes white and I am incoherent but it usually only last a minute or a few seconds but it is very unpleasant and scary and I just want to know if I am not the only one who experiences this.\n\nI have had testing and imaging done and mris and they did not find anything and said everything is stress induced but sometimes it even happens in my sleep or it will happen randomly even when I am not stressed and it will make me really scared and panicky and I am not having too much luck getting the therapy I need in my area because of the stigma around conversion disorder and I am not entirely sure how to cope with it. You have come to the right place! Check out the website  it was created by a neurologist who specializes in this. Lots of good information there. Also look at the sub PNES support. It is very active, and lots of good support. I call that graying out, but that usually only happens when my pain level gets that high. When everything goes white, I pass out entirely and lose consciousness. That, so far, has only happened when my pain level gets to that point.\n\nThe pain on the top of the head thing is something I have all the time.

For some background knowledge I also have hEDS, chronic migraine and suspected POTS.\n\nBasically I keep having numbness and lack of heat sensitivity mostly in my toes (but other motor issues too such as my fingers and hands) to the point that I could not feel that my hot water bottle had burst it is contents all over me until I realised my butt was a bit damp\u2026 I would been sitting there for 15 mins at this point. \n\nWith my toes and fingers it makes it harder to walk and grip things in my hands. It is almost like my hands or toes just get to a point within a minute or two of activity and then either go numb and stiff or they (my hands and fingers) will not move like I want them to, like they are trying to move through water almost, it is very odd.\n\nWas just wondering if this is common in people with FND and if anyone has any tips please haha.

I asked if I would be able to improve enough to do my job again, and he could not answer. My movement disability could be accommodated, but the seizures, pain, cognitive impairment, incontinence, paralysis, disassociation, cramping, speaking and vision issues will likely not improve with these therapies, and I need those functions to do my job well. \n\nIs there a resource available  or advice about if I am permanently disabled and unable to do this type of work again?", "Does anyone else have visual changes because of FND?

(hammer to knee, pinching my foot and scratching my foot) and a few movement tests. (over flexing my knee, testing my hip joint and testing my ankle joint). I have had a PAO for hip dysplasia and i have mobility range issues in my right hip, which he did not notice/acknowledge after i told him. He put \u201cno abnormalities in my file\u201d he also tested my neck. He told me, while speaking to me like im a child that I have Functional Neurological Disorder. Or Conversion Disorder.  (with other words, there is no physical explanation. My hardware is not bad, my software is)\n\nI told him that my mom almost died of a B12 and folic acid deficiency. And asked him if maybe that could explain my symptoms. He told me he had no knowledge of B12 but that B12 does not cause neurological symptoms. \n\n(i didnt dare tell him that i have been bitten by a tick once because i didnt want to look like a google fanatic.)\n\nHe scheduled a follow up appointment and told me to google my symptoms and ask questions next time. He also told me that if i really insisted he would make an xray. But since this was his profession and since he did his tests there would be no way it could proof actual nerve/neurological damage.\n\nI am just annoyed and shook.

Hyperreflexivity can be a sign of nervous system damage but it was a sign of being a healthy if anxious teenage girl in me. I could not find as much info on the babinski sign so I am not sure about that one, but it is good to keep in mind that FND can mimic any neurological disorder, though some symptoms are less likely to appear in FND than others.

The way it presents to me is, i call it a fake seizure. \nOut of nowhere my eyes went in to a forced position (upper right corner) and my head had the same forced position and then suddenly my jaws locked shut, very cramped jaw and my whole body started shaking. \nI never had this before so my parents called a doctor who called for an ambulance. \n\nThey ended up taking me to the hospital because it could be neurological but after a bunch of tests they explained what FND is. \n\nAfter being in my episode for 5 hours they gave me oxazepam to help my body relax and that helped very good but it took me over a week to recover from that.\nAside from being unusually tired that day I am not sure I could have seen ut coming.\n\nSecond episode I do not think I had anything before it started, my neck suddenly felt funny, i sat up and it started immediately again.\n\nThe times after I have felt unusually tired many times bit only a dew FND episodes so im not sure that is linked.\n\nI was really wondering if you have any 'tells' that warn you it is starting later?\nAnd what are some triggers you notice in yourself? Hi, I was diagnosed with FND back in January. I also have PTSD, gastroparesis, OCD, depression, and anxiety. It is been a rollercoaster. I have symptoms like paralysis that can last for months, sensory issues, fatigue, memory issues, etc. I think that what you are going through is very valid.\n\nPersonally, with my non epileptic seizures, I can feel my full body convulsions coming on about 50% of the time and my absent, partial, and head drops like 10%. I am not usually conscious or if I am I have amnesia. When I can feel them, I usually get this weird aura and everything is tunnel vision and slow. I will start to lock up, get a headache, and get confused as well. That is how i know sometimes when it is coming on. Not fun.\n\nFor me, I only identified three known triggers which would be flashing lights, loud noises, and over exertion. Otherwise, they are very random. \n\nWhen I am in the hospital they usually keep Ativan on hand to help relax my body and I have a prescription for it. Unfortunately, FND is a very complicated and poorly understood neurological condition but like I mentioned, FND is valid and is real. Thank you for speaking out about it.\n\nI hope that I could help you in some way :) Replying is a big help, thank you!\nWhen you get that tunnel like vision and your aura, how long does it take before it starts? \n\nI have read before symptoms can stay up to months like you with paralysis, that is so rough, I am sorry.\n\nThinking about it I think I feel it in my hands. I remember thinking a few times I need to squeeze my hands or massage them because they feel tight and tingely.\n\nI am not sure this is related because I have been getting this longer than I have had FND, but sometimes my brain shakes inside my skull.\n\nI am prescribed oxazepam for at home and I have been trying to take half a tablet when I think it is coming but the other day I think it just prolongued the pre-stage.\nI ended up being so incredibly nauseous for hours and I could feel in my head it was coming but it did not. Then when it finally did I needed just as much oxazepam as the other times so I am not sure that was the right way to go about it \ud83d\ude05 Mine can last anywhere between a few minutes or an hour before the seizures come. I also agree that taking the medicine does kind of prolong that stage. My doctor told me to use it when I am having a seizure. They give me the shot or when I am at home, my mom will crush it and put it in my feeding tube and it will calm my body down in a few minutes. \n\nYes, all of my symptoms stay for months and it takes a lot to make progress. I know for others they have shorter symptoms periods and some just have non epileptic seizures. I have noticed that things like my tics and tremors have not ever gone away but it could be unrelated as I had those pre FND. FND can make symptoms you had before worse though.\n\nYour hands are definitely something to be mindful about. Sometimes when I think I find a correlation, I will write down the symptoms i have and then keep tracking it. Sometimes that leads me to finding out my pre seizure symptoms. \n\nI do ask my neurologist about new symptoms or worsening symptoms because we do not want to lump the new ones with FND until we are 100% sure.\n\nI am glad I could help :)\n\nPS. It is nice to know that I am not the only one who has a locked jaw. If you do not mind me asking, how does that work out for you? Does your locked jaw go away or does it stay? Oh my jaw depends really. I do also have TMJ so sometimes I do not know what the cause was. My first FND episode was definitely the longest because they had to do alot of testing in the ER so all my muscles in the body had been cramped for 5 hours.\nMy jaw did relax after the medication but the disc was out of place from it so that took a few weeks before it was back to normal again.\n\nWhat I do now is whenever I feel an episode coming I put in my nightguard the dentist made for me and that is definitely helping the locked jaw issue, I do not know if you have a nightguard but it is worth a try. \n\nI actually just asked for a refferal to a neurologist to oversee this. My main care has been with a neurosurgeon because of my other neurological illness but that is not really the best place to manage something like FND. I have been writing notes with what I felt before, during and after the episodes. \n\nDo you know if food are a trigger to this as well? Ah, that is very interesting. I was talking to a family member and they mentioned TMJ. Do you think that could be a possibility? The FND clinic I went to said they have never seen FND lock a jaw before. Also, I am so sorry to hear that your disc was out of place then.\n\nYes, the initial testing talks a long time. For me, we did tests twice. We are still doing more testing because my doctor thinks I have more than FND. \n\nAh, I do not have a night guard but I will definitely ask about it. That is a really good idea, thanks for that! I do not really know if food can be a trigger for FND truthfully. I had triggers for food but I have PTSD from being force fed. It is kind of funny when I look back on it because now I have a paralyzed GI tract and cannot tolerate anything. \n\nOh, really? I am glad you are getting your referral. Have you found any triggers or patterns yet? I guess it depends what locking a jaw is for you, I do think it could be a possibility but not sure.\n\nWhat kind of tests would you say are important for FND?\nI am sure we will redo some of them as well.\n\nTriggers for me I notice every time it happened after a super long/busy day where I did way more than I should  and the others after I had some new severe pain im my body aside from my 'normal' pain. Well I had CT scans, EEGs, EKGs, MRIs, lots of labs, and I had a lumbar puncture. Let me just say, lumbar punctures are not fun if you ever have to get one. They might redo mine because they found high levels of protein but want to make sure. Yeah, unfortunately I have had too many lumbar punctures. I have too much pressure in the head and the only way to measure it is through a LP. They are horrible and part of the reason I developped PTSD.\n\nHow long ago was your last lp?\nDoes not high proteine levels mean inflammation?\n\nIn the ER they did everything but a ct/mri, mostly because I have had so many already, but I think I want a head mri done to make sure this is not caused by my brain herniating or something similar. Oh I am so sorry you had to get so many done. It is completely understandable to have PTSD around that. \n\nMy last one was in January and I had high protein, white blood cells and it was pink. I think that it means something is wrong but they did not really address it. I think that is why they want me to go back to get another. \n\nYeah I think that is a good idea. Better safe than sorry. Regarding the LP, do you still have lingering pain there? Ever since I got it, when it is raining I can still feel where they did it. Yeah, pink can mean they hit a bloodvessel, depending on the other numbers that is not always something to worry about.\nHigh proteine I am pretty sure is infection or inflammation. Do they have a treatment plan in mind when your next lp shows the same things? \nHow long have you had FND for?\n\nYes, I definitely have lingering pain in my lower back. I would say to get a heat pillow if you do not have one already, it is nice to lay on when your back is bothering you.\nI have a shunt (tube from my spine to the tummy to help drain spinal fluid away) and had like i dont know 8 or so surgeries on my spine so between the lp's and scar tissue it is a chronic pain I do not think will ever fully go away, so I am attached to the heating pad :') They do not have one unfortunately. They want to do it again and go from there. Yeah, my doctor questioned they did not look into it further. She was thinking MS. \n\nI have had FND since the beginning of January and it worsened in March.\n\nAww, chronic pain is the worst! I really do feel for you. I have chronic pain that might be due hEDS. I do love a good heating pad though :D Is yours electric or is it the one that pumps warm water?\n\nAlso, I really do hope that you can find some relief So that would be MS on top of everything? I am so sorry to hear that.\nDo you know when the next LP will be?\nI follow alot a bunch people on instagram that have EDS, what a nasty illness to have.\n\nI have a bunch of diffirent kind of heating pads, bottles, microwave one but really the most I use is a flat electric pillow since I lay with my lower back on it, that is more comfortabel than laying on a water bottle :') Yeah, sadly. I think it will be in December. Where I live, everything is booked for months so it will take a while. \n\nI have also started to follow people\u2019s journeys because it is all so new to me too.  I have not done so on Instagram but TikTok. I cannot believe I actually use that app XD it is so addicting \n\nHaha yeah I bet it is better to lay on the pad :D that reminds me of when I used to used frozen peas as a ice pack. It is good that you have a variety for different things. I just have an electric pad.", "my hand is locked i have never experienced this before.

Glad to hear!!", "I am so embarrassed A day ago i was coming from literature class on the top floor which is a long way and i felt my legs giving out as i was walking down the stairs but i did not think i would fall down a whole flight of stairs when it happened. so many of the people also coming down the stairs kept asking if i was okay and helped me up and it was just so embarrassing for me. even though i had rubbed skin off of my knee which was pretty deep and several other bruises on my legs i speed walked away while there was so much blood going down my leg. i had so much adrenaline i did not even notice until i got to my art class. i got some bandaids and stuff and my leg is still pretty messed up. my mom still refuses to get me a wheelchair of course because she thinks i \u201cshould not be getting comfortable with this disorder\u201d which is really weird for her to say, i guess she is just embarrassed that i would have a wheelchair. It is hard to go through; I also get embarrassed by my drop attacks. Have you gone through any physical or occupational therapy? not yet, i am supposed to be going back to the neurologist in November and he said that i would receive physical therapy! It sounds like your mom doesnt completely believe that you have a disorder yea i feel it too, even though the neurologist diagnosed me right in front of her she still is in denial that something is \u201cwrong\u201d with me That is good! Physical and occupational therapy helped me a lot. I scheduled mine outside of my neurologist but used them as a referral to get me in to a NeuroTherapy type clinic that usually deals with stroke patients and they handled me pretty well! You can always research if there is an avenue like that available around you if you cannot wait until November. oooh good to know! i will check that out, thanks! I swear, reading this gave me chills\n\nFirst, truly sorry to hear about your episode\u2026 scary when it happens \n\nSecond, a question for you.  I lose complete use of legs &amp; sometimes arms .. completely feel nothing.\n\nHave broken both ankles, so much more but my question is do you lose feeling &amp; use like I do?  No feeling whatsoever?\n\nHave you experienced not being able to see sometimes or hear?\n\nI am trying to find others like me &amp; what they are doing &amp; what helps?\n\nYour mom is not taking it seriously clearly.  That is rough.  It is hard enough trying to figure out what is going on &amp; deal with symptoms but the joking at your expense, feels so wrong it is ok! yes, my legs go paralyzed a lot actually, it only last a few hours though, i have never lost complete feeling anywhere else. i have never went blind really, my vision is already extremely bad haha. but one of my ears sometimes starts ringing like i am going deaf it is really strange. I understand the finding people like you thing, i also seek that. I am getting physical therapy soon after i go to my neurologist for a second time in november so he can refer me. a lot of people have been saying physical therapy is very helpful! yea, my mom is not the best person about my disability, hopefully she gets better since i have been living with the symptoms for like a year now (without diagnosis, i have gotten diagnosed 2-3 weeks ago) Hope things improve for you.\n\nFor over a decade plus I have gone through every single test etc trying to figure out what it is.  After another seizure like incident &amp; numbness.. A neurologist at hospital said he knew what it is.  FND but he was not my personal doc so to go &amp; find a neurologist.  After that, I asked myself is there a cure?  No, so like fibro, you learn how to live with it.  The testing of muscle contractions etc is just too much.  Pain tolerance is extremely low.  \n\nAll the best to you throughout your life and may you find a way to ease it out of your way and live happily \n\nThanks for the interaction See i dont go numb but i get severe right sided weakness to the point after a seizure fir the next few hours i cant even sit up. I also have decreased sensation in my right side so you can stick a canula in me and i dont even feel it. I have to use a wheelchair but i practice walking everyday to build up strength in my legs. So i walk say 20 steps sit in my wheelchair to im ready again and then another 20 steps repeat. You clearly have extremely severe symptoms .. which I sincerely hope you overcome and can get to your old self again \n\nyour mom is probably scared &amp; does not know how to handle it My mum used to be a nurse before she had my brother and her crohns was triggered so luckily my mum knows exactly what to do.\n\nAnd tbh i dont think i was that severe for this condition but then again idk much about it. But im pretty much wheelchair ground now except for 20 steps maybe. Though for the first time in 6 weeks i went almost 2 days but my brain couldnt handle motion anymore Hang in there I have a feeling things may turn around for you overtime Yeah they said i can suddenly stop having seizures out of nowhere your mom\u2019s such an idiot dude, you need to have a stern talk with her", "How do you all figure out your limits after diagnosis?  I am still learning my limits too, but my neurologist suggested cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as a way to identify and respond to symptom triggers with certain mindsets. CBT is not a solution for everyone and the effectiveness seems to depend on finding a psychologist who is familiar with or has worked with FND, but it could be worth trying! Thank you for responding! I am doing some surface-level CBT with my counselor, who I was seeing before FND appeared, and it seems to be helping! She is going to refer me to a psychologist with experience handling FND so hopefully I will be able to make a bigger difference! Awesome! There is also a book called \u201cOvercoming FND\u201d ($50some dollars on Amazon) that uses CBT methods if you would like another resource. I am only a few pages into it but seems informative. After 15 years of misdiagnosis I am in the same boat, so I just wanted to leave a little message to say I hear you :) you are not alone.\nI am lucky enough to have just started seeing a GP/DR who was willing to let me try Keppra for my seizures, but it took 2 years of going to a bazillion different Drs to find this new one.\nIf you have financial support / family who are willing to give you a little time to figure yourself out maybe try brainstorming a list of things you could cope with at home.\n\nI was attending uni and doing fine art in my 20s when FND hit, I had all of these big career goals and aspirations about teaching and running a gallery.\n\nNow I am in my 30s and lucky enough to have a supportive partner and a small welfare income. I feel like I might be able to run a creative business from home, selling things at my own pace so that I can support myself without having to meet external deadlines / expectations of an outside job etc.\n\nIf you can try to shrink down what kind of things brought you joy / bliss from before the fnd, and find that stuff now but in a smaller more manageable context.\nNow that you know you have FND, the idea is to try and achieve similar goals, but in a non stressful way. Part of that is knowing yourself, knowing you are triggers, but also allowing yourself time out consistently. Even when your not triggered, and having a good couple of days, it is still important to have down time and self-care everyday. \n\nLike do not feel compelled to be doing everything you can just because your feeling well, I used to do that and it always comes for you later. Sorry for rambling so much I just wanted to say your doing great and this stuff can be really hard to figure out, so do not beat yourself up.", "Hypnotherapy ", "Had another episode, heres the message i sent to my mom and the images i found after\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 ", "I believe that I was wrongly diagnosed.

It can mimic a variety of diseases. I would try to find what tests would show thoracic outlet syndrome and ask your PCP or neuro if they would prescribe that for you since all other diagnoses should be ruled out before diagnosing FND.\n\n-Hazel Anyone able to explain pain with FND please?

I am waiting for an FND neurologist appointment in 5 weeks time but I am extremely worried it all will be misdiagnosed and I am never going to heal \u2026 thank you for any help \nAs brief as possible, I have chronic Pains, muscle knots and spasms  ( which I feel are SI Joint and thoracic outlet syndrome?)..knee and leg locking, pain and dysfunction, weak ankle and collapsed inwards slightly, nerve pains and sensations, body vibrating/ trembling, eyes shaking , face and jaw pains - all left side and shrieking tinnitus! - ALL 24/7 since March 2020, post covid", "Mobility aid anxiety  This is complicated. I think that if you explain to people that you have a neurological condition where sometimes the electric signals go wrong, people would understand that, but I understand your hesitation. I would say that if it gets to the point where you just cannot walk without constantly tripping, then a mobility aid is definitely warranted. Do you have a good neurologist, pcp, or PT who you can talk to? I was assessed at neuro PT and recommended a rollator at 23yo. Definitely had trepidation at first but boy oh boy the benefits were great! I quickly realized I saved a ton of energy and could do more than ever. It is worth trying it out - could help you regain independence as it did for me. Another alternative - hiking poles! Easy to store, easy to carry when not needed, look like you are training for winter sports. I am 20 and I use a cane to help with balance and weakness in my left leg and people do not tend to ask as much as I thought they would. Some people do but usually they will not say anything mean to your face if you explain that you need the aid on your bad days/when you are walking long distances. I recently began losing control of my legs (weakness and buckling) I am currently using a walker (former dancer and really active young person as well). The first thing is depending on your country you may be able to get one for free or rent one for free/very low price. I accessed my walker through the Red Cross (free of charge, just needed my PT to sign off on it) \nThe anxiety is definitely present and can hold me back but I found falling over and collapsing to be equally as humiliating. If you can access a Occupational therapist or physical therapist they may be able to give advice or referrals That is what I use!", "newly diagnosed, speech issues hi, i am new here, 16f. i lost my speech completely in july of 2020, i was told many things by different doctors and therapists. i was told it was \"selective mutism\" or that it would come back when i was coping better with mental illness, i was given treatment plans for building up my confidence to talk, i was told that sometimes autistic people just go quiet. now i am well into my mental illness recovery, *definitely* confident enough to talk, using AAC full time, ptsd therapy has had no correlation to my ability to speak. a month ago i was finally told by a clinician that i had aphasia caused by FND. i looked into it and found neuro-symptoms.org and it changed my life. the people involved in my care still do not understand FND, they think it is psychological and that i will be able to speak when i \"work through my stress\" (right now is the least stress i have been under in years). my mother emailed my new school secretly to tell them that i cannot speak for psychological reasons, my therapist wrote down selective mutism on my chart, it is incredibly frustrating. FND is so underresearched, it is so hard to explain to people. the guy who diagnosed me said that the structure of my brain is fine, but it cannot co-ordinate itself properly. i feel like that is a pretty good summery, but there is so much bias around unexplained symptoms being psychosomatic/psychological, especially with autistic people and girls. i guess what i am asking is, has anyone else been in a similar situation? how did you explain that FND is neurological? should i be actively working on getting my speech back, or just accept that it might not come back (basically what i have been doing for months)? i hope there are others out there like me and i can find support with you guys :) thank you for reading consistent speech therapy has been known to help if that is available to you! i cant imagine how frustrating it is to be going through it. most importantly, you need to find a doctor who is well versed in FND. some of these doctors have no idea how to treat FND and it can be so infuriating given treatment plans that do not work. trust me, i know. i think that is a good place to start for sure. 19f and I am less than a year into the onset and diagnosis. I feel this as well, I usually recommend my teams/therapist to research FND and to get over the psychogenic understanding/ conversion disorder term. It is initially undermining to have a professional give that opinion. It makes me feel like maybe it is in my head and the FND is just to make me feel normal so I get out of my head more often. HOWEVER, I have full trust in my neurologist who specializes in movement disorders, and I will continue to believe and show others FND and neuro-symptoms.org. You are not alone! 30f also new here and struggling to feel like my own diagnosis is valid. What I have found reassuring is looking up studies that involve fMRI imaging for FND. Even ( states:\n\n&gt;Functional\u2019 brain scans (fMRI) are starting to provide early evidence for how the brain goes wrong in FND. fMRI scans show changes in patients with FND which look different from healthy patients without these symptoms as well as healthy people \u2018pretending\u2019 to have these symptoms. \n\n(( that shows these findings in Functional Movement Disorders, for instance)\n\nEven though there are a *ton* of physicians out there who do not 'believe' in this disorder, or dismiss it as a purely psychological issue, I think it is nice to know the stuff happening in your brain can actually be observed as different from someone trying to mimic your symptoms. \n\nHang in there, and if you can, try to find another doctor that specializes in FND. i was told speech therapy will not work because it will \"come back on its own when i am more confident\"... hopefully i will find a good doctor when i am 18 Wow, you need a speech therapist through the school as well as an IEP. I would trust a speech therapist long before I would a psych in this kind of case. \n\nThat advice really seems outdated and wrong. was given an EHCP after years of waiting (uk version of iep). action plan lists \"selective mutism treatment and training\". asked for it to be rewritten, new copy has \"functional aphasia\" ctrl+f replaced selective mutism (grammatically incorrect in many areas too). there is nothing i can do, i have had two 5 hour review meetings with promising action points and absolutely nothing has happened. i have now been discharged from all services and referred back to Early Help (who were involved when i was 7). i am trying to get a third review meeting but it is hopeless. this country just does not care about mental health or put any training in place for neurological disorders, let alone FND. Oh no. That is all just so very awful. \ud83d\ude14 I have aphasia with FND in my case it came on after a bunch of concussions and a long struggle with post concussion syndrome. I am 33F and I am training to be a psychotherapist so I am not sure if it is because I am older or going into mental health, or because there is a very clear reason why this started for me, but I have had a lot of luck with pointing out that I am very aware of what is mental health and what is not in my own body whenever a doctor or practitioner tries to dismiss this a psychological. \n\nThe other avenue I have taken is maybe a bit more aggressive but I mean - some people are really into dismissing this as psychosomatic. What I do is I ask them if they would feel like this if I were a man and I do not let them side step the answer. I have also pointed out that this disorder was called Hysteria once and the medical industry universally agrees that disorder was handled in a badly problematic way. That usually snaps them out of being dismissive but it can make the conversation uncomfortable. \n\nWhen I am explaining it to people I mention how on a microscopic level there is some differences in how my brain is wired together and we are only just becoming able to see the brain on that level.", "Can you drive with Fnd?  I think it depends on what kind of symptoms your FND gives you. For me, I have an occasionally unsteady gait and tics.  The tics only come out when I am unfocused so I can drive just fine. \n\n-Hazel Thank you Definitely depends on symptoms. I am able to drive and am mindful of when I feel more fatigued or headachey. If I do not feel well I will adjust by changing my schedule to accommodate or by taking a non-highway route (people do not reliably use their turn signals on busy roads which is frustrating even without FND). Thx It depends on your symptoms. I still drive, but only when I feel good. It is on me to be responsible about how I feel, can I drive. So learn your body, your triggers and warnings. Thank you If you have seizures and/or paralysis, no you cannot drive. Otherwise you can", "Confusing symptom triggers and treatments I have been so confused lately about what is triggering symptoms and how to treat them. This has always been tricky but the only triggers I was pretty sure of were being physically ill, and long car rides. This week I have had both of those, and (thankfully) I have been symptom free until today. I have been doing CBT and my therapist asked me to relax and do basically nothing for a day and a half because she thinks with the FND my body simply does not know how to relax and has forgotten what it is like to not be numb or in pain.  She insists that FND is stress/trauma related even though we have not \u201cuncovered\u201d what those problems are. My new psychiatrist however seems to think we have no idea what causes FND and there is just more research that needs to be done. I side more with him because stressful situations seem to have no effect on my symptoms. I had to take my child to the ER, and they flew her on a plane to a children\u2019s hospital on Christmas Day to have emergency surgery. Talk about stressful! I had no symptoms that day, or the following 4 days.  I also had a long trip and a virus at the same time, but still no symptoms. Today I am feeling better, had an easygoing day, and bam! Symptoms of pins and needles and numbness show up out of the blue. I am so confused about how to track or predict what is going on. I am also frustrated about the idea of this all being a conversation of stress and the treatment being mostly CBT at this point. I have bipolar disorder so I they automatically throw me in the \u201cpsych\u201d bin and blame everything on that. But I literally have 0 bipolar symptoms because my meds work so well and no anxiety either. How can CBT help ? I do not think it can hurt but it is expensive and I am just not convinced.", "Multiple Questions Hello, thank you in advance to anyone who reads this and decides to answer. \n\nI had a sudden onset of tics less than a year ago, and developed a stutter shortly after. I visited a neurologist who did not give me a diagnoses, my chart just said \"unspecified tic disorder\" and they did not really acknowledge my stutter. Recently, I have been having episodes where speaking was quite hard, sometimes from nonstop stuttering and other times becoming completely nonverbal with no obvious cause. I also have many symptoms that I thought were completely unrelated, such as tingling sensations in my limbs that I thought was a circulation issue(feels like pins and needles), ringing in my ears, trouble hearing at times, and moments of sensory overload that make my tics much worse. I have also had weird pain in my legs at times, similar feeling to growing pains. However, I do not have seizures or paralysis. My symptoms are honestly not that severe, but I would like to have a diagnosis so I have something to tell people when they ask what is wrong with me, especially because of my nonverbal episodes. so I am wondering if it is possible to have FND without seizures? Does anyone experience similar symptoms? Im definitely going to return to the neurologist because of the nonverbal episodes, so I am wondering if FND is something I should bring up. Thank you again to anybody who took the time to read this \u2764\ufe0f", "Ridiculous NES trigger *TW - Seizures* \n\nI just had, at least in my experience thus far, the most ridiculous and pathetic trigger for an attack/seizure. \n\nMy partner was trying to explain a technical thing to me and I just was NOT getting it because brain fog is at 90% today.\n\nBrain did a big NOPE and I had a pretty big seizure (for me), it was about 15 minutes long, as usual I could hear but not speak, could not move my head or left side limbs, all muscles scrunched up and flailing about....

I am new here but I have a few questions\u2026 I have not been formerly dx but I have had two \u2018attacks\u2019 over a 10 year period that were deemed to be non-organic/ functional in nature. However I have been in therapy for a long time now and have recently been having issues again which are;\n\nTwo instances of ocular migraine and since the second one I had a very sore eye\u2026 I had an eye test and they found a difference in colour vision which prompted investigation into optic neuritis. Then my left hand became slightly numb and weak aswell as my left foot. I will say I was very anxious about the possibility of having ms so I wonder if the anxiety is what brought on these symptoms\u2026\nAnyway I had a brain mri which was clear\u2026 neuro exam should left sided weakness and numbness\u2026 I am going to have a spine mri tomorrow which I assume will also be clear\u2026\nI guess I am just wondering if FND symptoms can be so specific? Most of what I read seems like the symptoms are usually more wide spread? So has anyone had symptoms that are pretty specific?\n\nThank you in advance! I have, and thought it was MS until tests showed otherwise. Good luck with spine mri, I have not had one of those. Would be interested to see what they find. My symptoms are very similar to what you describe, left side numbness, ocular migraines, etc. and then also have had one off symptoms such as a seizure. Also, get checked for sleep apnea if you have not already. That can also compound/cause problems of fnd. it is hard to feel lucky sometimes, but at least it is not cancer or MS! Good luck I was diagnosed just a month ago. A year and a half of hell with symptoms leading up to it, including a colonoscopy and endoscopy, 6 CT scans, several x-rays, 2 hospitalizations of four nights, so much blood work I could have donated multiple times, 4 MRIs, and a lumbar puncture. They ruled out lupus, Lyme, RA, Guillian Barre, any infectious disease, and finally MS.\n\nI would advise making sure all the possible things it could be are ruled out, so there is no doubt. But I personally had never heard of FND until I was diagnosed. In the past it was told to patients that it was completely phycological. I am autistic, have a panic and anxiety disorder, and a history of depression and PTSD. Now they can see a clear physical issue happening. Like it started as psychological and your body's cry for help felt unnoticed, regardless if you were trying and noticed and tried to help. So, the body started screaming too.\n\nMy neuro put it in perfect terms. My hardware functions at perfect levels but my software is at a blue screen of death. My brain needs to remember how to function in order to get back to my normal. MS looks a lot like other things too. Just make sure you are getting the proper diagnosis and getting the right medical team behind you.\n\nIf you do have FNB it is not all in your head, it is in your body too. \n\nI walk with a cane. I have a handicap license (signed by neurologist). I use a wheelchair when needed. It can and be debilitating but make sure it is FNB in case your doctor's are missing anything.\n\nWishing you the best in finding answers.", "Are memes allowed here?  i love this lmao Right?!?!\n\n\u201cYes, you are broken, we cannot fix you.

I was diagnosed when I was 16 but i have never had anyone to really talk about it with since no one I know is familiar with FND. \n\nIt started with feeling electrical sensations go up and down my arms randomly, was told it is just stress. A few months after that I just started ticking uncontrollably. It started with my neck then down my body until I was having non-stop full body convulsions. My mom took me to the doctors and they did a full work up on me for a full week. They ruled out everything they could and landed on FND. When they explained it to me It sounded like \u201cyour brains just not working and we do not know why lol\u201d\n\nI dropped out of school that year and had to be tutored for work I could not do in school. My tics have since subsided and are only bad sometimes now, but I still have a host of other symptoms including dissociative seizures, brain fog, and a bunch of other stuff. \n\nMy parents used to get frustrated with me a lot when I asked to rest or had an episode while we were cleaning or something. They would say I was doing it on purpose to get out of stuff. No one really understand how hard it is dealing with these symptoms because they are not visible to other people and I do not really talk about it. It usually gets downplayed by people and they laugh it off or tell me i am fine or how much better i have been getting recently. \n\nit is frustrating, but i am glad to find a community of others struggling with the same things. First off: welcome! I am really glad you have found us! Good luck, and remember that we are always here to help Welcome!

I am a 17 year old trans male who was recently diagnosed with Functional Neurological Disorder. Mine seems to appear in the form of tics and episodes of limited cognitive and physical functioning, almost like in a drunk toddler. If anyone has any advice or goes through similar things, I would really appreciate it. I am very scared i am also a trans male that is newly diagnosed (friday) except i am 15. i am also in need of advice but my neurologist made me download an app called \u201cneurosymptoms FND Guide\u201d to help me better understand all the symptoms. mine also appears in forms of explosive tics, paralysis, and dissociative seizures. The neurologist also said that i would start physical therapy. I go through similar symptoms myself, my best advice is to (if you already do not) go to cognitive therapy as well as have a close friend or family member nearby at almost all times. My sister helps me a lot when I go through those kind of episodes. FND is not something easy to go through, and I do realize it is probably been hell for you, but I am sorry the best advice I can give is just having a close friend or family member nearby and go to therapy, i really wish I could say more to help you. Physical therapy has been a huge help for me, when i was diagnosed i was not able to lift a coffee cup, pour my own water, and so much more. Now i am able to do all those things. If you are not already in it, I would recommend cognitive therapy, it too had been a huge help in my treatment. Drunk toddler is the best explanation I have seen so far that fits my symptom outbursts at times \ud83d\ude02 the stumbling around, stuttering and gibberish, limited cognitive function and my body being weird and wonky. At first I was so afraid and embarrassed and I would cry every time it happened. Now, it is a part of my life, and my partner and I giggle at it together when it happens. It will not be so scary the more you learn about this illness and the more you can begin to feel safe with your diagnosis and way of living.

The worst out of all my symptoms though is my inability to walk without the assistance of a mobility aid. This is frustrating because i am a young adult,19, and I am struggling with all of this.

I use trekking poles when my legs feel weak, or when my balance is off. They fold/collapse when you are not using them, you can stash them in a backpack, and they feel more like exercise equipment than a mobility aid. \nFor me, that is a psychological plus.

Way more comfortable than what you are looking at.\n\nBest of luck. I hope you find mobility soon. I use crutches and find them really helpful!  My balance is poor, as well as having weakness in my right leg and an abnormal gait.  My crutches have saved me from falling over several times, as well as helping me with my walking.  I would advise you to give them a try and see if they help you.  I bought myself some purple sparkly crutches from eBay - if I am going to have them, I might as well have some funky ones \ud83d\ude0e I use crutches normally, but if you have upper limb issues it can get difficult. For example if you hands/wrist have locked up, or if you are having muscle weakness or pain in your upper limbs, using crutches becomes quite difficult. \n\nHowever if you do not have much trouble with your upper limbs crutches are a good way to go, especially for your gait and balance issues. Have you looked into walking frames too? You can get some that have a seat so you can rest periodically I use a foldable cane but during bad episodes I might as well hold a blade if grass for all the use the bloody thing is. Still waiting on that neurologist getting back and yesterday had to treck all the way to the hospital with it had a seizure and my god the cane was useless.\n\nI tbink crutches are ok they do both side support which is good and better for if you have a weak wrist but if you have periods of upper body weakness or spasma they might not be the best. \n\nI am hoping for something more efficient than my walking stick but I do not know. Too scared for a wheelchair Oooh I like it. I bought myself a walking stick but I still fall and it does not help massively. What would you say makes your crutches better? Thank you for the suggestions, I will take a look at the options you mentioned! I am in the UK so hopefully price will not be too much of a problem I am glad you have found crutches helpful for you. I did not know they could help with balance as well, that is good to hear as I thought they were only used for problems with one leg. Buying a fun colour is such a good idea! It might make them less daunting to use as well. Thank you! That is a good point. My weakness is in my whole left side but my leg is worst and I notice it more in my leg because it affects my day more. I will need to pay more attention to my arms before deciding I guess. \n\nWalking frames seem quite intimidating to me. I have not had symptoms for too long and still sometimes feel strange about needing that extra help. I am trying to get past that, it is just a slow process for me \ud83d\ude05 I was thinking the same, that crutches will have the added support for both sides instead on one like a cane. \n\nI am sorry you have not found what works for you yet. I completely understand being too scared for a wheelchair. I am still doubting myself sometimes and get frustrated thinking to myself to just act normal. A wheelchair feels like a big step and people being judgemental about it does not help. But if it is what you need, then nothing else matters. You should be able to do whatever possible to feel independent. I agree everyone deserves what they need. I got abuse for using a cane out on public so defo not ready for a wheelchair but I hope you find what you need too", "Recovery Can those who have recovered please share their recovery stories?

I was also having more severe seizures at the beginning and some dystonia in the form of my left arm and wrist locking into my side and spasms/tremors in different parts of my body. Thank you!

The nausea is less severe with meds, but I have still been stuck with 6 months of continuous nausea.\n\nI have and appointment with my GP tomorrow to review my meds, he is actually pretty open to suggestions. If anyone has found something that really helped I would love to know. I have had this most of my life too. I was diagnosed with FND as a kid and constant nausea was supposed to be because of my FND. while my FND made it a lot worse, it was not the reason. \nI started taking probiotics and avoiding certain foods that i knew would make me nauseous. Seeing a GP is a great start, and if you can afford it, ask for an endoscopy. For me, the real problem was H.

They did tons of tests and tons of meds and nothing really worked. What has worked is the nausea bands (I have a pair in every room now) zofran ODT, nausea drops, Dramamine, and the Big One that changed everything was digestive enzyme supplements.

I have dissociative seizures and was diagnosed with conversion disorder in June. I lost my job in healthcare, stopped driving. My world became very small.\n\nLike a lot of you, I was frustrated by the response from doctors. After a normal EEG and MRI, neurology ducked out. Psychiatrists in my area are not taking new patients, so I see a NP who does not have much experience with FND. I have continued to take my SSRI, despite the fact that it is not working for my depression, because I read that it helps, and I go to therapy once a week.\n\nBut the episodes kept happening daily. I am the sole breadwinner for my family. I have a toddler and because I am no longer independent, I am trapped in a very painful marriage.\n\nSo I am desperate. The depression, anxiety, PTSD  and FND just feed continuously on each other. Since my doctors were kind of clueless, I started to do my own research and came across some studies of TMS being an effective treatment for FND.\n\nI am in the states and it is not FDA cleared for FND here. Just depression and OCD, and they are working on smoking cessation. Over in Europe they use it for all sorts of things.\n\nI was willing to try anything, so I found a place that does it, got my docs on board and they got it approved through insurance using my depression diagnosis.\n\nI am on treatment 23 of 36.

Or that, any new neurological issue I may have will automatically be pumped into FND without considering any other possibilities first like they did when I was first diagnosed with Fibromyalgia before I had my Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome diagnosis.", "I was diagnosed and then forgot about it A couple of months ago I went to a neurologist because I would been having these \"shaking attacks\" that were not triggered by anything and did not have any symptoms besides \"oh no my body is not working right\". The neurologist diagnosed me with FND. I have always been a very shaky person, and I get mild stomachaches for no reason, but other than that I do not really have any physical problems? And I have not had a full-on \"attack\" (or tremor) since I got the diagnosis (although last week I did have something close, just not as big). FND seems to be a lot more than this and while I am not doubting the professional diagnosis, I am a little confused. Does it even count as FND if the symptoms are so mild and infrequent that I forget I have it? I dunno..... thoughts?\n\nOh, also, did anyone else have a weird experience with the Covid vaccine? I \"fainted\" when I got my second shot (fainted is in quotes because I think I was conscious the whole time, but I did hit the floor and lose my vision while my hearing decided to just hone in on LOUD - not even like everything sounded loud but like \"loud\" was its own sound and I could not make out any other sounds except \"loud\"). That attack after the vaccine, I call that graying out. Blacking out is if I lose consciousness, but graying out is when I cannot see, but I am still conscious, but I cannot necessarily control with my body is doing. I have done it enough times to know that it is not fun, and I am sorry that happened to you.\n\nI think a lot of us have some kind of reaction to the vaccine, but I get that reaction with a lot of things, not just vaccines. Medicines, whatever. I tend to just get the tremors and nausea with stuff like vaccines. I am so sorry that is something you have to deal with a lot, but I am glad I am not alone! I have never fainted before, so I could not tell if what I experienced was just how fainting worked or if it was different. \n\nOther medicines and shots do not have any strange effects on me, but I still avoid taking anything because I am comically bad at swallowing pills. My throat says that if I did not chew it, then I am not allowed to swallow it, even if it is swallow-size. \ud83d\ude06 A lot of people actually have trouble swallowing, so sometimes you can ask doctors to write the prescription for a liquid version or a version that is easier to crush and mix in with something like applesauce.\n\nI normally black out from pain. If it is pain plus stress, I am more likely to gray out. For years, I thought that was just kind of a thing most people did and did not realize it was not normal. Luckily, my swallowing in general works fine, it is just medicine that I have trouble with. I will remember that and ask for it next time though! \n\nI am really sorry you have to go through that. :( That sounds horrible. I mean... yeah, it is, but it is also my life. I have had severe chronic pain since I was 22, and that was decades ago. It is what it is. I am hoping to start a new pain management program here this coming month. Maybe it will help? I really hope it does! And it is strange to hear you talk about 22 being decades ago when I have not even reached 22 yet myself. XD\n\nNot to change the subject, but associated question - does FND get worse with age? My grandparents actually visited recently for the first time in a few years and they were concerned about my shaking. I had not noticed that it is gotten worse. From what I have been told, most doctors do not consider it a progressive disease. That said, they admit that, without proper treatment, it can get worse. It is so amazingly individual, though, that it really just depends on the person. Mine has gotten worse, but since my pain is uncontrolled, that is likely why. My doctors think that my pain is the root cause of the FND, so that not getting treated is a real problem.\n\nThe reality is, there is a lot they do not know. Doctors are really flying blind with this condition because there just is not enough research for them to be able to make consistent decisions for all patients. The best thing you can do is track your own stuff, figure out your own triggers, and go from there. That makes sense to me! Thanks for the advice. I hope your pain can get treated soon, that sounds like a complicated issue. &lt;3 I have had my myoclonus for 31 years.  Having new cognitive issues starting last year.

Good to have a term for it.\n\nUsually stress, lack of sleep, or boozing for sustained periods seems to be my triggers.", "What do I do about this I have not been diagnosed yet but my neurologist said she thinks that I have it but no diagnosis. My episodes consist of my brain feeling like it is just full of clouds, eye spasms, stuttering, twitching, and in worst cases gagging, falling, punching myself, and screaming. It is hell and I am new to all this shit so I am just very confused about what to do. At first I thought these were seizures because I would feel numb and was spasming all over the bed. Now I realize these are scarier and I am very worried that my life will just become a slowly decaying nightmare. Does anyone have any tips to deal with FND? I dunno if it will help, but when I got diagnosed with PNES (functional seizures), they explained it with a computer metaphor. Instead of having a hardware problem, I have a software problem. So the seizures are not causing any damage, it is more like Windows just keeps crashing. And knowing that they are not causing brain damage has honestly helped a lot. I do not know about anybody else, but I have also found that just letting them pass instead of trying to fight the seizures off or hold them back helps significantly. \n\nFinally, when I was diagnosed they said most cases are caused by trauma, so the treatment is usually therapy. I questioned this strongly because I have had therapy and did not really think I had trauma. That was in July. Having started therapy and also a metric ton of self examination, I have realized that a lot of stuff in my life really was kind of traumatic. Stuff that I had experienced and just went \"oh, I guess that was a thing,\" afterwards. And working through some of that--just confronting some of that--has been helping a lot. My seizures have gone down enough I have been able to start driving a little again, I am tolerating fluorescent lighting better, I do not need a walking stick anymore. I still have trouble, but I am getting better.\n\nAnd it sounds ridiculous and is almost kind of offensive, to go to therapy for this. Honestly, I am still kind of pissed about that and I am still convinced there is something else that they just do not have tests for. But it is helping. And honestly, I think a lot of us who have some sort of FND have medical trauma, something we do not even think about and a type of trauma that nobody really talks about. But it includes any type of trauma from a medical setting. So that can include physical trauma, like surgery, or accidents (if you break a bone, or crash a car), but it can also include things like being told or treated like you are faking your symptoms, or being misdiagnosed, or any of those other lovely things that can happen to make you want to swear off doctors altogether. Basically, what it all comes down to is that trauma is not just the big stuff like we normally think it is. It can be a lot of little things, too. \n\nAnyway, sorry if that got long, but tldr: this shit is scary af, but you can get better and it does not have to destroy your existence. You may have to change a few things, but recovery is possible and it is not actively causing brain damage. Thank you so much! My neurologist said that my symptoms were caused by anxiety and fell under  FND. And thinking of how I started experiencing this shit right after my grandma passed, I am pretty sure it is because of that. I am now somewhat stably going to therapy (was not before mainly because no time and switching people) and I like my people. I am also around good people who understand that what I have is not just faking which is relieving. Thank you so much for your wise words! I really appreciate them and hope you have an amazing day/night/span of time! :3 Yay, therapy!\nMine has been more just general excessive stress, although I have also been realizing that hey, woah, some of that stuff that I just thought was messed up was actually legit traumatizing, oops.

I was petrified and had MRI scans of the brain and spine as well. Those came back normal. I did stay one night at the hospital and I had to be in a wheelchair. I looked like I had cerebral palsy\u2026 \n\nI know this is scary but it is not dangerous and that is the best thing about this disorder. Only fine movements get affected so if you are active, that can totally help FND. I still run, lift weights, play instruments, perfectly okay. Doctors tell me that this is not something that just goes away because it can be permanent or it might not be. But do not be discouraged because treatment helps a lot and avoiding stress is the MAIN factor. I was diagnosed with FND a year ago after suffering countless seizures. The only \u2018help\u2019 I have actually had is being given the link to a website. Other than that, I have had no help. I have an ambulance called once a week on average but that is only treating the short term problem, not the long term. I got referred to psychiatry and was then passed neuropsychiatry and they rejected me. So now I have to try and go through the whole process again just to get some help. I am honestly considering going private and despite the money it will cost, I do not feel like I have an option at this point. Honestly, I really hope you have a better experience with treatment and although I have no specific advice which relates to your case of FND, my best advice is to keep pushing doctors until you do get the help you need because sometimes it can be so hard; especially with a disorder which is so misunderstood. I wish you the best :) Thank you!\n\nBest of luck to you", "Possible FND Hi everyone. So basically I started developing a particular set of symptoms a few years back and after doing some research online became concerned that it was Parkinson's or ms, something along those lines. Long story short, after what has pretty much been a horrendous ordeal trying to get help and investigation into this, a neurologist suggested that I might have FND. I have been referred to psychology to continue the investigation but waiting lists are bad at the moment and I currently have no indication when my appointment will be. \n\nMy Dr talks to me as if this is an entirely mental condition and suggests that I use mindfulness to feel better. Tbh I do not think she even has a clue about the condition, when we first spoke about it she said that everyone can recover. Later when I had looked into it a bit more and I asked why some people diagnosed with FND had been unable to recover, she said that those people simply are not ready to address their issues. \n\nI have definitely had traumatic experiences in my life but I fail to see how sitting and talking them over with someone is going to benefit me in any way, when I do not feel any inclination or need to do so? If I feel perfectly fine mentally and have reported myself as such, is not it a bit unethical to suggest to me that I must have something wrong? The only mental distress I have is purely related to these symptoms and my worsening health, plus the fact that no healthcare provider seems to have a clue what is going on. Not sure where I am going with this other than to find a place to vent my frustration and hopefully be understood by someone. Peace \u270c\ufe0f", "My legs are so weird everyday i feel like my legs are slowly getting worse and worse, It is getting harder to walk down the stairs, my legs always shake when trying to do so. I also lose my balance a bit when walking normally My daughter (13) has been going through this for about six months.\n\nGot so bad she began missing school. \n\nEventually we were able to get her back in for \u00bd days, then \u00be days, then full.\n\nPainful reality is that she is been using a single crutch for about 5 months, though the funny thing (probably wrong word) is, I looked out the window today and seen her running home from our neighbours house using it !\n\nShe says her balance is a MAJOR issue too.\n\nShe cannot walk around without arms outstretched to be able to have something within reach! i am glad the single crutch is becoming more comfortable for her! i wish her luck on her journey :) I got a wheelchair recently and it is been amazing for days when the pain / paralysis is really bad.\n\nUsually I just use a walking stick when it is not too bad. I do not know how I would have coped without mobility aids. i am getting physical therapy soon! i asked my mom for a wheelchair and she said \u201cwe are not getting comfortable with this\u201d which is so weird to me\u2026i think she does not believe i have a disability or she just does not want to be seen with a son in a wheelchair When this started happening to me with stairs, I started hands and feet on the steps going up (feet still would not coordinate but I felt safer holding on with hands!), and sitting on my bum to go on each stair downwards. \n\nSure, it takes longer and looks a little weird, but I have never fallen! Bonus being that you can clean each step on your way down! abled people have this weird idea that if you use mobility aids you will start to like them and wont want to stop which is ridiculous because they are incredibly inconvenient to use That is what I do too. It seems to come and go. I use hiking poles (walking sticks) on my bad days. Sometimes 1, sometimes 2.", "My first time being taken to the hospital..oh boy So I was at school minding my business during my break time, and i had a dissociative seizure. After the seizure, i could not move my body from the shoulders down. I could regain upper body movement, but not in my legs. I tried to wait it out but it got way too close to next bell so I emailed my teacher and my councilor about it. They ended up putting me in a wheelchair and taking me to the nurses office which is where I had another seizure that was quite short while they were on the phone with the paramedics. Everything happened so fast, there were so many people and before I knew it I was on a stretcher in the back of a paramedics car. People kept asking me questions, sirens, i was shaking because it felt so unreal I had to keep tapping things to make sure I was not having a dream. Of course I was fine after about 2 hours, and my family came and they thought I was dying by how they described me on the phone to them. They came in crying and I could not help but feel bad because I was completely fine when they came, a little weak, but fine. So sorry for my friends too, they had to witness me being taken away like that. What an experience. What an experience! It is indeed so hard when an attack is happening and after your fine but it feels it is worse for your family because that shit looks really scary.\n\nI am dealing with this as well, having big spasms for hours and hearing my loved one telling me I look really scary.\n\nBut in all reality, what we experience is really shit! I think it is a coping mechanism for us to down play it because we are \" fine\" afterwards. But we are not fine! Attacks can still come, we live a very different life then most people with a body that is not doing what we want it to do and that is scary!\n\nI am gratefull that there are more times then not that I am not shaking and spasming. But it is hard and it sucks and that your body is moving again does not mean your fine. You also went through a traumatic experience.\n\nSuper big hug! Be nice to yourself and give yourself a treat! I have a question if you guys do not mind. Do you OR would you, have a medical bracelet instructing no ER for pseudo seizures? \nI know somebody with a blood pressure condition who passes out and her bracelet states NO ER. i would like to have one yes, the thing about FND is that my seizures are functional, they do not really cause anything that bad to happen to me unless i am standing and have one and hit my head or something. so unless my seizures cause a really bad injury, i dont want to be taken to the ER. i had my neurologist write my school a note stating this as well. Exactly my point, I am thinking of getting one for when I black out because I am fine, I just need to lay down till I come back around I will just have a headache. I qualify for medical transport so I have a little freedom in my wheelchair to go out alone so this worries me. \nIt is happened in the past before my diagnosis when I had a trapped nerve in my hip, I was screaming in pain when my bf was trying to get me to lay down and the pain was so much I just passed out. I heard him go \"ok good\" and felt his fingers on my neck to check my pulse \ud83d\ude02 - THAT IS the only treatment I need with my type of mini seizure cuz they are just functional not deadly. Update:... I was in the ER yesterday, had 9 seizures (these are brand new to me) in the space of 4 hours. They all just watched. Another patient sat behind me, in my own wheelchair, (with a bedsheet that the triage nurse tied around me so that I could not fall out) LOUDLY saying \"what an idiot why is she here\" \"that is not real shes just doing it herself prff\" and \"look here she goes again for attention\" I waited 4.5 hours then my bf decided I can just as well have seizures at home so we left. \nI hate people aw no that sucks i am so sorry. FND is a very stigmatized disorder and sadly it is very common for us to experience this treatment in hospitals. this is one of the main reasons i hate being taken to the hospital for my symptoms,i get downplayed by some people in the hospital. that many seizures in that span of time is very common for us sadly, i have sooo many a day it is hard to keep up.", "My family thinks I fried my brain with hard drugs and did this to myself. I have never even touched drugs. I was diagnosed with FND in 2020, but have been having symptoms since 2017. In the past I was in an abusive relationship and suffered PTSD, and before getting FND, my trigger was having glandular fever. \n\nI found out yesterday from my dad that my sisters think I have done this to myself. They think, because of my \u201calternative lifestyle\u201d (I am a spiritual person who is very happy and easy going, and I love incense and essential oils and natural products), that I did hard drugs and because of that I am disabled. My dad even confessed to not knowing the truth himself, and that he wondered too back when I first got sick what kind of drugs I must have been on. They all think I went full 1960\u2019s hippy experimenting with drugs.\n\nI have never touched any drugs in my life apart from cannabis, which I only tried for the first time when nothing else in the world eased my seizures and spasms. \n\nI am heartbroken to find out that this is what they think of me, and I understand now that it must be the reason I have had no support from them at all since my diagnosis. I am so lost and I have no idea who they have told that to, and who believes these things about me.\n\nThe love I thought I was receiving lately has just been pity and obligation for their poor, \u201csimple\u201d sister, whose brain does not work anymore. They think I am not all there in the head. The facetimes to do art together in the last few months? \u201cOh it is just art and craft time with my retarded sister because I am a good person.\u201d\n\nHas anyone else had to deal with anything like this? How to you cope with family members spreading lies and gossip and assumptions when they have no idea what we go through? \n\nI do not even know why I am posting to be honest, I think I just need to feel less alone in this. I am devastated that my family find it easier to believe I was a drug addict and fucked my own brain up by using, rather than accepting that I have suffered abuse and now have a disability because of it. Even when someone becomes disabled from poor drug use, that still makes them look like shitty people to treat a family member that way.\n\nMy doctor acted like i was a nuisance when i first went to him with my physical issues that i got from an abusive relationship, and my mom also got a broken back and wrist around the same time. My doctor said it was all in my head, and i went to him as a vulnerable person who just escaped abuse, so he gave me another layer of trauma. My mom would compare my issues to hers as if mine wasnt being taken seriously. I would feel guilty when shed be upset that i wasnt helping her with things around the house/garden because of her being disabled too.\nAt the start of all my issues I felt very alone while wondering if i could die in my sleep since i had no idea what was happening to me. It was very traumatizing. \n\nI support you and many people with neurological disorders understand the struggle, from my experience so many of us have stories of not being believed and it has helped me to have talked about experiences with others. I think when it comes to conflict with others, its important to think about how our emotional health is always going to be the biggest priority. Whatever that looks like to you, whether its ignoring them or something else,  it should always be prioritized and if they dont respect that, it is ultimately their fault. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f I am sorry you went through all of that as well - if only these things were more understood. At least we all can support each other hey Welcome, im trying to let go of a lot of different things in my life including some experiences around it. And exactly, even though the condition is really difficult, not everything surrounding it has to be completely bad, theres people out here who will make you feel supported. :) I am just horrified for you. That is awful of them! You deserve real family, real support, not that. I would go LC or NC for awhile. Thank you - I am definitely taking some time out from the family after this. Just going to do me and my life and if they want to be a part of it they can make the effort I am so sorry that happened to you. Your symptoms are real and they are not your fault \u2764\ufe0f\nI hope you can find people to surround you who believe you and lift you up. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f Good! That is for the best, I think. FND is very common among people who suffered abuse, the extreme stress caused the signals in the brain to go haywire.   I have a movement disorder and some in the groups who have FND movements developed them after trauma or assault. What do you mean by that because I have FND and I am wondering how that ties to abuse\u2026 For some reason severe trauma tends to trigger FND, the extreme stress can cause odd brain changes that cause odd things to happen. I am not sure the exact reason behind it.  I know when I was looking up FND when they thought that was what I had, many of the people in it had been assaulted or had severe abuse or trauma.  Many doctors consider it an effect of severe abuse or trauma, but other thigns can cause it.", "Numbness/weird feeling in face? Does anyone get numbness/feeling of fullness in their face? It is really stressing me out I had this with a migraine not long ago. \n\nKind Of felt like it was \"waking up\" after going to sleep, like your limbs sometimes do. I get this! I have dissociative seizures so that tends to be the warning sign for them I have that on the left side of my face always, actually the whole left side of my body\u2026. It does get worse right before seizures and while tic attacks\u2026. Sometimes it feels like intense blushing. It is a stroke like symptom so if it is new to you, I would go to the ER and get it checked out. Yes I do all the time. My left side", "For those who have been diagnosed with this, what was your journey? I have not been diagnosed with this. I have seen a general physician, Urgent Care, neurologist, ENT with no answer except Eustachian tube dysfunction that is not responding to any treatment (decongestants, migraine medications, vestibular therapy) nor do some of the symptoms fit after 21 months of this. \n\nMy symptoms are ear pressure, tinnitus, dizziness, possible vertigo, and waves of being pulled by my legs or like the ground is unstable and rocking. I feel strange muscular contractions like my foot slipping off the brake when it is not or feeling pushed against the desk or seeing/feeling the floor rippling and twisting in a circle, seeing walls move, feel the bed spin when my eyes are closed and the weirdest sensation\u2014an overwhelming sensation of movement over my whole body in one direction that my body automatically tried to fight in the other. My symptoms wax and wane every minute of the day. I feel like I see walls breathing or the sky wrapping around me if I overexert myself. The floors and bed feel tilted and sometimes my foot feels like it is falling below the tile or when sleeping that I am doing a wavy spin that goes below the surface of the bed. In 2018 I started getting very nauseous when waking up in the middle of the night especially after deep REM sleep when I used to feel all my muscles spasming. I get hypnic jerks a lot and the feeling is akin to sensory overload. I get very disoriented and sometimes cannot feel the bed or the couch under me. Sometimes, when I have my eyes closed like this my eyes go back and forth involuntarily. I now get this feeling when I doze off and when I wake up I feel like I have been on some violent ride. When in bed, my legs pull in one direction and my foot tries to catch the sheet resisting the movement. My vestibular therapist has no answers for what is going on with my muscles but I feel pulled down into the ground or that I am shifting. I get these episodes of pressure where the tinnitus changes and feels like movement is going from one side of my body to the other. If I am already feeling sick, the dizziness becomes almost unbearable. If I am very nauseous I start getting tingly and slightly numb, especially in my hands. \n\nPrior to this, I started feeling tumbling in my head like I could fall through the bed a few seconds and then it would go away. This only happened a couple times in 2006 and 2007. One time it happened with my eyes open and I could not see and felt like I was going to collapse and was seeing the world through a kaleidoscope. Even then, it only lasted a few seconds, but it took a couple minutes before I felt comfortable letting go of the bars on the gate I was holding onto. \n\nI have had a MRI that showed fluid in the mastoid my ENT said not to worry about. I have also had CT (no contrast) of the temporal bones that were normal. VNG results also normal. \n\nI am not asking for a diagnosis. This is just my story so far since February 6, 2020 and what I will save for the follow up appointment with my ENT or if it is time to get a second opinion.  I know this is long. Just needed to share. Thanks for reading. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n. July 2014 I started with severe chest pain. They did not know what it was. Gastric reflux?

June 2020 diagnosed with FND after losing my memory, ability to walk and talk. Aug 2020 started learning to walk only to stop after having more pain. Mar 2021 stroke like symptoms. June 2021 NEAD. Docs think I had FND all along, since 2014. Psychologist is concerned at my mental state because of how long it is been since i started with the pain. It is a difficult journey. Still cannot walk - in a wheelchair, speech is much better, memory is getting there. Still cannot remember my name or other identifying pieces of information but getting there. \n\nGood luck on your journey. Thanks for sharing your story and your encouraging words. Keep on keeping on with your journey. This might sound like a strange question, but have they checked your neck? They have not but from what I have heard about neck-related dizziness, they should. in january, my tics became extremely bad and i could not really hide them anymore so my family found out, took me to a neurologist months later, boom, diagnosed with FND. I also have paralysis, weakness, seizures, slight tremor, locking of limbs, and drop attacks. For me I have had disasocoative issues since I was real young this also involved spacing out and amnesia and having odd attacks with walking off and forgetting and odd vision disturbances. Then it progressed slowllllyy untill a few year back I started getting full on attack non epileptic seizures and now I have a lot of days where I need a cane a lot where I do not. I find staying inside helps I think what helped get a fnd diagnosis was a stay at a psych ward and then a great neurologist", "FND and Career Who has FND and also works full time? I am struggling with a flare up while trying to teach, and it got me wondering how others manage this disorder along with careers. I was unable to work for a few months after my first hospital stay for Bradykenesia/FND but now I am back to teaching. I have had manageable symptoms thus far, but they are worsening and I had to go to work with a cane for the first time today, sparking a million questions. I am not able to get disability due to a weird gap between social security and the state system teacher retirement, plus I am single so I have to work to live. I am looking for advice on how to stay working while dealing with a flare up of symptoms. I was working full time until this took me out. I keep telling myself I am going to go back, but honestly I think the stress levels are just going to put me right back where I am, so I am trying to figure out what I can do instead. I really need out of manufacturing, anyway.\n\nI am seriously looking at finally pursuing a career as a professional artist. It will give me the flexible hours I need and be something I genuinely want to do. Plus I will not have to put up with the fluorescent lights that trigger me. Same. After being exactly where I wanted to be professionally, I had to leave and now work part time from home. Cannot do more than that thanks to tics and seizures I wish you all the luck with your creative and entrepreneurial endeavors! Flexibility could really be helpful with this particular condition and trying to pursue a job that allows for that would be beneficial I am sure. That must be really hard, to be where you want to be and then have such a setback. It is good you are able to work from home though. Thanks, I need it, I am terrified, tbh. But maybe it is time to really schoolwork that I am meant to be an artist.\n(Not that I am not, like, I make art and have a degree and everything. I just have had day jobs because I am very risk averse) I do not know anyone who manages it. Unless their symptoms are mild or subsided.\n\nI had to stop the build of my own business cause this and Its been a year and a bit now.\n\nLuckly I have a parenter who works.\n\nThe thing is I can feel I am getting marginally better and then it hits me. You know I can go for a week a month with it okay and then it is back for weeks. It is hard to plan your life when you cannot rely on your own body.\n\nIf you have seizures it is even harder cause you are banned from driving then.\n\nHonestly wish I had something they knew what the cause was rather than this. My symptoms are non-epileptic seizures and my triggers are high stress, lack of sleep, and MAYBE sustained periods of drinking. (Ie, one or two drinks, a few nights a week, over a month or so)\n\nI was in a pretty high stress job,  but I loved it. But I resigned because I had to. I have got a new job now, and it suits me well, even if there is not much upward mobility there. But it is far less stress, so it is worth it.

", "Food Triggering Symptoms About 8 months ago I had a seizure and have been battling involuntary movements as well as a range of other symptoms since.(photosensitivity, chronic pain specifically in my joints, joint cracking, on/off low mood, brain fog, nausea, indigestion, incontinence)\n\nAbout 3 months ago I noticed most of my symptoms were triggered after eating, eventually this led me to suspect gluten. I have improved drastically, from myoclonus every day/all day to a couple times a month.But every once in a while if Im exposed to gluten or something in my food the pain and symptoms regress to some degree. \n\nI was wondering if anybody else has had this experience with food as a trigger. They diagnosed me with FND and I do believe I have it, because hyperventilating and anxiety can bring on the symptoms, but I am weary I might have an undiagnosed autoimmune condition that is causing these spikes in pain.\n\nAny thoughts are welcome, feeling quite lost at the moment as I have had to cut so many foods out of my diet.", "Effective therapies? I was diagnosed with FND a couple months ago, presenting with facial spasms. I am wondering if any of you have found different types of therapy - CBT, EMDR, DBT, somatic therapy ? - helpful or more helpful than others. \n\nThanks I found body psychotherapy was useful for me, it made me understand the connection between my body and my mind and the affect of FND symptoms on both. I had to pay for it privately though so I know that might not be an option for everyone hmm thanks. is that the same as \"somatic therapy?\" What do they do for body psychotherapy? Sorry for delay replying, in the UK it is called body psychotherapy but it seems to be the same as somatic therapy after a quick google search ah thanks so much! i am so glad it was helpful to you Thank you, I hope you find what works for you too.

My last was triggered by a medication reaction. My Dr. says see a psychiatrist for the conversion disorder symptoms because he cannot treat them. My neurologist says conversion disorder is just another way of saying I am faking my symptoms, and my psychiatrist insists I have some unresolved stress or trauma in my past or childhood. The trouble is, I really do not identify with that. I do not have any stress or anxiety going on, and I cannot point to anything all that traumatic in the past. I do believe that FND is the correct diagnosis, and I plan to go to therapy. However, I am more interested in dealing with the stress the symptoms are causing me than trying to find some deep rooted cause I really do not believe is there. The minor symptoms seem to have no particular triggers, but the major ones do and the Dr.\u2018s seem to ignore or not believe that a migraine for example could trigger them and do not believe me when I say I am happy and not stressed. Anyone else have this struggle? Why do not they want to believe me? Yes, this is unfortunately a common issue. It is an issue with the functioning of the nervous system and there are usually issues with emotion regulation as well. I have had to be treated by many specialists, but my neurologist and neuropsychologist are my favorite and most helpful for managing this condition. There does NOT need to be major unresolved trauma for it to be FND. I would check out FNDCourage, it is an amazing class and community. Yes. I have not been able to find any good specialists and am left asking them to treat the symptoms in the mean time which they are hesitant to do. They do not believe me I am pretty vanilla :)  I have some good leads on neuro and neurophysiologist though. Hopefully soon. Stay positive you are not alone!  Cheers I have not ever heard this. Thank you for posting. Do you mind sharing your specialists, if that is allowed?  TIA Indeed what I heard from dokters is that it does not need a traumatic past for it to be FND. I have practice therapy in the Netherlands and she is specialized in FND. Also some physiotherapist are specialized in FND.  It helps she is trying to find triggers for me and helps me with energy management. I really understand. \nDoctors will ignore the causes for a lot FND symptoms just because of the FND diagnosis. \n\nI have seizures from FND that are set by episodes of serious fatigue. the psych and neurologist told me that i was just depressed, and its normal to sleep a lot when youre depressed (17+ hours a day for me)\n\nI went to a nutritionist and they ran blood work. I have type 2 diabetes and anemia. I am not tired because its in my head- i am tired because i am diabetic. but they did not think to check that because im normal weight and have FND. \n\nIt is ridiculous. I am really sorry you are having to struggle with this. I would say to see a seperate doctor for your migraines and do not tell them about the FND and see what they can do for the migraines It might not be psychological stress. I have read that a long surgery, or a spinal cord surgery can cause it as well. I will look for the article, if I can find it, I will link it here. Late reply but just want to share that I have symptoms that started with my chronic migraines. If you look on ( they do mention -somewhere- that migraines can cause some people's - basically you have a migraine with symptoms (and migraines are hella complex, they can cause so many different weird symptoms) and then they stick. Mine are not associated with stress/anxiety etc, so yeah, I do not identify with a lot of the stuff around FND.\n\nI am fairly sure mine are basically symptoms that have hung about from having several hemiplegic migraines initially (and I am recently having a flare up of symptoms after what was definitely another hemiplegic migraine a short while ago - it was something I had not experienced in 18 months despite having a multitude of other lasting symptoms, and then I was stood in a queue in a cafe and bam...unmistakable - visual aura, then went weak and shaky on left side, then headache). My neurologist refuses say I have hemiplegic migraines for weird reasons (like she agrees it sounds like it so it is not because I do not have the symptoms, basically just because she does not want to label it that way) but she does accept my chronic migraines are causing my functional symptoms - she did not even mention psychological help, just referring me to physiotherapy. I do feel like I have struggles along the same lines with my migraines and not being believed however - I am constantly getting asked what changed when they started and whether I am stressed; I mentioned the first hemiplegic migraine I had and my neurologist asked me what had caused it (??? how tf do I know?) like I am going to reveal some psychological trauma and they catch me out and go 'ha! see it is just stress!'. Frustrating is not the word. I saw someone on askdocs describe it as doctors getting fixated on a narrative they have honed in on, instead of listening to what their patients are actually saying &lt;---absolutely this is the experience I have had with my neurologist, it is always like she is made up her mind before I have said anything and then anything I say just gets dismissed because it does not fit with the narrative. It sounds like you may be experiencing something similar.\n\nEven though a lot of the stuff around FND is focused on psychological triggers and causes, the formulation of it as a diagnosis is meant to recognise that lots of different things often contribute-yes that includes trauma and stress and anxiety, etc for a lot of people, but it does also recognise that *some people who have it have none of those things*. It is not a straight renaming of conversion disorder (I mean the whole reason it got changed was because conversion disorder was problematic as a diagnosis). You should not be having to educate your doctors on your diagnosis though; sounds like you maybe need to see another doctor/other doctors and break up with your current ones if you can, and try and find someone experienced at treating FND. Thanks for the reply. It sounds like we are experiencing a similar problem with getting our healthcare needs met. The idea that I should not have to educate my own doctors really hit home. Unfortunately I live in a rural area and reliable healthcare for even basic needs is difficult to find. It is worth looking for a good neurologist though because it is such a complicated disorder, even if I have to travel quite a way to find one. Oh Dr Afra Moenter with Boulder Neurohealth is a great place to start.", "At a complete loss... Hello, this is My first time posting to this subreddit, so I am really sorry if this is not allowed, but I really do not know where to turn to. I want to make it clear that I am not diagnosed with FND, and I am not self diagnosing, a nurse mentioned it to me in passing so here I am. I am also not turning to here looking for a diagnosis, I just a need a place and something tells me that you guys might be the only people who actually understand...\n\nSo Basically for the past 5 or so years my health has been rapidly declining for seemingly no reason. \n\nMy hearing started to decline, I found myself dealing with intense boughts of tiredness (sleeping 14+ hours, I need a minimum of 12 to feel awake for a few hours on a good day but I am always tired), I have seen doctors about random patches of skin on my body that are numb, and tingly, as well as chronic pain and numbness across the entire right side of my body, and only the right side, like there is a barrier going down my spine kind of deal, I have seen doctors about seemingly random dizzy spells, or days where I have been unable to stand up or move much because of the dizziness, about a year ago my wife and I had to look into getting me a couple mobility aids (a cane and a wheelchair) because walking was not possible for me without my limbs giving out or intense amounts of pain, I saw a doctor about the fact that sometimes my skin feels like it is on fire, the slightest touch, especially of fabric feels like both ice and fire at the same time on my skin and it hurts so much, I have lost a significant amount of strength in both my legs and arms, but the most noticeable is my grip strength, which fluctuates, sometimes it is OK, sometimes I cannot pick up a pencil, my stutter is coming back (was bad as a child) and I have experienced some rare boughts of lisping, my wife was really concerned for a while because she said I was having episodes of what looked like absent seizures, and I still have these episodes frequently, but my therapist told me they are likely dissociative in nature as I do have a dissociative disorder, and the most frustrating one is when my hands will lock or paralyze for seemingly no damn reason, it is happened from picking up a cup of water, from shaking my wife's hand a little too roughly and from clasping my hands in my lap a little too roughly, it is happened while I was signing one time. \n\nAnd yet.... every. Single. Scan. Every test, every exam, every pain specialist, sleep specialist, PCP that I have seen comes up clean or is at a loss. According to the tests and exams there is absolutely nothing physically wrong with me. \n\nLast night my hand locked up and paralyzed for almost 12 hours. 24 hours later I have enough movement to use my thumb to type, and can make a fist again, but it hurts and it is weak and the doctor ignored me. He just ripped open my fingers without warning and told me to hold it open with my other hand, as soon as I let go it locked back up for another 4 hours. I have been accused of drug seeking, attention seeking, lying, I have been told that doctors do not know what to do with me. I have been dismissed more times than I can count on both hands and I do not know where to turn. \n\nI saw a neurologist in May for my tics and chronic pain, but he ignored the pain piece. I was diagnosed with Tourettes Syndrome (which... yeah because I have had TS symptoms since i was a child, and my father had it) \n\nBut I feel so lost, my body feels like it is failing me and no one is listening to me because there is nothing *physically/visibily* wrong with me. \n\nI was venting to a friend of mine who is a RT, and mentioned they see a lot of these seemingly random episodes in patients with FND, which is why I am here. Not because I am trying to say I have it without a diagnosis, but because if there is ANYONE who can understand I need that right now... \n\nso anyway I made a list of all the symptoms and gave it to my doctor and demanded they do something, and she photo copied the paper and is going to consult another doctor about it, but even she took a look and had absolutely no clue, she said all of my symptoms are from different body systems and she has no idea what the the it could possibly be. But no one believes I am not making this up. My in laws, my family, workplaces, doctors... the only people who know that what I am experiencing, whatever the hell it is, is really happening, that it is real are my friends. I am losing hope for answers quickly, and it is making me angry and I just needed to reach out somewhere I might find some understanding, and hell even some validation after being dismissed for so long. \n\nThanks for listening. Oh\u2026 there is a good chance that you are in the right place! Even if you are not, you will get a lot of sympathy!\n\nCheck out the websites \n and FNDHope (after I posted, I found this \n resources.onuniverse.com )\n\nThey are a wealth of information on not only this condition, but support groups, finding a provider, etc.\n\nIf you are anywhere near a city/town with a university medical center, I would start there looking for both a neurologist and a therapist. \n\nThey have found that FND is frequently found in people that have suffered some sort of trauma, physical or emotional (ie - PTSD or major surgery). From what you e said, I very much doubt that you are faking. This is not something that you choose to fake.\n\nHang in there, come back to chat, and exercise however much you can, but do not overdo it. I have found that swimming has been the best thing. \n\nBest wishes! I would also try going to a Movement Disorders clinic! They tend to know the most about FND and typically have connections to neuro physical/occupational therapy which can help with some of the movement issues. Are you in the UK? If so try tk get a referral to St George's fnd/movement disorder clinic. They are really understanding there and have an inpatient unit. Either way do not give up, it takes stupidly long to get the help you need and it sucks that you have to keep trying when things are so incredibly hard but I promise it will get better. Sometimes there will be a random change in life circumstances and the fnd will change for the better for no understandable reason. \n Fnd is horrific though. Sending hugs. Xx\n\nP. S\nFor tourettes presenting fnd my neurologist recommended learning about habit reversal therapy and a website called tic helper. Wish I had something to say about the hand locking up thing - I get that too and have not figured that one out. Yep, definitely sounds like you are in the right place. I am so incredibly sorry you are experiencing all of this. An awesome resource is FNDCOURAGE, it is an online class and support group. We meet on Wednesdays and a new cohort starts next week. Came here to say this, my movement disorder clinic was such a huge weight of my shoulders because they diagnose based on neurological symptoms, mostly what you can or cannot do from the outside. \nI had been suffering with so many random symptoms for over a decade, then my tremors got so bad that my PCP sent me to Movement disorders and finally found someone who put the pieces together and I am still in shock that nobody found this back in 2009.", "Eye closure? My mum has not been able to physically open her eyes for 10 days. She could for a day with sunglasses on but now cannot. All of her MRI scans come back clear so doctors say it is functional. \n\nDoes anyone else suffer with this symptom? \n\nHas anyone been treated for FND in the UK? We are concerned as waiting lists are long and this is very disabling. Is there anything we can do to help her in the meantime? \n\nAlso is FND classed as a disability in the UK? With these symptoms and not knowing which days may be good or bad she is unable to work. \n\nAny help is greatly appreciated!! Idk about closing necessarily but my Left eye became crossed and I had to have strabismus surgery in February  Also as a kid, I lost the use of my legs completely for a couple days and it eventually just came back.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish you the best of luck with disability- Im going through the same process in the US now.  And it sucks.  I have been out of work for 27 days according to my work computer.  It is very very slow.  Be very patient and understanding with each other.  The fact that you reached out on here is heart warming. She is not having fun either with this so just be ready to be there when necessary, and able to give space when it is needed. Not *exactly* the same, but a year into FND diagnosis my eyes began closing sporadically throughout the day for up to ten minutes at a time. It definitely impacts one's life; I have had to give up driving and my career as a consequence. \n\nIn my case, I have found that there is an element of light sensitivity trigger to it, and I have taken to wearing extremely dark sunglasses with side and center blinders, made for mountaineering, when I go outside during brighter days. The dark lenses seem to help in the reduction of the number of occurrences, but they do not eliminate them entirely, unfortunately.\n\nI also keep the house dimly lit / screens dim.\n\nIf the ambient light level is low, I will sometimes have success getting my eyes to open again by manually opening them - and holding them open - for a few seconds with my fingers. Maybe something your mother could try?\n\nOne of the world's most prominent voices in FND research, Dr. Jon Stone, practices in Scotland.  Various vids on YouTube of him as well.\n\nOtherwise, I cannot personally speak to any U.K. healthcare specifics, as I am in the U.S., but I have found the Powers That Be here to be more helpful to my cause when I explain the issue as a, \"form of functional blindness,\" rather than trying to educate about FND from the ground up, since it is rare that anyone knows what FND is, and are thus unsympathetic. Thank you for your replies. My mums eyes shut at 10 minutes at a time when this first started now they have been shut continuously for about 3 weeks. She has the odd moment when they open especially if she is wearing dark glasses. We will get her some more specialised ones as you have!!\n\nHave you found you can get back to a high quality of life? Atm we have carers look after mum, she cannot do anything for herself and is feeling quite low I get it in one eye sometimes, I also find sunglasses help. I look like a wierdo staggering about at night wearing sunglasses, but \ud83e\udd37", "Possible FND + Symptoms Management until Appt Hello! I am going to see a neurologist on December 23 but was wondering if I could have some advice on managing symptoms until then as I am currently away at college with finals quickly approaching. My symptoms are- leg weakness and arm weakness, difficulties walking, hearing difficulties at times, difficulty concentrating (although I also have ADHD), fatigue, loss of balance, memory issues, tremors, and some twitches. I also deal with a lot of pain. These symptoms are making it more difficult to walk and get around. I also have POTS and HSD, but I am looking into hEDS and seeing a geneticist in January to see if I have it. I am also a forearm crutches user if that makes a difference at all! My main concern is leg weakness as I have become a fall risk. Thank you so much in advance.", "Recently Diagnosed but Having Doubts Hi everyone! I was diagnosed with FND 6 months ago. I have a tremor in my right hand that I can cause but also happens less pronounced sometimes. My neck will also jerk occasionally. These symptoms do not bother me but I have joint pain that does. The pain is in my elbows/down my arms primarily but also my hips and knees bother me occasionally. My joints also crack a lot and sometimes feel like they are grinding. \n I was referred to a psychologist for treatment for FND but they are booked so it is been 6 months and will likely be another 6 months before I can see someone. I am wondering if I should go to a doctor before then to explore other causes of the pain or if this still tracks with FND. I know symptoms for FND are very varied but does anyone else have something similar? I have the neck jerks. They started out like myoclonic jerks and ended up turning into tics so i can relate to you on that. I have EDS so that is the cause of my joint pain. For the joint issues, i think seeing your general doctor and saying \"hey, I have had this new symptom pop up and I would like to investigate it before assuming it is neurological,\" is completely reasonable Hi, I hope you are doing okay. I get lots of tremors in my hands and arms and jerks in legs and shoulders. I dont get pain but get other symptoms like dizziness and fatigue. Hope you manage to get some treatment/help. Thank you! I will set up an appointment, the pain is not new but I think I downplayed it too much with the neurologist. He also seemed pretty confident that CBT would fully get rid of the symptoms within 6 months which I am questioning now seeing other people\u2019s experiences Thank you! I am doing okay, the pain is not the worst it is just that it is chronic makes it more annoying Neurologists think that CBT works like magic. I do not want you to think that it does not work, because it does, but it tends to work best for intermittent symptoms like seizures, tics, and jerks. I did not find it worked for my gait issues but then again my functional neurological disorder is really resistant to CBT treatment, I think because I have DID so the problems causing the FND are hidden in other consciousnesses.", "Cramps and pain Anybody get cramps/spasms? I get these exaggerated startle movements where my neck will jerk suddenly to the side which can cause neck tightness and pain.  I get cramps from overexertion but not from FND. One of my main symptoms is muscle spasms and cramps. The pain from them is awful when they happen sometimes. I get spasms and a sort of cramp/growpain ish. Not fully painfull but reallyyy uncomfortable.", "I feel like my friend may have FND \u2026 I am a nursing student and have learned a ton in school, clinical and my job. \n\nMy friend has been diagnosed with POTS, ADHD, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, PMDD, anxiety, IBS and I think that is everything. \n\nShe has had every test ever and everything has come out pretty normal except tachycardia and light headedness to which she was diagnosed with POTS. She has weakness so bad that she cannot cut her own food, and other days she can exercise with a 40lb kettlebell. The days where she gets weakness and paralysis she literally cannot walk and it looks like her legs are convulsing when she tries. She has had trauma, and to my understanding never gone to therapy. She has a hard time living independently and needs a chair for most activities like showering and doing the dishes. She struggles to maintain communication with people, even over texts. She talks about her medical diagnoses constantly and posts about each one on social media. \n\nIt seems every other month she has a new diagnosis and I just want to know if any of this sounds familiar to anyone? I do not know how to help and I am also in no position to recommend therapy and definitely cannot diagnose.\n\nCan anyone help? this all sounds like things that happen in FND. and about the edit, stress can trigger symptoms, so that checks out. we cannot diagnose her, but she should see a neurologist to dig deeper into this. She is seen a neurologist and it seems like they are all very focused on her physical symptoms and she has so many appointments and never leaves with any answers. It is very confusing! I learned about FND in school and it blew my mind and I could not help but feel like this is something she has Also thank you so much for responding! I just really want to help and have no clue how. I feel like each time I see her she seems to have more symptoms that were not present the time before. Do neurologists typically diagnose FND? of course! just give her support, and make sure to accommodate when she needs help. FND can get worse, i only had one symptom at first and then broke out into a whole bunch. It really just depends on where you live, a lot of people are not educated on FND and a lot of people get misdiagnosed. my neurologist diagnosed me on my first day seeing him because there is a rise in FND due to stress with that virus + whatever else is going on in peoples lives.", "Feeling hungry forever and ever? Hello! I have been recently diagnosed with FND (well, technically with \"conversion disorder\") and the past few days, coinciding with an improvement of all other symptoms, I still feel hungry after eating. Like, really hungry, as if I skipped two meals, even after consuming an absurd volume of food and giving it time to settle. I would not have thought anything of it, except that I have had very little appetite while other symptoms are high and the timing seemed odd.\n\nDoes anybody else experience something similar with FND, or should I assume it to be an unrelated quirk?", "Getting a job with FND I am sixteen and have been officially diagnosed with FND for a little while now, and I want desperately to get a job. \n\nI am currently in the middle of getting my GED, so the job hunt will have to wait a bit, but after it is done, getting a job is the first thing I want to do.\n\nIs there anyone who has advice or experience with getting a job/working with FND?\n\nPlease keep in mind I am a minor and I have no prior work experience.", "I have been having a dissociative focal aware seizure for a solid 30 minutes and it is hella annoying I had an epileptic seizure yesterday, and fnd tends to flare up after an epileptic event, so I saw this coming but still ffs \n\nAnyone know how to stop these?

At least people have stopped calling an ambulance for me I am so sorry you deal with epilepsy and dissociative seizures. What are the symptoms of dissociative focal aware seizures? I am lucky enough to have never had one. I would recommend trying to ground but I do not know if you are able to during this kind of seizure.", "Vision and balance Hey all. I have had FND for about 3 months after an extremely bad reaction to a medication. My symptoms came on gradually and have waxed and waned but my biggest issues are with my eyes.\n\nWhen I read about FND I mostly see people who have issues with walking/paralysis. I have tingling in my legs and arms and basically whole body but no real loss of function. I am looking for anyone who has similar vision issues. It is been 3 months since my medication reaction and even with a clean MRI I am starting to wonder if I am going to be like this forever \ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab No one can really tell me how to get better.\n\nMy main issues are:\nTrouble focusing my eyes together--basically my vision is spacy and I feel out of body all the time\nIssues with screens--i cannot watch tv or read, scrolling on my phone makes me dizzy\nVisual snow\nEyes jump and bounce\nEyes flutter and move constantly when closed which freaks me out\n\nNonvision issues that feel related:\nBalance issues\nVery heavy head\nDizziness and vertigo\nBrain zaps and shakes\nStaticy tinnitus\nBody just feels electric all the time\nTics (not major)\n\nIt is like I can feel my nervous system misfiring. My brain and eyes feel jumpy and electric all the time. I had a full vestibular work up and all was clear. So how do I get my eyes back to working together? Still meeting with a neurologist and neuroophlamologist. Just looking for similar stories and encouragement. I really do not want to have this vision forever.\n\nThanks! I have some similar problems with vision, though mine center more around double and triple images laid one on top of the other. One thing that a physical therapist did to help with mine is have me wear glasses with one eye (my worst) acluded. Maybe something like that will help at least temporarily or help reset. I get blurred vision, but not all the time. I also sometimes have double vision which does not go away when I close one eye, which is really wierd I do not have the blurred vision but I get tic-like symptoms and during periods of sustained stress I too get the \"nervous system is hyper primed\" feeling in my head.\n\nThe frequency subsided overtime, but a lot of that had to do with not being in a stressful environment.\n\nSome of the stressors and triggers I have been able to tune out. Loud noises, traffic and crowded places I have been able to aclimatize to simply by sustained exposure. Other triggers have been harder to tune out, like being around toxic/aggressive people, and believe it or not, loud choir singing.\n\nNot every stress is a trigger though. I do not get as much symptoms during sustained concentration during things like detailed meetings or working going up on a ladder and cleaning the roof. We seem to have some similarities. My FND was also triggered by a medication reaction that caused Bradykenesia. It triggered FND and migraines. I have ocular migraines and blurry vision daily, and numbness, tingling, and weakness issues frequently. I have occasional speech, balance, and gait trouble as well. I am going to talk to my eye doctor about getting more testing for my vision though because I have thin retinas and have had eye injuries in the past so I want to rule out any physical symptoms just in case. I just started CBT to see if that will help, even though I have my doubts I figure it cannot hurt. I do not know what else to try. If you do not mind my asking, what medication was it that you reacted to? I feel ya! I have similar issues focusing vision, seeing things blur, trouble reading, low tolerance to scrolling and screens, light sensitivity, but instead of visual snow I have nausea. My neuro occupational therapist (for my movement issues) was awesome at observing my eye movements and referred me to a neurooptometrist who was 110% the right specialist I needed to see. They are very knowledgeable about functional vision issues. \n\nI was diagnosed with post-traumatic vision syndrome, specifically convergence insufficiency, oculomotor issues, and accommodative issues. I did 1.5-2 months of syntonics (light therapy) before starting weekly vision therapy. I am in month 4 of vision therapy and have made very slow but definite improvements! I no longer need to wear brimmed hats/sunglasses/turn off all lights indoors and am slowly pacing my ability to read and use the computer. One of the things I experience during an episode are visual problems. I also do not have paralysis but more so convulsions and whole body shakes.\n\nIn my every day life I do experience visual snow, double vision and all that but during an FND episode my eyes will force itself in to a forced location.\nWhat that means is they roll to the upper right corner, when I try to look somewhere else they will be forced back. Because of that my eyes also cannot focus on anything even if I try to force them.\n\nWhen the episode is over when I close my eyes they will be moving and twitching, sometimes lasts for days and when I have trouble sleeping because of it I can take half the dosage of meds I use for an episode (oxazepam). I am so sorry you are suffering friends :(\n\nI reacted really badly to my flu shot on October 4th this year, It exploded my mostly dormant FND, a LOT of horrible things happen now, but regarding eyes - My eyes like to do double vision most days. \nsome days I cannot see anything up close - it chooses which day.\nmigraines just randomly. \nif I use my regular glasses for seeing long distance, I get a headache so I do not wear them often now. \nI have the accessibility options on my phone at a very large text size and talk back on what I am typing to catch typos.\n\nNeuroopthalmologist resident said nothings wrong, they cannot help because they see nothings wrong and then he put in my chart that I came to see them for 'medication management'...I do not take anything for my eyes and I came to them because almost everyday I cannot see and I am walking into things. \n\nMe: \"so what do I do on the days that I cannot see anything?\"\nResident Dr: \"whh...

My neurologist is actually saying now that I have \"neuronitis\"-- basically that my nerves got irritated by the drug and that they should go back to normal after a few months.

They sound quite severe and debilitating. I did not have issues like this exactly but I had a gait issue that caused me to be in a wheelchair for about a year. I recommend trying to get a physical therapist who specializes in neurology, also called a neuro PT. They are usually the best to help with this kind of stuff. I found that the cure for my gait issue was standing on a half roller and trying to keep my balance. For some reason, using my leg muscles like that in a way that was not walking allowed my brain to use them properly again I guess. Now my gait issue only comes back very mildly if I am stressed or tired. I only saw a neurologist for the diagnosis and never saw one after that but to be fair, I had been taking antidepressants and in therapy for over 2 years when I developed my symptoms. I would say to book an appointment with your PCP about next steps and ask what they would do. They can refer you to a therapist and psychiatrist and physical therapy if they think that is the right treatment plan for you.\n\n-Hazel Hi, I am 25f with FND, in UK. \n\n(Sorry this is 3 weeks late but I thought I would answer anyway).\n\nNhs (uk health service) said an EEG is all the testing needed. I am incredibly lucky and have managed to see a psychiatrist - she prescribed anxiety meds for me. The nurses told me that the biggest change in reducing seizures usually comes from people improving mental health, and they advised talking therapy(cbt). I was advised to practise deep breathing daily so it is easy to do in stressful situations, and also told to establish a better sleep routine. I was told the biggest change in reducing issues like limb weakness/gait problems usually comes from seeing a neurophysiotherapist, (I am on a waiting list). The nurses also taught me about techniques like using grounding when a seizure is coming on to try and prevent it, and how distraction techniques help with walking.\n\nI dont use a wheelchair although at times I have got close enough to looking at prices of them online. I have been struggling with muscle spasms, facial spasms, difficulty walking, seizures, vertigo and vision issues. So far I havent managed to prevent the seizures or stop them at all.\n\nI have only had fnd for 3 months, I feel like it has been improving slightly in the last 2 weeks but it goes up and down a lot so it is hard to say. Hopefully in time I will.\n\nI live in the uk so I am not too sure about the insurance  question but I hope you manage to access some treatment\n\nEdit-To find about distraction techniques like grounding work (if you dont already know)-\n\n", "Do you work? \n\n( It will not let me vote but I work a part time job.

A while back I posted something in here asking others if they had experienced joint pain at all, not caused by a previously diagnosed condition.\nI was searching through the ( website and stumbled upon a portion in the symptom list about chronic pain. Apparently what i have been experiencing is not joint pain but rather chronic pain throughout the body. It never crossed my mind that my pain could have been from my FND. This is not my only symptom as I experience odd smells that come from nowhere, hear things that are not there, and constantly seeing things in the corner of my vision. \nThis pain is terrible. It hurts to walk, talk, write, move and pretty much everything hurts to do.\nI have not shaved in 3 weeks, because it hurts. I am sleeping all day, almost everyday because it relieves pain to stay completely still. Sorry your going through this, I have super smell sometimes to and super sensitive skin.

Being in bed will make you weaker, which will only increase the pain in the long run.

I was doing so many things for the first time again and it felt incredible. Then, in less than 4 hours friday night my entire body shut down again and I feel like I did when this first started. I can barely walk, I am in so much pain, my arms burn, my tremors are extreme, I cannot think. Took me 1 hr to write this much. I do not understand how or why this happened. I am so frustrated and angry bc that is 2 months of progress thrown in the trash. Does anyone else experience relapses like this? Does it get better? Am i going to have to start recovering from square 1 again or will I wake up tomorrow feeling normal again? I am so lost. And nobody understands how painful it is to see yourself doing your favorite things again like cooking and then having that ripped away from you for no reason. If anyone has any guidance please share. I do not know what to do anymore but lay in bed and cry myself to sleep, because sleep is the only time I do not feel so much pain. It gets better, then it gets worse, then it gets better again. For me relapses come and go. It is cyclical but also helps to keep a journal (in voice notes if you cannot type or write) to narrow down possible triggers. \n\n\nI am recently diagnosed after having a false MS diagnosis for the past five years. The symptoms are pretty much the same but MS is a hardware issue and FND is a software issue. \n\n\nWhat has been life changing for me is meditation. I started out with meditation and now I also do yoga for an hour a day. I am able to hike 8km most days now. I was bedridden for months and now I can move and breathe and I am in love with life and myself again. Meditation is something that you can do from bed, while lying down so it is perfect for those bedridden relapse times. It is not a cure. Some days I still cannot use my legs properly, some days my arms give up. I cannot type for long without excruciating pain. But I can use that pain now. \n\n\nGive yourself some grace, you are strong and your body is amazing, you would not be shouting into the void if your body did not want to fight. You got this. I am so sorry you are going through that. I also find that recovery is two steps forward, one step back (and sometimes two steps back!). \n\nWhat is recommended for FND is pacing. On bad days, do not do nothing, do just a little bit more than you feel like. And importantly, on good days, do a little bit less that you feel you could. That helps the nervous system not to \u201coverreact\u201d and start triggering symptoms. \n\nIt does take time and it is hard, but what you are experiencing now will not be permanent. Hang in there, use whatever support is on offer, and give yourself as much rest and loving care as you can. Thank you. I really needed to hear that. It does feel like 2 of the biggest steps back but I really want to believe it is not forever.\n\nBy pacing do you mean walking back and forth? Thank you. I have never found meditation helpful before but maybe now I can try it again when I am stuck in bed anyway. It is really nice to know some of us do get so much better. I keep thinking that if I had just one semi-normal day or 1 hour without any pain it would be so much easier to be hopeful and keep fighting. But I think you are right that my body does want to fight, and maybe it just needed a break this weekend Oh I am sorry for not being clearer! \u201cPacing\u201d in this case means \u201cpacing yourself\u201d - ie not overdoing it, not under-doing it, going at the right pace for your current level of capacity. \n\nIf you look up the neurosymptoms.org website there is some more info on pacing for FND \n\nBest of luck with your recovery \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79 Thank you for the clarification!", "Is this a thing for us? Is it a thing for those of us with FND to have a hard time getting motivated? Or having Anhedonia? \n\nI will be honest. I also have ADHD and Autism. I am sure those things do not help either. \n\nI am just so frustrated cuz I do not do much anymore. Not just because I am disabled either. I spend most of my time sitting around", "More than just TS? I am 32F and was diagnosed with TS a year ago. There are a lot of behaviours that I have always explained away with TS, but now starting to think that FND might be in the mix of diagnoses. \nI will be seeing a neuro in September. Not sure how I feel about this possibility of FND. Trying to read what I can, and work through the misconception of 'it is all in your head'. \n\nHere are a few of my notes of things that do not quite feel like TS... they only ever last less than 15 minutes. But happen at least once a week.\n\nTalking like a robot\nStuttering with first sounds repeatedly\nMissing the small words in sentences (the, and, to want)\nHaving trouble saying the word I actually want, and saying other words similar to it. \n\nWhole body Freezing \nVery very slow heavy walk\nFeet are glued to the floor, often more on one foot than both. \nHeavy body cannot move or slow move\nCannot talk\nDrag my frozen heavy leg and odd walk\nFalling down both knees some times 'kick out' and sometimes they just crumple \n\nRight hand curls up and in \n\nEyes blurred \u00a0 \n\nDizziness - Possibly caused from medications, but have not changed anything other than slowly lowering paroxetine.\nDizziness mostly in the mornings even while driving. Feels like Dizziness behind my eyes.\n\nI get angry at myself because I feel like I should be able to control my own body, anxiety that I am faking it. Even though logically I know that I would stop if I could.\nAny thoughts? you are heard and you are not alone. I feel this.", "does anyone else have this? so i was just sitting here, and I had my legs still for a while, and it felt like my legs *should* have been paralyzed, but they just were not. they were weak, but not paralyzed. the sensation when I ran my hand over my calves and feet just felt wrong too, like they were half-numb. It sounds weird, but I want to know if anyone else has had this before", "Newly diagnosed, frustrated, and confused I have been struggling with my health for basically the last 5 years. Over the last year I literally went to bed one night and woke up the next morning in excruciating pain. I am 17 and when I first expressed to my doctors that something was wrong they told me that I was having growing pains and that I was faking. It got so bad that I left school and was stuck with a cane or in bed for six months.  \n\n I just recently got out of an inpatient program and I was finally diagnosed with FND and Chronic Pain Syndrome.  I lose complete sensation and cannot move with no warning, exhaustion, fall a lot, dizziness, my ears ring, basically constant migraines. \n\nI know very little about the disorder.. Every doctor that I have been to has basically contradict another doctor that I have been to. And what is online is very vague. Can anyone help me understand a little bit? Oh h!\nI just made a similar post where I ask how to recognise an episode and what triggers are.\nI am still newly diagnosed too so I cannot answer you much except share my side and what Ive been told and found online.\n\nTo recognise an episode so far the only think I can think of is extreme or unusual fatigue few hours before, every time I had an episode Ive had this debilitating fatigue but i had that same fatigue yesterday and nothing happened.\n\nThe doctor I saw in the ER about this said it can be caused by stress, illness and underlying neurological illnesses. She explained that when it happens your brain is having an error processing everything that is going on, so some information goes to the wrong place. She also said that untill now there was believed FND is something you cannot see, but there arw researches coming in that have evidence FND is something you can see on a functional mri. In the grey matter i believe but im not sure.\n\nUsually they will tell you to go to a psychologist because they believe it is a mental thing. While that is not true it might still be a good idea to go. Hi, I think I just commented on your post. I am 19 and I was diagnosed in January but I hope I can help you a little. I want to give reassurance to the both of you and really everyone with FND. \n\nYes, many doctors have differing opinions on what causes FND. You see, FND is unfortunately poorly understood and not well known currently but it is neurological.\n\nThe conversion of stress is more correlated with conversation disorder, which is still just as valid, rather than FND which is neurological. Stress does tend to make symptoms worse though. My neurologist explained it as a software issue. It is the brain misfiring or under firing causing a wide variety of symptoms.\n\nI completely understand how you feel. I had to quit school, stop driving, I am dependent on my mom, and I have been wheelchair bound ever since March as well as mute. Some of my symptoms include paralysis (full body or just my legs) memory issues, seizures, cognitive regression, etc. It tough and for me, it is hard to see the brighter days. \n\nUnfortunately I cannot really tell you if things will change or get better because it depends on the person. For me, it is severe. I have been to rehab and to the hospital multiple times with little change but I hear of people who come back and they go into remission with some if not all symptoms so it is possible. I would recommend looking at the website FNDhope. It explains a lot but truthfully still quite vague. Also, having a therapist could help you cope if you are open to it. There are many options.\n\nI really hope I could help you in some way :) Keep hanging in there guys. We got this!! I am so sorry you are going through this. I had a very similar story. I took Dr Afra Moenter\u2019s class with FNDcourage and it has been a game changer for me. My symptoms are so much more manageable and I actually have a life again. I created a website with resources for FND! Feel free to check it out!\n\n(", "Does anybody else get this or is it just me i could be walking around normally and then sort of lose my balance but i catch myself, it is not a dramatic loss of balance but it does kind of scare me because it happens several times a day. All the time. This is my normal state these days. Yup me too, im not officially diagnosed with FND but most likely on the route to. I am starting physical therapy next week I will share any tips on how to deal with the balance problems :) great thanks! hope your diagnosis goes well that must really suck i am sorry to hear that Pretty much daily, yeah. I get startled everytime it happens. Yup that happens to me too. Like I am living my life on a boat hahahahaha HA, that is a great way to put it Yeah on bad days i walk like I am drunk. Never really fall though Yep. \n\nMy daughter (13) has being using a single crutch for about 4 months.\n\nJust woke one morning wobbly as fuck (sorry for swearing).\n\nThis was after various other manifestations, so not completely out of the blue  !

It is nice to know this condition is getting more attention. One of the most infuriating aspects of my wife getting diagnosed with this condition was so many people (especially medical professionals) telling her they did not know what it was or that she was faking it. It took 3 years of PNES and Dissociative Amnesia for a neurologist to finally diagnose her and finally validate her issues. \n\nI cannot wait to surprise her with one of these shirts. (", "Has anyone else experienced this? Hi, thank you for having me here \u2764\n\nAfter many years of experiencing unbearable symptoms that were not understood by any health professionals, a few days ago a neurologist diagnosed me with functional neurological disorder, functional myoclonus, and non epileptic seizure attack disorder. \n\nEver since I have been given these diagnoses, other health professionals are now taking me less seriously, a couple going as far to say it is all psychological and in my head. Yesterday I was finally seen at the hosptial pain clinic after a long wait, because I experience chronic pain. When I was asked about the appointment with neurology, I shared the names of my diagnoses. I feel like that was a mistake on my part, because she completely changed her attitude towards me, and said that there was nothing she and clinic could do for my pain, and that practicing mindfulness is the only thing that might help, because it is all in my head (I also already practice mindfulness, have for a very long time).\n\nI think what I am trying to reach out here for, is to see if anybody else has experienced dismissal and poor support from medical professionals? Particularly once they hear that you have FND, or give you the diagnosis. Thanks so much if anyone here feels up to sharing their experience. I am also wondering, to those of you who have had these bad experience(s), what did you do afterwards to try and cope? Is there anything you may be able to suggest? I ask because I have been struggling more with Major Depressive Disorder since the appointment with the pain clinic. \n\nThanks again for having me here, wishing you each all the very best \u2764 I have had similar experiences, but mostly quizzical looks from doctors as they have not heard of FND. You are not alone, and I am sorry but I have not found a good solution so cannot offer any advice. I keep looking for decent doctors that understand and have found a few (who then move to different cities far, far away!!). They are out there - keep on keeping on. You are worth it. Thanks for sharing, it is helped me. Thank you very much for opening up to me \u2764 I am so sorry that you have had similar experiences, and that some decent doctors you found have now moved to different cities. I can imagine that must be challenging.  I appreciate you reaching out and encouraging me to hang in there! It is made a difference. Yes, FND or FMD is like the Scarlett Letter of diagnoses. So much misinformation and a negative stigma toward patients. New research showing that very little people have psychological issues or trauma. This condition was once labeled hysteria and only occurred in women and then conversion disorder and then psychogenic disorder and how they are starting to acknowledge it as a Functional Neurological Disorder to reduce stigma. I have other diagnoses as well and I just feel like some doctors do not believe in the umbrella of FND as much as others or some are more focused on symptom relief regardless of etiology. I have this problem with close people in my life. I get the  \"hyperactive increased brain activity feeling\" in noisy situations and will tic visibly. Certain people have caught on and will treat me as if I am being emotional or under psychological distress.\n\nI have had to explain to them that nothing about my psychology has changed, the difference is how my brain reacts. Everybody has natural feelings in difficult situations, but most people can cover them up, like the way you hold your tongue at the dinner table when that one particular relative is being difficult. The only difference is that I have lost the ability to completely cover up my emotional state because my brain/body works in altered way now.\n\nThis presentation going on preliminary functional MRI studies was really helpful for me to understand what is going on: it is rather technical though.\n", "Symptoms worsening "]
