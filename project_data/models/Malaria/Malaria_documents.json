Sorry this is long. The first place I looked for information was reddit and could not find any stories or advice so I figure it is my duty to chronicle mine.\n\nA few weeks ago I took an awesome vacation in Thailand. I traveled all over the country with 2 friends of mine and was there for a total of 2 weeks. \n\nTowards the end of the first week I began to experience some major fatigue accompanied by minor fevers and chills over a few days. The fevers/chills would come and go every 48 hours or so. This was in addition to the typical \"bangkok belly\" lots of travelers report having when visiting Thailand. While I was there the possibility of Malaria did cross my mind as I had been bitten by more than a few mosquitoes but I did not consider it seriously since I knew the odds were so low. I chalked the fevers up to the stomach bug I was dealing with.\n\nWhen I returned to the USA I felt pretty great. My stomach stopped giving me issues, and I readjusted relatively quickly, though my fatigue did linger preventing me from going to the gym. I figured this was probably jet lag. \n\nI returned on a Sunday and we had a company Christmas party the following Friday. I stayed up late and had a couple beverages as one would expect. The next day I did not feel great but I did not feel terrible either. That night my roommates and I had some friends over for a few beers. I felt off the whole time, and after a few hours I had to leave.\n\nI ended up with (what felt like, I did not take an actual temperature) a high fever which made me feel delirious all night. I thought I had kicked this illness by now, so the fact that it re-surfaced really made me start wondering. One of the main symptoms of Malaria is the reoccurring fevers due to the life-cycle of the bacteria. I read this on WebMD and was convinced I had contracted it. \n\nThe next morning I called an immediate care facility and told them what I thought the problem was. They immediately advised me to not come to them, because they would not be able to test for it, but to go to the ER. This was a mistake. I did not have a fever or any other symptoms at this point, but I was spooked so I went anyways.\n\nI ended up sitting at the ER for 5 hours while they ran their normal tests. I could tell they were not really sure how to proceed for possible Malaria either. There was a $150 upfront visit fee (I have insurance thankfully) which, coupled with the time I had already spent there, made me insist they draw my blood and run some tests.\n\nIn the end, I ended up negative for Malaria and everything else they tested me for which was great, but I got slapped with a $900 bill even with insurance, on top of the $150 paid up front. \n\n**My advice: If you think you have Malaria, call an infectious disease specialist or someone else who is equipped to handle it. Malaria is fatal if left untreated for months. You can wait a week to see a specialist and it will not cost you nearly as much as an unnecessary trip to the ER.**", "Novel combat strategy for malaria ", "CAN MALARIA BE CURED ONCE AND FOR ALL?

Find out the top five ways to avoid getting ill on your vacation and make the most of your holidays.\n\n**1. Determine your level of risk**\n\nInform yourself about your destination and the chance of getting malaria infection. Things you must consider are the season and time of year you are travelling. You should also consider the duration of your stay, the activities you have planned to do and the place you will be staying. The risk for infection may vary substantially, even within the same country. Successful ( is based on your knowledge of the potential dangers. \n\n**2. Stay in well-screened areas at night**\n\nAvoid sleeping out in the open where mosquitoes like to live. Avoid the areas where the mosquito breeding grounds are found like standing water, tyres, lakes, waste dumps. If you are planning to sleep in a tent, keep the door closed at all times and made sure that your tent has no holes anywhere. These may be fundamental rules, but they can significantly enhance the success of your efforts of preventing malaria.\n\n**3. Always use a bed-net impregnated with insecticides**\n\nCheck that the mosquito net is not damaged and always assure it is correctly tucked under your mattress. The sleeping room itself should have extranets attached to the windows and doors. Keep your air conditioning system on, as mosquitoes usually stay out of cold, air-conditioned rooms.\n\n**4. Use mosquito repellent**\n\nUse a good quality insect spray holding pyrethroids in all living and sleeping quarters, especially during evening and nighttime.\n\n**7. Check the risks - Get an antimalarial treatment**\n\nDepending on the risk of malaria at your destination, it might be required to practise the ( either on a daily or a weekly basis.

He does this by finding nano-sized nickel-iron crystals, that are unique to meteors.\n\nMalaria. (yes the disease) Malaria is a protozoon that feeds on blood. Blood contains a non-magnetic iron-containing molecule call heme. Iron is toxic to protozoans. The way the malaria parasite handles the iron is by converting it to hemozoin. Hemozoin is a crystal made of the iron. It is super-paramagnetic, a special case of ferromagnetic. I would like to talk to Meteor Man to see if there is any chance his metal detector could be modified to detect hemozoin.\n\nThe person who told me about meteor man, a friend of his, will not let me talk to him. She thinks the idea is pure woo, and will not communicate a message or give me his name. This is because I am entrenched in pseudoscience in many ways (guilty). I think that if I can get a couple of doctors, physicists or anyone who has scientific authority to say this is not a waste of time, she will forward the information, or let me talk to him.\n\nAlso, for the record, if anyone on Reddit can do anything useful with this please do.

The lancet and malaria journal and can both be taken very seriously. \n\n (the second reference) seems to indicate there is even commercial equipment trying this as dialysis - see refs 5,6,7 therein. \n\nSo not a waste time, but the feasibility remains unclear. Forget \"Meteor Man\" - sounds like an unhelpful distraction, because at best he has a sensitive magnetometer, which I do not think is what you are after...\n\n **Hemozoin**\n\nHaemozoin is a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by some blood-feeding parasites. These hematophagous organisms such as Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), Rhodnius and Schistosoma digest haemoglobin and release high quantities of free heme, which is the non-protein component of hemoglobin. A heme is a prosthetic group that consists of an iron atom contained in the center of a heterocyclic porphyrin ring. Free heme is toxic to cells, so the parasites convert it into an insoluble crystalline form called hemozoin.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 Thank you for your reply.

It is transmitted by an infected female mosquito called Anopheles (&gt; 30 species able to transmit). \n\nIt is known that a specific mutation affects the membrane of red blood cells and gives immunity to people with this mutation. This mutation is present for &lt;95% of some African populations. It gives immunity against Plasmodium vivax (the most amply distributed human malaria in the world) (\n\nAlso, carrying specific mutations (like sickle-cell heterozygotes, people carrying one gene of sickle-cell disease but not being actually sick), prevents you from being infected as dramatically as others. This, again, has been selected in some African areas. (\n\nI have also heard that hemoglobin type and other genetic factors have an impact on malaria immunity. I am not an expert though, so anybody please correct/ complete this, in case I am missing something.\n\nSo yeah, basically you have a badass genetic background and white people are more sensitive to malaria, because missing some cool mutations. Cool! Thanks for the response. I get it now. Thanks. &gt; Also, carrying specific mutations (like sickle-cell heterozygotes, people carrying one gene of sickle-cell disease but not being actually sick), prevents you from being infected as dramatically as others.\n\n&gt; I have also heard that hemoglobin type and other genetic factors have an impact on malaria immunity. I am not an expert though, so anybody please correct/ complete this, in case I am missing something.\n\nIt is four months later but I thought I would chime in and point out that you are talking about the same thing here: \"sickle-cell disease\" _is_ a disorder due to abnormal haemoglobin type. Basically in most of the human population the haemoglobin beta gene (genotype AA) leads to the production of haemoglobin-A, which is pretty shitty vs. malaria. Populations in sub-Saharan Africa developed an allele which produces haemoglobin-S instead, which (unlike the A variant) tends to clump together. This is what helps vs. malaria: the polymer chains and the byproducts of the clumping make it harder for the parasite to get a foothold in your red blood cells, so less of them get destroyed and you experience less symptoms overall. It usually does not have adverse effects because most people are heterozygous (AS), so about half their haemoglobin is the normal A variant. But if you are homozygous (SS) and _all_ your haemoglobin is haemoglobin-S, the clumping is so bad that your red blood cells tend to collapse in on themselves (into a _sickle_ shape) under stress (like respiratory illness, dehydration, low oxygen concentrations, etc).", "Malaria - a rising global threat ", "Can an experienced microscopist distinguish a well stained blood smear, from a badly stained one?

Vivax and falciparum:\n \n\nSweet Wormwood, artemisia annua, is an annual shrub native to Southeast Asia containing artemisinin. Artemisinin is proven to be between 95-100% effective against plasmodium infection in most studies. It is most often combined with another treatment to form Artemisinin-Based Combination Therapies (ACTS) which in theory will prevent the development of artemisinin resistance. However, there have been reports of resistance from Southeast Asia. Some argue this is due to a. Annua being administered as a tea rather than ACT. Otherslike Dr. Pierre Lutgen argue tea is a far more effective administration of the medicine. \n\nMalariaworld.org- search: Pierre Lutgen", "Although deworming may provide net health benefits to human populations, the Princeton study suggests that it has the potential to exacerbate the severity of some malaria infections.
