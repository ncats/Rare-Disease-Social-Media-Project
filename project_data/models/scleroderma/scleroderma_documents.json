["Magnets placed on fingers can help you get rid of pain (", "ANA + w/ pattern staining C29 ... need insight/anecdotes/advice Hey guys! \n\nI am a 25 yr old AFAB. Since my senior year of high school I have been struggling with symptoms of chronic fatigue and had mono five times, that combo justifies each other. However, over the last six years symptoms like insane weight gain over short periods of time despite being highly active (dog walker) and a vegetarian, and having a tendency to restrict food due to past ED, no period, acne, easily sick, mood swings, intolerance to heat, brain fog, etc. started.\n\nAfter testing negative for PCOS at my OBGYN I ordered tests from Jason Health and went to a lab myself. None of my results were indicative of PCOS, my cortisol levels were normal, my metabolic panel was normal, but I always have high eosinophils and low blood protein. My ANA panel came back positive with three staining patterns, the most concerning being c29 which is almost always Indicative of scleroderma. \n\nNone of my symptoms seem to make sense with any type of scleroderma but maybe there just is not enough personal stories out there? Should I redo the panel or just go see a rheumatologist ? \n\nANYTHING you have info wise would be helpful. I would go to a rheumatologist. They will probably redo all of your blood work anyway. I do not really have symptoms, either. I went to my doctor because my body hurt (to the touch and my joints, especially hips). Blood tests finally showed scleroderma. So far, these things and shit skin are the only symptoms I have right now. I will schedule an appointment the rheumatologist to and test with them just so they have it on record. I was diagnosed with sclera derma at 15 without any symptoms besides the bloodwork and all those symptoms that you are describing. It was not till eight years later that I got the full on signs of systemic scleroderma (there is two types) which explains why I did not show any outside skin problems but tested positive for scleroderma \n\nI think that you should look into functional medicine doctors as well as Western medical doctors. Because there is only so much that our regular doctors can do in changing lifestyle patterns with scleraderma is what helped me. Check for \u201cleaky gut\u201d and SIBO infection with a functional med dr. AND see the rheumatologist for the other stuff. The AIP diet helped so much. The brain fog and fatigue is not as prevalent anymore. Other autoimmune diseases often are comorbid with scleroderma! So make sure to check everything out. It is a long journey but we will worth it If you would feel up to it I would be really interested in talking to you more via Pm about what your journey has been like since having no symptoms at 15 to having symptoms now. Because I am not exhibiting any skin symptoms I am operating under the assumption that I probably have systemic sclerosis (which does not bode well for someone who also has asthma) and I know staying on top of this is crucial, but I am also pretty scared. also THANK YOU so much! Are your doctors doing anything now to help mitigate long term risk? I have asthma too so I totally get that. Yes I will message you off off my other account! Lmao do not mind  this one a girls got to eat, so that is why my account on here is not PG PMed you! You should do some research on the Epstein-Barr Virus since you had mono already multiple times, that virus can continue to wreak havoc on your body and some studies now are claiming it may be linked to autoimmune diseases. I second the suggestion to get a integrative doctor to help with possible gut issues and definitely go see a rheumatologist.\n\nSome short reads on EBV, I am also reading the medical medium\n\n\n \n\n \n", "My doctors are not taking me seriously  Auto immune disorders can have overlap in symptoms. Sometimes it takes multiple rheumatologists to figure out exactly what you have. I had to go to two to get a scleroderma diagnosis. You might want to consider a couple more rheumatologist opinions. I had a diagnosis of CREST syndrome during my last flare up, was put on methotrexate and prednisone, and went into remission. Now this time around two different rheumatologists think I never even had it. It is very confusing. Like the hardest part is, apart from intermittent rashes, I have no skin symptoms, which throws everyone off, because I have everything else but the most classic symptom. That is called Systemic Sclerosis Sine Scleroderma (SSSS). It is very rare, but it does happen. Most doctors never see it in their lifetime.\n\nI just happened to be reading about it as I stumbled on your post. Med student studying b/c we have a scleroderma patient coming to clinic tomorrow and I wanted to brush up. Just want to also point out that I am taking you at face value with the \u201cI have everything but the most classic symptom\u201d. I dont know your history and findings so I am not saying anything definitively. Oh, I totally understand. I have looked into sine scleroderma myself. I have always had the positive antibodies and once had the reflux and Raynaud's (was put on methotrexate and it went away in a few months. The current Raynaud's and skin color changes (10 years later after no symptoms, also why they think it is not scleroderma) extend well beyond my elbows. I do not count this as \"skin involvement\" because my rheumatologists never do. It is not tightening or anything like that. I guess the key takeaway is that a lot of people I have run into online are like myself, where the antibodies are present and a lot of various and debilitating symptoms are present but not enough or in the right places, so we get labelled the same as a completely healthy individual, when I think the reality is a lot more complex. I am interested to see how the meeting with the patient goes. Keep me updated! I found this interesting- (", "I get it now. Everyone on here warned me that having a job with the diagnosis is trouble.

Used to be able to run miles and swim laps in college and now in my mid-30's I have to be careful taking a long brisk walk or my arms burn, weirdly. Wondering if it could be related. Thanks for any help. Be well and safe, you all. Its pontentially related but youd need to be diagnosed properly by a scleroderma specialist in your area at times this mean driving over six hours but its worth it considering how dangerous this disease can be for some and getting proper treatment is vital. Lookup specialist in your area. I dealt with muscle fatigue when my scleroderma onset. It was weird like they would feel like i worked out super intensely when all I did was carry a few boxes. It was by far my oddest symptom. I also felt random muscle relief you know when you stop working out and theres exhaustion but also a good feeling rush of it being over. Yeah that would randomly happen for no reason. I could be sitting on the couch. Sadly you need more hten an ANA result to diagnosis scleroderma and alot more information to get a subtype.

I thought I had lupus for 28 years so I am pretty good about advocating for myself and understanding what labs and results mean.   Here is my thought process:\n\nI would like to establish a baseline for lung/heart involvement.  What is necessary for that to happen?  X-ray or CT scan for lungs.  I had an unrelated EKG a few months ago (that looked good), I would still like to request an ultrasound since we are looking for something specific.  Does this sound right?\n\nI would like to know the extent of calcinosis even though there does not seem to be much to about it.  Pretty positive my knees/shins and elbows are pretty involved.  Is this reasonable to ask for?\n\nAre there additional blood tests to request?  I had a very high Anticentromere antibody (first time I have ever had it run, thankful for a new rheumatologist!).\n\nLastly, does anyone have a similar experience of long term scleroderma but not getting a diagnosis until new symptoms develop? I can only sort of respond to your last question. My mom has had symptoms of sclero her whole life, but wasnt diagnosed until she was 52. She was seeing all sorts of doctors her entire adult life, and had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It seemed like everything got worse all of the sudden and that is when they finally discovered the sclero. We do not know if it developed over time or not, but once she got to this stage every thing has really gone downhill. She has the kind that affects internal organs more and her skin less This is helpful, thank you.  It confirms that I need to be very sure that they do not hold back on ascertaining how I am being affected internally.  Part of me thinks \"hey I have had it this long and I am not dead!\" but at the same time I need to remember we found it not just because of the new blood test but because of the new symptoms (none of which have been skin related).

On the left side of right middle finger there is this waxy, thick patch of skin between my top two knuckles, and these small bumps appear on it, and on other parts of my hands as well. It is quite hard to describe, but during stress and at night my hands can just feel generally inflamed, red, in pain, and there is this sensation as if the skin is thick all over. I have been noticing these patches in the photos, and I cannot tell if they are just small scars or the calcinosis I have read about. You are lucky I have calcinosis spots on my scrotum and I am a teen so it is very embarrassing and yes that looks and the symptoms are very calcinosis like I think you should go get checked it could be idiopathic calcinosis", "Fingers Wrinkly/Pruny. Concerned its scleroderma. So about a month ago my fingers started becoming wrinkly/pruny as if I they had been exposed to water for a prolonged period of time, when they have not. Soon after, the skin on both my hands started peeling off. The peeling lasted a few days and completely went away. However the wrinkled fingers did not go away.\n\nI am 29F and have no known health conditions. I also have no other symptoms besides the wrinkled fingers. I have noticed that when my fingers are warm and moist, either from washing them or from sweat, the wrinkles go away and they appear normal. But when they are cold and dry, the wrinkles appear. The skin does not change color like in Raynauds and there is no pain. My fingers feel kind of swollen though and a bit numb/tingly and can feel stiff when the wrinkles set in. I went down a hole Googling my symptoms last night and now I am terrified that I have scleroderma. Does this sound like something it could be? I plan to see a doctor soon if the symptoms do not resolve but I am trying to hold off for awhile as I do not have very good health insurance. just a general statement- scleroderma tends to cause a lack of wrinkles. skin hardens or thins, but its a sclerosing ( hardening) of the connective tissue so skin looses its mobility.  i hope you figure out what is going on with you. i would start with your dr,  google has every condition, even ones so rare you are not likely to have them. start with letting a medical clinician see what is going on, they will likely be able to help! This is not indicative of scleroderma. I only get wrinkled fingers if I have very bad raynauds and it is extremely painful.  Even if it is Scleroderma, it is a very slow advancing disease. Frankly it sounds like you are dehydrated or using harsh cleaning chemicals.", "My sister was just diagnosed My older sister was just diagnosed with systemic scleroderma. She also has raynauds and sjogrens. Having googled it, I am afraid for her and I know she is afraid too. I would like to learn whatever I can about this illness. What helps. What does not. What triggers a flare. Possible diet changes. Best form of treatment. Please, any information at all that you would be willing to share would be greatly appreciated. I am sorry to hear about your sister\u2019s diagnosis. Is it Systemic (whole body is effected) or Limited systemic/ CREST (face, legs and arms)? I have limited so I can only speak on that. I think her doctor told her it was systemic. Though, the main thing that is being affected right now is her hands as her raynauds has been getting pretty bad recently. I know she is also been having stomach problems when she eats certain foods, but I am not sure if they told her whether or not that was congested. If the Raynauds is pretty bad they usually prescribe viagra or something similar and trust me does it help. As for the stomach problems that can be Scleroderma related. When you have scleroderma it usually comes with Raynauds and GERDS (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) the symptoms are heartburn/reflux, diarrhea, nausea etc. It is great that you have questions so hopefully you are prepared for when she has them too. As for treatment I am currently on:\n\nImuran 50mg 2X a day.\nPlaquenil 200? 1 and 1/2 tablets once a day.\n\n*Imuran and Plaquenil are Immunosuppressives to keep the Scleroderma in check. Sometimes you are given corticosteroids too.\n\nDiltiazem 90 ER and Viagra (as needed)\n\n*Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker and Viagra is a vasodilator both are for circulation but Viagra helps when the hands turn blue/purple.\n\nI am on many more medications but those I did mention pertain exclusively to Scleroderma. There is Facebook groups which are helpful. Team Inspire also is good. \n\nTreat her with actual medicine. Do not buy into bullshit pseudoscience. \n\nWord of advice, get her titers checked to determine her immunity to things like MMR etc. if she is not immune, get vaccines now before she goes into immune suppression. \n\nIt is scary yes, but it is totally manageable these days. \n\nHow old is she?\n\nI was diagnosed in my mid to late 20\u2019s. \n\nAMA - we are here for you and your sister.", "My raynaud's is spreading, scleroderma-like symptoms with no diagnosis ", "Confused about morphea... Hello all! I want to start by saying that I feel super bad asking this here because it seems like so many people have worse cases than mine, but I do not know where else to ask... A few years ago my dermatologist told me that the mysterious discoloration I had on my left hip, arm and shoulder was morphea, and that there was not anything she could do besides give me something to soften the surface of the skin. A cream was prescribed and it was so uncomfortable to me I gave up using it a couple of weeks later. Years later, I have virtually no new information, and mysterious hip pain. I do not notice it all the time, but when I do it is pretty painful, and right under where my morphea is the  most dry/tight/noticeable? Like I said earlier, I do not really have any information so describing it is tough. Could my hip pain have anything to do with the morphea? I do not really know where to start or what kind of doctor/specialist could help me if they are related. As a side note, I am graduating highschool this year, and though I have not been super active, I have never had trouble with my hips or joints prior to this, so I am just really confused. Any general information or experience with morphea would really help me as well. They might not be related at all, but I do not want to make anything worse. I always like to be educated on what is going on with my body, but the lack of information from my doctors really stumps me. Thank you in advance!! I recently read an article on morphea: \n\nI hope that gives you a foundation of information that you can build from. If you do have this type of scleroderma, it makes the most sense to me to talk to a rheumatologist, but one that has experience with sclero, or even better, the morphea expression of it. There are a lot of rheumatologists that just do not have experience with scleroderma to really help (because it is a rare disease). The first rheumatologist I saw had no idea what was wrong with me. I had to go to a second one to get a diagnosis.\n\nI hope you find information that is helpful! I have morphea too. That is the only symptom that I have for my scleroderma. No internal involvement, lucky for me!\n\nI went to a dermatologist a year ago and was diagnosed. I still go see her every few months. She also referred me to a rheumatologist and I go there more often. It is been a year of medication that has done nothing.

It is just my arms and abdomen but still... Yes. I have morphea scleroderma down my left thigh and leg and it does hurt.

Thank you\u270c\ud83c\udffb I would start by asking your primary care doc for a basic autoimmune blood panel.  Most people with scleroderma will have an ANA+.  I would also seek referral to a rheumatologist.  Prioritize seeing a doc with experience treating scleroderma patients.  Not all rheumatologists are current on treatment protocols.  The rheumatologist will be able to run more extensive lab work as well as other tests, like capillary nail bed test, which can determine if you have scleroderma as well getting a baseline for disease progression. This is going to vary based on your country and how the healthcare systems works where you live and are insured.  Best of luck with your diagnostic journey. Thank you so much! Just a small question, since the process is underway, should I get my insurance updated for larger coverage, considering the financial strain a chronic condition like this may cause? I do not feel qualified to definitively answer that question.  I will say that it is expensive to be chronically ill and if you have the opportunity to increase coverage, it may be to your benefit.

Is that scleroderma related or is it related to age or another reason? They should have taken bloodwork at some point and im wondering what her scl-70 score is. With all of the other issues id have to assume she has diffuse scleroderma which can be the most aggressive type. She cannot walk because she is too weak and her legs are swollen from kidney failure (this is what I have been told, it is been hard to get information out of her side of the family at some points because they feel protective of me as I am in my early 20\u2019s) \nShe is 62, and you are correct, it is diffuse scleroderma. Also, what is a scl-70 score? Scl-70 are just autoantibodies they usually test to help diagnose scleroderma. Theres no concrete evidence but studies have shown that the higher scores indicate diffuse vs limited and also can help indicate how aggressive the scleroderma is. I believe the mean is 4. I hate to say but she might be in bad shape moving forward. You should 100% find a scleroderma specialist in the area and see if they can view her case and help out. She should have been on a series of medications including an immunosuppressant like mycophenolate and with the swelling it sounds like she should be on a lasix like furosemide as well.

Ive had scleroderma for 5 years now. Can I ask how badly did the disease hit your father at the onset?  Mine has plataued significantly since first being diagnosed, but I still deal with the symptoms daily. Sorry for your loss. My dad was diagnosed Dec \u201810 and was pretty good for about 6 years, only had progressive Raynaud\u2019s symptoms. He died in September \u201820. \n\nIn general, he went through phases of remission and recurrence. He called the recurrences \u201cscleroderma attacks\u201d. He would be fine for months or years, and then very quickly his immune system would attack another organ. Heart, kidney, intestines, lungs, and heart again. It is my understanding this pattern of remission and recurrence is typical for systemic scleroderma (disclaimer: I am not a doctor... but my dad was, and he told me that. Take it with a grain of salt, memory is fallible, etc.)\n\n2011-2016 he mostly had issues with Raynaud\u2019s syndrome. \n\nThen starting in 2016 he began to decline.\n\n2016- hospitalized with cardiac arrest, pacemaker, kidney function impairment. If he had not been working at the hospital at the time of his cardiac arrest, he would have died. He got a pacemaker. \n\n2017- kidney function declined further, began to lose weight. Intestinal problems became severe. \n\n2018- intestinal problems diagnosed SIBO and low motility (he was not able to digest food and take up nutrients).\n\n2019- diagnosed Interstitial Lung Disease. He was underweight by this point. He consulted with specialists in Pittsburgh and they decided it was time for the nuclear option- chemo and immunosuppressants. \n\nDecember 2019- began 6 months chemo to wipe out his immune system. \n\nIn the first half of 2020, he did chemo, began immunosuppressants, and was hospitalized once for a minor virus. \n\nIn the second half of 2020 he was hospitalized for 3 months, initially due to Influenza B. He was in and out of the ICU and physical rehabilitation floors. A huge list of medical problems began to stack up. \n\nHe passed away in September \u201820 of cardiac arrest. Many organ systems were stressed or impaired. If he had not died of cardiac arrest, he would have likely gone soon of kidney problems (he chose not to do dialysis) or lung problems. \n\nSome unsolicited advice. If anything changes for you- shortness of breath, urination habits change, weight changes, lethargy, anything- GO TO THE DOCTOR. Be persistent, advocate for yourself, get a second and third opinion, see a scleroderma specialist. Dad\u2019s organ involvement happened in as little as 2 months for each recurrence. He might have been a candidate for some drug trials if he would gotten help on the early side. Im sorry to hear all this. Can I ask how old he was at diagnosis vs passing? I was only 35 when diagnosed, which is very rare.  I get my lungs tested 2x a year and am lucky enough to be able to see a Scleroderma specialist at Johns Hopkins in Maryland.   So far so good, knock on wood.   My Raynauds has been manageable. I am on a vasodilator.  \n\nHow bad was his skin at early onset?  They have a very detailed \"skin score\" to measure progression of the disease. It sounds like you are doing all the right things! My dad was diagnosed at 57 and passed away at 67.

My right side is my \"bad\" side, but no real cause has ever been found aside from the vague \"Neuro Lyme\".\n\nNow, at age 43, I find myself still battling Lyme Disease symptoms with herbal treatments, and living in an apartment for six years that I now know has a significant mold issue. My poor immune system!\n\nFor a few years, I have noticed that my right eyelid is growing less and less hooded. This seems strange to me, as I would expect my \"bad\" side to be droopier, not more taught.\n\nA few months ago, I noticed I had a groove in my scalp. The groove now extends down my forehead curving towards my right eye.\n\nI am waiting for a doctor appointment to see if this is, indeed, En Coup De Sabre, but it seems likely. If I do have this form of linear scleroderma,  it usually strikes in childhood, yes? Is there a chance that it may have hit me when I was first infected with Lyme Disease as a teenager, and effected my right eye, but did not manifest the \"scar\" on my head?  \n\nCan it still have small effects while \"dormant\"? How stealthy can linear scleroderma be?\n\nMy right arm has had a series of raised bumps that seem to follow Blaschko lines, and the right side of my face moves differently.   \n\n\nI am just wondering if I am on the right track here, and if there might be any correlations that I am missing, or that I am inflating.   \n\n\nThank you for reading!", "Therapeutic plasma exchange for the treatment of systemic sclerosis: A comprehensive review and analysis  From the link:\n\nTherapeutic plasma exchange has been tried as a treatment approach for systemic sclerosis since 1978 based on the rationale that some circulating factor is involved in disease pathogenesis, for example, autoantibodies or immune complexes, and that removing the potential pathogenic factors could lead to symptom improvement. Based on our impression that clinicians and researchers are largely unaware that a large volume of research has been published about the use of therapeutic plasma exchange as a treatment for systemic sclerosis, we conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of all published research on this topic.\n\nResults:\n\nWe identified 46 relevant articles that met our search criteria, involving a total of 572 patients. Of these, 19 were case studies; the rest ranged from small observational studies to prospective randomized clinical trials. In all but two studies, most patients receiving therapeutic plasma exchange showed improvements in both clinical symptoms and laboratory markers, including significant improvement in Raynaud\u2019s symptoms and healing of digital ulceration after three to four weekly treatments. The beneficial effects from even a short course of therapeutic plasma exchange treatments were long-lasting, typically 6\u2009months or longer. Therapeutic plasma exchange was very well tolerated. Adverse events were rare and, in almost all cases, mild and transitory.", "Thickening &amp; tightening of skin on feet? Has anyone experienced problems specifically with their feet? Yes.

I have like a red ring around my feet", "\u2018Our battles living with scleroderma\u2019 - The Nation Newspaper ", "Positive antibodies Hi everyone. I did not even know what scleroderma was until I got positive test results for the ENA screen and the Scl-70 antibodies, which indicate scleroderma. I have other diagnosed autoimmune conditions: Addison's disease, and I have had both Grave's disease and Hashimoto (autoimmune hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism). I also have severely dry eyes, so my doctor wanted to test me for Sjogrens syndrome, and scleroderma antibodies happened to be on the same test panel. I am very worried now that this means I have scleroderma and caught it in the early stages. As for the symptoms, I do have reflux/heartburn, sometimes everyday. I have had Raynaud's for most of my childhood until early adulthood, but it is been several years since I have had any symptoms. I am seeing an immunologist about these results in April. I have seen scary things about scleroderma while researching it, about lung problems, patients requiring organ transplants etc, so that scares me a lot. I already have enough of my other autoimmune conditions... Any thoughts or opinions on what to expect would be appreciated :) Welcome to one of the worlds crappiest clubs lol... Is it limited sclerodoma aka CREST syndrome?  Or diffused? All I can do is send hugs! I am in the same situation. I hope it helps a little to know you are not alone.  \n\nLike you the results came while the doctors were testing for something else. I am primarily asyptomatic except for the Raynauds, chronic pain, inflammation, fatigue, and recurrent costocondritis.  I do not know what it means overall for me yet as far as prognosis. Sometimes early detection just seems frustrating. Thank you! I do not know yet, I did not get to see a doctor yet to discuss the test results, I have an appointment in April. Thank you! It helps to know that there are other people in my situation. Ugghhhh the waiting is awful. With having Raynauds tho its probably limited which is better as awful as that sounds. Here is a link for some sclerodoma info, news and stuff like that.\n\n\n\nAnd one with some others to peak at\n\n Thanks a lot for the links! No problem I have systemic scleroderma, and the most frustrating part for me is that there is no one pill that treats the illness itself. It is managing all these other stupid symptoms I get, individually. \n\nI did want to say that if you are having bowel/GI trouble, do not be afraid to see a GI doctor! I was embarrassed for years about having chronic diarrhea, but when I finally bit the bullet and saw someone, they gave me a med that stopped the diarrhea pretty quickly. I wish I had done it years ago. \n\nGood luck! Can I ask what are your other symptoms and if your condition is stable or gets worse with time? Thank you for sharing your experience and advice. I will definitely address the GI issues with my doctor and see if they want to refer me to a GI specialist. Sure! \n\nLike you, I have a lot of autoimmune issues. I have been hypermobile my entire life (with a number of dislocations in my younger days), and I started having GI problems when I was 15-16. Then it was gallbladder. Then it was a thyroid tumor that blew up overnight\u2014benign but had to be removed due to crushing a vocal cord. It is like my body just tries to kill itself constantly. \n\nI finally got in with a rheumatologist after testing with a high positive speckled ANA, and the testing he ran showed one lupus marker (positive antiphospholipid) and a high SCL-70. I am technically considered as Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, since we cannot definitively narrow it down to which disease might be causing the issues, but my symptoms mostly align with diffuse scleroderma. \n\nI mostly have internal issues (thyroid, gallbladder failing, lymphocytic colitis, Raynaud\u2019s), and some skin issues (rashy, psoriasis, sebderm, Telangiectasia). I have a high C-Reactive Protein test, so a ton of inflammation. \n\nI am 31 now, and I think my symptoms have been getting worse over the years BUT I was also not having treatment or management of any sort until a couple years ago when I got in with my rheumatologist. He started me on Plaquenil to treat the inflammation levels, and for the first time since I was a teenager, my CRP level was normal during my last bloodwork. It took about a year on the Plaquenil for that to happen. \n\nI am sorry for the novel, but I hope it helps! For me, it is always the not knowing that is the hardest part. Any time my skin or body does something weird, I am paranoid that I am having \u201cprogression.\u201d My rheum is great about reminding me that this is a spectrum disease and that as long as I keep up on the monitoring, it should be okay. It is also frustrating because, like I said, I cannot just see one doctor for it all. There is my endocrinologist for the thyroid, the GI specialist for the colitis, the rheum for the inflammation/joint pain. I am glad I see them all, but it is not cheap or fun! Thanks a lot for sharing your story! That sounds like a lot to deal with. I am glad to hear that ypur medication is helping you! I totally get what you mean by not knowing and being scared of progression... I am pretty much in the same position myself - positive SCL-70 test, symptoms include an inflated index finger on one occasion, aching fingers in the mornings, thickened skin on my finger joints, and raynauds.  I have had reflux for 15 years but only started getting the other Scleroderma symptoms over the past 3 years.  Still waiting to see a rheumatologist for a proper diagnosis, but if it looks like a duck, it is probably a duck!\n\nI swear mine is down to stress, every time new symptoms have appeared it is been a stressful point in my life, break-ups, stressful job, kids being born etc. etc.\n\nIt is been a scary few months but after speaking to the Sclero charity over here in the uk I feel a lot better about it.  Obviously it sucks, but from what I have read with life changes the symptoms can be manageable.  \n\nI have stopped drinking alcohol and coffee, started exercising daily and toned-down my job to cut the stress down.  It is early days but I have already seen my symptoms improve since making a few lifestyle changes.\n\nFrom reading a lot of articles it seemed stress is a major aggravator so time to be completely Zen for the rest of my life!\n\nHang on in there - I cannot speak from having a huge amount of experience but hopefully it helps knowing that someone else is going through the same thing! Thanks for sharing! It is crazy how much stress can affect us, while some other people are stressed all the time or go through traumatic life events without getting sick. There are probably some predispositions at play. Glad to hear that lifestyle changes made a difference, I have been making some big changes myself lately.

I truly love her, and I am just scared I guess", "New here, in the process of being diagnosed. Hello,\n\nI am new to this subreddit. I have been having major medical issues and I am in the process of trying to get this figured out. In 2018, I had blood work done that showed positive ANA and high levels of scleroderma on a RA blood work panel. I went to see a rheumatologist and he ran a more accurate panel that showed high levels of scleroderma but negative ANA. He then told me if my ANA was positive I would have scleroderma and to not worry about it as I do not have it.\n\nSince then, I have had more issues and have seen different doctors to try to figure out what was wrong. I saw an allergy asthma doctor who figured out I have reduced lung capacity and just assumed it was asthma without running any other tests. And recently I have been diagnosed with moderate primary pulminary hypertension. I also failed their walking test 30 seconds in and qualify for 24 hour oxygen. The cardiologist then ran more blood work which again showed positive ANA and high levels of scleroderma. My cardiologist was dismissive of this and does not want to consider that avenue.\n\nI am trying to find a rheumatologist, but none in my area seem to be able to see new patients so I am trying to find a doctor that will look at the labs and run other tests to see what is up and not just assume I am too young for all of this (I am 26). Do you guys have any recommendations on where to go? Or how to handle some of this until I can see someone.\n\nOther pertinent info: I have been diagnosed with hEDS, POTS (most likely hyper POTS), and presumed MCAS (still in testing). My hands have been swelling on and off for a couple of years and they react weird to cold. What test was it that showed \"high levels of scleroderma\" ? An antibody test? What specific antibody? A positive ANA only shows inflammation in the body, so it could be a number of different autoimmune issues.\n\nThere is a lot of good info on the scleroderma foundation website, as well as a resource to find scleroderma specialists \"near\" you (you may have to travel though--my closest one is 2.5 hrs away). Do not ask your doctor for a referral, get your medical records and fax them to the specialist yourself. My local rheumatologist did not take mine seriously and would not refer me anywhere, but he is never seen a scleroderma patient before and gave me incorrect info, so I lost all trust in him. I referred myself to the specialist, and after reviewing my medical records, they accepted me as a patient.\n\nTwenty-six is a little young for systemic scleroderma, but not that far off. I am in my early 30s. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat helped me the MOST was changing my diet and doing mobility training (e.g., yoga, strength-training). I took a food sensitivity test and cut out everything that came back on that, as well as cutting out nightshade vegetables. After all that, I am essentially vegan with a lot of weird restrictions that were difficult to adjust to initially, but now that I have been on this diet for awhile, my inflammation has dropped a lot, which has lead to a SIGNIFICANT drop in my symptoms (e.g., joint pain, hands swelling, GI symptoms). I also take daily turmeric and drink matcha daily for anti-inflammatory factors. I am not on any medications for my scleroderma yet, but I am also early stages without a lot of organ involvement beyond my GI and some mild lung involvement yet though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith how advanced you are, you probably need to go on some immunosuppressant medications through a rheumatologist. I also recommend that you get onto facebook and join the scleroderma groups there. I know most young people hate facebook (me too), but I rejoined after learning how active those groups are. There are thousands of people on those groups that give REALLY GOOD info.\n\nScleroderma is a really difficult diagnosis to deal with, and many doctors do not understand it or take it as seriously as it deserves because they have not seen it much. You have to advocate for yourself HARD. Become your own expert and push back when they are dismissive. It was blood work that cardio called a RA panel or profile. It looked at ANA, the line for scleroderma was called AB Scleroderma. The panel looked at different auto immune issues including lupus and Sjogrens.\n\nI have already had to modify my diet a lot for various recently developed allergies and have recently developed a sensitivity to nightshades.\n\nThanks for the advice. I am very frustrated with being unable to do anything while I wait for oxygen. I am tired all the time and so tired of arguing with doctors. I do not blame you for being tired of arguing with doctors. It is definitely the most frustrating part for me. Once I got into the scleroderma program, my local rheumatologist took it a little more seriously, especially when I started rattling off data and research to him that he clearly did not know. Now, he does not dick me around, but I definitely had to put effort into it and argue a lot to get there. I do not know that you will get far with a cardiologist-- you def need to get into a rheumy when you are able to. They will better understand what is going on, but that is not always a guarantee. \n\nAB Scleroderma-- is that just shorthand for antibody scleroderma? There are several specific antibodies linked to scleroderma (e.g., SCL-70, ACA/centromere, RNA polymerase III), and they can mean different things.  SCL-70 is the most common one associated with systemic scleroderma. ACA/centromere is the next most common and seen in limited systemic scleroderma. RNA-PIII is the least common and associated with diffuse systemic scleroderma with a higher risk for renal crisis (this is the one I have). I know I will not get far with this cardio. I asked for a referral to a rheumatologist from him because of this test and the cardio does not believe this test so I am on my own there. He even suspected scleroderma until the test came back and I am only \"borderline\" high in his opinion. This doctor also did not believe I was having any issues and did not look at the echo he ordered until I put my foot down and would not leave him alone until he did. Then he got really concerned and tried to say I was pregnant and that was causing it. He would not take \"no there is no way I am pregnant\" for an answer for a while and still seems really focused on that.\n\nThe AB I think means antibody? I will be googling for a scleroderma specialist and calling Monday to see about getting in. I have hEDS and scleroderma with anticentromere B antibodies.  I wonder if that is the AB antibody.  I also have an allergy to nightshades.  I am older, but I honestly think this is something I was born with.  At least the hEDS I know it is.  My hands swell but no tightening and have decreased lung capacity but not on oxygen. You probably want to go to a scleroderma clinic and not just a rheumatologist. Thanks for the reply. Some of my docs do not believe that someone can have EDS and scleroderma.  They seem mutually exclusive.  I only developed hEDS symptoms in my early 20s right about the time that I had the initial blood work that showed scleroderma.\n\nI will look for a scleroderma clinic. Do they tend to have age limits? I know John Hopkins has an age limit for their EDS clinic. False positives can be commonly seen with the antibodies--I would ask for a retest to confirm and see if your GP will refer you to a rheumy. I know I was tested twice for the antibodies because of the high false positive rate. \n\nAlso, once you find the scleroderma specialist, they will probably ask for your medical records before they will schedule you. That was my experience, anyway. Ok. I have had three different blood tests now that all showed elevated levels of scleroderma antibodies. I need to track down hard copies of all of these. I have pictures of the hard copies, but recently moved and I need to find them again. They do seem mutually exclusive and not coincidental, in the EDS subreddit there are a few ppl with connective tissue autoimmune disorders.  The clinics do not have age limits, I think if anything they want to see rarer cases like yours to learn more about scleroderma.  I went to the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma clinic and now go to the University of Pittsburgh Scleroderma clinic (closer to home) Well it is very likely that hEDS is misdiagnosed. Autoimmune diseases are a spectrum, at least in my belief. hEDS cannot possibly be supported from a genetics-only standpoint. Therefore, the environment is the \u201ccause\u201d of many hypermobility disorders. just like environments trigger autoimmune flares. Hi, sorry to hear your going through this.

Anyway, we are waiting for a follow up appointment with her GI specialist. In the meantime, my daughter showed me a patch of skin on her chest, in between and just below her breasts, that is large, discolored (yellowed/a little pink) and very leathery, hard and dry.

Also, though, I am fearful that the doctor is going to dismiss my concerns as being hysterical, like I was Dr Googling too much.

I have had scleroderma for about 4 years and I have had similar symptoms to your daughter, but I have no wish to armchair diagnose her. I would say a tip for your visit to the doctor would be to make a full and comprehensive list beforehand so you are better able to deliver your evidence dispassionately. I cannot imagine a decent physician ignoring you or dismissing your concerns when faced with the list I just read in your post. At the very least it deserves a referral to a dermatologist and/or rheumatologist. \n\nWish you all the luck in the world.

Only been about 5 days but I feel an incredible amount better. Hi there! My mom is a dietician who specializes in this stuff. I am experiencing the same issues right now, so here are her tips...\n\nCold food is less likely to upset your stomach. So you can buy some Boost weight gain shakes and put them in the freezer for a little while, then take tiny sips here and there. This is my go-to right now because they are fortified with a bunch of stuff.\n\nFiber can be difficult to digest, so limit raw fruits and veggies. Ginger also helps a little bit with nausea. I am lazy and just mix ginger powder into water.\n\nOther foods I can eat: VERY tiny pieces of plain white chicken breast, Skinny Pop sea salt popcorn, Oatmeal+peaunut butter (sounds weird but tastes like a granola bar), microwavable packets of oatmeal+tiny pieces of apple (cook the apple with the oatmeal), protein smoothie\n\nYou can also message your PCP and ask how you could talk to a dietician. A dietician could help you tailor an eating strategy that is likeliest to help you. They also might have discounts for those expensive Boost shakes.\n\nI hope this helps! I am right there with you.

Long story, but my grandmother (mom\u2019s side) passed away from complications of scleroderma a little over 5 years ago. She was 67. It was brutal. She declined rapidly in the span of 3 years with a double leg amputation and it is something that traumatized me.\n\nFast forward til now, I think I have developed Raynauds? I am 26 yo make. Cannot confirm yet as I am going to see rheumatologist in a few days. But my hands never change colors at the tips with blue or white. It is when my hands hear him they become very itchy and almost swollen to an extent? It is something that I cannot stop thinking about that my Grandmother\u2019s fate will be mine. I am sorry I meant when my hands heat up Well it does not really sound like scleroderma but it could be the early stages i suppose. But scleroderma is not hereditary. Autoimmune diseases are. Meaning you have a predisposition to getting an autoimmune disease but not specifically scleroderma Even if a grandparent had it? My mother does not have one, as far as I know Yes, its just a predisposition and since no one knows what triggers auto immune diseases its likely your mother just was genetically lucky to not get it or never got triggered to activate it. Hey! Ah that is stressful. Sorry to hear about your grandma. I have an autoimmune disease so I get it. I just wanted to pop in and say that the treatment for autoimmune conditions in general have improved significantly in the past 10 years, so your grandma's situation may not be a realistic comparison. By the time good medications became available, it is possible her condition had already progressed a lot. I know it is hard, but try not to stress. Sometimes I think the worst in terms of my condition, but then I say to myself, like you just do not know what is going to happen so there is no point worrying. E.g., my dad got sick with lung cancer at 58 after being healthy all his life and then passed away within 2 years - I never expected this to happen. Having an autoimmune condition in your 20's is not great of course, but there are people who still live long and quality lives with an autoimmune condition.   Wishing you all the best with your appointment! Thankyou! I am hoping that I come out of this ok. I am sorry for your Dad. That sudden loss is devastating. If you do not mind me asking, what autoimmune disease do you have? Came here to say the same thing - my mum has a different autoimmune disease but I ended up with scleroderma. Do not get too worried when you have just got vague symptoms but keep your doctor updated with your concerns and keep an eye out for the big telltale ones like GERD, Raynauds, chronic puffiness, changes to nail bed capillaries. If you want to be proactive you can make sure you are exercising, not smoking, minimising alcohol and processed foods, and minimising stress, so that if anything happens your body is in the best possible shape to deal with it. I completely understand why you are worried but try not to drive yourself crazy with what-ifs. Dear All, I am new here and entered for my mom. It is so sad to hear about your grandma and it is absolutely normal to fear.

It was not an easy ride, especially in the communist times (we are from Romania), but she is here alive and happy nagging my dad all the time. My mom\u2019s miracle treatment was the cortisone.

I thought maybe they are more myositis related but my creatine kinase is coming in very low normal instead. \n\nDid your specialist indicate the reason for the issues? I know they push the idea of poor posture, repetitive movements, and such. I am not sure I buy that with autoimmune though. The specialist I was talking about is a physiotherapist and due to regional rules they have to be very careful about making any diagnostic claims. She is extremely experienced and probably has an idea about what is going on, but she has to be very careful what and how she tells me things.

", "Cannabis Strains For Scleroderma ", "Scl-70 result alone Hi all,\n\nThank you for sharing your experiences on this subred, it is been very informative.  \n\nMy wife was just given a lab result that was a sick-70 of 1.8, which is considered a positive finding.  She is had vitiligo for a long time and we are just wondering if it is related.  She does not have any scleroderma symptoms.  Is 1.8 considered a very high indicator of a positive result?\n\nThanks for your help, Do you know what the titer was by chance? \n\nI know from personal experience you both are probably feeling stressed and freaked out by this because there is not a lot of information about it and receiving a positive result is scary, atleast it was for me. I tested positive without any symptoms like your wife and they did not diagnose because my only symptom was reynaud\u2019s. Ultimately what the positive test has resulted in for me is just being bounced around between (cardio,gastro, pulmonary, etc) to monitor for symptoms and I have found that a lot of doctors are ignorant or completely unaware of scleroderma. After getting fed up I went to a scleroderma specialist at MUSC and she told me very condescendingly that she did not care about the scl-70 result and that without observable symptoms they are not going to diagnose you with scleroderma. \n\nI have tested positive for scl-70 five times at around 1.1-1.3 and have not been diagnosed. In the three years since the only noticeable change is skin thickening on my wrists.\n\nI do not know if this really helpful or not I just wanted to try and answer how I could because I have an idea of what you guys are feeling right now. I have been testing positive for SCL-70 for 3 years and am not officially diagnosed either. 26F. I do have quite a number of fun symptoms though, mostly Raynauds and pain in all my joints. Main issue being my fingers, which are stiff and difficult to use. As far as I understand, a diagnosis will only come if they start to see other symptoms as well that specifically indicate scleroderma. Skin hardening I guess, or if something shows up in my lungs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think of it as being \"in the waiting room.\" I know I have a connective tissue disease (hence the joint issues) but it may not \"progress\" into anything further and I could remain in the waiting room forever.  Or I might graduate into one of the next rooms. Hopefully not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf your wife does not have any symptoms I would say that is excellent. Having SCL-70 does not necessarily mean she for sure has it. Her doctors will likely just want to keep an eye out, maybe a checkup every 6 months. Hopefully that helps - best of luck to you both! It is not a fun journey, but you are not alone in it. Thanks so much for responding, that sounds like you have been through quite the ordeal with testing and specialists.\n\nWith respect to the titer, are you referring to ANA? I appreciate this post because I am in this boat, positive, but same symptoms I have had for 5+ years (I am in my 30s), even younger as a teenager. Thank you for taking the time to write this out.", "Limited Scleroderma with sudden sever joint pain Hello everyone! This is my first post here and it may be long so bear with me. \n\nI was diagnosed some years ago (13?) with limited Scleroderma. I had one weird spot on my shin and that was it. Since that time I have had two kids (both times I had a weird condition called cholestasis) I have had a random non-aneurysmal brain bleed three years ago, and my gallbladder removed. \n\nDue to the brain bleed I was put on Topomax for headache relief. In the last month and a bit I have been getting seriously sore joints. It started in my knees and travelled to my ankles, then hope and shoulders and now my fingers are really swollen. I have been warning myself off of the Topomax because it was a likely trigger. However the more I think and read about it I believe I am having a Scleroderma flare up. \n\nMy Dr was not very helpful about the Topomax and the rheumatologist I would been seeing before did not need to see me anymore due to nothing happening with my spot for so long. Therefore I am kind of out here on my own trying to figure it out. \n\nI guess my question is: how common is it to have severe joint pain come out of nowhere when you have a mild case of limited Scleroderma? If this has happened to you did you figure out what triggered the pain to come on? \n\nI am really sick of hurting and just want to go back to \u201cnormal\u201d lol. Get a better doctor. Look up near you who specializes in auto immune diseases rheumatology and scleroderma and make an appointment as soon as possible. I dont want to scare or worry you. But limited scleroderma can turn into full blown scleroderma or other auto immune diseases. My hands and feet swoll up so bad i couldnt fit my feet in my sneakers. I didnt even realize till i looked back at photos my face was huge and swollen. I had shooting pains down my arms and it was hard to walk. I didnt know what was going on nor did any doctor i was seeing. I tried to ignore it which was a mistake. Scleroderma is ugly and can do irreversible damage that will drastically change your quality of life. My hands will never be normal again. The swelling was inflammation due to the disease attacking your joints. My hands got to the point they couldnt move. Ive had many surgeries on my hands already to make it look more normal and help some of the pain but my fingers will never get there mobility back. Im sorry to be blunt but Im trying to help you. Coming from a 22 year old girl who at 18 did not even know what scleroderma was. Everyones case is different and that does not happen to everyone my situation was bad im hearing similar symptoms and i want to tell you what i think you should do, the sooner they can put you on meds to stop the progression of the disease the better. Be strong you already are youve been through a lot already. Dont wait for answers to come go find them. Research anything and everything educate yourself even though theres little out there for us. Once i started to take cellcept my disease like paused it self. Didnt cure it but stopped the progression. I wish i couldve caught my disease quicker. Im wishing you the best. Shit is hard especially being young just wanting your life back. Some times are harder then others but it gets better. The pain gets better. Go find a doctor hun a good one some of them dont know shit. Write down all your symptoms and remember to say everything even little shit that you dont think matters. You got this! It sounds like you have been through the ringer!!\n\nI have an appointment, it just so happens, with my dermatologist on Thursday so I am going to get a referral back to the specialist at the hospital.

Best of luck! Thank you so much for your input! I really appreciate you taking the time to share No problem at all! I hope you are able to get some answers and treatment that will help you in the long run. I have the same type of scleroderma but I just want to let you know that it is called limited systemic scleroderma instead of CREST now because there are more symptoms then what crest spells out. And not all of us have the same symptoms. My first rheumatologist kept saying there is no way it is scleroderma because I do not have any skin issues. Well\u2026 not everyone with scleroderma has the classic skin issues. I found a better rheumatologist after 3 years of fighting and only getting more and more sick. So if you are not happy with this doctor def do not waste your time and go get a new one. Try googling limited systemic instead of crest. Also, there are a few Facebook support groups that are very active. That is so helpful to know and also definitely problematic that he does not even know the proper name. I will absolutely look into it that way, thank you! Mine is diffused Interstitial lung disease. With some heart problems. But I do not have skin problems at this time. We all have our crosses do not we. Best of luck hon. I am so sorry for your diagnoses, that is quite the cross. Thank you for your compassion and for sharing. I am actually really curious how you got diagnosed. Raynaud\u2019s and GERD are both -extremely- common in \u201cnormal\u201d people and the rest of that does not sound super specific to Scleroderma. \n\nDid the doc run any blood tests besides the WBC? Any skin symptoms at all? Did they do a nailfold capillaroscopy (magnifying glass to your fingernail beds)? So I absolutely get your scepticism, which is why I am asking. I know both symptoms are extremely common, but if you look at the ( only two symptoms are technically required for diagnosis. The doctor has run a lot of blood tests and they are generally normal. Iron, sodium, seg. Neutrophils, and wbc low, but everything else within range. No capillaroscopy. Skin symptoms are hard for me to say, the doctor did not point any out. So yeah, that is generally why I am here, because I am likewise doubtful of the diagnosis. Oh I am not a doctor or anything so do not mind me. But if everyone with GERD and Raynauds had Scleroderma\u2026.like 6% of everyone in the world would have Scleroderma haha.\n\nThose criteria are not current either. The current criteria is a point system, google \u201cEULAR Sclerosis Criteria\u201d. It does not include GERD at all, only Raynauds specific antibodies, skin thickening, nailfold, and ulcers. Hi. Limited Systemic Sclerosis here! \n\nRaynauds and GERD are very common, but Raynauds as precursor of Scleroderma appears 5 years before the Scleroderma diagnosis. Not everyone with Raynauds gets Scleroderma.  \n\nI had Raynauds for 4 years before the skin in my fingers started to get harder and shiny.  I never paid attention to the Raynauds because I blamed it on my new house which has a lot of marble and it is very cold. \nHowever, you need more than a Raynauds diagnosis to be sure that you have Scleroderma. I got the Anti-Nuclear Ab (ANA) \nAnti-Scl 70 Ab\nAnti-RNA Polymerase III Ab\nAnti-Centromere Ab\nAnti-Th/To Ab; Anti-U1 RNP Ab\nAnti-U3 RNP Ab\nand Anti-PM/Scl-100 Ab\n\nMy doctors are at UCLA. \n\nI also got a manometry test since Scleroderma affects the intestines and the eosophagus to check if I have Disphagia. \nThen I got a CT Scan of my lungs and they saw the scarring and then I got diagnosed with Limited Systemic Sclerosis. \nCREST does not cover all other symptoms and we do not always show the C R E S T symptoms at the  same time. \nHope you can get the right diagnosis and good luck.  \n\nHope you get all your questions answered. \n\nGood luck, love.", "Any guidance would be appreciated I do not really understand the vocabulary of all this yet but I had an ana of 1:80 speckled and a positive anti centromere b antibody of 4.8 AI whatever that means, it was supposed to be under 1.0 AI \n\nAnything I look up about the anti centromere b says scleroderma but that cannot be end game on that right?

You might want to consider a rheumatologist over a dermatologist. Maybe do some prep ahead of time and call a few rheumatologists ahead of time to see if they have experience with scleroderma first. It depends on if you have linear or systemic scleroderma. For systemic it is recommended to see a rheumatologist and for linear you can see either a dermatologist or rheumatologist. Testing for confirmation involves blood tests and physical examinations of the skin. \n\nNot all dermatologists and rheumatologists have experience treating Scleroderma since this is not exactly a common disease. Literally what I did to find my doctor was look up the state that I live in and \u201cLinear Scleroderma doctors\u201d. Thankfully I live in a state that one of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s are at and I have a good doctor that I see there. Major hospitals in the US states usually have doctors with experience treating Scleroderma as well. \n\nRegarding health insurance, I feel super bad for your situation. Even with insurance these doctors visits can get expensive. You might call ahead to the billing departments of whatever places you are going to see what the uninsured cost will be. Additionally, have you looked into any government covered insurance programs like Medicare? I obviously do not know what your income level looks like, but if it is something you qualify for, it can be extremely helpful with covering the costs of doctors visits. There is a list of scleroderma centers on the Scleroderma Foundation website. \n\n\n\nIt can be difficult to find a rheumatologist who knows much about scleroderma, and most will not admit that they do not.  If you have systemic scleroderma it is important to be under the care of a rheumatologist who understands your rare disease. \n\nYou can also look on the same website for support groups in your area. They are all virtual groups due to COVID but the patients in your area will be a good resource for finding a doctor. thank you all for your helpful comments! i was diagnosed in the 5th grade with scleroderma epidermitis on my hip and morphea on my face. it really hurt my confidence growing up especially since it did not seem like the dermatologist back then did not even know how to explain it and therefore affecting how i handle being asked about it. i am not even sure if this is what i have or if i have been misdiagnosed. either way i really appreciate all of the resources and i will look into finding a rheumatologist and possibly a dermatologist! Have you called the Obamacare hotline?   I think they can probably find someone who will take you on as far as health insurance, and they sometimes will subsidize it pretty heavily.

WhT lead to the test was issues breathing, blue lips, cold feet and hands and sore swollen hands. \n\nBack story: in 2009 she thought she had fibromyalgia. She went through the testing and they stated she had it. (We now think she was misdiagnosed)\nShe is very authentic and a former nationalist figure skater. She was going to the gym regularly until 4 weeks ago. Within the last few weeks, she had gone from extremely active to lethargic from the pain. She literally can only walk a few stairs without getting winded. Keep in mind that she is only 27 years old. She is 5\u2019 tall and exactly 100 lbs. so it is not like it is a weight issue\n\nQuestion; with her declining so rapidly, what are the expectations? What treatments should she be getting? Did she have SCL-70 all along? \n\nI am just scared and have zero answers. I do not even know what questions to ask. Her rheumatologist apt is not until next month. Today she called and they gave her an inhaler. \n\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. I have linear scleroderma. Mine is destructive physically and typically childhood. I know support and patience is important. If you are concerned she is frightened to death. First; thank you for your response!!! \n\nShe is a former Olympic figure skater. At a young age she had to train for 10 hours a day. She lost a lot of her youth doing it. Now she is devastated to think that her adult years could be cut short. \n\nWe are both scared because we do not have enough information. With this being in her lungs; she is terrified. \n\nI just wish we knew more\u2026. I am so sorry to hear about her condition. I found out I had lung involvement about a year ago (kind of on accident). They have put me on a rituximab infusion every 6 months because it is supposed to be great for the joint pain + lung issues. I am sure the protocol varies based on how progressed the disease is, but I am guessing she will have to go through several more tests and then start a heavy immunosuppressant. I hope she feels better soon. inflammation is exhausting.  there are lots of medications that can be used to stop her body from attacking itself. her good health and strength will definitely be an asset as she deals with this. i have scleroderma and have had lots of flares where i cannot make it from the couch to the kitchen and i can sleep 18 hours- then after they get some immune suppressing drugs in me i feel normal again with a week.  i am sorry she is going through this, the best treatment is to find a good rheumatologist who listens. do not let her accept living with the symptoms, find a clinician who cares about her quality of life. i hope she is feeling better soon- your a good guy for looking to see what the disease means- (my family took 10 years to learn how to say scleroderma /s) Thank you for your advice and kind words. It is helping a lot. I have read every response to her and she is thankful As usual, to start, progression and symptoms are different for everyone, but I have been in that place where she is when it comes to potentially having this disease with lung involvement. It is insanely frightening and there are a lot of people that told me I was overreacting. So I am going to say whatever she and you are feeling is ok and entirely valid. Cry about it, scream, freak out, you both do whatever you need to do to get through those moments when you start spiraling down those \"what-ifs\". Just do not stay there and let it take over you. I would highly recommend finding a therapist that has experience in dealing with chronic illness.\n\nNow, the good part... A lot of my lung deterioration is now well controlled on medication. Please take that with a grain of salt, because I am not a doctor and do not know your fianc\u00e9's lung or scleroderma situation, but just know there are most likely things that can help. I would say to be sure to write down symptoms so you do not forget anything you want to tell the rheumatologist.\n\nI personally like to know all the possibilities before going into new things, so knowing the following would have helped me avoid crying in front of several doctors had I known this info ahead of time... If a breakdown of potential tests she may go through seems like a bit too much at the moment, do not read the next part. I only write it from personal experience and understand if it is not what either you want to hear right now.\n\n&gt;!I had to do an echocardiogram, and a pulmonary function test. Both are painless. When my pulmonary function test came back as abnormal, I was then given a high resolution chest ct to look for inflammation and a lung perfusion scan (needs an iv, they inject and track a small amount of radioactive tracer through your lungs). Also, my doctors recommended a right heart catheterization to check the blood pressure in my heart for pulmonary hypertension (PH) because they could not see anything major on the echo. The catheterization was not to put in a stent or anything like that... It was just to check the blood pressure in my heart and be certain I did not have PH. Personally, this was the scariest thing to face with those early tests. It would not surprise me if she has to have these tests as well, but her doctor may have a different approach entirely, so do not bet on having to do them either.!&lt;\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if either of you need someone to talk to. I am more than happy to be a crying shoulder, a listening ear, or an encouraging cheer team. Again, do what you all need to do to stay calm about it - honor the bad feelings, but try not to stress too much. I am wishing the best for her at her upcoming appointment. I hope you both get answers and good news. Thank you so much for your transparency!!! This post really helps us both a lot. Everything we read sounds so bleak without much positivity. We are just at a loss for what to expect and what road is ahead of us. We do not even know the right questions to ask the rheumatologist. \n\nAgain; I cannot thank you enough!!! I have had Diffuse or Systemic Scleroderma for 4 years now. Had a Stem cell transplant 2 years ago. Went from being wheel chair bound and on death row, to being able to play with my kids. \n\nHere is my #1 advice to you. Get all stressers out of her life. Stress is the fuel of Scleroderma. All of them. Good and Bad stress. Aim for a flat line of emotions as much as possible. Ask all your questions. I have spoken in a conference before and can even refer you to specialists other people do not even know exist. If it is of specific medical nature questions I will refer you to the right people, no worries.\n\nGood luck and steady health. This is one of the best responses yet!!! Thank you so much. This gives me both direction and hope!!! We will definitely look into stem cells transplant too!! I looked at your post again. It does not sound like they have proper protocols. If she has lung involvement that is severe she needs an emergency hospitalization. Rapid onset Scleroderma can be deadly within a couple months. Get a second opinion. Do not take no for an answer! Very few doctors understand Scleroderma. It is like winning the lottery rare. Where do you live? If in Canada I can refer you to 3 hospitals in different provences. We are US based in the southwest. I keep reading that the lungs are one of the worse places to have this.  She literally went from no breathing issues, to manageable issues, to difficulties within the last 6 to 7 weeks. I just do not understand why we have to wait two more weeks to see the pulmonologist and then 4 weeks to see the rheumatologist. I am scared as we do not have her baseline or curve determined which means we do not have timelines. Dion. My name is Ben. Here is my advice. Go to war. Pick up the phone and call people until your ears bleed. John Hopkins Scleroderma Center. Call them. Move closer if you have too. Change jobs if it means making it easier. This is a life long battle. Get insurance and make sure they will cover you. Just in medication is 50k if you end up getting the transplant and 1 mil in other expenses. Probably another 10k a year after that. If this means anything, you got a grown man crying and praying for you. I know what is ahead. Lung involvement can prevent you from getting the stem cell transplant. 4 weeks can make the difference. Worse, the only solution is a full organ transplant if it gets really bad. If lungs are involved the heart usually is too. To say you have to fight for her life is not exaggerating. She cannot do it. Make her rest as much as possible. I mean full 100% rest. No stess, no physical exertion, breathing exercises might help. Wim Hof method does help, skip the cold part,  I did it hours a day at my worst. Make sure family knows they have to be 100% supportive or GTFO! I cannot be more specific on that point. If she was a former athlete, this will be devastating. You however are lucky. Not everyone has a chance to show how much they love someone. You will. Ben\u2026.you are an amazing person. I am a former marine and all I ever need to fight is to know the enemy and the cause in which to fight for. My 15 yr old son has never seen me cry and I cried about 20 times yesterday. She is literally my best friend and she completes me in every way. I would literally give my life for hers. So thank you for your openness, rawness, and honesty!!! You are what I need to get through this. Please stay in touch!!! Dion Did the transplant help? Who was the cell donor? Me and yes it did. I think the term is Autologous? They harvested my cells, then eradicated my immune system and after 9 days of injecting the cells back it was system reboot complete. Took 6 months total fyi. And can take up to 2 year to take full effect.\n\nMy only comparison was another male patient in the same age group with rapid onset diffuse Scleroderma. He chose not to get the treatment, he passed away 6 months after. I have recovered about 70% what I lost. Still have Scleroderma though and the best results is symptoms being dormant 10 years. \n\nI will say this important point. It is only to be considered in a life or death case.

And it is. A lot of people got diagnosed with this type as kids, and well, that is what bugs me, among other things. I am female, and well currently without hair so I am wondering did you use any of the typical medication for this bullshit of a disease? Thanks. :) 9 cm is 3.54 inches Yeah, when I was young I had to use a topical cream, I am not sure how effective it was or what it was called. Eventually by the time I was like 14, it stopped spreading. I saw a dermatologist for years and I believe it is probably best to see a specialist (once the planet gets back to normal, I guess).\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong: but is it possible you had linear scleroderma as a kid but did not notice until it was revealed by the alopecia? I know my scar matches my skin tone but will turn purple-ish sometimes when I am upset or winded. Well, that is a very good question actually.\n\nMy mom always told me that I had lumps on my head because I used to fall around and hit my head when I was little, but trust me, up until this point I never even thought that it could have been scleroderma. Wow. Well that is just a hypothesis, my specialty is counselling psychology not dermatology or autoimmune disorders.\n\nWas it typically itchy along that path growing up? Mine used to itch quite a bit while it was still active. I had atopic dermatitis since I was 3 months old, but never on my head. \n\nMy hands were the only thing that was ever itchy, and to this day it remains the same. Well, here is a question for your specialty: how did you learn to cope with all of this? Because having this, I also have MAAD &amp; PTSD so it is safe to say that I do not have as many shiny days as I would like. I will be honest, it took time. I was uncomfortable whenever people asked why one side of my face was fat and the other side skinny or asked if I had bruise. I decided to own it one day and just said \"Yeah, that is just my scar. =D\" Usually a good conversation starter, it is particularly rare as well so a lot of people find it interesting.\n\nI have had my own encounters with Depression, anxiety, and trauma as well so I know they do not make life easy. Of course, without knowing more about you I can only give general tips. First being, see a counselor--they can give you a different perspective and help you learn to live a life that you would like to live.\n\nWith quarantine we are stuck with telemental health options. Betterhelp.com has online counsellors and has low cost options if you cannot afford full price treatment. There is an app called \"pocketcoach\" which can give you some nice mental health tools.\n\nTaking care of your body can help manage depression and anxiety. Regular excercise, staying hydrated, getting adequate sleep, and even meditation can help significantly.\n\nPTSD is caused by past trauma and anxiety is future-based worry. It may help to be more mindful of the present and what you can do now. I also found it helpful to think of depression as a \"call to action,\" like there is something in my life I want to change or better cope with.\n\nSorry if this is generic advice. Is there anything else you would like to ask?  And reach out to others, humans are social creatures. Mental illness is difficult to face alone Hey, sorry for the delayed reply - I was off the net for a couple of days.\n\nAnyways, thank you for the advices. Some of them I have tried to apply already, but without success. But I have to tell you this - I have been to three diferent therapists in the past 2 years and none of them have told me this simple sentence that you provided: \"PTSD is caused by past trauma and anxiety is future-based worry.\" \n\nI have honestly never had something so complex explained in a simple sentence in my life. So thank you for that, very, very much!\n\nI believe each of us is our own best doctor, and without the will to help ourselves first, no expert on the planet could do much. I am glad that it was helpful for you. However, it is important to remember that therapists are people too and you may not vibe with their personality. I myself have seen over 8 different counsellors and provided counselling for others--so I am familiar with both sides of the couch.\n\nAdditionally, there are a lot of different styles of psychotherapy (think of it like martial arts styles). Your phrase \"I believe each of us is our own best doctor,\" fits with the client-centered approach via unconditional positive regard. The rationale being that if a person is given the right environment they will naturally pursue self-actualization.\n\nI am really enjoying our discussion, but it is strayed far from scleroderma.

I have had some weird issues over the last 2 years and my doctor said he believes I have a connective tissue disorder. In my research, I came across scleroderma and now I am panicking. What were your earliest signs of scleroderma that you did not realize were related until later? Here are some of the issues I have had recently:\n\n- Random rash appeared near right elbow. Perfect circles. Thought it was ringworm - punch biopsy diagnosed EAC (Erythema Annulare Centrifugum). Rash comes and goes; not consistently there. Does not itch.\n- Elbow, wrist, hand, finger and forearm pain on my right arm. Again - not constant. Thought it was my carpal tunnel, but feels worse. \n- Doctor seemed interested that I formed a keloid over my punch biopsy. \n- Left eye is sometimes dry / blurry vision\n- Shiny skin near cuticles, but someone pointed out here that it is normal \n- Hard dry skin on toe knuckles that looks like corns. They never fully go away. Never seen a doctor for it. I have had these for years and never found them to be an issue \n- Randomly fatigued, like absolutely wiped out \n\nAs far as labs go...\n- WBC was elevated 3 months ago, but now normal\n- ANA has been negative twice \n- Rhematoid Factor is low / normal \n- Positive Lyme ELISA twice, negative WB\n- Negative Lyme ELISA recently \n- CPR elevated - 20mg/L\n\nI guess I am looking for comfort and reassurance that it is not scleroderma, but I know nothing is guaranteed. I am overweight - PCOS - sleep apnea - pre-diabetic - insulin resistant. is your hand/wrist/arm pain worse when you wake up in the morning? that is how mine was at the start and it is an indication that it is autoimmune related because the immune system is more active during sleep. \n\nthe symptoms you list are not necessarily incompatible with scleroderma but there are a lot of different connective tissue disorders and there is nothing in that list that is a distinctive scleroderma hallmark. I think it is good to stay informed and look out for things like Raynauds, acid reflux/heartburn, visible capillaries in your cuticles, hard or tight skin etc, but do not jump to conclusions too quickly. when there are a lot of unknowns it is easy to jump to the worst case scenario but a lot of what you described could be explained by your existing chronic issues + a less serious autoimmune connective tissue disorder eg psoriatic arthritis, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, Sjogrens (the dry eye) etc. \n\nif you have not already the best thing to do is to go to a rheumatologist, go prepared with a list of all the symptoms and all the things you are concerned it could be and they will be able to answer better than anyone here what the odds of it being scleroderma are. even if you have to pay out of network its worth it to ease your mind and to get qualified answers to deal with it early if there is anything going on. regardless of anything else remember scleroderma is RARE, the chances of it being something less serious are much higher.\n\nsorry you are going through this on top of your existing issues, it is a lot to deal with and i hope you get answers soon. Thank you so much. I felt so bad posting here because I know everyone is truly dealing with this and I am just scared. I forgot to mention I do have GERD and IBS, which I have suffered with for years. The GERD is managed with Omeprazole. \n\nMy doctor did suggest I go to a rheumatologist, so that is my next step. I am not really in pain in the morning, but my joints feel a little stiff. even still, GERD is super common in the general population, I would not start freaking out just yet but definitely be proactive about seeing the rheum. it is OK to be scared and seek support, it is a big unknown and very distressing, and I kind of like responding to these posts because I was in the same place once and I wish I had talked to someone about it instead of freaking out alone Thanks so much!! I really appreciate it. i have had scleroderma that has progressed over the years. my first symptoms were inflammatory arthritis in my thumbs and big toes. that resolved and my hands and fingers began swelling and they never went back to normal ( my wedding ring fits only at the end of my pinkie now). i have had raynaulds since i was a teenager so there was that too. i agree with the reflux symptoms being an early sign. so far it sounds like you have dodged having any significant symptoms that point to connective tissue problems. good luck to you! Thanks for answering! I am really sorry about even freaking out here. I just get anxious. It was very triggering for my doctor to say he thinks I have a connective tissue disorder because that was not really on my radar! I knew weird things were happening, but was not sure what to make of it. I also have PCOS and I know hormones can cause all sorts of issues, so I am definitely going to a rheumatologist to rule things out.  not an important detail, just a comment. it is not that inflammation is worse at night ( cancer symptoms are) its that when you stop moving the chemicals caused by inflammation collect in an area and you feel the stiffness when you move in the morning. the same thing happens whenever you maintain a position without moving around- day or night are not the causative factors. oh interesting, thanks for that! It is a little upsetting having someone come to the scleroderma subreddit, list their symptoms which may or may not be scleroderma, saying they are looking for comfort from us who actually do have diagnosed scleroderma and have to live the hell that we do everyday and ask for reassurance that you do not have it. I mean would you go to someone suffering from cancer, ask if your symptoms are cancer and say omg I hope I do not have cancer like you do please comfort me because I am nervous I will end up like you. I mean yah, when anyone gets sick we all think that and get scared and want to be reassured we are okay but that is why we go to doctors for that stuff or a different subreddit. \nI know getting diagnosed and knowing you are sick with something and no one is listening is frustrating. A lot of us have had to go to many doctors over many years and told we were crazy or had depression or were fat and just needed to lose weight or getting older or anxious, etc when in the end we were actually really sick and in pain. If you are in the same boat I highly suggest to just keep looking for a doctor who will listen to you. See a rheumatologist or 6 until you find the right one. Have them do bloodwork and do not take no for an answer. You are absolutely right. I did not mean to offend or upset anyone.

When my doctor first told me what I was diagnosed with she did not tell me what the course of my illness would be like, likely because she did not know either.

The only symptom I had was soreness at the injection site. I have morphea and a bunch of other crap. I have had both my first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine. After the first dose I had just a little soreness in my arm where I got the injection and I was pretty tired the next two days. After the second dose, the arm pain was more intense. The night after the 2nd shot, I woke up in the middle of the night with my teeth chattering from the chills and was achy all over. The next day my arm was still sore but no more body aches or chills. My lymph node in my armpit of the arm where I got the injection swelled significantly and was very painful. It was about the size of a ping pong ball. It took a few days to go down. That being said, I would do it all over again. I do not regret getting the vaccine at all. My side effects were not even a quarter as bad as having the flu for one night. I am sure my immune system response to catching covid-19 would be significantly worse. Thank you! Thank you! I have UCTD with Raynauds, migraines, and interstitial cystitis.

The triangular shaped pens are comfortable also! I, too, have scleroderma and the compromised use of my hands that comes with the condition. I am unable to do many normal day-to-day things because of lost dexterity. But I really appreciate fine writing instruments and can write satisfactorily, though with some difficulty.

May I ask, what, if any, side effects have you experienced from it? Thank you I was also (supposedly) in the early stages of limited scheroderma. I was taking it and quite enjoyed it, but it was not strong enough and I had to be put on something stronger. Compared to the stronger stuff is was sunshine and rainbows and actually quite pleasant.\n\nIn the general scheme of things it is actually quite a weak DMARD, and as I understand is very common as the first one most people go on for a range of diagnosises.\n\nIt took 6 months of continuous use before it kicked in and actually started having an effect. I had no side effects while I was on it. As I understand the common side effects do not kick in until you have been on it for around 7 years. It is a first step medication with minimal side effects and relatively safe all round. I was on it for over 3 months with no discernible effects. Fairly mild in my experience but it is a long term drug and you need to be on it for at least 2 to 3 months to expect any results. Honestly not much. The biggest thing is you have to have your retinas checked regularly to ensure there is no degeneration as it is toxic. \n\nIt does not feel like it really does anything, until you go off it, then you realize it made your joints feel better. \n\nIf you are not experiencing joint pain, I do not think there is much of a benefit for you. \n\nMycophenolate is probably the best all around option.

Working out triggers a change in the location and concentration of blood.  This is achieved via the same process that causes \"inflammation\" (as ultimately, inflammation is simply a lot of blood moving to the area, which can be a pathological disease response but can also simply be a normal bodily process).\n\nWith many forms of illness that are characterized by excessive inflammation, you get TOO big of a change when environmental conditions (or your actions) call for a change in the location and concentration of blood.  \n\nHistamine, one of the MANY inflammatory markers that cause inflammation, is also a HUGELY important neurotransmitter.  Histamine literally triggers irritability, depression, anxiety, and a WHOLE host of other mental illness symptoms.

", "CREST and Infertility, Miscarriage, Pregnancy Hi everyone, I could use your experience. I am 35 and me and my hubby have been trying to have a baby. After trying for about a year, we moved on to IVF. After a bunch of testing, it was noted that I had a + ANA @ 1:160 titre with Centromere B. All other autoimmune tests were normal. I went to a rheumatologist and he said no worries, this is suggestive of CREST. I have no skin, breathing, or heart issues, but I do have occasional joint pains. In early July, I had a perfect Genetically normal embryo implanted and became pregnant. My fertility doc had me on baby aspirin, prednisone 10 mg, and Lovenox 30. All was going well until 6.1 weeks when I started bleeding. The ultrasound showed a normal pregnancy with a normal fetal heartbeat. No cause for the bleeding was noted. Two days later at 6.3, I went in for a routine check and the heartbeat was gone. I needed to induce a miscarriage. When I asked what happened, he said that because of my autoimmune, my body attacked the baby.  I am petrified this will happen again. My question is, does this CREST syndrome predispose to infertility, miscarriage, or to your body rejecting a pregnancy. Just wonder if you all have had problems like this and do you think This was just a fluke and it will not stand in my way of having children? Thanks so much for sharing. Talk to your doctor about APS or APLS -- it is a \"friend and family\" disorder So sorry for your loss \ud83d\ude1e. I agree with the suggestion about being tested for Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome because it can cause recurrent miscarriages. I have had 2 miscarriages and 1 stillbirth \ud83d\ude1e. This is the reason my OB/GYN suspected that I had autoimmune disorders in the first place. He diagnosed me with CREST prior to me officially diagnosed with Lupus, Scleroderma, and Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome. All of my pregnancy losses happened either in the 2nd trimester or third trimester (I was 35 weeks when I loss my first daughter). My husband and I did have a successful pregnancy and had our rainbow/miracle baby about a year after we loss our daughter with the help of a wonderful OB/GYN and Maternal-Fetal doctor from the University of Washington. My OB/GYN had me on baby aspirin, fish oil, heparin, and Procardia ER. He instructed me to eat foods that were high in calcium, proteins, and folate. He placed me on bed rest at 5 months. I had monthly visits with my OB/GYN and Maternal-Fetal doctor. My Maternal-Fetal doctor created a monitoring system using high resolution ultrasound machines to look at the valves in my heart and neck to monitor whether I was at risk of pre eclampsia/or forming clots. He also monitored my urine to determine if I was spilling too much protein into my urine. He was accurately able to predict when my pre eclampsia was going to start. My OB/GYN scheduled me to be induced right before the pre eclampsia started. So my son was born at 35 weeks and 3 days. He was a big preemie and weighed 6lbs 6ozs and was completely healthy. He did not require oxygen or any other medical assistance when he was born. I was luckily able to have him naturally. His Apgar scores were 9 and 10. He actually peed on me when shortly after being born lol. He quickly took to breastfeeding and did not have to stay in the hospital and we were discharged together. We had two miscarriages after my we had our son. One at 13 weeks and one at 15 weeks. I know my post is long, but I really wanted to give you a thorough answer because I wish someone had taken the time to answer my questions. I also wanted to give you some encouragement that you and your husband can go on to have a healthy baby after your loss. Good luck to you guys and I pray that you guys become parents soon! OK thanks for the advice. I think they tested me for that and it was negative. I am not sure if they did the whole APS panel though. I have also seen that APS should be rechecked every 6 months in cases like mine. Thank you ! I am so happy you did finally have success. \n\nThey tested me for a big number of all the other autoimmune disorders (SLE, RA, etc) and those were all negative.  My ANA was + @ 1:160 titre. The only thing that showed was Centromere B.  \n\nSo do patients with CREST typically have troubles getting pregnant or typically have miscarriage problems? According to the medical journals that I have researched regarding Scleroderma and Fertility, Scleroderma does not appear to negatively affect a woman's ability to get pregnant. In regards to Scleroderma and Pregnancy, however, it depends on the form of Scleroderma a woman has and whether she also has Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome. Systemic Scleroderma and Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome both increases the risks of miscarriages/stillbirths. Localized Scleroderma does not appear to increase the risks of miscarriages/stillbirths. Also, are you on/were you on medications to treat Scleroderma when you were pregnant? Methotrexate, ACE inhibitors, and Cyclophosphamide can cause problems during pregnancy. Both forms of Scleroderma can increase a woman's risks of giving birth prematurely and having low weight babies. I showed no antibodies on the APS tests -- it was signs based on full blood work plus symptoms (miscarriage post 6 weeks) ect No, I was not on anything specific except for baby aspirin, prednisone 10mg, and Lovenox 30mg. Supposedly the prednisone was to cover the + ANA and the Lovenox to cover any clotting issues they did not want to test for. Idk, I still wonder about the baby aspirin and the Lovenox and if that combo caused my loss with excessive bleeding. When I first started with my former fertility clinic they put me on plaquinil and also low dose naltrexone, but my rheumatologist said no you do not need that. Some immunologist I found on a sub said that Centromere B does not affect pregnancy or increase miscarriage risk at all. It is just been so hard to find anyone who knows anything about this. I did have a cardiac echo and a pulmonary function test on advice from the rheumatologist I saw and they both came out completely normal. I think the key to having a successful pregnancy when you have a chronic illness is having a good medical team. All of my pregnancy losses happened in Florida, and doctors there are not the most educated or up to date about autoimmune disorders, blood disorders, or pre eclampsia (which they still call Toxemia). I know that medical neglect was a big part of why I loss my pregnancies because with my first loss (the stillbirth), the doctors did not start treating my preeclampsia until after my loss. During my 6 week follow up, the OB actual asked me where my daughter was. I was sitting there bawling my eyes out and he asked me where my dead daughter was smh. When I replied that she died, he said oh yeah that is right, so how are you doing? Smh. I was devastated! My second loss happened when I was visiting Florida. I am lucky to be alive because I bleed so bad during that loss and they did not think that I needed a blood transfusion. That loss was scary because the blood clot were huge and I lost so much blood. The ER doc on the maternity ward said, these things happen sometimes. You can try again smh. My son was born in WA State and he was born in between my 1st and 2nd losses. My OB/GYN was an excellent doctor. I actually referred my foster daughter to him when she was pregnant. Use Healthgrades to find yourself a good OB/GYN in your area. I trust reviews from actual patients above anything else. Teaching hospitals usually have really good doctors and specialists. Again, the key is finding a good medical team in order to have a successful pregnancy. Btw- Have you had genetic testing? It may provide you with more thorough answers to some of your questions that your doctors have not seemed to be able to answer. I got my Health DNA test done via 23andMe and my results cleared up a lot of questions I had and it also shed light on medications that are problematic for me. Plaquenil is one, so is Baby Aspirin. You may want to consider having it done and making sure your doctors have a copy for your charts. It took me 38 years to find out that I have genetic blood disorders and gene mutations that can interfer with fertility and cause recurrent spontaneous abortions. You have been through so much!!!\nI did consult with another RE and the plan is to repeat a APS panel, check karyotyping, check for endometriosis (BCL6), check for sperm DNA fragmentation, and double check for polyps and septum. I might do another retrieval too, but I do not want to even try another FET until I get more information. Very sorry for your loss!!! I am 36 and currently 36 weeks pregnant. I have had systemic sclerosis/ scleroderma for many years. The illness has been progressing but very slowly. I have been taking mainly only Nifedipine for Raynaud\u2019s and anti-reflux medication for my esophagus issues. I get hardened skin on some parts of the body and develop digital ulcers in winter. I have also developed autoimmune graves thyroid disease at some point a few years ago. It took us about 2,5 years of active trying to conceive, and the pregnancy is considered high-risk. I would be curious to know if in this period of 2,5 years I had gotten pregnant more than once but had very early miscarriages or failed implantations \u2014 I will never know.. Throughout my pregnancy I have had more frequent ultrasounds due to the doctors wanting to monitor the sizes of both placenta and baby\u2019s thyroid. So far the baby is looking healthy and the pregnancy has been relatively normal \u2014 it is possible and statistically doable for women with CREST to get pregnant and carry until full term. I hope you will be able to try again and I hope it works out this time! \nP.S. I expect all my symptoms to go worse postpartum, as it is common for autoimmune illnesses to flair up after birth due to the hormonal transformations the body has to go through. Thank you and Congratulations! I am 35 and this was my first pregnancy ever. With this clinic I was at they really focused on the autoimmune aspect of things. I really only have very mild symptoms of joint pain and fatigue, but I have Centromeres and + ANA so they really focused on that. I kept hearing them say your body will reject the embryo. So I did the baby aspirin, prednisone, lovenox like they wanted. My rheumatologist said it was not necessary. I felt like I was between a rock and a hard place. I really do not understand because from what I read people with CREST, and any of the scleroderma variants, do not seem to have an increased risk of infertility or miscarriage compared to people who do not. Everything was going great and then blindside. They told me the placenta detached and the bleeding from the blood thinners uprooted the embryo. The emotional toll this has taken on me is not good and the financial and physical toll has also been difficult. I just do not know what to do? Do I do another immune protocol because my body really did reject my embryo, or just do what everyone else does with routine IVF ? There does not seem to be much agreement in this area of autoimmune IVF treatments. Prednisone is a class D drug and can cause harm to a fetus. Aspirin and Lovenox can increase bleeding and subchorionic hemorrhage, which I had. It kind of seems like I am a guinea pig and try this and try that maybe something will work. So frustrating.

", "Wyatt the Warrior: 9-year-old boy will not let Scleroderma slow him down ", "Early Signs? Hello everyone. I am reaching out because scleroderma runs in the women in my family. My great grandmother had it last and I know that it skips generations for us, so as I approach 30 I am on the lookout for signs and symptoms.\n\nI have always had inflammatory issues, particularly in my joints (knees and wrists). My extremities get cold very easily. I have also recently noticed a small, oval patch of hard, flaky skin on  side just above my hip that I cannot explain with anything I wear, so I am keeping an eye on that. Of course, all of these things could be symptoms or they could be completely unrelated. Knowing my genetic history, however, I am just being extra vigilant.\n\nWhat advice would you give to someone who may be looking at a scleroderma diagnosis in the future? What can I do now with my lifestyle to possibly prevent the severity of the disease or further put off its onset? Thank you! Raynauds is typically the first symptom. But I wouldnt say scleroderma is genetics or skips generations, scientists and doctors dont even know what causes it, much less how it is inherited, if any pattern. I also do not have major symptoms yet, so I cannot speak to that. However, I have been doing a ton of reading about nutrition, and it seems like diet can reverse autoimmune disorders for some people, so maybe it can also prevent or slow the progression? The autoimmune protocol and plant based diets both seem to work for people (look up Forks over Knives to learn more about plant based). Eating lots of anti inflammatory foods might help, and intermittent fasting has been shown to reduce autoimmune symptoms as well. I do not know for sure if these things can prevent disease, but they do seem to reduce symptoms for those who are sick. Thank you! From the research I am doing, scientists definitely do not know if it is genetic or not for sure. However, because they have learned that members of the Choctaw nation develop scleroderma at a higher rate than other groups, they suspect that some component of scleroderma may be genetic. With that in mind, I am making sure I learn as much as I can about it. Thank you! I could definitely begin following some anti-inflammatory lifestyle changes. Even if I do not have scleroderma, it could only benefit my health. (One of my cousins that descended from my great grandmother also has it, so that is another reason I suspect it may be genetic, at least in my family.) Cold extremities does not come even close to describing  raynaud\u2019s. Until you have a much clearer indication that you have an auto immune issue, you should forget about it and get on with your life. Everyone has aching joints now and then. Many many people get cold extremities and have no underlying issues. Flaky skin on occasion is normal. You are patching together some tiny threads of nothing, and trying to turn them into something they just are not. You will know when there is something to worry about. From what you have described, that time is not now. Hi, I do not think any of this means I have scleroderma. Again, I am basing this on my genetic history. I have no idea whether the symptoms occur gradually or slam on at full severity all at once, which is the only reason I mentioned any of that. I am not making any claim that I am currently suffering from scleroderma; I know that scleroderma is usually (always?) a debilitating chronic illness, not a few aches and pains and some dry skin.\n\nNot sure why you had to take a tone that made me sound like a hypochondriac when I am seeking advice on preventative measures, but I hope it made you feel better. It did not make me feel better. I was trying to make you feel better. It is hard to convey tone in just written words. My intention was to be reassuring, but in clear terms that came off as something other than reassuring.

The signs come on slow. A slight discoloration that looks like a bruise that  does not heal, maybe. Or an indent in the skin. Then puffy fingers is very common in early stages. Sometimes fingers &amp; wrists hurt. Cannot open twist tops, etc. Blood tests can show clearly if you have Scleroderma or a biopsy of a morphea plaque. Sometimes acid reflux is then common. Everyone is different. You should try to see a Rheumatologist that is affiliated with a college as they know more than an average Rheumatologist or Dermatologist. My sister has SLE and they say most ppl with Scleroderma have family members with autoimmune diseases. I was diagnosed 2 months after a Hypothyroid diagnosis,  which is also an autoimmune disease. Then 1 year later was diagnosed with Linchen Sclerosis,  yet another autoimmune disease.\n\nI have cleaned up my diet, meaning no sugar or processed food. No alcohol. Limit carbs &amp; add lots of omega 3 and plant protein.  Still, the disease is progressing. I now have Raynauds (which it sounds like you may also) and GERD.

Until I saw a dr and got manageable meds regimen I used O'keefes working hands hand cream and it worked really well. I suggest taking a baby aspirin a day though I would ask a doctor before you do. Also ask your rhuemotogist about taking Fluoxetine, Mycophenolate and plaquenil. I am guessing you have Raynauds (numbness, discoloration of digits) the collagen that builds up during a Raynauds flare up cuts off blood supply bla bla bla causing the fissures, the medication I recommend combats that. Also if you smoke cigarettes quit immediately. I know easier said than done but it is a HUGE trigger for Raynauds. I did all of this about 4yrs ago, have not had a fissure since and mine were really bad. Even ended up losing a finger tip. I take viagra for them and wrap them with knuckle band aids (I cross cross the tips so they stay on longer than regular band aids) avoid anything that might wear down your finger pads and antibiotics helps a lot because mine always get infected. Just curious it IS a low dose of Viagra right?  Are you taking mast cell stabilizers in addition to antihistamines? I do not know what those are. I am currently taking Amlodipine, Mycophenolate mofetil, Leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and just recently got off prednisone. All this is to manage the Reynaud\u2019s, swelling and inflammation. plus I take cetirizine, hydroxizine, and gabapentin for itch. Lastly, I take B2, magnesium, iron, and B12. It makes for a lot of pills every day. I am on mycophenolate, amlodipine, leflunomide, and hydroxychloroquine. I just got off prenisone. Yes, I have Raynaud's.

Unfortunately, there are no scleroderma centers near me. but I will be looking for a scleroderma specific rheumatologist. Terrible headaches from Amlodipine and my fissures were getting worse and worse. Yea I live in the mtns of North eastern Pennsylvania, zero sclerodoma clinics here lol. Some quick research found me a rhuemotogist that knows auto immune disorders really well. I was going to the Jefferson university clinic in Philadelphia but did not work out. Terrible table side manner. More like a assembly line to me. Only good thing there was the whole team of docs right in office. Instead of what I do now, travel from doc to doc. Pulmonologist, Rhuemotogist, cardiologist etc etc lol... Anyways sorry, Colchicine is mainly for gout but has shown to help reynaouds and it works really well. I would definitely ask about it I will ask about it. I am under care of the VA, and while the care I receive from them is 99% awesome, the rheumatology section is kind of lacking. Glad you were able to get a good doc! Oh wow you are in a better VA than I was!!! They were awful to me and acted like I was lying about feeling off. GOOD LUCK !!! Thanks! Yeah, the VA here really benefitted from the overhaul a few years ago.  Like I said before, all of the other clinics are awesome, just feel like I got the wrong doc with Rheumatology.  \n\nDid you talk to anyone about your care at the VA? The folks here typically bend over backward to solve any issues.\n\nAlso, what branch (if you do not mind my asking)? thanks for the advice.  I will look into that.  Do you have a source for the knuckle bandaids? They only come 5 to a box or so.  I like using the tiny little Nexcare ones, but there are only 5 or 6 of those in a box, too . I buy a hundred pack from amazon for 10 dollars No way! What a great idea! Thank you! No problem. I use a product called PRID (round orange tin and available on Amazon or Walgreens from $5-$10) on my fingertips when they starts getting tender. And even after a finger ulcer develops. It helps prevent the ulcers, and when one develops, it keeps the ulcer under control so I do not lose any more tissue on my fingertips. It also helps to pull the calcium deposit out cleanly, if that is what is causing the ulcer. Thank you for your response. I am in the early days of my scleroderma, and thankfully have not experienced the ulcers or calcinosis.  I will try this PRID. Thank you again!", "Strongly suspect CREST but not sure if it is worth it to try to get a diagnosis Hi all, first of all I know it is now called \"Limited Cutaneous Systemic Scleroderma\" and not CREST, but I will be using the term CREST just because it is so much easier to type :)\n\nAnyway, I have currently a hEDS diagnosis with strong indications of MCAS/POTS, but someone recently asked me if I had CREST, and after looking it up, it does seem very likely that I have that as well.  I do not have varicose veins, but I do have all the other symptoms.\n\nMy question is this: when I say \"I do have all the other symptoms,\" what I actually mean is \"I definitely have some of the symptoms and I used to have the other ones before I started treating for MCAS.\"\n\nDoes it make sense that some of the symptoms of CREST would improve upon massive doses of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers?\n\nAnd my main question is: assuming I \\*do\\* have CREST (just play along for a second,) does the fact that I have been able to treat many of the symptoms as a result of treating MCAS mean that if I did the pertinent labs, my results might be inaccurate?  In other words, will massive doses of antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers change the result of the test for whatever antibodies they use to diagnose CREST?\n\nI already have another condition that I am told I have to go off antihistamines for 72 hours before I can do the test that is used to diagnose for sure (SCDS), and if I go more than 5 hours without taking antihistamines, I will go into anaphylaxis, so that is not possible. I have no idea what the answer to your question is. But I also have had symptoms of diffuse systemic sclerosis: Raynaud's, reflux, general cold intolerance. I have positive ANA and tested positive falsely for scl-70 (the Mayo clinic test uses an inferior method and consistently is high positive for me, while more accurate tests are consistently negative.) And I have MCAS, and the treatment for MCAS has cleared up the majority of those symptoms. So... I do not know if that helps or just adds to the confusion. I am in a similar boat of not knowing if I have an autoimmune connective tissue disease, but I try not to worry about it because the meds and diet I am on give me a virtually normal life.

He said as long as they are not active and have faded etc it is totally fine to do so, my NHS dermatologist also said the same but refused to write a note as it is for cosmetic reasons (which infuriated me beyond belief as she did not take into account the mental health aspect of wanting to feel comfortable in my own skin), so that is why I paid \u00a3150 for a note to show to tattooists.\n\nSome of my tattoos are now close to a year old and I have not had any new marks.\n\nDefinitely go for it! Look around for a decent artist, and someone you feel comfortable with - if you are like me, you will be spending a lot of time with them. My only regret is not doing this sooner. Thank you so much! Has the healing been ok? If you look at my post history, check out the raven on my stomach. I have only had issue with healing once and that was not over my morphea patches. I believe it is because I had 20 hours done in a month, did not take time off of work, and my body was struggling to heal what is essentially an open wound. After that, we tattooed over the few patches where the ink did not take (it stayed wet for a while and when it did scab they were very thick), and used second skin during the first 4 days of healing - had absolutely no issues since (I now also book the following day or two off of work to rest)\n\nI still have a few hours to go before the raven is finished, I was supposed to do it last Thursday after having linework on my back, but I could not deal with more pain lol. I will post a link with how it is looking in a sec  Your tattoos are so cool! I have often wondered about covering my scars up so it is really awesome to see your pictures and progress. \n\nMy morphea covers one of my legs from the hip to my ankle and kind of twists round from the front to the back. Even though its not active anymore, a lot of it is yellow or purple still and I feel like it is the first thing people see. It also changed the shape of that leg so that is fun. But, no hair grows where the morphea is so I totally save a lot of time shaving. Hey, thank you so much - I really love them and how they have changed my quality of life, it is therapeutic to be able to take a shower and not feel sad looking at my naked body. It is strange that I ever felt that way, because I would never look at someone else with morphea and feel grossed out etc, how I always expected someone to view me. \n\nI have heard about  a type of morphea effecting limbs - that really sucks, I am sorry that is something else you have to deal with as a result of this disease. Feel free to message if you ever need someone to speak to! \n\nyou can totally get an incredible piece of art, and take comfort in knowing that is why their eyes have been drawn to your leg. Even without the tattoo and with the morphea, only an ugly person would ever find reason to judge something like that.\n\nIf financially you are able to, get messaging some local artists and find someone you vibe with! Think of some ideas. I gave my artist some vague ideas and let her take full creative reigns.  Only my rat has significant meaning behind the design and is basically what I asked for. God, yes. I have a giant patch on my torso that started out the size of a half-dollar about 10 years ago. I hate not being covered up. I typed that before reading the whole thing! I wish I was brave enough for tattoos, but alas... Hey! You can do this, it is mind over matter. The numbing cream I used was incredible - an area over my hip made me almost cry out in agony, but with the numbing cream it was painless. Healing on the other hand was quite painful due to the location, however, I stand by my point that that pain was worth it. The emotional trauma of feeling unhappy with my body to the point I had quite disturbing intrusive thoughts at one point was far worse than a a week of feeling sore. In a strange way I found the pain somewhat liberating, I knew I would soon feel more free. Wow! so glad I came across this post! I too was diagnoised around 14 now 28 and it has spread like wildfire across my body. I was having such bad joint pain the only solution was Methotrexate and after some bad side effects I opted to get off of the medication. It took me a long time to come to terms with the discoloration. I too want some tattoo cover ups just have not got around to it. I used to hate the way my skin looked now while I do not love it I tolerate it. I will never love it but its there and I cannot chage it so why let it bring me down? Hey, sorry I have taken a while to respond to this.\n\nIf you ever want to message to vent about this shittt disease, please feel free! It honestly sucks, but since speaking to other people with morphea and getting some of them tattooed over, I feel more at peace with my body. \n\nI spoke to someone who was taking Methotrexate and it also made them feel ill with bad side effects. \n\nFind a decent artist when you do! I found that a few were not comfortable working on me because of my condition.. I  ended up  getting a doctors note from a private dermatologist saying it is safe.\n\nI am glad you are able to tolerate how you look now, rather than hating. I never thought my mindset towards my body would shift, but even the areas I am yet to cover with tattoos, I feel less sad looking at them and not so awkward speaking about it. When I was a teenager I thought I was just dirty because of the dry weird skin I had.  My parents would not' buy lotion so I had to put conditioner and cooking oil on them and I just felt like such a poor gross girl.  But then I started going to the YMCA and the locker rooms.... we are all pretty different and wild looking!  I am so much happier now that I like myself.  I didnt' change how I looked just my attitude and I am thankful for old naked ladies paving the way!\n\nThanks for the reminder that I am OK! That is so sad.. how long did it take you to see a dermatologist!? I did not the whole time I had active skin morphea. I was diagnosed with \"Lupus\" when I was 10 but when I was 12 my parents were convinced I would had a faith healing so I did not go to the doctor other than a GP during my teenage years.  Once I turned 18 I got a new doctor and told them my symptoms and was diagnosed with \"Lupus\" again.  It was not until 28 years later that we figured out it was scleroderma.  Thankfully the morphea has been extremely limited except when I was a teenager! I will get other skin issues but mostly I get poofy and painful skin. Supposedly the poofy part is what comes right before the skin hardening but i swear I am just getting regular old lady wrinkles haha.  \n\nI have kids and I see their struggling with self love sometimes so it feels really good to be able to support them and encourage and try to lift them up and sometimes I am smart enough to extend the same kindness to myself:). I feel like a dick that I did not reply to this! I thought I had. So what are your morphea lesions like compared to mine? You can see in my earlier tattoos where I do not have full colour! Still feel so bad you had to wait until you were 28 for an answer.\n\nI am really glad your kids have you as a mother, they are lucky to have your support, especially as that is something you never had growing up. You sound like an awesome mum. Also, small world we have stumbled across eachother again on reddit! I only have morphia and I am almost completely cover on my back and chest. I have tattoos on areas that do not have scares. I got a tattoo on my back years ago before my back was cover and there are no scars on or surrounding the tattoo. I hope to go in for a patch test on my scars to see how my skin will react. I definitely have body dysmorphia and I feel that adding tattoos is a way for me to take back my body. 1000% this. I feel so much happier with my body now that I have started covering them, and far less embarrassed speaking about my remaining scars that are yet to be covered. Get a test patch done ASAP! I did find my scars were more painful to tattoo over, but tktx numbing cream helped a lot.\n\nIf you ever want to vent, feel free to message!", "OTC Itchy Skin Solutions *Cross-posted* Hi all, I am diagnosed with UCTD (scleroderma is the top suspicion) but have been experiencing itchy skin all over my body starting in the evenings and throughout the night. I am currently coating my body in Gold Bond Ultimate Healing in the evening but wondering if there are other OTC options that I could try. My skin is a bit more dry since moving to a drier climate for college but the itchy skin is not more dry or flaky than anywhere else. Benadryl does not help with the itchiness and makes me drowsy. The lotion helps a bit, but looking for anything else to help. TIA! Its a prescribed med but Hydroxyzine works for itchiness. My husband has scleroderma &amp; this med has helped a lot. If your itchy skin is from bacterial infection (redness and itching like in eczema), you could try hypochlorus acid spray.  See this ( about it.  Make sure it is for skin care and not general sanitization \u2014 the sanitization mixes also have bleach in them. Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize! Stay away from lotions and oil with fragrance. I love Aquaphor but you could also use vaseline. This will mostly sit on the skin. So put it on after showering and/or before bed. Oil is really hydrating but harder to find without fragrance. Hope this helps. Sarna helps with me sometimes when I get intense itchiness. It does not always work but works most of the time for me", "Scleroderma Foundation increases research funding by 100% ", "9-year-old girl from Muscatine is battling three rare diseases ", "UTHealth's Shervin Assassi leads national Scleroderma study ", "Jaw tightening advice My jaw has tightened in my masseter muscle and I now only have an opening of 19mm. It is becoming painful and as you can imagine very inconvenient. \nMy specialist has mentioned using Botox to try to help relax the muscle. Has anyone had experience with this issue and how have you dealt with it? Thanks I know most scleroderma patients have jaw and lip problems. Have you heard of any effective treatments?", "Has anyone else gotten survivors guilt? Ok I have been doing research on this illness and I have found that I survived longer than most people with this disease and I am male (apparently we do better than females with the disease.) These two factors have given me survivors guilt. Has this happened to anyone else? Also male, so we are significantly more rare than females.\n\nWhat I have found is the opposite actually. That males tend to do worse. At least for Systemic Sclerosis.\n\nThat being said, like I mentioned in the other thread, modern treatments are far more effective than they used to be. You will see far fewer cases like the movie \"For Hope\". It is certainly not a cakewalk, but the disease can be controlled to a certain extent.\n\nAs for survivor's guilt, I would not say so. Perhaps it is cause I have a touch of ASPD, but at the same token, I think that I cannot control other people's outcomes anymore than they can control mine. The whole males thing is from my reading up on this. My new Dr says that since males are so few it just looks that way in the academic literature. Male 41 here. I was diagnosed in 2008. My labs have always remain the same. Within the past 13 years, my symptoms have remain the same. Very mild finger pain and heartburn that I can control and not have for days, even longer. I tested Positive ANA and Scl-70 2.3 in the multiplex. Unsure if it is a false positive since that is what I have been reading. O.k. I am 48(M) and was misdiagnosed with Buerger's in 2003 and was properly diagnosed with scleroderma, anti phospholipid antibody syndrome and a host of other disease/complication in 2007 after nearly dying from a pulmonary embolism in 2006. I was given a likely prognosis of 18 months in 2008, have endured tens of dozens of hospitalizations, 'near misses' (along with one coma), multiple strokes, lung, stomach and heart issues, have had j-peg/g-peg tubes, colostomy bag, dual lumen Hickman catheter/central line, pain packs etc., was put on TPN for 8 years(12 hr/day) and did not eat for that amount of time. \n\nI am doing OK, considering, but by no means have a normal life or ability and endure regular visits to specialists(I have 6 right now, plus GP) with no means to work. I struggle to get proper pain medication given the current climate regarding such despite being in palliative care and I am alive, but it is not exactly romantic. I live in daily pain which is oftentimes excruciating and I would not wish my life on anyone.\n\n Survivor's guilt? ....................... Similar feelings...\n\nI am f(40) with ssc dx'd 17 years ago and 4 years ago dx'd with pah. Pah is pretty grime prognosis and i was not expecting to still be around.

I am new to this disease and I say live your life and enjoy.", "Raynaud's + persistent light reflux - should I be worried? Hello! \n\nI have just spoken to my GP this morning who has agreed that my winter hand/finger symptoms are indicative of Raynaud's - at first I thought \"oh well, seems like an annoying but harmless thing, I can probably deal with that, not much I can do\", but then a Scleroderma/Raynaud's charity site mentioned I should be on the lookout for reflux. **And I have been having reflux/upper GI symptoms essentially since the lockdown started!** It is nothing dramatic, I keep a journal and I see that it calmed down lately, but I would still say I have some light symptoms daily and more severe ones couple times a month. And before 2020 I never really had any issues with my upper GI (might just be the magic of turning 30)  \n\n**Should I be worried? Or is it a good sign that the two do not really overlap? (My Raynaud's has been very much a winter thing, while my reflux has been the worst in the summer).** \n\nEek. I know it is not healthy to think about it too much, but I hope you can relate! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance! So, I am not a doctor. No one here can give you medical advice. What I can tell you is what my doctors have told me and what I have found in researching medical journals. \n\nIf you have only these 2 symptoms, it could be literally hundreds if not thousands of things, assuming that they are connected. It is not scleroderma with only GI and raynaud's-- there is a host of other symptoms they look for to even qualify for a baseline diagnosis. Raynaud's is a common enough phenomenon on its own and is seen in a ton of different autoimmune disorders. Then, GI symptoms are a VERY common response to stress, and the entire world has been under substantial stress since 2020. It may have nothing to do with being over 30 or your immune system. So those 2 together are not enough to suggest scleroderma.\n\nWhat can give you better information and reassurance is to go back to your GP and ask for a general antibody test that includes the scleroderma antibodies. I had to take mine 3 times with 2 different labs and 2 different doctors to confirm it because there is a pretty notable false positive rate for some of the antibodies. If you have scleroderma antibodies, then that means you should look out for other signs/symptoms developing. Some people have antibodies show up but never develop scleroderma. So, it is not perfect, but you will at least have more information on it. Thank you! This gives me some much needed insight. \n\nI am definitely going to take notes of how things progress with both my hands and my GI (I have been doing this since December actually!)  and hope that my GP does not fight me on getting blood tests as well - it is been really hard in the past year to see any doctor really, which only leads to more anxiety and more anxiety related symptoms. GERD is pretty common (estimates are at 20% of adults have it), it might be totally unrelated. It might benefit you to keep a food diary and see if certain things cause more symptoms and thus can be avoided. Also GERD is correlated with increased weight. If this has been since lockdown, have you put on weight? This might be making this worse and is something within your control to help with the symptoms. Lastly you can try using TUMS or other antacids prior to mealtimes to alleviate symptoms. It is important to remember that while the vast majority of people with Scleroderma have Raynauds, the vast majority of people with Raynauds do not have Scleroderma. \n\nI would keep an eye on things and you could see a rheumatologist who could run some blood work, but I would not be too anxious about it. I have heard that if you develop Raynauds in your 30s or beyond, it is much more likely to be secondary to a connective tissue disease than if you get it in your teens or twenties. Please ask your doc to run bloodwork that includes an ANA test. Good luck! Have you had any rashes, skin changes, or joint aches and fatigue?\n\nI was diagnosed with Scleroderma nearly 30 years ago. Approximately eight years prior to diagnosis (around age twenty), I noticed bloating after my evening meal. (This was on a daily basis, so it was consistent.) About age 25 or 26, I started feeling a burning sensation in my throat. The burning feeling was always in one area of my throat and it felt like someone was holding a lit cigarette and burning me - but, it was on the \\*inside\\* of my throat.\n\nIn the decades since my diagnosis, I have learned that the bloating was likely symptoms of a slowing digestive tract and the burning in my throat was likely stomach acid from GER. Sometimes, pills and food would feel \u201cstuck\u201d in my throat. Pills and food sticking in my esophagus and heartburn from reflux were caused by Scleroderma, as well as bloating.\n\nAll of the above changes were gradual and I imagine they were rare in someone in their 20s. I began to have shortness of breath in high school...but, now that I think of it, my shortness of breath (with dizziness) really began in third grade. \n\nI am not sure exactly what your winter finger and hand symptoms are, but with Raynauds, when your hands (and other parts of your body) get cold, the fingers suddenly grow pale and numb. Mine would turn suddenly - and completely, numb. (My toes and feet would do this also.) You could see the paleness of my fingers on the palm of my hand. When my fingers and toes warmed up and blood flow started to increase, they would tingle like pins and needles. This was all really striking and it felt weird and uncomfortable.\n\nUnfortunately, as we grow older, we start to have heartburn from all kinds of foods that never bothered us when we were younger. Perhaps, it is a good sign that your reflux and Raynauds do not bother you constantly.\n\nHave you already been diagnosed with Scleroderma? My symptoms did not become unbearable until I had a child. \\ After I had a child, my symptoms were more pronounced. The fatigue was the worst - at first.   \n\n\nBeing African-American, I had pigment changes in my skin which were misdiagnosed as vitiligo. But, in Scleroderma, areas of both hypo-pigmentation and hyper-pigmentation can occur. This hypo- and hyper-pigmentation has been described as a \u201csalt and pepper\u201d appearance to the skin. There is dark color surrounding the hair follicles, while the rest of the skin in the area is pale. I believe the pattern of pigment changes in Scleroderma are different than those of vitiligo but most doctors may not know the difference unless they are a very good dermatologist or rheumatologist. It took me about two years trying to get help from other physicians before my dermatologist finally \u201cput two and two together\u201d and looked at my reflux, skin changes, and fatigue and ordered an ANA (Anti-nuclear Antibodies) test which came back (very) positive.\n\nIt does not sound as though you are dealing with all of these symptoms. Assuming you have a good relationship with your GP, I would talk to them about any additional symptoms and I would keep them posted about any changes, if I were you. \\\n\nTake care! That is what I am hoping - that it is just two pretty common issues making their first appearance during one (difficult) year! I have been staying pretty active throughout the lockdown so my guess is the first big GERD attack was covid-stress related (as that was in spring) and perhaps since then I just became a lot more acutely aware of the issue even when it is not giving me too much trouble. \n\nThank you so much for your reply! Really appreciate it. Thank you so much for going into so much detail for me! \n\nI have not had a scleroderma diagnosis made yet - so far my GP was only able to look at photos of my hands I sent him (as I am not allowed to visit him in person yet due to the lockdown here in Scotland) and said it does look like Raynaud's to him. Which at first actually calmed me down, having that sense of \"well at least I know what to call it now!\", but then as I was reading up about it and noticed the connection with reflux and how that might be a red flag, all that calm left the building pretty quickly, haha. \n\nIt is really helpful for me to read all of this as I feel like it gives me more things to look into / look out for! Definitely! Stress can cause a lot of things!! Best of luck.", "Raynauds I have had scleroderma practically my whole life, but never really experienced Raynaud\u2019s as a secondary issue.\n\nBut as I have gotten older, I feel like that is changing.\n\nMy hands end up getting very stiff and I cannot move my fingers very well. \n\nThey do not turn white, but they turn bright red when they warm up (especially on the palms and where my knuckles are) and they start getting swollen.\n\nAre those possible symptoms of Raynauds?", "Mom has Scleroderma, I am trying to find all the treatments I can for her... care to share your treatment(s)? My mom back in 2015 was diagnosed with Scleroderma but it is the kind that mainly effects your skin. Her organs are okay. My mom currently takes 3 5MG Prednisone a day (she says it does help the pain) and also has 3 lesions on her foot from where the scleroderma has ripped and pulled. Each are about the size of a pencil eraser. She used ointment to aid to those since they hurt her. \n\nI have had someone with Scleroderma tell me her doctor recommended Viagra to help maybe get some more blood flow in her feet and legs (it is mainly there on her but it is also on her stomach, breasts, butt, vagina etc.) and I have researched and seen this light therapy to help those who have it.\n\nWhat treatments do you guys use for your Scleroderma? My mom has had it since 2006, I believe. I have done some extensive research on the topic and advised her and others to do the following\n- cut out all stimulants and drugs like coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol.\n- you can use the Viagra, but check with your doc first. Need to ensure that the issues with blood pressure and flow is properly addressed.\n- regular daily stretching and exercise \n- consuming less processed foods and more natural. Consuming less meat as well. Consider shakes to help with malabsorption.\n- staying warm, especially when cold\n- regular sleep\n- for other prescribed drugs, you could look into ACE inhibitors.\n- Prednisone is good, check your dosages though. Look at Rituximab, it is an immunosuppressive. Resunab, iloprost, nifedipine, cox-2 inhibitors, and corticosteroids are all viable options.\n- in terms of more aggressive treatments, you can look at cell therapy and stem cell therapy.\n\nThis is all I can remember off the top of my head. Hope it helps. Does she have the kind that is more in her organs or skin?  Yeah, she has the systemic kind. It affects mostly her skins, hands, and lungs.  I have limited scleroderma (original dx was morphea, which means only skin involvement, though I have since developed additional symptoms).\n\nThe only medical therapies recommended to me were light therapy (insurance would not cover it) and methotrexate (which I declined because I was breastfeeding, then pregnant, and it is known to cause birth defects). Light therapy would theoretically help with pain management and joint restriction, but will not do anything to treat the underlying disease. Methotrexate (and other immunosuppressants) are thought to address the underlying causes.\n\nIn regards to lifestyle management of it, my opinion is the single best thing to do is get regular exercise and stretching. One, to keep skin and joints as flexible and elastic as possible. Two, to become aware of your body &amp; it is limitations, and how those might progress with the disease (monitor any changes in strength, flexibility, etc). And three to increase blood flow to the affected areas.\n\nFor my patch of scleroderma skin, which stretches from my right rib cage down over my hip &amp; front thigh to my knee, mostly I am focusing on keeping it moisturized.  It could be in my head, but I think using my stretch mark butter (from pregnancy) has had the most impact on the skin. I also had success with using an exercise roller over the patches, and it did make a difference in the texture of the skin (I got the idea after reading about using rollers to break up scar tissue from an unrelated injury. I figured the excess collagen bundles that create the hardened plaques were pretty much scar tissue) &lt;--- All of these are alleviating the appearance and texture of the skin, but not treating the disease of course. \n\nGood luck to your mom! It can be a frustrating diagnosis because there are not many studies and broadly effective therapies, but as long as her type does not have organ involvement, it should be manageable. Mom was on methotrexate and I would never wish that on someone ever again. At first, the methotrexate was for what they thought was rheumatoid arthritis. She would take it by getting an injection. She threw up like 5 times every morning this clear goop and it did not even help her. \n\nI am now interested in trying the stretch mark cream. She has this patch on her foot and it has three gashes the size of dime on each gash that looks like it might be getting better because she is soaking her feet but I am trying to find stuff to maybe fix her foot in some way. Was the stretch mark cream Mederma? I used that for my stretch marks (sadly I was not pregnant) and it worked so maybe it is worth a shot. \n\nCan you describe what it is like getting the light therapy? Ugh, I am sorry to hear about your mom's trouble with methotrexate (though it makes me glad that I passed on it). When you are not dealing with the systemic form of scleroderma, it is tough to figure out what treatment is right, because it is more about alleviating symptoms, and sometimes the side effects of the medication just are not worth it. Unfortunately it is a rare disease without much research behind it, so there are not as many options to choose from (that insurance will cover, at least). \n\nFor the stretch mark cream, I use Basq Advanced Stretch Mark Butter (Amazon link at the end of this post). For one, because I already had it, but also because the skin of the plaques gets very dry, scaly, and tight, so moisture is key. Something like Mederma is great for helping to repair scar tissue, but it is not focused on moisturizing the skin. And there is no shame in needing stretch mark cream even when it is not related to pregnancy - not all of us are blessed with skin that is super-elastic =) \n\nThe exercise roller I used really helped with releasing some of the tightness of the skin plaques (just search for \"muscle roller stick\" on Amazon, there are lots of options in the $10-20 range). Depending on the size of your mom's plaques, it might be useful. Mine cover the entire front of my right thigh, and were getting fairly hard -- rolling over it for a minute or two a day softened them up within a week or two. &lt;-- This is totally my own experimentation, it may be a placebo effect. I just decided to try it after my trainer recommended a muscle roller to break up scar tissue from another injury, and when I started researching about manual things like this to \"break up scar tissue\", it turned out that actually does work for injuries, so I figured \"why not?\". \n\nI have not personally tried light therapy -- my insurance would not cover it unless I had already tried the methotrexate, which I was not willing to do. How it works, though, is that your mom would have regular (weekly or bi-weekly) short doses (a few minutes at a time) in a light box (which would be focused only on the affected areas, not like a whole chamber) at a doctor's office. The light is specific wavelengths to penetrate to different depths of the skin, and the purpose is to break up / release the collagen bundles that have formed. In theory, this would help to relax the skin, leading to improvements in mobility, as well as reduce pain from the tight skin. It will not help the disease, though, so if your mom's scleroderma / morphea is active, new plaques would likely still form. I am not sure how effective this would be if she has gashes from it - I would definitely check with a doctor on that. \n\nGood luck to you &amp; your mom! She is lucky to have you taking such an active interest in her treatment, especially for a disease with such limited understanding. \n\nStretch mark cream:  Yeah, luckily she has the kind that is only hurting her skin (that is weird to say.) We do have a prescription ointment for the gashes since they hurt her but it is like I wanted to see if there was something to make the tightness go away in some way. I work with registration at a hospital and someone came in with Scleroderma and I was talking to them and they even suggested that Viagra could help! I appreciate you taking the time to explain your experiences and product recommendations. I wish you the best of luck because I know how much this sucks. My wife struggled with scleroderma for a few years. Truthfully, the only thing we ever found that worked was acupuncture. The results were almost immediate and borderline miraculous. Once we went to the acupuncturist with her in a wheelchair and by the time he was done, she was able to walk out on her own.\nThe only catch is that the results seemed to plateau after a time and we had to go weekly without fail, but YMMV. \nIf this is something you are interested in, be sure to research the practitioner and make sure they are extremely knowledgeable. We were very fortunate to find a Chinese specialist that was a legit physician in China and also had board certified physicians in his Clinic. Really? Wow, I wonder why needle sticking would help that? I figured with the skin being so hard and rough a needle procedure like acupuncture would be dreadful. The needles are so small that it did not seem to be an issue. Kim's legs were kind of locked at an angle and bent at the knees. She could not straighten them or stand on her own after not going for a year. When Dr Lee started working on her, I saw her legs slowly release and straighten. When her parents saw her walk up to their house they broke down in tears. \nThe Chinese believe all sickness is chi being blocked in the body, and this therapy unblocks the chi. Dr Lee told me chi is kind of like circulation. \n\nI have always been skeptical of this kind of thing, but I am a believer now. Unfortunately, Kim was far too sick with diffuse systemic and nothing was going to help very much. I am convinced that this can work for people that have less severe cases.  Hey- Curious. What were the additional symptoms you developed?\n\nI am blanking here but what is an exercise roller? I have a bad patch on my arm and another one forming on my other arm (I can feel it, very tight and aches). I would love to try this.\n\nI use shea butter on my patches. I am currently being pressured by my rheumy to take methotextrate. I have so far refused but I worry that I am making a mistake. The side effects seem so severe and it might do fuck all. Thanks for sharing your moms experience with it.\n\nI was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis years ago and they pushed methotextrate. I did an elimination diet, found out I am sensitive to dairy and sulfites and have been much better. In fact they cleared me of having RA about a year ago. I asked them if it was possible my Scleroderma manifested as RA ( I was sero negative, meaning no rheumatoid factor in the blood) but they said I DID have RA but its gone or in remission now. I wonder if I ever even had RA, to be honest, wonder if it was the Sclero starting up. Well at the time, they thought my mom's scleroderma was RA. So the doctor did not know and just gave her methotrexate to help with her 'RA'. It is literally a chemotherapy drug they use. I mean, I am not sure what your experience will be with it but my mom did frequently throw up and did not feel better. \n\nI have noticed Scleroderma and RA are confused since they are both autoimmune disorders. The main thing I noticed was it was her skin and that sucks that it has to be that indicator since some people have only internal scleroderma so I would bet it is harder to diagnose. First it started off with Raynaud's, and then I also started developing GI symptoms (increased reflux, etc) -- nothing far enough to fit the CREST syndrome cleanly, but these were the first symptoms showing anything beyond just skin involvement. This was about 3-4 years after my original morphea diagnosis, and has been about a year or two since they started. Fortunately nothing has progressed since then. \n\nI used something like this on my leg:  (in case direct product links are not allowed, just search \"muscle roller\" on Amazon)\n\nIt will not do anything about the underlying disease, obviously, but it really helped with the tightness of the skin. I gave it a shot after an exercise trainer recommended it to break up scar tissue from an old broken bone injury, and I figured - why not? The plaques look and feel kind of like scars, it cannot hurt. Search for \"Myofascial release\" to read more about it. \n\nIf you are having mobility issues in your arms, you may want to talk to your doctor about possibly doing the light therapy - my understanding is that it is intended to help with the skin texture and joint restriction, so it might be worthwhile for you. \n\nGood luck! It is a frustrating disease, that is for sure.  I used to have really debilitating calcium deposits on my fingers and major tightening on my arms.  I have been taking Actemra shots for several years and my debilitations are now minor irritations.  Not fully healed but life is much better! how often is she getting the injections?  \n\ni see its over $400 per 4 ml -- may i ask what it costs per injection?\n\nmay i ask what her side effects are? I take injections once every two weeks. If my symptoms are worse than I take it once a week. The only major side effect that I have had, is that I am more susceptible to colds. When I first started doing it every week I got sick a lot. But now it is not so bad.\n\nAs for the cost, I live in Japan and I am a Japanese health care, with special insurance because it is a rare disease, so I pay no more than $100 a month for doctors visits and medicines. Did your mom use Rituximab? And if yes, did it have any positive results? My moms doctor prescribed it to her and we do not know if we should buy it or not. She used it once, but does not now due to the prohibitively high cost in our country. The results were positive though.  I am so happy to hear that! How often was she advised to take it, if you had the possibilities? And what do you mean by positive results? Can you give me more details? What treatment is your mom following now? How is she feeling?\nSorry for all the questions, but my mom is really depressed because all the treatments are super expensive here and none if them have any results. It is okay. I really do not remember how often she had to take it, but she got a trial set of medicine but really could not pay for it after the trial was up. In terms of benefit, she had more energy and breathed better. Right now, she takes some corticosteroids, but mostly maintains a healthier diet and lots of exercise. She has tried marijuana and it helps with the pain, improves her energy and rest levels.... Sadly, it is illegal here and hard to come by as well", "What to expect.. Wife has just been diagnosed What is up everyone.. after a few years of just random things happening we have had the diagnosis of scleroderma. With a sense of relief comes a sense of terror.

Her hands have always hurt I am the past year (she is a very talented seamstress so we put it down to her constantly using them). She is 32. Can she live a normal life now that we know and she has the appropriate treatment?\n\nAny and all information is welcome. Even the brutally honest kind.\n\nTake care everyone.  I was diagnosed when I was 32 as well, last year. I am very sorry that you all have to go through this.\n\nPurely speaking from my experience of having this diagnosis for only a year, I know that I have had to completely relearn what I can and cannot do, physically and emotionally. \n\n***The physical symptoms will be different for everyone...*** When I was diagnosed, I had severe finger ulcers on every finger and could not pull up my own  pants without my spouse's help. A year later, I am having a right heart catheterization to test to see if I have pulmonary hypertension from scleroderma scarring my lungs. Some days I cannot get comfortable no matter what position I am in and can only sleep after I am so exhausted I cannot keep my eyes open anymore. Other days I am wanting to pull my skin off, it itches so much. Some days, it is a miracle I can do anything more than get myself to the bathroom and back to bed. So \"what to expect\" in terms of disease progression is going to depend on how rapid it is and how she responds to medications and treatments. I think one of the best pieces of advice here, is find a rheumatologist that is familiar with scleroderma. If you can manage it, make the long trip to a rheumatologist where they have scleroderma specialists. UCLA, Duke, Mayo, Johns Hopkins, etc. \n\nI believe it is safe to say, that your wife will go through many, many, many moments where she will \"die\" over and over again, especially as her symptoms change. She will be reminded constantly about things she can no longer do and will die a little inside each time it is brought to her attention. To complicate this further, I think it is safe to say that she will need to mourn those parts of herself and will not know how... Because she is, for all intents and purposes, still alive. And mourning yourself is lonely, because to everyone on the outside, you are still alive and well when you feel hollow. I hope you all have the resources to let her see a counselor that has some experience in clients with chronic illness. Mine has been absolutely invaluable to me.\n\nI know for my relationship, I was (and honestly still am) terrified that my spouse will leave because they do not want to deal with me and everything that comes with my scleroderma any more... Certain issues brought a lot of topics to the forefront of our relationship that are not comfortable to think about. Topics that are not asked or thought of in things like pre-marital counseling or relationship books. Those conversations will bring a lot of things to light that may not have been an issue before, but will be now, because you all may find out that you are not on the same page. Are you prepared to be her caregiver? Is there anything you are physically unwilling to do for her should she be unable to do it herself? Are you prepared to be strong for her when you are just as terrified as she is? Does she want you or someone else making the decisions about staying on assisted living devices, should her condition come to that?\n\nI am sorry, because I know this probably is not what you are looking for... But again, it is different for everyone, and you can read tons of research and experiences online about the physical aspects of scleroderma. I just know the psychological aspect of this has had the biggest impact on me in this first year and I hope she and you can stay strong through it.\n\nPlease feel free for you or your wife to message me if you would like. I will definitely have you both in my thoughts. What type does she have?

There are many support groups on Facebook I highly recommend them.", "FDA Approves Nintedanib for Progressive Interstitial Lung Diseases ", "Possible False Positive? What Now? Hey all,\n\n30 year old male. Did not even know what scleroderma was until about an hour ago. Blessings to this community!\n\nLong story short, last month I was feeling a little off and went to the doc to see what is up. They did a blood test and told me they would reach out if anything was necessary. Never heard anything and have felt normal since.\n\nNow, a month later, I logged into the labcorp portal to pay the bill and checked out the labs myself. Turns out my SCL-70 antibody is 1.8, which was flagged as high and abnormal, but everything else is fine. I do not really think I have experienced any of the symptoms that most people discuss in this sub.\n\nWhat do I do now? See a rheumatologist? I just moved states last week and since I buy insurance through the government marketplace I do not think I can use my old insurance in my new state. Probably will have to wait until that changes which could be a few weeks.\n\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated :) Go to Iowa for the antibiotic protocol and get into remission quickly before it gets too bad. That is what I did. It saved my life if you are interested in information about this I would be happy to talk to you or anyone about it. My name is Denise and my number is 401-339-2323 Completely ignore this crazy person. What was your overall Ana titer? It will look like this \u201c1:XX\u201d. The higher the XX the less likely a false positive test is. If it is low, aka 40 or 80, I would not worry any more.\n\nIt is possible you did not get the general IFA test which has that titer on it. If that is the case I would see if your GP can order the \u201cIFA ANA\u201d test.\n\nAll that being said, even if your titer is high the rheum probably is not going to do anything without symptoms. If it will give you peace of mind I would schedule an appointment anyways. But you probably do not have to worry.\n\nThere are a -lot- more people who are antibody positive than people with symptoms of disease in the world.\n\nEdit: Just to add more evidence here 3 years ago my mom got a very positive 1:640 ANA for scleroderma. The doctor never told her (lol) but she is developed no scleroderma symptoms. You are probably good but following up is not a bad idea The scl-70 is very prone to false positives. Seeing a rheumatologist might be a good idea to be safe but if you have no symptoms, odds are it is false positive. No I am not. I am alive and happy to still be here. And I wonder why you say I am crazy? Because I found an alternative with an 80% success rate of total remission? I take two antibiotics a day, it is what they prescribe people for acne and this is keeping me healthy and alive. Much safer and way less side effects than the drugs that they give you to shut off your immune system. Maybe you should do some research on the antibiotic protocol. Look up the road back foundation, they have a list of doctors who are on board with this treatment. The doctor in Iowa, Dr. Sinnott, was doing this for decades and saved thousands of people from dying. Thank you so much for your thoughtful response! I do not think I got the titer test because nothing on the report gives me a number like that, so I suppose that might be my next step. I will have to wait a few weeks until I can get new insurance to see a GP and ask for the test. \n\nAll it tells me is that my count is \"1.8 AI\" which is over the reference range of 0.9 AI Thank you for your response, I really appreciate your perspective. Yeah they probably ran the \u201cANA Id\u201d test rather than the IFA. Not a doctor obviously but from what I can tell ANAs are tough since they are meant to -confirm- a diagnosis from symptoms. They do not really diagnose. So if the doctor does not already suspect an immune disease they do not mean much. This is likely why your doctor did not call you. \n\nI am a high anxiety person so I would probably still pursue this but it would be 100% reasonable to consider yourself healthy and put it out of your mind too! If you are genuine, which I very much doubt, deeply and dramatically reconsider how you approach this.\n\nYou come across as a crack pot pushing a potentially dangerous treatment. Not only will no one take you seriously but if you truly believe in this treatment, you are pushing people away from it. That makes a lot of sense. I am a high anxiety person too haha so I will def look into it some more. On that note, your explanation is really calming me down a ton and I am extremely grateful for your perspective on this!

The primary outcome measure was the modified Rodnan skin thickness score (MRSS).\n\nRESULTS:\n\nOf 36 subjects initially enrolled, 31 returned for at least 1 followup visit and were included in the analysis (modified intent-to-treat analysis). The group consisted of 23 women and 8 men, with a mean age of 51.7 years (range 26-82 years) and a mean disease duration of 23.5 months (range 6-60 months). The mean MRSS at entry was 22.7 (range 12-43), and at the final visit it was 18.6 (range 2-48). There was no statistically significant difference in the change in skin scores between the minocycline-treated subjects and subjects previously reported in the D-penicillamine (D-Pen) trial. In addition, when adjusted for disease duration, a comparison of MRSS in the minocycline trial subjects (including all subjects active at each time point) and the previously reported D-Pen trial subjects showed no difference and no treatment effect. Fourteen subjects did not complete all 12 months of treatment; 10 of them withdrew due to disease progression. Disease duration was significantly shorter for the noncompleters than for the completers (P &lt; 0.03).\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe degree of change in the MRSS was similar to that expected in the natural course of this disease. Based on these data, minocycline is not an effective therapy for SSc.\n\nPMID:\u00a014872498\u00a0\n\nAlso... (\n\nIt was a very small sample of patients, and there was nearly a 50% failure rate in completing he study, which is very high, and two people (20%) died of Scleroderma renal failure within the first few months who had no evidence of renal disease beforehand.\n\nThis was not a double-blind test. Both the patients and the doctor knew what medication was being used. No measurements were taken of internal organ involvement. The skin scores it was based on are a purely subjective measurement. The natural course of Scleroderma is for the skin to initially harden, and then begin softening.\n\nMany treatments have initially seemed promising for Scleroderma which in larger studies were proven to be of no benefit. The most recent example of this is Penicillamine (Depen), which was widely used for the treatment of Scleroderma in the U.S. until a large, double-blind study proved it to be of no benefit.\n\nThe study was sponsored in part by The Road Back Foundation and NIH. The results of this small open label study must be interpreted with extreme caution.\u00a0These results do not represent a \"cure\"\u00a0for scleroderma.\u00a0American College of Rheumatology. May 14, 1998. I think the only one pushing people away from a life-saving treatment is you with your closed mind. I have contacted several people on this app who have already gone to Iowa and received help and are feeling better. For me when I found out about it, it was a No brainer. I was basically sent home today with nothing that was helping. I made an appointment and went as soon as I could. By the third day of antibiotic treatments I could dress myself. I had that much range of motion back in only three days of treatment.\nBut everyone is entitled to their own opinion. You can think whatever you wish. Sorry talk to text made a few errors. That should say I was sent home to die, not today I tested positive for that too.  I went to a different lab and had them re do the test.  Still positive.  My family doc says the test is actually fairly accurate. Hello. I tested Positive for Scl-70 at 2.3, 13 years ago. My Rheumatologist never said much and got rested in 2014 with 2.3 (AI) then this year again at 2.3 (AI). Negative for all other Autoimmune. My ANA came out positive but unsure how high or low. The only symptoms I have had is minor joint finger pain and very slight fatigue. Every lab, EKG, Chest X-rays, Kidney and liver check, all are perfect. I am seeing another Rheumatologist for a 2nd opinion. Oh and I get Anxiety and feel like I cannot breathe. Blah. To much research can affect your mind. Other than that, I have not had any other issues. Thanks for your perspective and sharing your experience. It is unsettling how confusing this all can be. I have not made much progress on any diagnosis since I wrote this post because I still need to wait another couple weeks at least to get my insurance squared away and can see a doctor. Wishing you the best. Any updates to this? I just tested positive for scleroderma and I do have gerd but am still weary of the test results. I broke my ankle 2 months ago\u2026 so I just do not know. I also have a ton of health anxiety so this is really not helping Hi there! I have not been able to see any docs yet since I have had to wait to get new insurance set up in the new state I moved to. I will begin to have insurance again on Aug 1 so going to get it checked out once that happens. \n\nI have still felt fine for the most part but admittedly my health anxiety often gets the best of me and every small thing that happens to me I freak out it is something bigger. I am sorry this is something you are going through. Have you seen a Rheumatologist yet regarding your diagnosis or did it just come back positive on a blood test like mine? \n\nI am reassured that so many people are helpful and positive in this sub .. and for what it is worth, lurking in anxiety subs has definitely helped me with my anxiety in the past. Knowing that others are going through the same thing as me always makes me feel better. I will keep you posted! I feel like I am the exact same way. I have had health anxiety for years and so this is the worst possible thing that could have happened. I really want to believe it is just a fluke and the blood tests are wrong. I keep looking for reassurance and get myself totally worked up about all of it. I am seeing a rheumatologist on July 27th. Please do update me about what they tell you and I will give an update as well! :) I am in dark space from it now, honestly. I need to chillll Hey just thought I should update. I did see a rheumatologist and she did a retest which came out the exact same. Positive for ANA and high titers, positive anti-centromere\u2026.. she said she wants to monitor it every year or so and to look out for any other symptoms. I have gotten my gerd down a ton since I posted here by getting my stress down as well. She said she was not going to give me a diagnosis yet so I do not really know what to make of it. I guess the only thing I can do is to go on and just live my life and try and forget about it in the meantime\u2026 so no closure lol which is not cool in some ways, but oh well. Thanks for sharing - I have been thinking about this recently. I suppose no diagnosis is a good diagnosis, all things considered, but I am sure still anxiety-inducing to be in this grey area. That is life I guess! I remain positive from some of the other posters that have been able to live completely normal and unaffected lives despite higher counts.\n\nI still have not made my way to the doc despite finally having insurance again. I have been feeling normal and I guess keeping it \"out of sight, out of mind\" even though that probably is not the best move.  I am sure I will get around to it eventually but I kind of feel like my doc would end up saying the same thing as yours lol Yes! A doctor would probably tell you the same info!  Basically if you are not showing more than 2 clinical symptoms of the disorder than they cannot make a diagnosis. Plus, I have come to find out that the tests they use are hypersensitive and often produce false positives especially with the SCL70 tests!

However, I have had two reliable tests and the anti-centromere was by far the higher antibody, between two antibodies in repeated tests. One is speckled the other anti-centromere.\n\nWhy would he not repeat the lab for the anti-centromere, and consider it a non-factor? And yes, I have some of the limited scleroderma issues. Can you get a second opinion? This does confuse me as well. My ANA pattern is also speckled and my doctor considers it postive I will never state this enough. Always get 2nd opinions.

Hi everyone, I am totally new to this subreddit so this might be a bit misguided. For some background, I was diagnosed with Morphea when I was 13, and I am now 23. I have it on my stomach, neck, hips and under my arms. It does not interfere  with my life that much but it did cause me to have major self image issues in my teen years. \n\nThe reason I am here is that as as an adult, I want to get a tattoo. I want to have something on my body that I put there and not something I could not control that is there. It would just mean a lot to me. I do not want to get the tattoo anywhere that the morphea is on my skin, and I would be getting a fairly small one. I was just curious if anyone else had experience with this issue or if anyone might be able to direct me anywhere with information. I tried looking it up online but there is not much about it. Thanks for reading!  I was diagnosed with morphea when I was about 10. It progressed to \"linear\" and eventually burned out when I was late teens/early 20's. I have had a ton of piercings and tattoos without any issue. Everyone is different though and I am guessing if I would have asked a doctor first they would have advised against it. \n\nPS.

Within the last 6 months I have had blood tests that resulted in the diagnosis of scleroderma. However, the rheumatologist believed it was incorrect since I do not have any of the skin related hand symptoms it is known for. A second round of tests came to the same conclusion. Does anyone else experience the  high levels of pain in their body, muscles, joints , and sporadically everywhere, without the skin issues and how do you cope with the pain? Were you given medication or recommended a change in diet? what has worked for you? I do not have skin symptoms, but my doc thinks I will likely develop them within the next year because of the specific antibody I have (RNA-Pol3, which is linked to DSSc) and the fact that they caught it early. There is a subtype called sine systemic scleroderma, which is only about 5% of people with systemic scleroderma. I wonder if that is what you are experiencing? \n\nI do not have any medications yet for scleroderma, but I was given a script for a medication for my GERD. \n\nMy pain experience has improved significantly in the last six months after making some pretty substantial dietary changes and starting turmeric capsules daily. I still have pain flare ups, but the severity is like a 4/10 instead of 7 or 8. My worst symptoms are the GI issues, and that has improved with my diet but is still very present. \n\nI started with the AIP diet and ended up blending it with FODMAP and creating my own personalized diet. Then, I took a food sensitivity test and came back with like 12 sensitivities, so I cut those out alongside with the nightshade vegetables (which are linked to increased inflammation), coffee, chocolate, and tea (which all increase my GERD). I try not to eat anything too acidic to help reduce my GERD. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI miss chocolate. :( Thanks for responding. This is the second time someone mentioned turmeric pills to me. I think I will check that out. Funny thing is the only time any doctor mentioned my inflammation levels is when I was nearly dying in pain in Japan a few years ago. One of my doctors recently gave me a med that is used for people with osteoporosis. But that is only because I also had a snowboarding injury. That is the only thing that has worked to help with pain. So, I am going to look into adjusting my diet as well. I will probably have to lock up my coffee maker :( but I may never truly give up chocolate I definitely recommend turmeric. You could also look into golden milk, which is sort of like a coffee-free latte with turmeric and honey. I do not like it, but some people swear by it.\n\nI would recommend looking into the AIP diet since it is a systematic method to trial and error different foods that are common inflammation triggers. You start off eliminating everything, which is really hard to do, but it is short term and you slowly introduce things back to see how you tolerate them. This will help you with identifying your personal triggers because everyone is body is different.

It took me about 5 months to get my diet sorted out, but I have got it settled now and have found some acceptance despite missing some of my favorite foods. The skin manifestations may not happen for many years. Mine happened years after Raynauds and generally feeling unwell with random rashes, etc. It could also be CREST or some other limited form of scleroderma. Like I have the antibodies, the GERD, and the blood vessel involvement, but no skin symptoms. And it is been a complete nightmare getting a diagnosis and treatment. I am glad to find this post. I have been going through hell trying to find out what is up with me this last year. I have had IBSC for 6 yrs that I manage with linzess. Last year I started getting URQ pains that sent me on a whole trail of tests. I get random pains in my body especially my low right hip. I have symptoms of gerd and delayed stomach emptying. I found out this year I have hashimotos and Gilbert\u2019s syndrome and I am positive for ANA and that panel also said positive scleroderma. I have to obvious symptoms like the hands and tight skin so my dr dismissed it. My hands do get red and dry fast but I have always had dry skin.

I still do not understand the reasoning and it is making it hard to seek a correct diagnosis. Sometimes they will tell me it is because I do not have skin involvement and mine goes in flares and then disappears. But my raynaud's symptoms are spreading outside of my limbs and my quality of life is rapidly decreasing. Scleroderma can be systemic, without skin involvement. It is called Sine scleroderma. You need to get yourself a doctor who specializes in the treatment of scleroderma. Most rheumatologists do not see a lot of scleroderma cases for them to fully understand the disease. \n\nTry looking on the Scleroderma Foundation's forums. There are a lot of people with this disease who can point you to the experts. Off the top of my head, I know that the Mayo Clinic has specialists there. You can Google scleroderma specialists as well. I am in the exact same boat as you. I quit seeing my RA a couple years ago because I felt like they were not taking me seriously. My kidneys are failing, legs go numb, hands and feet are always cold even if it is 80\u00b0F out, extremely tired no matter how much sleep I get. I can never take a full breath because I feel like my chest and throat are in a vise. I have almost passed out from eating things like sushi and pancakes because my stupid esophagus does not work right. But because I do not have skin involvement, I am in limbo about what I need to do next There are false positives on SCL-70 (I have had high positive multiple times on Mayo Clinic's test, but was negative on a more accurate version). And systemic sclerosis without skin involvement (a.k.a. sine scleroderma) is fairly rare.  \n\n\nThat said, your symptoms do sound pretty concerning. If your doctor is not taking you seriously, can you find another one? Have you had a high resolution chest CT scan? Interstitial lung disease is one of the most dangerous and harmful problems that is common with the scl-70 antibody. If you are doctor has not checked for it, then they are doing you a disservice. Did they do a nailfold capillaroscopy? They really just look at the base of your fingernails with a good microscope...  it is very easy, but it is a fairly sensitive clinical test for scleroderma.  \n\n\nHere is a pretty good summary of the diagnostic criteria:  \n( I have a SCL-70 positive test and I wasnt diagnosed with Scleroderma... yet.\n\nI had the test back in Dec after my mom passed away fro Scleroderma. She had both diffuse and Crest. So far my only symtom is Reynauds. Because I dont have acid reflux, skin, calcium or lung symtoms at the moment my doc isnt giving me the scleroderma diagnosis.\n\nHis best guess is I may be testing positive because my mom had it. Basically I may just be a carrier at this point. Right now I could go either way tho.. continue living with reynauds that ive had all my life and that is all I will ever experience, or as I get older more symptoms may appear and I will get the formal diagnosis then.\n\nRight now theres no meds or therepys to help, so I just keep on keeping on. I feel like to are telling my story! Scl 70 positive, ANA positive, and Raynaud's. Some of my doctors say it is scleroderma, others say; \"your presenting closer to lupus\", \"fibromyalgia\", etc.  It has been frustrating! I try to focus on what my wonderful doctor said, \"the longer you are without symptoms the better the prognosis.\"  \n\n\nThat being said, if you are in the eastern US, look into The Cleveland Clinic Rheumatologic and Immunologic Diseases.  They have locations in at least Florida and Ohio. They have a Scleroderma Center. Maybe the would have a referral to a doctor in your area. I have very minimal skin involvement as I have the limited form. One of my earliest rheumatologist felt I needed to have more skin involvement to think the disease was progressing. I found a new rheumatologist, found out I also have another autoimmune disease and my Scleroderma is progressing rapidly. It is your body, you know when something is wrong. You should try to find a new doctor who takes your concerns seriously. Have you had an ANA test done? I also do not have a diagnosis. ANA 1:80 speckled and SCL-70 1.2 \n\nI was also told that I did not have scleroderma because I do not have the skin problems. I am so sorry your health problems are making life hard. You are not alone xx What are your symptoms? There seems to be this whole group of people I have found online that test positive and basically have scleroderma with no skin manifestations.

This is not specifically for morphea, I have read on this platform that its been prescribed for plaque psoriasis. Its a steroid. Mine is fairly extensive, going from top of my thigh to now under my knee (linear type). Although it is a large area, it is actually hardly visible in the oldest parts (the hyperpigmentation has really calmed down). My dermatologist told me to moisturise religiously every night with a thick barrier cream, in addition to steroid cream during active phases. It is definitely a lot better a few years out. What creams are you using? Hello! I know I am late to this post... But I think I can be helpful! I have lived with this since I was about 11 or 12 years old! I am 31 now. \nI found that no medication or cream helped. For me, it eventually ran its course and stopped spreading / being flakey / itchy / painful / like my skin was ripping. I remember the patches on my hip used to actually bleed.\n\nI am left with large discoloured patches on my upper back, left leg, left arm and shoulders, side of my left breast, across my hips and stomach, wrapping around my lower back. They do not even really feel much different than the rest of my skin anymore. \n\nSo although you will probably be faced with the discoloration forever, the pain does go away! I did develop a new patch right in between my eyebrows a couple of years ago, which has been really frustrating for me, as I was told it \"ran its course\" and would likely not spread anymore... So there is the anxiety of it deciding it wants to take over my face... I do often wonder if there is some sort of autoimmune response that re triggers / flares up this disease. \n\nThis was a curse to me as a 12 year old girl. Drs. Told me it was dry skin, my mom insisted I must be doing it to myself somehow... I was was then diagnosed with psoriasis... It was not until many, MANY years later that a dermatologist finally realized there was no way in hell this was psoriasis, and I was given a proper diagnosis with an honest \"there is not really anything you can do except learn to live with it\".

She believes it was triggered by a c-diff. infection that had almost killed her. \nHer scleroderma was very aggressive and became debilitating very quickly. She could barely open her mouth to feed herself, that was if she could bend her fingers enough to hold a utensil. In addition to the extensive loss of her range of motion she also lost most of her muscle mass, her hair began falling out, and her feet and ankles had swelled up to the size of balloons. \n\nIn 2015 she found out about the antibiotic protocol at Horn Memorial Hospital. She got in touch with Susanne Landgrebe, the woman who specializes in this treatment &amp; and sends the orders to the hospital. \n\nShe traveled to Iowa and was there for treatment for five days. Two intravenous or pic line treatments (depending on what works best for you) per day. She stayed in a nearby motel but there are also other affordable places to stay not very far from the hospital. \n \nBy her fourth treatment she was able to dress herself - something she had not been able to do for close to a year. From then on she felt a little bit better every day. She is been in remission since, and maintains it by taking 100mg minocycline 2x daily. This is prescribed by Susanne Landgrebe. You can contact at her at 515-720-4377. \n \nI do not know much about him but I have also heard of a Dr. Franco in riverside, CA who specializes in this treatment as well, so that may be worth looking into if it is closer for some. \n\nMy mothers phone number is 401-339-2323, her name is Denise.

I have been trying to educate myself about what that means for disease progression, but everything I am reading seems to suggest that it is pretty rare to have both. \n\nWas anyone else diagnosed with diffuse systemic scleroderma with both antibodies? Did it affect your prognosis &amp; disease progression at all? \n\nI am kind of freaking out because I had a history of ILD with a high ANA before I finally had positive antibodies, but it seems like ARA+ has a poor prognosis. Well, your entire question should be rephrased. No one knows what these mean. They are scleroderma specific antibodies? ARA is highly specific for diffuse systemic sclerosis, which is what I have. It is associated with a worse prognosis and rarely occurs with Scl-70 antibodies, but I happen to have both. I was wondering if anyone else in this sub also had both when diagnosed. You do not have a disease if you do not have the symptoms. No one has a poor prognosis from blood tests. It is so rare that, you are probably false positive. It is Bayes theorem. It is very rare to have both, but it is supposedly very common to get a false positive for the Scl-70 antibody, so you may have just the anti RNA Poly antibody in reality. Please do not freak out, but do know that people with this antibody should never use steroids because they can cause kidney failure. You should also be monitoring your blood pressure to watch for symptoms of kidney failure even if you are not on steroids, since it is more common in people with this antibody.  Luckiky there are really good treatments for scleroderma kidney failure, like ACE inhibitors,  but it needs to be caught early. Please consider joining the Facebook scleroderma group and also seeing a scleroderma specialist, since there are good treatments available for many symptoms! Holy gate keeping Batman. I have been diagnosed with diffuse systemic sclerosis based on both symptoms, antibody tests, as well as other testing. One of those antibodies is associated with a worse prognosis when present in diagnosed patients. It is just rare to have both, which is why I posted here. \n\nI have been being treated for pulmonary fibrosis and ILD before was even tested for scleroderma. I get it must be annoying to see people speculating about vague health issues on here, but I literally said I have been diagnosed.\n\nMeant to reply to u/RipEducational with this, but mobile sucks. Thank you for the advice about steroids! I have been checking my blood pressure and it was high at my last rheumatology appointment. \n\nI thought it was weird when my anti-Scl 70 came back positive because I had read that is super uncommon. \n\nMy hospital has a scleroderma specialist, thankfully! I had been treated for pulmonary fibrosis there. Some other issues landed me with rheumatology, but they seem to have a few multidisciplinary specialists that see scleroderma patients, which is great. Okay. still, bayes thorem applies. there is no prognosis based off of blood tests. I mean there is literally medical research on it, but ok. That is great that you already have a specialist! You probably know more than I do about treatments for pulmonary fibrosis, but it seems like a lot of people with scleroderma related lung fibrosis have responded well to rituximab. What others said are right, SCL-70 can have false positives. From what I have read, it is near impossible to see both.. so much so that I have not seen any documented cases in medical journals. So, I would not be surprised if you had a false positive there but do have the RNA-PIII antibodies. I have anti RNA-PIII as well, and I have not really seen anyone else post here with that antibody. Most on this subreddit discuss SCL-70.\n\nYou are right that RNA-PIII is associated with a worse prognosis, as it sees a higher rate of renal failure. My doctor is having me do lab work quarterly to check my kidneys while I check my blood pressure 3x/week to monitor. So far my symptoms have been minimal. I have not been happy with my doctor so far as he is had a pretty laissez-faire attitude so I reached out to a specialist program for scleroderma to try to get in there. I would much rather be proactive with my care.\n\nI found a lot of relief from joint pain and gastric symptoms by changing my diet to an autoimmune protocol, increasing protein intake via whey protein shakes, and taking turmeric alongside my vitamins. I also upped my cardio exercise and started a daily yoga practice for mobility. I do not have any meds prescribed to me yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should add that just because there is a potential for worse prognosis does not mean you will have that course. It is highly variable between people in how symptoms present. That is why I am doing so much with my lifestyle habits and trying to find a proactive medical approach with a different doctor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nETA: If you want to keep connected to talk with someone with similar antibodies, let me know.

So a few months back I saw a primary doctor for shortness of breath and chest pains. After a battery of tests (X-rays, blood, 2-D echo, EKG), doc concluded that the bout of breathing/chest-pain was probably caused by stress or anxiety. Thankfully, all the breathing/chest issues resolved, and I have been fine for a couple months.\n\nFigured while I was at the doctor, I would ask about a painless lump that had developed on my shin. It was about 1cm in size, slightly raised, sometimes looked normal skin color, sometimes a bit pinkish red. She referred me to a derm, he said probably a benign fatty tumor, but let us do a biopsy anyway.\n\nHe called me back after a week, said the pathologist analyzing the biopsy said it could be a fatty tumor or it could potentially be scleroderma. Now I am kind of stressed because I was hoping a biopsy would provide a straightforward resolution, not more questions. The derm said he believes it is not scleroderma because a lump on a shin would be an extremely abnormal case of it, but perhaps should look into more tests just in case.\n\nAnyway, after going through months of tests and various guesswork, I just wanted to float my particular story over here and see if anyone can offer some insight. Anyone have a similar case? Does this sound like Scleroderma or highly unlikely? Can a biopsy really return an ambiguous answer when it comes to this? I would try not to worry about it. Does not sound like there is any cause for major concern, especially without having done any type of rheumatological testing yet. People get bumps, this one does not really raise any red flags. And just know that even if it is scleroderma, which again probably not, you would be catching things early and there is a lot of treatment options. I am pretty new to this disease myself. Have not even been diagnosed for a year. The bump may be calcinosis, the C in CREST syndrome - another name for a version of scleroderma. It might be why your doc suggested it. I have never had a calcinosis issue, but autoimmune can present very differently in everyone. I believe that specific blood tests are a surefire way to assess for scleroderma. \nI think they can be expensive tests if you do not have insurance, but the results can tell you for sure if you have an autoimmune disease. \n\nAsk your doc to check:\n\nC-Reactive Protein\nAntinuclear Antibodies \nANA Titer\nANA Pattern Legacy\nANA Path Review Legacy\nAnti-Centromere Antibodies\n\nThese are all tests that I had when I was diagnosed by my PCP that confirmed scleroderma and got me in to see a rheumatologist.\n\nI hope this helps and wish you the best.

I know it is not as magnifying as the one they use in nailfold capillaroscopy but I guess she would been able to tell if one was needed? She did not seem concerned at all. She said my capillaries would have been huge if I had scleroderma. She tried to comfort me talking about how I need to learn to differenciate between real symptoms and just some random stuff that a body just does and will keep doing. She seemed quite cool and not judging at all. It was me who wanted to leave the office as quickly as possible before I would go into a panic attack. And honestly I would have been fine if I showed her the other finger and knew she looked at it. Now idk how to stop worrying. As for the symptoms, I do not have Raynaud's. But I get random pain I am hands and feet (or arms and legs even), paresthesias for no reason (I have had a brain mri done and it should not be MS or anything), shaky hands sometimes idk why, gastric discomfort and heartburn sometimes (it lasts for a few weeks and goes away after, sometimes I have to take omeprazol. The episodes are probably triggered by especially stressful events but I did not manage to really tell yet). Had fibroscopy done a few years ago and it showed a slightly marbled gastric mucosa. Otherwise it was fine and doc blamed my issues on anxiety. I am going for another exam soon. I definitely get spider veins a lot and I have had unexplained petechiae for years on my legs. They come and go and look like little hickeys. I bruise very easily, too. I do not notice any swelling anywhere. Nor calcium deposits. Lastly I have had difficulty breathing also for years. But when I went to a doctor with that years ago, there did not find anything wrong with my lungs. Spirometry, x-ray and pulse oximetry (I think that is what they did) were fine. They said it was the anxiety. My bloodwork seems quite normal, too. I have some set doc appointments already, I just do not know how not to go mad while waiting. Going to get spinal cord mri in two weeks (just to be super sure it is not MS), rheumy appointment I think next month, immunologist and mmg (neuro) in December. Will also have another bloodwork done before the reumy since they want me to bring the basic panel. You probably already can tell that I am a pretty anxious person. But I just cannot allow myself to blame everything on anxiety. Even though it would have made my life much easier.\n\nAlso, how have you been dealing with scleroderma for so many years? Are you doing good? I am doing great! I get frustrated once in a while but we all do!!! I have a great support system that is is so important.

From what I have seen they are definitely common for us with scleroderma but harmless. Of course, be sure to show your rheumatologist the next time you go. I always like to point out anything that is new to her just so she has documentation of what is going on and can let me know if it is anything to worry about or not. So I am UMCTD right now but we are watching it to make see if it turns into schleroderma. I took this picture to show her next time. My last appointment was just two weeks ago. Do they go away? I get them, I also have uctd. My 23andme health report says I am AT risk for scleroderma. My dermatologist and rheumatologist do not believe it will turn into scleroderma. Been looking into stem cell treatments Do yours go away? Sorry if this is vain of me to ask but I do not want dots everywhere. Mine went away, my skin is a war zone. Bright red and splotchy , itchy. The plaquenil has chilled me out. I was not really good looking to begin with, so red skin does not help. Ah okay. Any skincare products help? I wish,,,, not really. I moisturize  a lot , that helps a bit They go away but it takes me almost 2 months. The red will go away but it will be tender and off colored for awhile. Its not really a sign of crest, its a sign of Raynaud\u2019s. Crest syndrome consists of Raynaud\u2019s, but Raynaud\u2019s more often than not, stands alone and independent. In order for it to be crest you would need at least 3 of the 5 traits associated with CREST. Ah okay. Just have had Raynauds for about 2-3 years now with purple fingers, coldness and all. This is the first time I have had the dot so I kind of freaked out. I just saw the rheumatologist and was fine but I get scared everytime something new happens. Yeah, scleroderma is scary and not to be messed with. But 2-3 years with what would be secondary Raynaud\u2019s (if you did have scleroderma) would mean the disease is moving ridiculously slow. Does not seem like there is anything to worry about other than the Raynaud\u2019s, which if you let go can be very bad. Not that you are, but just as a general statement Thanks friend! I have Raynauds and that happened to me only once (in the same area) went away and I have not had one since It just came off like a scab!

And after Jan I started dealing with some severe GI issues that I have been having to deal with ever since. Pretty sure the muscles in my digestive tract have hardened- so I take 3 laxatives DAILY and a prescribed motility drug and I still have issues. Well recently my sinus\u2019 have been being weird too and I have been getting vertigo on and off for years now. Come to find out the tubes in my ears do not open like they are supposed to. It could be purely due to inflammation... but I am worried it is more than that. Also, it is finally summer here and stopped snowing so I can start hiking again which I do EVERY year. This year though, my back and legs make it feel like I am wearing cement shoes and I have to hike extremely slow to bear the strain.... has it affected my legs and back muscles now too?! \n\nI am just curious if anyone has experienced anything similar? I have Systemic Sclerodrma and have been diagnosed for 7 years now. But I do not have Diffuse and I always kind of banked on that at least rapid deterioration would not happen... but it seems like this is false?! How old are you? My symptoms made exactly that kind of escalation about a year ago without any treatment. I am reasonably sure covid had nothing to do with it but I am in the exact age bracket for the onset of the disease. (47) I did not have covid, I also have limited systemic, and I have the same symptoms along with a bunch of other issues of course. Still no skin issues though. \n\nDid you get a covid antibody test? No never got the antibody test. What do you do for your GI problems? I just turned 30. But My disease has been active for over 7 years now. I mean I am just it was happening slowly and maybe just now the accumulation is too much that I am full noticing how much it is affecting me. \n\nDo you experience issues with leg/back muscles like this too? Not specifically no, but I do have a lot of weird new muscle spasms and pulls. I have to be really careful because a minor strain can become something that I miss work over.\n\nI have a decade+ old, serious back injury and still work in construction so while I have not seen any significant increase in that particular injury, it is still debilitating fairly regularly. I am on some pretty good drugs. I also like to hike and do a lot of backpacking, I have had to moderate my plans and scale back. Do not have much energy by the time I get there.\n\nThe cement shoe thing I get from the fatigue, combined with my meds if I am not balanced properly, getting through a day without a nap is goddamn torture.

It was very validating for me,  sometimes I feel like I am becoming a hypochondriac.\n\n10 weeks later, still have tinnitus. \n\n:( I have really bad ear problems now and I 100% believe this rapidly increased due to the Covid shot. I had horrible ear pain after the first dose of the Covid shot but my rheumy said to get the second, so I did and I did not have any symptoms after.

Could you elaborate on the link between vitamin A and C, and skin thickening? Yeah\u2014 so vitamin A is a building block for collagen so you do not want to take large amounts of it (eg some formulations in vitamins will have double or triple the daily need). Vitamin C is vital to your immune system, so since our immune system is attacking the body you do not necessarily want to help it with large doses. If you are taking immunosuppressants then you should talk to your specialist because then you may want to add vitamin c depending on what you are taking. I take the store brand for mine. It is a regional chain so not sure if you have it: Meijer's ?\n\nIt is not necessarily that you need low VitC: Just not over 100%. Mine is like 80%. Yes: seconding vitamin D for sure.

I have a lot of vague symptoms that resemble scleroderma (joint pain, hardening of the skin, Raynauds, acid reflux, problems swallowing, skin ulcers) and all of my tests (ANA, RF, C3, C4, etc) are coming back negative or borderline. I know that my symptoms could also be caused by many other diseases so I feel like my rheumatologist is kind of taking a shot in the dark.\n\nI had my anticentromere antibodies tested and they came back at 24 au/ml ( normal range 0-29 au/iu). Obviously this falls into the negative category, but my question is what does it mean when you produce antibodies that are in the \"normal range \"? I had similar results on a Thyroglobulin test I took recently (TG was 13.2IU/ml range &lt; 14.4 IU/ml). Is it normal to have some anticentromere antibodies? \n\nDo I keep checking them to see if they become positive or do I rule out scleroderma? My SC70 antibodies were very low so I am not too worried about those.\n\nAny advice is appreciated! I am following because I have a very similar situation. First rheumatologist was quick to diagnose me with scleroderma and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome. However all blood work was normal but based on clinical observation like yourself. Went for a 2nd opinion they do not think I have scleroderma but may have sjorgens even though blood tests are negative but I have never been given any meds by new dr so I am on nothing but restasis eye drops for my dry eyes. I have same symptoms as you but no skin ulcers (so far) and in addition I have fatigue, dry eyes, dry mouth and several lymph nodes that are inflamed but my inflammatory markers are normal. I am at a total loss myself as to what to do so that is why I am following (hope you do not mind) to see what others might have to say. \nA couple of questions if I may? Did your dr start you on any meds ? And if so what ones? And what does your skin hardening consist of? I swear my knees have it but my new rheumatologist does not seem to pay any attention when I mention it.  Depending on your ulcer location and the degree of skin thickening you may meet the conditions for a scleroderma diagnosis without any confirmatory blood tests. Check to see if you have been tested for \u201cRNAP III\u201d which is a more rare autoantibody that is specific for scleroderma. Happy to answer! So I also have severe fatigue (my first symptom, have had it since I was 18) and dry eyes and mouth. I always have slightly elevated CRP and I have insanely high cholesterol (probably hereditary) but everything else is clean as a whistle. I have had an ulcer on the nailbed of my index finger for months, but I have a bunch of weird skin conditions (several forms of eczema, granuloma annulare, chronic hives) so I will not know what it is until I get a biopsy. I only have a little tightening of the skin on my fingers- the skin is hard and reptile-like and my fingers get hard to bend and the skin cracks and bleeds a lot, but this might also be eczema. \n\nThe only meds I have been on were meloxicam and prednisone. Meloxicam was meh, prednisone REALLY helped for about 3 days and then I woke up one morning and all of my symptoms were back. Every doctor I go to says \"I THINK you have rheumatoid arthritis. I THINK you have scleroderma\"  Then nothing happens. I understand that it is a liability for them to misdiagnose someone so they are probably just waiting for some definitive proof, but damn it is been a long wait! I am 99% sure I have NOT had this test- I wonder if that will be my next test! Skin thickening is pretty mild. Getting a biopsy of the ulcer next month. I told my doctor that I would be excited to get a diagnosis and I asked him if that was weird and he said no, he would be excited too so we can start treating it! I am so sorry to hear about everything you are going through like I said I can definitely relate. The only thing elevated on me is my LDL and my %EOS. I have had the RNA III test as one person suggested below but literally had to beg for it since it was one of the only scleroderma blood tests they had not done, it was a 3 which is negative. If I am paying for the test I am not sure why Drs are reluctant to order. Especially if you want to say I have something. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f i was on prednisone as well low dose and Like you gave me some energy for a few days and a bit of a reprieve from my other symptoms but it was short lived so dr took me off. i am really hoping and praying that you get some answers.  \n\nEdited for typos This is the test that confirmed my scleroderma diagnosis (along with my physical presentation). It is called the RNA Polymerase III lab. Good Luck to you OP! Are we twins?? My LDL is sky high (286 at last count) and everything else is perfect so it messes up my total cholesterol. I think you and I are both in the early stages of something and it will take a lot of perseverance to get an answer unfortunately. Just do not give up! You can take breaks (I recently took a 5 month hiatus from doctors), but you HAVE to keep trying to figure it out! And make sure to take care of your mental health too \u2665\ufe0f Omg I swear we are twins! That is crazy! I agree with you we definitely have something going on (unfortunately) but no one can figure us out yet. I do appreciate the kind words about taking a break but not giving up on myself. That really means a lot. I hope you do not mind but I started following you so I can check in from time to time to see how things are going. Wishing you the best always! \u2764\ufe0f Consider seeing a functional medicine doctor who might treat you for inflammation that could give you relief from symptoms. Sometimes disparate symptoms that mimic specific diseases come up because our bodies are fighting inflammation that may be able to be reduced by diet. This is probably my next bet. Honest question (and please do not take offense), is functional medicine legit? Does is kind of fall into the realm of chiropractic medicine? Not saying I am opposed to it, one of my drs actually recommended it. It is legit but find an experience practitioner that knows about autoimmune diseases. I have had scleroderma 29 years, and been seeing functional medicine doc for 15 years. It is helped me stay healthy and have plenty of energy to volunteer with scleroderma foundation at 62 yo.

My Rheumatologist said I have a Connective Tissue Disease, but he did not know which one.

I do not want to scare my family by prematurely talking about SSc, but I need to talk to someone. \n\nI started having trouble swallowing a few months ago but I am not sure if it is fatigue or the early stages of esophageal dysmotility. I am worried that telling my rheumatologist could backfire and cause another doctor to shove Xanax down my throat, and ultimately slow my diagnosis. Anyway, I cannot control how much food/drink goes down at once and, other times, food/drink seems to bounce off the back of my throat. For those of you with esophageal dysmotility, I was wondering if this sounds like the early stages? Is it worth telling my rheumatologist about? \n\nI tend to only tell my doc about symptoms that are very atypical or particularly painful. I am wondering if there is anything else l might be overlooking as \"normal\" for me, that I should tell my doctor about?\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to help me! Hope you are all happy today :) Hey there. I am in a similar predicament with the dysmotility (dysphagia) issue. \n\nYes, tell your Rheumatologist everything.\n\nThe dysmotility hit me as one of the last symptoms to develop and one of the most stubborn to treat. \n\nPart of the problem is weakness/inflammation in the muscles and that valve in the esophagus connecting the stomach. As a result, I have GERD which also irritates and makes matters worse.\n\nI am on a PPI (dexilant) for the GERD and cellcept to manage scleroderma as a whole. After nearly two years of treatment, the dysmotility / esophageal issue that I mention has improved.\n\nPoor swallowing function has made me choke in the past and caused spontaneous regurgitation of some foods. It can be scary and should be actively managed medically. Thank you, this is very helpful! Yikes, that sounds both frustrating and scary. I am glad to hear you found a treatment that helps you!

I have had it since i was 13, it was dormant while i was in college but started up again around 23. I would heard not to get a tattoo as it *could* trigger it, but once i got morphea again anyway i decided screw it and got one. It healed great and caused no morphea around the site. It is been a few years now and instead of risking it over and over, I would like to get tattoos on my existing scars.

", "Crest I am 22 and I just had my blood work done, and the doctor called me saying he thinks I have CREST syndrome. He is referring me to a rheumatologist to be sure. I guess I just do not know what to expect, both from another doctor and from crest. I mean, I have researched but yeah. I am just nervous I guess. Is it the bloodwork alone that makes them think CREST? What is pointing to that exactly?\n\nI would not be too worried if that is all it is. So far it is the bloodwork (something with the ANAs) and the dr asked a few questions which seem to match me? \nI was recently diagnosed with chronic Uveitis (an eye infection) and that is usually (though not always) caused by an underlying disorder of some sort. Hence the blood work. I have had scaly patches of skin before and gastrointestinal issues so it is hard to say if it is right or as of now if I am being a paranoid hypochondriac. ANA alone just means there is potentially something in the realm of autoimmune-- does not mean it is CREST by any means; there are thousands of potential autoimmune diseases, some more serious than others. Multiple symptoms of scleroderma can overlap with dozens of other autoimmune diseases too. It takes lots of testing and very obvious signs to lead to a scleroderma diagnosis. \n\nYou are on the right path to work with a rheumatologist, but I would not worry about it being scleroderma until after you talk to the rheumy. After that, if your rheumy suspects scleroderma, schedule with a scleroderma specialist to be sure. Scleroderma is hard to diagnose-- the specialist will make certain of it if that is what is going on, or at least point you in a more accurate diagnosis if not.\n\nAlso, you would be an extreme outlier if you have CREST. I am in my early thirties, and my rheumy said I am a bit young for scleroderma. It is usually seen closer to 40. \n\nBest of luck to you. Scaly skin is not the same as skin thickening-- that could be a ton of other things. Skin thickening also does not just go away. GI symptoms are hard to link to scleroderma because there are so many other factors at play-- e.g., stress, diet, physical activity.\n\nDo not worry too much yet. See what rheumy says first. That is odd. I was diagnosed with DSSC in my 20\u2019s. Yeah-- do not get me wrong, it happens, it is just a rare outlier. So.. congratulations? jk Thanks No really unusual. Diagnosis in 30s and 40s is common. CREST now called Limited scleroderma by scleroderma specialists. Means primarily limited to skin on hand, feet and face. Tends to be slower progression than diffuse scleroderma. But, it effects everyone a little differently. Agree with person that suggested seeing a scleroderma specialist. There is a nail fold capillary sign that a knowledgeable rheumatologist will use to identify scleroderma. Best piece of advice on offer - do not overthink the possible diagnosis.  \nThere are no silly questions either - just ask away.  \nI was diagnosed with crest approx 6 yrs ago now. Worst part I find so far is the raynauds and skin splitting on my hands, but I just wear gloves a heck of a lot now. Thanks. I have pretty bad anxiety so I am trying not to overthink/jump ahead of myself. It is just kind of scary. \nHow did you handle it? I have had CREST, scleroderma for over 20 years. It is a strange diagnosis from your physician. Not something that can be seen at onset. Where do you live? Would like to help you find a rheumatologist that will help you calm your nerves.

It DOES happen and you are very lucky that your doctor is being thorough and sending you to a rheumatologist. Go to the rheumatologist and have them run more blood work. I do not think a physician is going to say you have CREST unless they ran the more detailed blood panels for that, so chances are you probably do have Scleroderma. \n\nIt IS scary, there is no doubt about it. Just try to keep in mind as you start googling and reading about this disease that how it affects you is going to be wildly different than others. Scleroderma is so unique to each person. I am so fortunate to not have any massive skin problems, but I do have internal complications from it. However, I live mostly a normal life and I have adapted to what I have needed to. I hold a job, I have a relationship, my life IS okay! If you want to talk I am 100% here feel free to message me anytime! And what if the doctor ran an ANA subset test? For a doctor to name it as CREST probably means they ran a subset ANA to figure out which autoimmune this person has. I know you are trying to be comforting in telling this person \u201cnot to worry\u201d but that in itself has its own damaging affects. \n\nIt is not that much of an outlier these days to be diagnosed in your 20s. I was. And more and more people are getting diagnosed earlier because doctors are now more aware of the disease. People were not diagnosed until their 40s and 50s probably due to lack of information. You are not a hypochondriac \u2764\ufe0f No-- I am saying not to worry until they talk to the rheumatologist. That is different. There is no need to work up into anxiety about having such a serious illness when it could literally be hundreds of other things--many of which could be far less serious-- based off the information shared.\n\nWorry and stress will only exacerbate symptoms and cause unnecessary distress that will not be addressed until they get into a rheumatologist, and we do not know how long of a wait OP will have.\n\nBesides, antibody tests have high false positive rates. The rheumy is going to retest. Mine did it 2x and even then did not think it was scleroderma until I went to a scleroderma specialist to rule it out, who repeated the test again and did the nail fold capillary test.\n\nOP likely has a long road to a diagnosis, and encouraging worry/anxiety would only make things worse.\n\nETA: Diagnosis is not typically seen in 20s, but yeah, it can happen. People sharing their anecdotal experience does not disrupt the trends in research for when symptoms begin. I did not develop signs until I was 31, which is still young from what my scleroderma specialist, i.e., an expert, said. Twenty is even younger. The number of people here saying that they are 20 and got the diagnosis is also a reflection of the fact that reddit trends younger--if you go to the FB scleroderma pages, it is primarily 40+. Those pages are also significantly more active with over a hundred thousand users, unlike here where there are only a little over a thousand people.\n\nYes, diagnosis early happens, but it is still very rare. That fact crossed with the diagnosis only coming off bloodwork and a couple symptoms is not accurate. There are a host of symptoms considered in diagnosis that are rated in a point system. I think this GP was irresponsible in suggesting any diagnosis at this stage, and that is why I am saying OP should not worry about having this diagnosis. That does not mean they should not take their health and symptoms seriously. I just would not spend a ton of time researching scleroderma.\n\nThe doctor naming CREST also is not updated on the research because they do not call it that anymore. I have an older GI doctor who referred to my DSSc as CREST, and that is not even the same subtype of scleroderma. I live in the Midwest but there are not many in my\nLocal area, so we are getting a referral to Mayo in Minnesota Thank you \u2764\ufe0f One of the reasons we see so many people diagnosed in their 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s is because it often takes 10-15 YEARS to get that diagnosis.  There are plenty of younger people with scleroderma. \n\nAlso, if they called it CREST, they are outdated. This term is not used anymore because it causes confusion with both doctors and patients.  A rheumatologist is definitely the right direction to go in if they think you have limited systemic scleroderma, but many rheumatologists have never treated a scleroderma patient. It is a rare disease. \n\nScleroderma is diagnosed clinically, and while blood work can play a part in that, it is the symptoms that are required for a diagnosis.  There are people who test positive for scleroderma antibodies and never have any symptoms, and there are people who clearly have scleroderma that never test positive for antibodies.  It is a complicated and confusing disease, which is why we need to be seen by a knowledgeable rheumatologist to be properly diagnosed. I live in MN! So let me know if you need any support. Will do! Thank you! Makes sense! \nI am waiting for a referral to a rheumatologist so I am hoping the doctor I get knows something about it, just to be on the safe side. And if not then they can at least figure out what is the deal This is really good information, OP. I know I was pretty direct in my response, but there is some extra context here that this user explained really well.\n\nIt sounds like you are very early in the process, and your GP did a disservice to you by naming CREST at this point. All that will do is make you worry unnecessarily because you could have a different autoimmune disorder that accounts for your symptoms that is less serious or even more easily treatable. Especially if you are one who tends to start reading about it. There is a lot of frightening information out there on the illness, but it is important to recognize that everyone is experience with it will vary widely and treatment has come a long way to help manage symptoms more effectively than even a decade ago.\n\nMy GP did the initial testing and told me there was not enough information to go on for a diagnosis, and I came back with notable RNA Pol-III antibodies on the first test, which is rare from what I learned from other patients and in the research. Typically it starts with a small number that increases with time, and the antibodies do not always show up on the first test from what my doc said. My rheumatologist did not even even mention the term scleroderma until the results came back a second time, and he was still not convinced I had it because we caught it early. It took another year before he felt like we should take a closer look and follow up with the specialist.\n\nIf you have a positive ANA alone, that is showing an increased inflammatory response. Did your doctor give you any recommendations to help with what you have going on while you wait for your rheumatology appt? There are tons of things you can do (e.g., dietary changes, supplements, physical activity) to help reduce inflammation in your body that could provide some relief from symptoms related to the inflammation, whether or not it is scleroderma. Currently I am working on dietary changes, both for this reason and for general health. I would be happy to talk more with you about different changes that could be helpful if you are interested. I did a deep dive on recommendations after I met with my first rheumatologist and got more info on scleroderma from the support groups, a couple dietitians, and my GI doctor. I took up crocheting - keeps my mind busy and it is quite a compact hobby so I can move it around the house (lounge and bed). Also took up drawing again. I have an exercise bike I try to use several days a week (fatigue permitting).   Basically, even when you do not feel like you could do anything, it is best to do something no matter how small.   Approx 18mths ago I was also diagnosed with two autoimmune liver diseases, so keeping busy with hobbies is the only way I cope. Just an FYI. I started a podcast for Scleroderma patients. It is called Mogils Mobcast. You can find it on both Apple Podcast and Spotify. I hope you will find it helpful. I have guests lined up through the end of the year.", "I am a 25 year old male and I have recently discovered that there is a strong chance I have been dealing this disease for years. I have Reynaulds syndrome, a chronic cough, frequent heart burn, and am always short of breath. My fingers get swollen and puffy in the mornings, I have these dark sores under the skin of my fingertips that hurt like hell when I bump them. I have never been to doctor for any diagnosis I never imagined that all the symptoms I deal with were connected to one disease. What steps should I take? What do I do now? Tell your doc your symptoms and be prepared with some scleroderma digital ulcer images to let them compare your fingers to. The dark sores sound exactly like my last ulcer flare up. Ask them to run blood tests for rheumatic diseases. I do not know if they will agree to it, but it may be worth it to you to find a doctor who will order them. My results from tests I listed below are what got me a confirmed diagnosis of limited systemic scleroderma. Also, here is a really great peer-reviewed resource that explains the tests and the results and what they mean.\n\n( \n\nC-Reactive Protein\n\nAntinuclear Antibodies \n\nANA Titer\n\nANA Pattern Legacy\n\nANA Path Review Legacy\n\nAnti-Centromere Antibodies\n\nComplement C4, Serum\n\nAnti-dsDNA Antibodies\n\nRheumatoid factor\n\nSed rate Get a referral to a good rheumatologist and stop reading.

I also was starting to get red spots on my face (telangiectasia) my heartburn was getting so bad I thought I had heart issues. I was freaking out one day looking up symptoms and found CREST Syndrome which is now called Scleroderma. \n\nI have been seeing a rheumatologist at the Cleveland Clinic for 15 years and I am 48 now. \n\nOver the past 2 years I have also developed PBC liver disease that is related to the autoimmune component of Scleroderma.  I was just told I have stage 4 fibrosis of the liver and cirrhosis (non alchohol related)\n\nScleroderma sucks bad.  And like all medical issues can really fuck with your mental well being. Please go to the Doctor and start a treatment plan. Get a physical and research what rheumatologists have Scleroderma patients in your area. You need a Dr. who is familiar with the disease. There are a bunch of Scleroderma forums on reddit, Twitter and FB. \n\nI believe my liver issues could have been caught earlier.  I would suggest also having your liver enzyme levels checked now and on a regular basis.\n\nI have never posted before, but this hit me hard and I thought it could have been  something I wrote 15 years ago.

So I am wanting to find out if anyone knows how likely it is to have an incorrect subtype diagnosis. I apologize in advance for how long this will be.\n\n\nWhen I was 2 ('92) I started showing signs of scleroderma on my stomach. My parents immediately started taking me to the doctor and after three years of trying to figure it out the local children's hospital levied the linear scleroderma diagnosis, and said I just kind of needed to live with it &amp; monitor it. \n\n\nI did, the scleroderma patches got bigger and bigger until they covered my entire left arm and several left fingers, a small patch on my right side, the left side of my stomach, and right at the base of my spine. Then, when I was about 16, it stopped and my skin softened considerably.\n\n\nFast forward a nine years and have not paid much attention to it the whole time. I did not have good insurance at that point in time, but I have been researching out of curiosity and I seem to see a theme that it is normal to expect scleroderma to come out of remission at the end of your twenties (based on the anecdotes I could find.) \n\n\nAs of last year I started to have to have occasional instances where my throat stops working somewhat while chewing, as if I lost strength. I go to the doctor, I am diagnosed with acid reflux (and yet I do not have heartburn..) and I never end up filling the prescription. Fast forward a little further, my hands have become extremely shaky, and sometimes I just drop things (coffee mugs or other cups are a good example, they will just fall out of my hands, and my hands cannot respond *at all* to prevent them from slipping - while I am clumsy, I have (had?) relatively good reflexes.. I never fall, etc). By this point I am pretty sure what is happening is the scleroderma coming out of remission.\n\n\nAs of two months ago, the outside of my left forearm has gone completely numb (as if with a local anaesthetic). As of this morning, I noticed the same happening on the left side of my face, underside of my chin extending down my neck - which is scary.\n\n\nI also should mention that I have recently been displaying POTS, my heart rate is never below 100, when I lay down it is 111, walking is 133..  while my blood pressure, when last measured, was 100/78 (and that is with me being on a medication that raises my BP. 4 months ago before I started, it was 88/68 I think?). My PT attempted to manually gauge my bpm, and he commented that it was extremely faint and had to try both wrists. He managed to clock it in at 110? And my feet often get painfully cold, despite when they are in socks, under blankets. They take hours to get warm, and fall asleep very easy - is this reynauds? My blood sugar is optimal, fyi. And I am slightly hypermobile - my neck pops out of place often and I have to push it back in place. My sister has ehlers danlos.\n\n\nI have been well aware I need to go to a rheumetologist (especially now that I have optimal insurance), and now that I have gotten through the mandatory OT season at work, I am working with a rheumatic disease center in my city to schedule an appointment asap (my work hours make it tricky, the doctor has to find a morning appointment when he does not have many). \n\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n\n-does this sound like it is entirely local, linear, scleroderma?\n\n-is it possible to have diffuse scleroderma misdiagnosed as linear?\n\n-has systemic scleroderma ever been misdiagnosed as local?\n\n-does this sound like diffuse?\n\n\nI swear I am not a hypochondriac. I have spent most of my life not being bothered by my disease because I figured since it was local, I just needed to be mindful. But all of these recent changes have me seriously concerned and I want to get a realistic outlook here. Are there things I am not considering, that I should be? I have combed through medical journals and anecdotes for the last year and nothing concretely squashes my fears, and many medical journals slightly conflict in the specific areas I have been focused on n\n\n\nThank you in advance if you read all of this. Any input here is greatly appreciated. I have localized scleroderma, or technically it is generalized. I just have morphea all over my arms and abdomen and sides. For me personally, I have terrible heartburn and I also have to cough and clear my throat a lot after eating until about 15 minutes or so has passed. Those two things are generally symptoms of systemic sclerosis. So it is possible to experience worrying symptoms w/o having the disease they are associated with. \n\nAlso, I am a 24 year old female and was diagnosed just 6 months ago, which is kind of uncommon. I never had any health issues growing up, let alone morphea. So you never really can tell. \n\nGoing to the doctor is the only way you can know for sure what is going on, because they will be able to order lots of blood work. \n\nIf I were you, I would start eating plant-based to battle inflammation within the body. You can look at nutritionfacts.org or on Nutition Facts YouTube channel and find the playlists and videos all about the best lifestyle changes and nutrition for autoimmune diseases. None of them are for scleroderma but they can work for us just as well. It is all about fighting the inflammation.  Thank you for your response. The plant based diet does sound like a good plan (&amp; while I have otherwise very good vitals according to my work biometric screening, my hdl cholesterol is only rated at a 40 (optimal being 46 I guess?) So I need more fiber)- I would imagine that reducing inflammation would help with the numb skin. I am fortunate enough in that my sister that I mentioned happens to be a massage therapist. Being that she has EDS, she is extremely focused on connective tissue issues, scar tissue, fascia, etc.. so I trust her assessments of what is going on, &amp; she is of the opinion that my nerve endings are simply shutting down in those areas because of how inflamed/tight/etc those areas of my skin are. She will be retiring from massage in 5 years or so due to EDS but I am grateful to have her skill until then.\n\n\nI am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Being diagnosed at 24 must have been hard; it was hard enough being around little kids as I came to terms with it at 5-6yoa, I cannot imagine discovering it at this point. I do not know that I have the need for  throat clearing like you describe; I just will be eating something, and my throat will just stop being able to swallow and I will have a momentary panic and think \"well, I guess this is how I go...\" Every time.\n\n\nI am definitely looking forward to my doctor's appointment. I pretty much was just waiting for the mandatory OT to end at work - I am in retirement finance, so end &amp; beginning of year is crunch time for us. Originally I was able to nail down an appointment for 3/5, but the doc just had to cancel yesterday &amp; I am still waiting for him to provide me with replacement dates. It is kind of agonizing, because I just want to sit down and discuss this with someone... Getting the whole picture helps me stay calm.\n\n\nIn my case, while I knew something was up with me as a kid, I did not know it was specially scleroderma, just that I went to the doctor a lot, tried a lot of steroid creams (I still cannot deal with the feelings of most lotions..) &amp; even a vitamin D ointment. My parents were terrified of bringing it up with me, since they did not have conclusive data.. so I did not know that what I had was scleroderma for an embarrassingly long time. My dad could only stomach telling me when he found an article referencing successful medical treatments. I am frustrated they did not tell me, but I imagine their position must have been difficult. They did not know whether they should tell me I am just affected, or potentially dying. I do not know what I would do in their shoes.", "4 Videos with Skin Care Tips for Scleroderma Patients ", "Want thoughts from the community Recently diagnosed with scleroderma. I wad told it was just in my hands and quote \"not the scary kind but good job for coming in.\" My hands do not have any problems right now but mild pain and sensitivity to heat and cold. I refused medication (I cannot take it  at the moment anyway) and then I get a call from the nurse saying that because I refused medication they want to do a ct scan on the lungs, pulmonary blow test and ekg. I said why do I need this done if it is \"just in my hands and not the scary kind\" why do I need all of this done. She said oh they just want a baseline for the future. I said why do I need this if it just localized or are you unsure if it is really localized. She repeated her answer. I do not have the time or money for the tests and I feel like I am being screwed with now because I am refusing medication. So the doctor can get money for the tests. I ended up getting the ct scan and it was normal as I suspected and they still want me to get the other tests done and still cannot answer my simple questions that I stated above and my question of okay so if that was normal does it mean that it is likely just in my hands and do I really need the others. The other tests cannot be scheduled until this next year and will be expensive for me even with insurance. I do not know much about localized scleroderma. I know with systemic, it is recommended to test organ functioning early because if organ involvement occurs, it happens rapidly and early. If I were you, I would request the most recent visit summary to confirm what diagnosis they gave you. Do you know what made them give you that diagnosis? Hand pain and raynaud's can occur in other disorders too, especially if you are not seeing skin thickening, which you did not mention in your post. Crest scleroderma was my diagnosis. I also have gerd. I have very little skin thickening. That is not localized then-- CREST is systemic scleroderma, which can have organ involvement. It sounds like you have limited systemic instead of diffuse. Diffuse is the one with high likelihood of renal crisis and organ involvement--hence being \"the scary one,\" but limited systemic can still impact organ functioning. \n\nSo, yes, you should get the tests. Pulmonary function tests are usually recommended every 6 months and echocardiogram is annually, as well as lab work to screen kidney proteins.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomeone posted ( on another post recently, and I found it really helpful in explaining the different types. Okay but could not it be Limited Systemic Cutaneous Sclerosis then? Limited Systemic Sclerosis does not seem to fit if my ct scan was normal FYI it is not really called crest anymore and called limited systemic scleroderma. While it is only in your hands now, in the future there is a high probability of it involving your organs, GI tract, esophagus, skin, hair, etc. I am 35 and it started in my toes with hardly any involvement like you shortly after I had my second child 8 yrs ago and since then it is gotten so much worse. The scar tissue from my c section grew so much I had an ectopic pregnancy and my tube blew out I had to have emergency surgery. I had my gallbladder removed and same thing... scar tissue from the surgery grew and blocked my bile duct and I got really really sick and had to surgery to fix it. The scar tissue growth was due to limited scleroderma. My second toe is constantly swollen so much it feels like it is going to pop it is so painful it is purple and gross. My hair is falling out like crazy and my scalp is flaky, my esophagus is narrowing so much it is painful to swallow I need to get it stretched. I have had diverticulitis. My joints hurt all the time. \n\n\nThe point is.... you may feel fine now but they need a baseline and then every so often you go and get rechecked out to see how the disease is progressing and to make sure they catch everything early so it can be taken care of. And the meds help to slow down the progression of the disease. The best time to take is now and you can take the immunosuppressant if you are pregnant or nursing according to my dr and the research I have seen. Those are both the same thing. CT scan can be normal in limited patients, especially if you are in early stages. The connective tissue thickens over time to impact arteries/veins, which is what damages the organs. The disease progresses differently for everyone. You may never have organ involvement, but that does not mean you should not get tested to monitor for it so you can get treatment early. Proactive and preventative treatment is best (and cheaper) long-term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it was localized, then you would not have GERD symptoms--that is a sign of organ involvement with your GI system. Okay, I have had GERD for years though. I do not have issues with it now and when I got my intestines checked previously they were fine. Well damm my hair is like that as well but also wondering if it is due to lack of ability to shower due to baby Look, you are going to do what you are going to do. I am not here to convince you one way or the other. I do not know your medical history, and you gave very little info to give you recommendations than would be better than what your doctor says. They know you. If you do not trust your doctor or you are pissed at them, find a new one or get a second opinion. Chances are the new one will order the same tests and medications for you.\n\nSystemic scleroderma is serious and can be fatal if unchecked. That is the reality of the diagnosis. If you want to put off testing until you start having symptoms, that is your decision. Just know it will be more costly long-term if you end up needing breathing treatments, dialysis, or organ transplants if it gets serious. I am only naming that since you seem to be pretty focused on the cost of these tests.\n\nIf you want to do something preventative relatively cheap, then start checking your blood pressure 3x a week at home with a reliable monitor. I got mine for $50 from omron--you may even look to see if your insurance would cover any of that because some do. If you start seeing spikes over 140/90, then call your doctor ASAP to check your kidneys with a urinalysis and get on the medication because you are likely facing renal crisis, which is deadly. You may never need that, but there is no way to know because the disease course is random for everyone. I got diagnosed with localized Scleroderma in my legs at age 13 and that is pretty much where it is stayed (at almost 25 now). My rheumatologist told me it is pretty rare for organ involvement to occur with that particular type, but because the nature of scleroderma can be unpredictable, they still like to run rests to make sure it is not progressing further. Like, at the most they just want me to get blood work done every year, a heart echo/spirometer test done every 5 years (as long as I am not having problems and need one sooner), and a MRI every couple of years to see how the existing scar tissue is looking. I understand the frustrations regarding insurance, because you do not want to get I necessary testing done and be stuck with that bill. I would be annoyed too, and I think your dr should have been transparent about how it is just an unpredictable disease and they want to make sure it does not progress to any other places.\n\nNote: the frequency that your dr wants routine testing done will depend on the type of scleroderma and other factors. Mine came and did much of the damage in childhood and has not really evolved since then - which is why I do not get testing done as often as some others might. Did you get the test for autoantibodies?\n\nCan you tell us a little more about your medical history and the physician who is treating you - are they independent? They are trying in money. If the blood test was negative, I do not see why you should stay there. After all, something else could be causing Raynaud\u2019s and you could seek a second opinion for an explantation. I do not know if this will help you or not. I apparently have the \"hands and feet only\" version and they did the whole set of tests, and a couple more you did not mention on me.\n\nThe thing is I live in Canada, and the province pays the bills. In my experience doctors here try and limit unnecessary tests to avoid spending the provinces money. With scleroderma I have come to realize my General Practitioner is actually more like a gate keeper to the provinces purse strings, she will not ask for a test unless she is very sure there is a problem. I am assuming my Rheumatologist is the same way.\n\nThis probably will not help you much since I genuinely would not be surprised if there were doctors in the US that got kickbacks from hospitals, but even in Canada which tries to avoid testing if at all possible I was asked to do those tests.

Its also affecting one of my thighs a little. But my stomach and breast are almost back to normal and it all started for me about 1.5 years ago(The skin hardening ) and I am 42 years old. I have had other symptoms starting with raynauds about 6 years ago. My skin is very dry all the time also my lips are always peeling and my eyes are red because they are dry too. Everyones disease manifest in different ways  and according to the type of scleroderma you have. Im not sure that I make sense right now. I am sorry I cannot keep my thoughts straight I hope this helps! I have all the indicators of blood tests, and MRI, but my doc dismissed because I did not have Raynaud's and I am pretty \"flexible\" (double jointed) but now IDK if it is because of stress I am having Raynaud's episodes and having those little spots of subcutaneous hardening, tanks for the help! I did not knew that they could soften again, this is good, I have some spots like those you said, it makes perfect sense, my skin is extremely dry and my lips are flaky too, also I was taking oil pills to get better lacrimation \"quality\" because my eyesight is getting worse and my doc think that is because of scleroderma....\n\nThank you for the help, i was really freaking out My eyesight is getting worse too, well somedays are better than others. So my blurred vision does not seem like its permanent either.  I  use Carmex on my lips and occasionally I rub them with a little bit of sugar with a drop of water to exfoliate. For my skin  I use that Jergens lotion that  you put on while your skin is  still wet  after a shower  seems to help alot with keeping my skin hydrated. I think that if your skin hardening is limited to your hands that it is more permanent . I am so glad I could help ease your worries. \ud83d\ude0a I see what you mean. As far as symptoms go, it looks like Reynauds came later. If that is your doctors doubt, then you could revisit this.\n\nFor myself,  body aches and Reynauds were the first symptoms. I also thought it was stress related and was told that, Reynauds is absolutely not a normal reaction. &gt;body aches\n\nThis is my life every 24/7", "Facial Care and Hyperpigmentation I have been wanting to take better care of my skin. I do not wash my face everyday for fear that I will over do it and irritate it. I do not know if that is right. Does anyone have any tips for taking care of your skin? How often do you wash your face and what products do you use? I have also been developing hyperpigmentation on my arms and do not know what I can do to avoid it. My scars on my arms and legs have started to leave permanent marks darker than my skin tone. I wash my face and body every other day with goats milk soap. Huge difference in my \"scaly\" skin symptoms. I use a brand called Zumbar and the type I use is Dragons blood. As far as the scaring and discoloration, It does not really bother me as I have always had scars and stuff but Vitamin E might help you there. Awesome thank you so much! No problem  I highly recommend watching Dr. Dray on YouTube. She is got several videos on hyperpigmentation and is very knowledgeable (she is a dermatologist). I have learned more from her videos than all my dermatologists over the last decade.  Cool I will check her out! Thanks!", "New Diagnosis I was recently diagnosed with connective tissue disease. My Rheumatologist said it was probably Scleroderma, but he was hesitant to give a specific diagnosis because I do not show the typical symptoms. \n\nI am a 30 year old man. I have had a chronic cough and shortness of breath for about 4 years. The cough is my main symptom. I cannot tell where the cough originates. It feels like it could be coming from my lungs and my throat. It took 9 doctors to diagnose me. After my first pulmonologist could not find anything wrong, I went to other doctors looking for other causes. Eventually one of my doctors ordered a test for autoimmune diseases after I showed him my purple fingers.  \n\nI am ANA IFA positive. Positive for SCL-70 antibody (&gt;8 H). ANA titer is 1:320. ANA pattern is homogeneous.\n\nI need someone to talk to. I do not tell my friends or coworkers how sick I am. I pretend my symptoms do not bother me. My parents are uneducated and do not understand any medical information I tell them. They do not have the emotional maturity to deal with my illness. My mother thinks there is nothing wrong with me and that I am just coughing when I am around her to piss her off. I do not know anyone else with this disease. I have recently started treatment and I do not know what to expect. I feel alone.\n\nI have had very mild skin issues and they are not persistent. They come and go. There is a spot on my hand that gets dry and flaky and it is a little discolored. Sometimes the skin around my mouth will get a little dry and flaky. The skin issues do not bother me.\n\nI have had no soreness or joint problems. I am paranoid that any stiffness or soreness could be the onset of debilitating arthritis. I have had no hair loss. I have had no blood pressure issues. I had an echocardiogram. My heart is healthy. \n\nI might have fatigue. My symptoms have developed gradually. I do not really know what my normal healthy fatigue level is, so it is hard to tell.\n\nMy lung function is 53%. My (third) pulmonologist observed scarring and inflammation in my lungs. He could hear my lungs crackling with the stethoscope. He had me elevate the head of my bed. I do not feel disabled. It feels like my breathing is more shallow and I get winded more easily than I should. I can do cardio exercises at a good pace, but my breathing feels shallow and rapid. \n\nI had an endoscopy. My esophagus showed damage and inflammation. My ENT thought it was acid reflux damage. I have tried Omeprazole with no effect. My Gastroenterologist did a PH study and stomach scope. He did not think that I have reflux, but now I am skeptical because acid reflux is a common symptom of Scleroderma. I do not have difficulty swallowing, but I clear my throat a lot. It feels like my cough might originate from mucus in my esophagus, but I have not responded to any nasal drip sprays.  \n\nI have Raynaud\u2019s syndrome, but that is a more recent development, I have shown symptoms about a year or so. My fingers turn purple when cold, like when I am at the grocery store. I do not have any sores on my fingers.  \n\nMy doctors put me on Cellcept, 1,500 mg daily. The plan is to just wait and see what happens. I have increased to 1,500 mg gradually over the last 3 weeks. I am still coughing, but less frequently. In the last couple days it feels like it is gotten slightly harder to breathe. Otherwise I have not noticed any changes in my condition.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience using Cellcept for treatment of respiratory issues? How long did it take to see an improvement in symptoms?\n I think you will get a lot more responses and help if you go over to  in the scleroderma foundation support community. Lot of knowledge over there.  will check it out First off, I am sorry about your diagnosis. My mother is battling scleroderma right now, so I know how scary it can be, albeit not first hand.\n\nSo, I have some experience with breathing issues that took me forever to find help for, and actually ended up finding help because of other issues I was having (full body pain 24/7). I will do my best to explain it well, but it is complicated if I go into too much detail, to say the least, so I will try to keep it brief.\n\nShallow and rapid breathing is not limited to those with disease. Imagine taking a long balloon that they use to make balloon animals. Pretend the balloon is your torso. Blow up that balloon all the way. Notice how the entire balloon fills with air. Now let the air out and pinch off the balloon 3/4 of the way up. Blow it up now and you will notice that the air can only fill the top 1/4 of the balloon. That is what shallow breathing is like; only filling part of the chest cavity.\n\nYou diaphragm contracts downwardly, not outwardly, so when you breathe, the air is supposed to go down into the belly and pelvis area. If you have developed one of the patterns I briefly mentioned, due to how this pattern works, your diaphragm is not in a position where it can contract downwardly and you end up only breathing shallowly. In fact, your diaphragm is likely working like a back muscle, to stabilize you.\n\nHere is an easy, albeit not perfect way of figuring out if you have one of these patterns (works best if you do not have a lot of fat on you, but if you are pretty heavy, it would indicate to me that you are highly likely to have one of the patterns working against you). Take your shirt off and stand facing a mirror. Under your pecs, do you see one or two \"rib boobs\"? These are your ribs just sticking out a bit, rather than being flush with your abs. Right under your sternum (chest bone), your ribs flare out to the sides. Is the angle that they form where they meet at the sternum &gt;90\u00ba when you exhale?\n\nIf you see those \"rib boobs\" or \"rib flares\" popping out under your pecs, even if its just on one side (the left usually), then you are going to have breathing dysfunction because your diaphragm cannot do it is job properly. Do you find yourself sighing frequently? That is a good sign that this may be a problem. Basically what happens when your body gets stuck in this pattern is that you cannot breathe into your back or abdomen properly, so you can only expand through the front of your chest (at least if you have rib flares on both sides, its a little different if it is just the left side that is flared), and sometimes even this is hard because of tight pecs (shoulders rounding forward is often a good sign of this) restricting the movement of the ribs. This keeps your ribs in a constant state of inhalation and you cannot fully exhale all the air out of your lungs.\n\nOther signs that you have got this going on in one form or another:\nLow back pain\nShoulder pain\nHip pain\nGroin pain\nSexual dysfunction/pain\nTalking fast/rushed, often accompanied with finding it hard to get enough air in to do so.\nTight hips\nTrouble emptying bowels completely and/or frequent constipation\nInability to get comfortable (and more difficult to breathe) while laying flat on your back (ribs pop/flare out even more in this position, and this is where it was always worst with me)\nNeck tension (shoulders often rise on inhalation? that is no good)\n\nI have a chronic cough, myself, and it gets 10-50x worse if my ribs are popping, as does my breathing difficulty, exhaustion level, irritability level, etc.\n\nJust a thought. Feel free to DM me if this sounds like something you have got going on and I will help you find someone to treat you. It is fixed with somewhat complex (at first), yet quite simple exercises, that help you get out of the bad pattern you have developed and get your body working a LOT better and more efficiently. I heard about one guy who was pretty heavy and lost 20-30 pounds in a few months just by getting his diaphragm and ribs functioning properly again (fat burns into CO2, which is expelled through the lungs). It is amazing stuff.\n Thanks. Will look into this.", "Immune suppressors ", "My YouTube channel \n\nI saw someone here talking about a podcast they host.\n\nSo I thought \"why not promote my channel?\".

", "Struggling This goes all the way back to 2006! I received a positive ANA (1:160 speckled) and a positive SCL70 (86 using the multiplex method). The thing is, I have no evidence of the disease. I have no symptoms except for fatigue. I had my heart and lungs looked at, no issues. It is now been almost 15 years later and I have just been chugging along. \n\nI go back tomorrow for some other tests. I am looking to see if I can get my testing redone using the lab out in LA but it seems that it was bought by labcorp. \n\nDoes anyone have any hints/suggestions/assistance? You do not know how encouraging this is to hear. I am 4 years post blood work diagnosis. I have some low level Raynaud's, pain, and fatigue, but no morphea or tissue change.  I always wonder how long this is going to last; maybe I will have years like you! \n\nI do not really know, but I would suspect part of it is that being able to diagnose from lab results and not from morphea is letting us know a lot earlier that things MIGHT happen.  I take this from information from a doctor regarding a different diagnosis; however, I think this might apply here, too.  My scleroderma specialist even told me that in my life time I might never see more than Raynaud's symptoms. \n\nI do not have advice on redoing the blood work, but I wanted to thank you for sharing! Good luck to you! It is quite frustrating to wonder if the \u201cother shoe\u201d will ever drop. I am interested in getting my SCL 70 retested using the method that is more accurate considering the one that I used has an 80% or more false positive rate. I had about 10 vials of blood taken today so hopefully I can get a bigger picture of everything going on. I basically stopped going to doctors years ago because no one had answers. But I am very tired as the days go on. Some low level joint pain and muscle pain but in general it is the fatigue. I am so glad there is a more accurate test and hope you find some answers. \n\n I had a appointment yesterday and used these exact words with the PA as I once again explained that my blood pressure is always high in office because ever since my original diagnosis I am always waiting for \"the other shoe to drop\". She looked at me with such sympathy! I was so impressed when she actually said she was not really aware of what systemic Scleroderma fully entailed! I told her as a PA for a Neurologist that was just fine, but when it is your local Rheumatologist it is a different story! Of course, this led into explaining that I need records sent to a specialist hours away.  Ah, Life! \n\nI truly hope your test comes back with the best of news!!", "Symptoms changing due to weather ? Hi! I am fairly newly diagnosed. I live in Minnesota where the weather changes drastically and I feel like I am prone to feeling crappier with those changes.  Specifically humidity.  I just feel so awful, I am getting spots on my face.  Is this something anyone else notices? Hey fellow Minnesotan! It sure does suck living here with scleroderma, does not it? My Raynaud's is pretty severe so yeah I am basically confined indoors unless it is over 65 with no breeze. My fingers get really puffy in the summer but not so much in the winter. So far that is what I have been dealing with for the last few years. Hi! I also live in MN. The weather is tough when you have Scleroderma. My hands are very much affected by it. What kind of Scleroderma have you been diagnosed with? I have limited or otherwise known as CREST. I have the spots on my face. They are the T in crest. Telangiectasia. It is kind of like spider veins on your face. I have to wear makeup all the time. I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years. I can answer a lot of questions too. Hello, fellow warrior! While I am in North East Texas, the weather changes here most definitely affect me significantly. Whether it is humidity, cold, raining, or super hot, as it gets so so hot in Texas. I feel it in every joint in my body. And the swelling in my hands, knees, ankles/feet, and face get worse. It kind of feels like I have gotten hot by a semi truck when the weather changes. I do not get the spots on my face though. At least I do not think I do? It usually takes me several days to get through it and back to \u201cmy normal\u201d which is still swollen in all of those places with the joint pain as well, just not as severe. Flare ups, aside from the weather induced ones, feel even worse. Even if I remain indoors most of the time, the weather/barometric pressure changes affect me, so there is no escaping it unfortunately. I know it is not just the scleroderma that is reacting, but also the rheumatoid arthritis, Reynaud\u2019s, lupus, and fibromyalgia that I have working against me. I try to ease the pain and swelling with ice packs, CBD creams, essential oil pain blends, and just rest. I am so sorry you deal with this too. I hope you find something to help ease the pain and discomfort! Prayers for you! \ud83d\ude4f What essential oil blends do you use? The pain relief recipe I use is as follows: \n\nCarrier Oil is necessary and can be Fractionated Coconut Oil, Grapeseed Oil, or Avocado Oil. I find that the Grapeseed Oil absorbs better into the skin and does not leave a greasy feeling. \n\nIn a 10 ml glass roller bottle (must be glass-link below) put the following essential oils in the bottle first: \n8 drops of Panaway (Young Living exclusive oil. If you do not have this you can substitute with Eucalyptus Oil)\n5 drops of Copaiba Oil\n5 drops of Lavender Oil\n5 drops of Peppermint Oil\n5 drops of Frankincense Oil\n\nThen add the carrier oil until the bottle is full. Note that this amount of drops is just for the 10ml roller bottle. If the bottle is bigger, the amount of drops increases. \n\nUse as needed in any areas with pain. You can roll it on then leave it to soak in or you can rub it in. It provides me with a few hours of pain relief at a time usually. Be sure to keep it away from your eyes and mouth. Discontinue use if you see any kind of bad reaction to the oils like redness, itching, or welts on the skin. You could do a test spot first and wait a few hours to see if there is any reaction before you use it anywhere else. \n\nLink for the 10ml glass roller bottle on Amazon: Vivaplex, 6, Cobalt Blue, 10 ml Glass Roll-on Bottles with Stainless Steel Roller Balls - .5 ml Dropper Included \n\nYou can also find the carrier oils on Amazon as well as the individual essential oils, but I have been ordering my oils from REVIVE because they have awesome prices! \n\n\n\nYou can search for other essential oil recipes on Pinterest! There is tons of them! I love using the essential oils for many different things! I hope this helps! And I hope I do not get in trouble for posting links and the recipe! \ud83d\ude2c", "Awaiting Diagnosis Hello there. I am currently waiting for diagnosis.since August 2020,  I have  oesophageal issues....swallowing and dysmotility, joint pain, fatigue, weakness in legs. Sound familiar to anyone? Sounds very familiar to me and my daughter.  Our family has a huge scleroderma problem in my family, a real autoimmune problem.  Two aunts with Lupus, one Aunt with RA and 19 cousins with Scleroderma and my sister has MS.    My main problem is the esophageal issues, swallowing problems and Raynauds Syndrome. Thanks for replying. My daughter has juvenile Dermatomyositis so that is why the docs think autoimmune. I had an endoscopy yesterday and they took biopsies.  They did say there was evidence of reflux but the PPIs do nothing for me. Gosh that is a huge genetic/hereditary component for your family. I hope you get answers soo", "Accidental improvement with a medication combo. I was having some pretty serious vascular complications. (Also GI issues, skin problems, and muscle involvement)  \n\n\nDoctor A put my on hydroxychloroquine as an immunomodulator. I started on aspirin therapy for blood clotting with doctor B. Doctor C put me on amlodopine to help with circulation.   \n\n\nThe vascular surgeon is \\*really\\* happy with my circulation right now. And I feel better in that department than I have in years. She believes that the combination of the hydroxychloroquine and the aspirin is acting as a fantastic anti-inflammatory. The hydroxychloroquine alone did not give me the results. I was on aspirin therapy in the past and that did not work for my circulation by itself. It is the combo. The touch of amlodipine completed the formula.  \n\n\nAll of the pain in my legs is gone and that was a daily agony that I would fought for years. Swelling is better. The flushing in my face and chest is improved. I am having fewer Renaud's attacks.  \n\n\nNow I have been doing a keto/carnivore diet off and on for this year, too. Again, I tried this in the past and it was not the holy grail either. Cutting back on fiber definitely helps my GI problems and it is very clear when I overdo it.  \n\n\nThe doctor thinks that we have got a sweet spot combination that is proving beneficial.   \n\n\nJust thought I would share. We have so few things that seem to work.  \n\n\n(I am also doing an experiment with a dietitian to work on the calcification, so we will see how that works. So far, so good.) I am glad to hear you are doing well on this combination.  Do you have limited scleroderma, or diffuse?  I would also like to know this.\n\nGlad to hear this is working for you!! I am allergic  to aspirin unfortunately. On plaquenil right now but not noticing much change. \n\n That is funny because I went on amlopadine for my blood pressure about a month before I went on plaquenil (same as you take, I am just too lazy to type the generic name). Just not the aspirin. So far I am not feeling much. It is been two months. I think the joint and muscle aches are not as bad, but not enough for me to be positive and jump for joy. I still have some days where I am in pain, but they seem to be further between than it was before. The biggest improvements were with the neuropathy and Reynaud's. I was on the amlopadine and the plaq (I am not spelling it out, either. lol!) for about four months before the aspirin was added. That was the game-changer.\n\nTwo, tri-buffered aspirin two times a day.\n\nVery little has put a dent in that all-over ache. Eating pure carnivore made a huge difference. But that ripped my guts apart. I am trying to figure out a way to go back to it because it did help.\n\nHot baths and my hot tub also help me get by, but it is got to be pretty often. Weather permitting, I will get in my hot tub 3-5 times a day. Each time buys me about two hours of life. Not realistic if a person wants to have a freaking job or live any kind of life at all, but if I am at home, I will do it.\n\nHas *anything* helped with the ache for you? That is got to be the worst part for me. Even worse than the digestive problems. I think when I do not eat right and/or forget to take my probiotics, my aches get worse. \nI am trying to eat a non-inflammatory diet but it is super hard to never ever have a glass of wine or piece of bread, for example. Especially when I am out with other people or at their house.\nI cannot take baths because it dehydrates my skin. The skin on my legs is so dry it hurts. I moisturize several times a day. Epsom salts did help the aches when I did take baths though :(\nI will try the aspirin thanks for the tip! Just one quick tip.\n\nBaths jack up my skin, too. So I add about 1/4-1/2 cup oil to the tub. I am using olive oil right now. I have got some emu oil a friend sent me that I am going to try next. \n\nAnything but mineral oil works. Mineral oil has actually been implicated in scleroderma flares.\n\nIt seems like the oil is just sitting on top of the water, but it does get all over your body. When you get out, just buff off with a towel. The oil locks the moisture in and does really help with the rash. I do sometimes use oil with epsom salts for the spasms.\n\nI cannot use soap on my legs at all. The skin is much too sensitive. But the oil helps enough that, even after a shower, I will spread some oil on the bad areas right before I get out. Just leave it.\n\nThis works better than any moisturizer or lotion that I have ever tried.\n\nBefore the oil, I was in trouble. I had another issue that required several baths a day and it was killing me. This does appear to cut down on the flares on my legs at least.\n\nGood luck to you.\n\nAnd if you have ANYTHING, please share it. Modern medicine seems pretty baffled, so we have to keep trying and spread what works and what does not. Oh! And I need to confirm.\n\nProbiotics screws up my entire system completely, as well. I have totally given up on them. They make me generally sick and trigger a flare.\n\nAs for the diet... I will eat any diet if it works. Carnivore did more to help my overall disease, but my guts were so destroyed that I could not leave the house. For a solid month.\n\nAbout a week ago I got bitter and threw it all out the window. Started eating whatever. \n\nGuts are fine. \n\nBut I am having a flare right now and I am sick as a dog all over. smh\n\nIf it worked all the way around, I could stick with it. But to be deprived and to only trade one hell for another is too much. \n\nI am going to keep trying. I have to. Thanks so much for the tips. I would heard about emu oil and forgotten. The probiotics definitely work for me, but that may be because my gut was the main thing acting up due to the sclero. I get these medical grade ones called visbiome. Pretty expensive so if they are not something that helps you, you probably do not want to do that.

(Now so severe, only drug that controls is Omeprazole, no other ppi s work) Renauds severity has varied over the years. Mid 50s - back of hands developed bumps, severe itching. lasted most of a year, nothing helped. no recurrence. Past year, began with severe swelling of ankles and feet, severe toenail changes, intense itching and ongoing nail loss, hard whitish patches. Then what I thought, mosquito bites on swollen feet, ankles and lower calves (Became swollen as well). would begin to heal and flare up to intense itching and intermittent stinging (like being poked with toothpicks) Fingers periodically looked like sausages with limited movement, knee pain upon step climbing and standing from sitting finger tips covered in white bumps, resulting in callused fingers and toes, \"acne looking\" bumps on face, neck, (now 60 y.o, no acned history). bumps filed with thickish substance which oozed immediately after pooping  (also on toes). intense itching on scalp. feels bumpy. severe sensitivity to heat (former sun goddess, olive skin). after several months of TORTURE, all symptoms began to fade. now, facial bumps recur, scalp itch, and loss of strength in general but finger grasping is noticeably impacted. FINALLY went to PCP, normal blood work, is referring me to Rheumatologist. Sorry for this long discription, PCP  thinks rheumatoid. I researched every autoimmune for months. Scleraderma was 99+% match. Still waiting for Rheumatologist appt. Question: although RELIEF, most symptoms have subsided. Medical ancillary career causes me to research and research. Looked up remission and got poor answers. Actually symptom remission, if autoimmune, I know that is not curable.

Hello everyone, I have been having symptoms which match what Google has been telling me about Scleroderma, but there are reasonable alternative explanations. I am worried and would gladly know more about the disease, specially about how common are symptoms to start in an asymmetrical form (right hand only).  \n\n29M, history of nail pitting (symmetrical) and very localized skin psoriasis  (5y ago), both went into remission and very occasionaly show up in a mild form (HLAB27 neg). Greatparent with spondylitis. I have started showing Raynaud's phenomenon 2 months ago (but this is my first time in a truly cold climate, so I do not know if I always had it, I always had cold hands and low resistance to holding cold things).  \n\n Had an annoying cut right above tip joint of right hand's middle finger, this led me to keep my hand sort of still for some weeks, otherwise the cut would never heal.  \n\n Suddenly presented red, painless swelling of the middle joint of ring finger (that is, a different finger). This went on to affect pinky and middle fingers some days later, the back of the hand became puffy and red too (but only the region near affected fingers). No pain whatsoever, some itchness, specially at night. Index finger absolutely normal.  \n\n GP asked for a blood test, I have not seen the results yet, but he said they looked absolutely normal, including autoimmune markers (not sure if it would show up as high CRP). GP prescribed antibiotics just to be sure, as hand is extremely dry and full of cracks (cold weather + hand sanitizer frenzy). The swollenness and redness went away within a week (not sure if because of the AB, because I decided to start moving the hand more, or natural course of disease).  \n \n  Now I have a hand that is not swollen but that I cannot make a fist with, moving the tip joints make me feel as if my skin is going to tear apart. The site above the middle finger cut has a flaky appearance. There are things pointing at scleroderma (Raynauds, swollen hand, skin tightness). But alternative explanations too (Raynaud might have been there forever, swollen hand could be superficial infection due to skin cracks and hand left still for a while, skin tightness could be weeks without moving hand very much, very dry hand, and a cut that is slowly healing right around the middle finger joint, the fact that the index finger is normal points at this I suppose?).\n\n So I will only be able to see a rheumy in January. The only fact that seems absolutely clear is that this is asymmetrical, so, this is why I would like to ask you: is it common/possible for the disease to develop assymetrically in some of its iterations (Localized/Systemic)? If yes, which one? This fact seemed to leave the GP puzzled, he was not expecting asymmetry in whichever diagnosis he was thinking about. \n\n Thank you for any kind of information and sorry for the long text.", "Tested positive only for AntiScl-70 (3.7) but negative for ANA (&lt;1) Having a bit of a freak out so would appreciate the help in answering my questions from anyone educated in the area. Im 28 and male if that matters. I have spent the past 5 years of my life working on finishing my degree and I have just secured my first contract with a client for my startup - I have finally hit traction. I am scared I will not even be alive long enough to see my company grow or meet someone and have a family. \n\nI was referred to the neurologist weeks ago as I have had issues with my muscles activating, feelings of tiredness, and unexpected muscle soreness. This has caused a wide variety of issues over the past few months. When I am at the gym, it almost feels like my muscles do not flex - as if I cannot activate them. more recently, I have had trouble swallowing. I also have been getting pain in my hands and forearms that has worsened over the past 12 months. My fingers are also starting to bend inwards. I am cold all the time, like freezing, and often have to wear multiple sweaters or my hands and feet start to get cold and hurt. Lastly, my legs are crazy dry and itchy all the time. I find it odd I was referred to a neurologist over a rheum with these issues\n\nThey ordered labs and I just saw my lab values, then made the mistake of googling what anti-scl70 was associated with and now I am sitting here having a mini panic attack. I have read that the type that exist vary in life expectancy, but most people with a negative ANA and positive antiSCL70 have the diffuse and dangerous scleroderma. I have also noticed my symptoms have come on quickly and It has made healthy activities like running and working out painful for me. Can someone please tell me if this anti scl could be positive in other diseases or let me know about the specificity and sensitivity of the test. Also, whether a false positive of 3.7 (normal &lt;1) could be possible? Just need someone to provide me with objective information until I meet with my neurologist on Monday.\n\nThank you This should clear some stuff up for you... It is a rheumatologist from UCLA that breaks down what Scleroderma is and is not.\n\n(\n\nHope this helps. False positives of anti-scl70 are actually MORE common than true positives\n\n\nYour symptoms could lineup with early scleroderma, but they are not specific enough to diagnose it. A negative ANA and low positive like that is statistically more likely to be a false positive, but you need to follow up with appropriate doctors. Have you seen a rheumatologist yet? \n\nFWIW I had a high positive in this same test at &gt;8.0 twice with positive ANA. I took a more accurate version which was negative of the test and got evaluated by a scleroderma specialist, and I do not have it. \n\nGood luck, I hope you get some answers and some treatment. Thank you for this! I am being referred to a hematologist and rheumatologist. Unfortunately, my neuro doctor looked at my labs over the years and apparently i have had an elevated WBC, specifically, elevated neutrophils for 4 years. She seemed quite concerned and I am even more worried now. Is it normal to have elevated WBC chronically, with only neutrophils elevated in scleroderma?", "Support Hello,\n\nI am reaching out to connect with fellow people who have been diagnosed with SSC.\n\nI am navigating through the long and what seems to be really dark road of being diagnosed. There is a lot of scary stuff to read about this on the web, however, I have read information stating that many publications are somewhat outdated and newer medications, treatments and therapies have in many cases improved the prognosis. I understand the condition is highly variable and there are no defined answers. I have also read on a number of publications that the limited ssc variant can be mild and people are able to continue on with a close to normal life and possibly live a full life expectancy.\n\nI am curious to see how long some people have been dealing with their SSC, how are you coping with it and how is your life in general? Do you still work, study, do social and physical activities etc? I guess i am looking for some of the more positive side of things. I have read some posts whereby people have been coping with ssc for a long time (25+ years in a few cases) which is great to read \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI do my best to try and look at things in a positive light and I feel like having a positive outlook and attitude can help many situations. It is getting difficult to keep that perspective given what I am going through at the moment but that is why I am reaching out.\n\nBless you all. There are several different types of scleroderma so it totally depends on what type I understand. I am referring to limited systemic scleroderma but also keen to hear from anyone with dssc too. Systemic Scleroderma checking in. I was diagnosed two years ago after a rapid onset of symptoms including CREST, rapid weight loss (muscle and fat loss), GI problems and scarring in the lungs. It is believed this disease was brewing well before I noticed it. Came outta nowhere.\n\nI went from very healthy to thinking I was going to die in that short span. Once diagnosed, I read up on the internet which made that feeling much worse. It was the wrong thing to have done. \n\nScleroderma has changed my voice, my lifestyle and my appearance. I fight this each day. \n\nI was put on a rigorous course of immunosuppressive drugs and I am much better now. Many symptoms have cleared up. The GI stuff is very stubborn and sometimes alarming.\n\nWork - I still work but, from home due to the pandemic. I cannot leave home save for walks, which I can do just fine. \n\nSocial - I am afraid to eat out due to GI issues. I love to socialize but, this disease can make it difficult. I am still trying to understand how to cope with certain things publicly. I have become more withdrawn.\n\nPositivity - I joined an online support group through my local Scleroderma society. Wonderful people. Some have lived just fine with it for 30 years. Others are struggling. I highly recommend joining a group, but keep an eye open to make sure it is constructive and not toxic / reinforcing misinformation. It brings me comfort knowing that I could live a normal life. \n\nInformation - I go directly to my care team or the scleroderma society for disease information. I find googling around just builds anxiety and contradicts the info the team is telling me.\n\nI feel the same way you do about the perspective of positivity. It is hard. If you are like me,  it may scare you even though you are educated on it and treated. It is like a feeling of nostalgia for better times mixed with dread/trauma.\n\nI apologize for being long winded. I want you to know that you are not alone. Your experiences are unique but we can share in this and hopefully find some healing.\n\nBless you as well. Thank you so much for your comment. It is nice to hear from you. Are you in the US?\n\nRegarding your diagnosis, you mentioned CREST. Is your diagnosis lssc?\n\nI did not quite understand the line you wrote \u201cI cannot leave home save for walks, which I can do just fine\u201d.\nWhat did you mean by this sorry? Glad to connect! No I am not - not anymore at least. \n\nNo, mine is the diffuse systemic sclerosis. So, I get the CREST but, also a bunch of other stuff all over my body. \n\nI am presently on something called Cellcept. Do you know about it?\n\nOh - sorry to be vague. Where I live, due to the risk of catching covid, I was advised to not go anywhere near strangers. Everything is closed anyway. I go for walks to get exercise and manage that just fine. If I see people coming towards me, I go the other way. I have Systemic Scleroderma and have been diagnosed for 7 years now, though looking at symptoms it is probably been active for 9. \n\nI have been able to live what from the outside people think is a very normal life. People do not know I am sick unless they are my friends. I mainly deal with GI issues\nFrom Scleroderma. And just in the last year has it gotten really bad, but before that it was pretty normal. You learn to adjust and adapt! \n\nI hold a normal 8-5 job and am doing great at it! I am able to do really everything, it just might take me more energy than most people. I would suggest reading something called the \u201cspoon theory\u201d it is just a short article you can Google.\n\nI found an amazing partner too, which was pretty stressful for me in the beginning, but if you do not have one already- I promise it IS possible :) \n\nPlease feel free to message me anytime if you have questions. I know how hard it is to find people to talk to about this because it is rare I am just a few years into DSSc. I made substantial dietary changes to help my GI symptoms which were some of the worst issues for me. I think that coupled with my turmeric helped with reducing my joint paint flare ups quite a bit too. I am able to work fully time &amp; I am studying for a certificate exam in my industry outside of that just fine. I am not very social in general but I have a few friends I skype with. I am not going out much with the pandemic these days. I started weight lifting about 6 months ago and that is going fine. Cardio is harder to do but I do not even have lung issues yet. My PFT came back that I have something going on but apparently it is unrelated to my scleroderma. That is new ifnromation though so not really sure where that will go if anywhere.\n\nNot sure how you feel about facebook but there are a couple very active support groups there on scleroderma that were very helpful and supportive for me when I started. I am not a big facebook fan but it was really helpful to learn from that group so early on.", "Do not think I have scleroderma but do not know where else to ask. Noticed an indentation in my forehead in photos last week, asked in a FB group and a couple people mentioned en coup de sabre, so now I am worried. I knew there was a visible vein in my forehead, but now I am not sure it is just a vein...  I am 27 and already have alopecia from years ago when I did a crash diet and lost the majority of the volume of my hair, never grew back. Been having issues with my skin/face and really do not want to deal with this as well. Time to go to a doctor. Not to freak you out but it does look a bit like the starting of it. However there is no way to know without a doctor seeing you. You will need to see a specialist, most doctors are not very familiar with scleroderma. I do not do not there are any specialists where I live. :( Where are you from? A small town in New Zealand, most specialists for anything are 5 or 6 hours drive away and the rest you have to get to by plane as they are mostly in the North Island, I am in the South. There might be a scleroderma group for NZ on Facebook to help with specialist locations or local gps that may be able handle the tests.  I am in a fb group for Australia (has about 2 thousand members), plus an international group that has approx 12 thousand members. They may have some more advice for you in what to look for in regards to coup de sabre.  I swear, a little bit of information can be such a burden when disseminated to the masses with no practical knowledge. People see something that vaguely resembles an image they saw \"one time, on the internet\" in a forum... without the contex it is worthless and without the practical knowledge, even less.\n\nYou should treat this like anything you have concern and get it checked out for peace of mind, but do not get yourself worked up over a barely noticable dent in your head, because the chances are statistically nominal. Now, do not get me wrong, I happened to \"win\" the most nominal of all the possible health and rare disease lotteries, myself, and I do not mean to discourage good sense in following up and getting a doctor's advice. I just mean to interject some common sense and no need for panic.\n\nGo get checked out and be well. Please, let us know how it goes either way. If it makes you feel better I have coup de sabre on the middle of my forehead and it is my understanding that it is even more rare to develop it at 27. I am 23 now but I think mine was relatively late developing and it settled into its current form when I was 18/19 but started showing up (more clearly than yours is at least based on pics) when I was 13/14. That being said, I would definitely go to the doctor and ask. Not sure the specifics of your health care system because I am in the US but I think even a GP could do ANA blood tests if you have not had them done before. A good dermatologist can also be helpful and may be more accessible than a rheumatologist. Also, I do not mean to make you feel bad about being concerned, because I definitely do get upset about it a lot, but ultimately it is not the end of the world. Feel free to pm me if you want to talk about it or have any questions of my experience. Thanks. Saw a doctor and she was not concerned, she said it was probably the vein making it look like that. Do I need a second opinion? I would not go out of my way unless it is still troubling you or you begin to exhibit other indications (tightness in skin, temperature sensitivity, extremities changing color). I know I wished I had pressed my doctor for a more formal diagnosis than just looking at me but I had obvious indications at the time. It just took 3 years to come to fruition. Of course it is only something you can answer, but if the vein is your only concern I would listen to your doctor. Thank you, I will keep an eye on it and hope nothing else changes. Shame most doctors do not know anything about it so it took so long for you to get your diagnosis.", "Raynauds and GERD, is it game over? For the past 2 and a half years i had symptoms od dysautonomia, neuropathy, cold hands, feet, headaches, tiredness, full body twitching and many many more. I had all tests done with nothing to be found. My ANA was negative 2 years ago.\n\nIn the last month I got diagnosed with Raynauds (no discoloration, just cold hands) and I also developed GERD symptoms.\nI have other dysautonomia symptoms from before.\n\nDoes this 2 symptoms being together means I have systemic sclerosis?\nI am male, 24. It all seems unreal...\n\nAnd what about all the other symptoms, i feel so lost where to look and what to do. Doctors, family, nobody understands this crushing paralysing fear i have and i cant confide in anyone. I dont know what to do. Please any advice? Do you have a rheumatologist? You said you had a negative ANA-- has this been re-tested? Did you take an antibody test?\n\nRaynaud's can exist on its own, as can acid reflux/GERD. Having these 2 symptoms alone are not indicative of SSc--especially if you do not have a positive ANA or a scleroderma antibody or other relevant symptoms (none of what you listed factor into SSc). My rheumatologist refused to give me my SSc diagnosis until I developed skin thickening as well as a host of other specific criteria.\n\nI recently met with a scleroderma specialist for the first time, and he explicitly said that he does not count raynaud's in the diagnostic criteria if there is no color change.\n\nSo.. you do not really have the symptoms of SSc.\n\nFrankly, developing GERD could be a sign of your stress-- gastric changes and discomfort are very common stress responses, and it seems like you have worked up a lot of stress with this fear you have.\n\nTo give yourself peace of mind, get your ANA retested and ask for an antibody test while you are at it. Please know that antibody testing has a good chance for a false positive-- my doctor had me repeat them 3x to confirm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nETA: Also, this is not a death sentence. Yes, it can be serious, but it is different for everyone. I know people with SSc who have very full and happy lives. It is all about how you take care of yourself. Allowing yourself to sit with this fear and have it fester is not good for your health--with or without SSc. Consider looking into a therapist who specializes in working with people who have chronic health or autoimmune needs. This is really good advice. The only thing I would add is that limited forms of scleroderma exist like CREST Syndrome, so even if it is scleroderma, it could be one of these forms. I have GERD and Raynaud's as part of my CREST, but it comes and goes in flares. I have had my diagnosis for more than 10 years. I have DSSc. Still kicking after almost a decade post diagnosis. \n\nIt is not the same prognosis as it was years ago. The scary shit you see online, a lot of that was before modern treatment options. Game over? Come on man. We all have scleroderma here why would you say that to us? I meant game over for the almost 3 year old journey to my diagnosis. Not the game over as in death sentence. Sorry for everyone who misunderstood. No. If you have dysautonomia that could cause both of those symptoms.

I will look for a guest that can talk in detail about the esophageal dysfunction. Glad for suggestions. How long have you had Scleroderma? What is your biggest frustration right now with Scleroderma? Thank you for that. I look forward to hearing about it in a future episode.\n\nAnother common thing in this sub are people coming on and asking if random symptoms count as scleroderma.  Alot of us who have it regularly advise that they see their medical practitioners. It seems like a bit of phenomenon. Some seem to have practitioners who do not believe it to be scleroderma (despite convincing symptoms) or its someone saying \"my skin is a little shiny. Is it scleroderma?\" . Perhaps this speaks to growing awareness of the disease but, maybe I am being anecdotal. \n\nI have been diagnosed since late 2019, though obvious symptoms cropped up in 2018. Prior to that, my nuclear antibody titre was 1:320 in 2016 with no symptoms. I had this checked as part of an allergy test. So to me, it seemed to creep up on me. I went from a healthy guy to feeling arthritic and crashing weight loss in a matter of months. \n\nMy biggest frustrations would be the stubbornness of esophageal motility during treatment. My other symptoms have greatly improved since mycophenolate. This issue was a significant risk because I was prone to choking.\n\nThe other would be the mental health element. I am told I will be fine. But there is always that nagging worry that my life is not going to be as long as I had imagined. To this point, hearing your views as someone who is lived with it for 20 years (you and I were diagnosed at the same age) and have a career, a life and such good perspectives really helped me.\n\n I know we can have full lives with scleroderma.

I got the phone call today that my ANA was high and I tested positive for Scleroderma. She said we do not have any Rheumatologists in our area that deal with this and she was sending my referral to a doctor 2 hours away. I have never heard of this and my head is spinning. What can I expect? I feel lost and scared and google scared me to death. Thank you for reading. I am also newly diagnosed so I do not have much advice to give.  It is very difficult to get adequate treatment for *any* form of connective tissue disorder, so that does not sound too surprising, that you have to go two hours away.  I definitely had to go two hours away to get diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos because there was absolutely no one in my entire city (major metro) that would diagnose it anymore.\n\nIn terms of joint pain, I have recently posted on here about using gentle heat, cupping, and gua sha to break up calcifications, which are a frequent cause of joint pain with scleroderma.  A doctor on this subreddit said this was okay to do, so maybe that would be worth considering.  Gua sha tools are incredibly cheap, and cupping sets are not expensive either (usually around 30 bucks).  If you have access to MMJ, I have found that ointment with a 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD will instantly *melt* the top layer of these calcifications, enabling them to be broken up over time.  Since most people are pretty much homebound for now anyway (any non-essential medical treatment is being postponed) it is probably worth looking into.\n\nAlso, before I knew I had scleroderma, I was taking tons of OTC antihistamines, and those actually reduced my symptoms a decent amount.  Obviously, if you are already taking some prescription medications, antihistamines can cause interactions sometimes, but if you are not currently taking any prescription drugs, antihistamines are usually quite safe. I am 29, I was diagnosed at 23. I completely get what you are going through. If you need somebody to talk to feel free to message me. I am not going to sugar coat anything and say it is fine and nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, Scleroderma acts so differently from person to person it is impossible to tell you what your journey will look like. I can tell you though that i have not had any super serious complications in the last 6 years. My life has been mostly normal. I am also a 30 year old female and tested with a high titer of centromere antibodies.\nIt is scary when you Google. Do not. This disease affects everyone different. Just breathe. I felt the same way when I found out last year, I ironically found out June 29th which is national Scleroderma Awareness Day.\n\nWhat antibody did you test positive for? I have put google down lol. I keep getting waves of emotion but I think that is normal. I honestly do not remember what she said I am going to call tomorrow and ask for a copy of my bloodwork and ask of they can go over it again. When she was trying to explain Scleroderma I was in tears and everything went fuzzy. I know how you feel. Virtual hugs to you. Yes, get all your blood tests. If you are going to a specialist you are in the best place possible. Relax, and take each day as it comes. Finding a competent rheumatologist who specializes in scleroderma should be your first step. Good luck. I am feeling so fortunate to have found this post. I too am recently diagnosed and so scared.  I live in Asheville North Carolina and apparently there is a rheumatologist shortage. I am having to wait 3 months to get in . It has created so much anxiety which is very unusual for me. I am so sorry hugs to you \u2764\ufe0f. If you have a Facebook I found a Scleroderma support group and they have been amazing. This week has been so hard I have been all over the emotional spectrum. I also feel like my body is failing me I have been down and exhausted for over a month but I feel bad for my husband as he is picking the slack but he has not complained once. If you ever want to vent feel free to message me. GO TO scleroderma education project and Scleroderma foundation. you will find no better info then the ed project for you or your family. I have had it for it for 33 years and have been told a couple of times  that I did not have much time. The scleroderma foundation is admitting that AP dose work with a portion of us that getit from a bacteria. Some thing that many people have been trying to get across for many years, Their is also plasema exchange and stem cell to try. I heard of none of these from good or bad doctors till I found Inspier.com in 2013. these sites will tell you things that you can ask you doctors and find out how much they really know. As I have found out the hard even Doctors that make you feel like they know what they are talking about they may not even specialist have different ideas on how to treat you on the same thing,  Be vary care full I lost a leg I should not have in an area of many fine hospitals but no doctors that knew what they though they did, Because the problem that the doctor caused was removed with only his nurse as a witness and I asked him what he saw he said nothing, The doctor pulled out about a foot of gauze and it went away with the doctor, He insisted on another operation when it looked as if L just needed a couple of stitches. He cut the hole front orf the foot off I guess to see if he left more, I found out that my Rhummi that I asked to find another doc to tie up the wound. because I could not find anyone that wanted the job to repair a misstake like this one and it takes a lone time to set up another doctor any way, I found out later that the Rhummi was on the board of the hospital that took his creds away before I went and asked for another doctor, I wondered way I was sent to another town and hospital. Did not find out for a long time and only when My rhummi slipped up in a conversation. The foot doc s report said that I did not do as I was told to take care or the foot . I asked for all the staff reports of to op and was told that was it, Here is the sadist part, Two seconds be fore the doc pulled the gauze out he said this looks good I bet we only needed one more cleaning. It has cost me tens of thouands of dollars for power wheel chairs and handicap vans, meds, and I can go few places and it is hard to meet and do things with new people if you cannot do things with them . As many of you h ave learned that you may lose friends as you can no longer do the things you did with them, play ball (all kinds) go out in the  cold. So winter sports. flying sail plains. boating.  In my cause the lose of most of my hand function. All fingers are locked at stright or 90% at one joint or another . I say the best think I can do is drop things things, And as with with many I have many of the other problems of the stomach. at least four different ones and three lung thingies. And PAH  bone and joint . mouth scrank and lost most all my teeth over three years and found that most of use will relax after some years and some streaching . but still cannot get proper fit As for walking my Rhummi told me I could not have a fake leg be cause of how hi they had to cut. The had to cut that high because he thought he knew more then he did, It hurt when I could heir the doctors talking across the room that my doctor was at least two weeks late in getting me in ' I have had 58 nurses that have never herd of this disease. and many more rare ones. Another thing to be careful of is that do not want to take care of hard diseases that take more time then they want to spend on you or how much they relay want to spent the time to learn. I hope that some of you look into AP or plasma exchange and pay close atention to how the meds work for you . there is no reason to take drugs that do you no good, I moved to a area where their are no doctors that have a graft of what you have. Fl may have a high rate of scleroderma cases that are mostly different from each other but no specialist in the state as of the Scleroderma.  Foundation. And Doctors can scare off a wife that was sticking with until  to many things that do or don.t happen are told to them, Some times it gust get to be to much, One time A gastro told my wife that he was concerned a but asample that worried him, two days later the office called and said to get in as soon as posabile. Got there and He ask why I came in. That one pushed her over the edge of worry and when she left me I was in another state loosing my toes, lost every thing I owned because the state i filled in never went after for the settlement. And when I was miss DX at what is now a respected school teaching in scleroderma and gave me less then three to five years. When the woman that I to marry soon  she disided the right thing to do would not put the kids through it . They were only two and four. I did not tell the family this as they could not see more or the problems except the fingers rotting down to the tendons and the funny colored hands. the rest I keep to my self because I had a seven year old son. That turner because I was the one that did most of there repairs and the contusions would cause the worst ulcers, It was strange that when I told them I could not do something that they were used to me doing they did what ever it took to make feel guilty till i would do it.  I tell you all this so you will look at the AP and plasma options and not trust any doctor till you do a good chech out, The foot doctor that cost me my leg and years of pain and the rhummi that even told he was my god was not half as good as the one that found the disease in me by the spots on my face and body and skin as hard as it could get I used to believe that a rhummi was a specialist as long as he told me he was. and I am payinyg a price that know one should. and as with many of us there are many more things that do not have any thing to do with scleroderma that would lay the average person down. in a crying fit. In many cases we need not to trust the doc tors first. Some have families that will see a once strong person and help them to the end and some that find they no longer have time for your problem even when you thought you were close You cannot let these people stress you out you cannot think of them because they will make you sicker. The sad side for some Drugs can change who you are and how you respond. not always the way you want. \n\nHere is a link to help you!

Is this pretty certain?", "Symptoms, positive ANA, positive Anti Centromere B, feeling very anxious Recently did some lab work and my results back and my ANA is positive, and I also came back positive for Anti Centromere B.  A little background, I have Hashimoto\u2019s Thyroiditis, which I was diagnosed with at 20. (I am currently 23). So I am unfortunately not a newbie to the world of auto immune diseases. For a while I figured my symptoms were due to Hashimoto\u2019s, and kind of just ignored them. However as of recently I have been feeling like hell. My endocrinologist referred me to a rheumatologist because he said my symptoms do not seem to be due to my thyroid at all.\n\nMy symptoms: Extreme fatigue, weakness, headaches, exhaustion,  weak hands/weak grip (can hardly even open a water bottle) joint pain, and sensitivity to light and cold. I also have some stomach issues,  I suffer from constipation and often severe bloating, despite being on a healthy diet. I do not have any skin thickening or Raynaud\u2019s however.\n\nMy next appointment to meet with my Rheumatologist is not until 5 weeks and I have been extremely anxious about my results. I have done tons of google searches, and all point to my lab result being Scleroderma. Apparently Anti Centromere B is only found in people with CREST, which seems to be the worst form of scleroderma. I do not want to self diagnose but I am just really worried.  Is it possible to have these lab results and not have scleroderma? Anyone experience similar? Hi! I just wanted to say that I have CREST and I have had it for over 20 years. Your symptoms do not match what I have or what CREST stands for. I would try to wait patiently for your appointment and try to stay away from the Internet, it can scare you. Hope that helps. CREST stands for calcinosis, raynaulds, esophageal dysfunction, sclerosis and talagectatias.  despite having a positive lab test for this form of diffuse scleroderma you do not appear to have any of the signs of the disorder. this is a limited form of the disease, definitely not the worst.  all the autoimmune diseases have overlap and you may have symptoms because of the process of inflammation, not a specific disease. hopefully you will not ever fit the piece that causes your disposition to progress to full blown diffuse limited scleroderma. hopefully your physician will find the right medication or drug combo to address the symptoms that you are experiencing. i wish you well and a long wonderful life without finding out the effects of the disease! I have CREST and it is a whole range of different things fortunately and unfortunately. Unfortunately, it means it is really hard to pin down. For example, I have just the R and E, but I am Scl-70 positive, Centromere negative, with no skin symptoms, which technically makes no sense. lol. I should have full-blown scleroderma but I do not. I had it really bad as a teenager but was put on immunosuppressants, went into remission, and literally lived as if nothing had happened for 10 years until another flare-up. It is very random and that is the fortunate part. Like sometimes it just lifts.", "Should you Get or even Want a Stem Cell Transplant. A Patient's View. So to start off. I am a patient. Not a Dr. The following is based on my own experience and also talking to my Rheumatologist about the subject. If you think this treatment is right for you ask your Dr.\n\nSo it is IVIG injection day and instead of doing nothing for 4 hours I figured why not post.\n\nI am post Stem Cell Transplant 2 years. I was diagnosed with a rapid onset Systemic Sclerosis or Diffuse Scleroderma. From the appearance of initial symptoms to diagnosis, my health tumbled rapidly. Going from a healthy 31 year old, to looking at what wheelchair was the best deal online in only 6 months was traumatizing. To tell you the truth I left no one indifferent. All medical professionals I saw were lazer focused on getting me better. 3 months after diagnosis I was offered the Stem Cell Transplant. \n\nI searched hours and hours online for information. Most of it was useless. How do you expect to find anything that applies to you when you are the 17th person in the country to get the treatment? You see a Stem Cell Transplant for Scleroderma is unique all on it is own. I cannot tell you what you will go through or what to expect. The medical protocols are going to be unique to you, and your reaction to the treatment as well. Anyone who says otherwise is misinformed or lying. \n\nWhy was I offered the treatment? My Rheumatologist believed I would die if I did not get the treatment. Let that be your reasoning if you think this is good for you. Will you die if you do not get treatment? Why so harsh? Because a Stem Cell Transplant can kill you. It is an extremely toxic treatment. It will cause other health problems down the line. Heart disease, cancer,... So basically, it should be life or death. \n\nIt will NEVER heal you of Scleroderma. Best case scenario is 10 years of relief from symptoms. Damage on skin usually stays. Damage to organs and digestive tract heal about 10% on average. \n\nI have a point of reference. At about the same time a 26 year old male was diagnosed with the same type of Scleroderma, he chose not to get treated. He passed away about 6 months later. \n\nMy Rheumatologist is part of a research team looking into new treatments for Scleroderma. One that is not as toxic or dangerous and that would be available to a greater number of patients. Only 3% of patients fit the profile to receive a stem cell transplant. I pray for their success. Not only because I will be faced with the same option in the future, but I know it will bring relief to the suffering of many people who have no real options. Thank you so much for sharing your story! Definitely sounds like the right choice for you! I hope you are doing well! I agree with the earlier poster and just wanted to say thanks for posting this.  I was actually going to ask about your experience after reading some of your other posts, so thanks and please dont  stop telling your story. \n\nAs I am pretty new to the journey, it be nice to hear some more of the more ubique/experimental treatments that others are going through and their journey.  Any others comfy to share? I am happy message passed! It was the right choice for me. It might not be for others. That is really what I wanted people to take away. I am all ears as well for new treatments. I just caution people though. A lot of scams out there. Like a doctor from the USA that claims to have a special yogurt that heals Scleroderma or others from India that claim the use of special herbs will do it. Always confirm with your Rheumatologist before getting your hopes up. Have you read the book A Life with Uncertainty by Claudia Sultan? She also had stem cell transplant.

Autologous stem cell transplant.", "My Hands need YOU ", "Anyone on Methotrexate? Hello!  I have been managing scleroderma-like symptoms for about five years.  My rheumy has not diagnosed it definitively (I do not tick enough boxes), but basically as things progress it will be scleroderma.  Sort of \"prescleroderma,\" if you will. \n\nI have been taking azathioprine and plaquenil for five years, gradually increasing the dose of azathioprine.  My blood tests over the weekend showed that I still have too much inflammation, and my rheumy is considering replacing the azathioprine with methotrexate.  Does anyone in this group have experience with methotrexate that you are willing to share?  What I have read is a bit concerning, so I would love some real life experiences to either confirm my fears or set me straight.\n\nThanks! Hi, I was on methotrexate nearly a year but had to stop. At first it was great! Both pain and symptoms were noticably down then about 6 months in I noticed pretty drastic hair loss. I can deal with that but once the mouth ulcers hit me I had to give in. I am 56 and had massive acne, in my nose and in my ears. Ulcers on the sides of my tongue so that it was hard to speak even with folic acid supplements. \n\nI wish the side effects did not hit me so hard because it was otherwise working. I have heard that it works really well,  but the side effects are pretty concerning if you have them.  Thanks for sharing your experience! I have been on it for almost but not quite a year. I am on a very low dose(2.5mgx4) so I have not had many side effects. I also take 5mg of folic acid three times a week to replace what it has removed.\n\nBasically it sucks folic acid out of your system so you become anemic. I take it once a week, and the rest of the week I take folic acid supplements to replace what it has removed. The only consistent symptom I have is that I feel tired and grouchy the day before and the day after I take it, because you have to stop taking folic acid the day before and the day after so the anemia comes back. Oh also my hair may be a bit thinner, but it is not really noticeable. I have already got a low RBC from my current meds and low iron.  Do you feel that the medication is benefitting you?  Is the difference notable?\n\nThanks for sharing your experience! The difference is notable, however I would say it is only a little bit stronger than planquanil. I am suppose to be on even stronger stuff that nuked my liver, so methotrexate does not seem that bad to me anymore.\n\nYour specialist knows you are already low in RBC, so they will probably watch you more closely. Request a larger than normal dose of Folic acid to absolutely make sure that it will not be a problem, and report any increased fatigue immediately. I was started on 1mg of folic acid daily and it absolutely was not enough, so I had to self medicate up to 2mg daily until my next appointment and then finally I was upped to 5mg.\n\nI am actually almost dangerously high in iron, but I cannot absorb B12 from my food so I will be anemic without a daily B12 vitamin. It is a cursed irony, with the methotrexate I have double the source of anemia, and neither is actually iron. I used to take B12, but the gastro issues made it impossible to keep down.  I had the same situation with my iron supplements and even my daily multivitamin.  I just started an H2 blocker that we are hoping helps, though.\n\nThanks for the info!  I appreciate the help! Methotrexate gal here! I have been on and off it for 20 years and have only ever had minor side effects, including exhaustion, brain fog, and minor hair loss. I am on a pretty low dose currently (2.5mg, 5 pills weekly) but had more side effects previously when my dosage increased. So, if there is any advice I can give, the side effects of methotrexate really depend on your dose. If it is higher, in my experience, you may have more side effects. If it is lower, maybe less. I have also previously split the dose across two consecutive days to limit the side effects. That may be something you could bring up to your doctor! Thanks for sharing your experience!  I do not read many mostly positive \"reviews\" of methorexate, so it is nice to see that the more concerning effects are not as universal as my research has made it seem.\n\nAnd of course, like all meds, the dosage, biology, and ones own tolerance for side effects influence the decision.\n\nYour experience is encouraging.  Thanks for the helpful insight! CREST diagnosis here (Anti-centromere pattern, 1:2560). Main symptoms for me are Raynauds, muscle fatigue/stiffness (especially in hands), and some skin tightening on my fingers. \nLabs wise, I have always had high CRP &amp; white counts, and sometimes high CK. \n\nI went the opposite route and started Plaquenil and Methotrexate first and been through a bunch of other biologics before I ended up on Imuran (azathioprine).Originally I was on MTX from 2017-2018 (pills -&gt; injections) and 2019-2020 (injection only).\n\nThe biggest difference I noticed is that I had way more side effects on Methotrexate than I have with Imuran. I was originally on MTX pills + folic acid tabs + plaquenil and was swapped to injections for MTX because I was not responding well to the pills. \n\nInjection wise, I was on 25mg/weekly subcutaneously with folic acid. I was still having nausea, hair loss, severe fatigue from it with the folic acid.  \nBriefly trialed Humira + MTX + Plaquenil for about 3 months with no success, then swapped to Orencia + Plaquenil which helped somewhat for about 6-7 months and was taken off of it when I relocated to Mayo Clinic. \n\nMayo Clinic took me off all the immunosuppressants except my plaquenil until I started having muscle fatigue, weakness, high CK levels, and abnormal EMGs that lead to a biopsy of my muscles. My rheumatologist decided to put me back on immunosuppressants as I was no longer able to pretty much function due to the myopathy and myositis. We started me back on MTX injections + folic acid again, same **** as before... hair loss, severe nausea, fatigue.\n\nBeing an oncology nurse I knew that they gave reversal agent (leucovorin) was to patients on MTX and I asked my Rheumatologist to see if this would be an option. She wrote it for 12 and 24 hours after and kept me on the folic acid with the MTX injections. It cut back some of the nausea and fatigue issues (4 days a week to about 2 days which was manageable around my schedule) but I still was having issues with muscle weakness and fatigue so we decided to try something else at about the 8 month mark when we swapped me to Imuran.\n\nI have done better on Imuran than MTX, but our last resort is IVIG should Imuran fail.", "Survey on the experiences of employees with rheumatic diseases  Hi everyone, I am a Public Health major who is currently working on a research study about the experiences of individuals with rheumatic diseases in the workplace.

But he basically looked at me and said it was cut and dry scleroderma even though my ANA panel came back negative. I think that will be re-run. \n\nI am majorly concerned about my weight. I weigh about 80 lbs and I eat as I should. I was just told to eat more calories. Any tips on high calorie foods?\n\nI am also concerned about my voice. I think part of my vocal chords are paralyzed as my voice is hoarse and I am having difficulty while speaking. He suggested I see an ENT but did not refer me to one currently. I explained I was scared of this being permanent and he said its possible, which TERRIFIED me. I feel so helpless and scared. Has anyone else experienced this symptom? What happened? Has anything helped? I cannot lose my voice, I have lost function of almost everything else ): Hey there - I have experienced hoarseness. It is scary and I too have had anxiety over losing my voice too. I understand how you feel and I am glad you reached out.\n\nQuestion: have you been examined for GERD / Types of reflux? How is your swallowing? \n\nQuestion 2: do you notice a trend when your voice is worse? Time of day...after eating...etc?\n\nI ask because food and/or stomach contents were spilling over and aggravating my voice. Caused me to get raspy. Oddly, it was fairly asymptomatic- no burning feeling, no gross reflux. Just, raspy voice.\n\nMy voice would deteriorate throughout the day to the point where I felt nobody understood me. I was a heavy coffee / caffeine drinker and this seemed to correlate. Same with sodas, same with junk food.\n\nI have cut caffeine out as well as other trigger foods and my voice is near normal. Anti phospholipid syndrome I had a barium swallow done that showed reflux. I never really feel like I am experiencing it unless its difficulty just swallowing. I have a very hard time swallowing unless its certain textures/temperatures/positions I am in. \n\nMy voice is horrible all day. It takes me winds of breath to get through and push out a sentence. Its almost like I cant spare a breath when I need to speak.\n\nI do routinely drink coffee. But I just find it so weird that its suddenly an issue. I guess that is what this is though. I am suddenly having issues with things I never had a problem with before. Interesting to know. Thanks for sharing.\n\nMy issue with this happened fast and suddenly which made figuring it out hard. With scleroderma,  foods I have eaten or drank all my life are now absolutely not tolerated anymore.\n\nI have the same trouble with swallowing. Dysphagia and slow esophagus motility.  Food does not stay down in the stomach so easily. It comes back up and will do so without those symptoms you would expect...which is what made it hard to connect food to the voice issue. I worked this all out with my gastro doctor. \n\nThe breathlessness to speak is something I had as well. Trying to make swollen cords work.\n\nMay I make some recommendations? These are not easy but they might help you alot. They have made a huge difference to me...but it was an adjustment. \n\n- Taper off the caffeine for a couple months. See if that improves.\n\n- Ditch carbonated drinks. The fizz can push contents up or weaken the valve between your stomach / esophagus. \n\n- Try to sleep on a 45 degree incline. This sounds silly and tough but, it was explained to me that if you have dysphagia and weak motility / reflux, this incline will help keep your stomach contents down.\n\n- Keep a food journal. See if your voice gets worse on certain days or better depending on what you eat. This is a long term thing.\n\n- Are you able to try some PPI medicines? Eg. Dexilant or Protonix? These reduce acid. Much different than antacids.\n\n- Can you ask your primary care doctor for more investigation into your voice issues, potentially relating to reflux? Drinking fluids and having them come back through my nose kind of issues. Not normal. So reflux definitely makes sense. I am sorry we seem to have a similar boat. \n\nHas your voice gotten better since your initial difficulty? Especially with the breathing? I barely have mine at all, its very difficult to speak. \n\nI think your suggestions are helpful and I think keeping a journal or log book can help me a lot. Especially since I never realized I was having issues with my diet. \n\nI am interested in PPI's as I never have really taken them. I will ask my doctor about that and regarding the reflux. When I brought up the difficulty swallowing and speech she wanted me to see the rheumatologist before anything else. My speech issue actually got me my appointment faster. Definitely not and I have the same problem. Less so with the changes I have made. Do you occasionally choke a bit when you drink or try to eat some foods?\n\nYes, my voice has gotten much better with the ppis and lifestyle changes. If I try to go back to old habits, it gets worse. \n\nMy breathing has improved alot with my Zenhale puffer  ppis and cellcept. The irritation of the gerd seemed to irritate my airways too. My scleroderma was messing with my lungs and GI tract.\n\nI agree with your doctor. My Rheumatologist pivoted me towards different specialists depending on the issue. The voice issue landed me with a gastroenterology doctor first where I had to do several tests to confirm. \n\nMy family doctor prescribed the PPIs and my gastro later agreed with it and added Motilium to help.  I asked for generics to save $. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this too. I know how alarming it is and feels almost like you are becoming disabled. It messes with your mental health.

My BFF (36 yr) of 28 yrs was diagnosed with scleroderma a few years back.  I believe right now that it mainly affects her skin but honestly, I do not know much about it because she does not like to talk about it.  She has 2 children (18f and 16m) already and just found out that she is about 5 weeks pregnant. \n\nWe are not sure what pregnancy , while already being a little older does not help, will affect her disorder.  She does not want to put her body through anything that will cause her to progress quicker or to put her children without a mother sooner.  She is really concerned!  Does anyone have any knowledge about this?  Please advise! Mine also mostly affects my skn and I was told tahat while I have a higher rrisk of going on to develop systemic or diffuse scleroderma, it is still a very low risk.  My doctor seems to feel that I will just have the morphea scleroderma, with hardening of the skin but that my interior organs are safe.  I do not know what sort of drugs your friend takes (maybe hydrochoroquinine ?) or if she uses some form of medicated steroidal creme.  I am not sure if either of those would affect a forming baby or not.  She could ask a pharmacist but she should also immediately see her doctor to find those things out.  \nI was told that morphea, and scleroderma that affects only the skin, are often things that run their course.  Some people are diagnosed, and within 3 years no longer have any more symptoms for the rest of their lives.\n\nBest to see her doctor/ dermatologist and gynecologist to ask those questions.  Best of luck to her! Thank you! BLODD TRANSFUSION ASAP. NEED PLASMAFERISIS The level of risk would be commensurate with the type of scleroderma she has. If she has the localised form, there is no more of an increased risk over a normal pregnancy. If she has the systemic form, then she would have to seek the advice of her GP, just to make sure that she would be okay. Normally, women with scleroderma deliver healthy babies, but it is always good to take the necessary precautions Thank you!", "Concerning Test Result Hello all,\nI have been undergoing tests lately for autoimmune disease as I have had a constellation of symptoms occur over the last two years and a recent ANA come back at 1:1280. I just received my ENA panel back and everything was negative, except I am positive for RNA Polymerase III with a level of 40.\n\nI know this indicates SSc and I know it common to be negative on other antibodies and positive only with the RNA Polymerase. \n\nI am currently waiting to see if the doctors can call me before the weekend to talk over these results, but I am pretty scared right now. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with a positive on RNA Polymerase III? From what you know about SSc, is it likely I do in fact have it? \n\nAny input is so appreciated...feeling very alone... It is hard to give you any clear cut answer without you going into specifics about your symptoms. I am also in the same boat as you with an extremely high ANA titer (and scleroderma as a possible reason) so I totally understand the fear and anxiety you are probably going through, so if you feel like listing your symptoms (and when each started) I can definitely try and mention anything relevant that my rheumatologist told me. Thanks for responding. Have you happened to have an anitobodies test done too? (testing for things like RNAP, Scl-70, etc).?\n\n(Symptoms: chronic fatigue, migraines, brain fog, constantly cold, dull and consistent mid-lower internal back pain on left side, IBS-C, always sick, heart palpitations daily, sometimes short of breath)\n\nI was diagnosed with IBS-C in 2015, so I have had digestive issues for awhile and the IBS diagnosis is more like \"we do not know what is wrong, but youre having symptoms soo...let us go with IBS!\").\n\nThe chronic fatigue has been going on for about 2 years and has gotten worse over time.\n\nThe strange flank pain in my back comes and goes and has been around for about 1.5 years. It is very consistent and noticeable even if it is not particularly painful. It is not a muscle thing.\n\nMigraines have been going on since I was a little kid. No doctor has ever cared to figure that out or do any testing.\n\nI have been asked and it has been suggested that I might have Raynaud's. The thing is, I do not have any of the big color changes that seem to be common with Raynaud's. But my hands and feet are constantly, absolutely freezing anytime the temperature is below 55 degrees. It is like having ice cubes attached to me body - it is miserable. This has been true for many years.\n\nHeart palpitations and SOB is recent as of the past couple of months. Wow...Are you sure you are not me? Swap out IBS for swallowing problems and reflux and my symptoms are identical to yours...like even the exact same spot of back pain and potentially atypical Reynauds presentation. I did do the antibodies test, the three most common forms came back negative and I am waiting on the full antibodies test to come back that includes the less common ones along with rechecking the first three. \n\nDefinitely make sure you find a good rheumatologist (and if possible a scleroderma specialist since that antibody is one of the scleroderma specific ones) because the clinical presentations are just as important as the blood work in determining if you actually have it. Sounds like you know a little bit about what I am going through! \nThe rheumatologist called me back yesterday and told me \u201cnot to worry about it\u201d since I do not have any skin involvement at this time...which I think is horrible advice. She did not even want to do any more tests to get a baseline of my kidney function or anything. I am definitely grateful to not be diagnosed w it h SSc right now, but I am very pissed off that all my other symptoms of organ involvement have been dismissed.\nHave a pulmonary function test today that was set up previously - we will see what happens with that. I have also made appointments with a neurologist, cardiologist and gynecologist in the next couple of months to see if they can help at all. \nI just cannot believe I have a high ANA, tested solidly positive for RNAP3, have a ton of organ symptoms and she literally does not care all because I do not have skin involvement at this time. I know I do not meet diagnostic criteria, but I think at least a little more investigation would have been appropriate...\n\nLet me know how your other antibody test goes!!\nHave you ever had a nail fold capillary test done? Finally found the antibody...a particular strain of the rnp test \u201crnp a\u201d so it is basically a scleroderma/polymyositis overlap. Unfortunately it seems the polymyositis has been what I have been dealing with until this recent flare and now it seems the scleroderma portion has entered the game. I have been trying to get that nailfold test done everyone I have gone. I have had it with 10x magnification which means squat. No one carries the proper machine to do the 200x required for confirmation. \n\nHow did your PFT go? Hopefully you can get some medication and a better rheumatologist if anything shows up abnormal in your tests along the way. Now that you know the antibody, have you been given any treatment options or any follow up tests to do?\n\nMy PFT went well. The doctor said everything looked good - which is great! I just started using a CPAP machine last week as a result of my sleep study coming back with indications of mild sleep apnea. So far, I have not noticed a difference in my daily fatigue, but we will see...I still think it is autoimmune related.\n\nI am going to a new PCP today to try and talk to him about getting a referral for a scleroderma center in my city. I just really need at least one doctor who is invested in helping me figure out how to feel better.... Started on the most basic one for now, plaquenil. But it apparently takes months to tell if it is working. Good PFTs are always a plus! I am still trying to get into a scleroderma center myself. Still many of my specialists are very unfamiliar with certain aspects of the disease. Olive oil on your finger and a USB microscope will get the magnification you need. It is not the quality of capillaroscopy but you will be able to see enough to see if you have any enlarged capillaries or hemorrhages. You can save and print, then you have hard evidence to show your doctor", "Scleroderma and humira? I was diagnosed with scleroderma several years ago. A more recent rheumatologist thinks it might just be undifferentiated connective tissue disorder. \n\nI was also just barely diagnosed with scleritis.

Stay well.", "What to avoid What substances should I avoid while having scleroderma? Are there any foods that enable the spread of it or that slow the spread? Thanks. Look up the AIP diet. You will likely need to experiment as some things will trigger more symptoms for you than others. Nightshade vegetables are a major culprit to avoid. Some people find that anything with gluten is problematic for them, but others are not impacted by gluten.\n\nAvoid anything with refined sugar--natural sugars are generally okay (e.g., maple syrup, honey) in moderation.\n\nAvoid alcohol and smoking. If you are into cannabis, switch to edibles.\n\nAlso, limit excessive vitamin A &amp; C intake. \n\nIf you are into skincare, avoid retinol or collagen-boosting products. Over the years I have noticed that certain things seem to trigger flare ups or make my Scleroderma symptoms worse. Copper is by far one of my worst triggers. If I eat foods that are high in copper, wear copper infused gloves, or accidentally ingest supplements with copper in them, it triggers my Scleroderma (amongst other things). It makes my joints feel like they have sandpaper rubbing against them, I get inflamed, my skin tightens/gets extremely dry/cracks and hurt, I get short of breathe, I get GI issues like gastroenteritis along with pancreatitis, I get body tremors, extreme nausea, and lethargic. I avoid certain adjuvants including aluminum and silicones. I make my own deodorant and toothpaste for this reason. I also avoid certain vaccines for this reason. I am not telling others to do so, this is just my opinion based on my personal experience and research. I also avoid certain environmental triggers like pesticides, smoke, ozone (I stay indoors when the air quality is poor). I moisturize religiously with either olive oil or pure coconut oil. I avoid cigarette smoke/marijuana smoke. I use Edibles/tinctures instead of smoking medical cannabis. I also avoid processed foods/foods with artificial colorings and flavors, cleaning products that contain bleach, silica, or naphthalene, hygiene products that contain sulphates, parabens, and menthol. I avoid UV lights and being exposed to too much sunlight. I get my water from water stores and avoid bottled water and tap water. I avoid make up, hair dyes, hair relaxers, etc. I also avoid foods/drinks/meds that cause oxidative stress, that are high in nitrates, histamines, salicytes, oxalates, and sulfites.\n\nHere is an article you my find insightful and interesting.\n Good post! I was actually wondering if certain body building/gym related supplements are okay to take with scleroderma or CTD\u2019s? Supplements such as protein powder, branched chain amino acids etc?\n\nAlso what about stevia or any other \u201clow calorie\u201d sweeteners? Are they safe.\n\nAdditionally, is it possible that any of the products I have mentioned above could actually cause scleroderma or CTD in the first place? I have wondered that as well as well as the possibility of vaccines and tattoos being a potential causation Oh NOOOOO I had the copper iud! Wondering if that is what triggered my scl.   My grandma had it tho! People who are genetically predisposed to autoimmune disorders do not automatically develop an autoimmune disorder. Often times it is triggered by an environmental adjuvant, hormones, or drug induced. I was in a perpetual Lupus and Scleroderma flare up when I had my IUD to the point that I was bed ridden. I had to use a walker and bath chair and I was only in my early 30s. Once I got my IUD removed and went to occupational therapy, I started feeling better and even went into remission for 2 years. My Lupus and Scleroderma was triggered again by an Zinc supplement that I did not know had copper in it \ud83d\ude1e. I have been in remission for almost 4 years now thanks to a biologic med called Rituxan \ud83d\ude0a. I had a copper IUD for 2 years, had it taken out 2 years before the onset of my symtoms, I had not thought about if it could have contributed... I definitely know copper is a trigger now because I used a copper eye cream for 2 days and felt an intense tightness in the skin around my eyes.", "Hello all, Question: My doctor tested for scleroderma about a year ago\u2026 but it came back as low (out of normal range?)

I quickly remind him or his assistant of my condition and my meds.  Chances are my problem is infection causing inflammation. Be sure you say that.  If I have to go to a walk in clinic or emerge I have my condition on my phone to show them. I am sure to communicate the what and the why is. Obviously though with a BP of 160 should be taken seriously.  I feel it is important to ensure your not having issues with your heart. I would just clearly communicate that it has happened in the past and this is why.  Even write it on paper or have it handy and prepared as Drs see many patients and may have a busy schedule.

It is mostly a clinical diagnosis. Hence why I think if you do not have scleroderma antibodies and not many scleroderma-specific symptoms, it is probably something else. But clearly you are having some real issues, so hopefully a rheumatologist can figure it out. Ok thanks was not sure if wbc, liver enzymes, esr, crp were common signs I am not an expert, and certainly there are other things that frequently are abnormal in scleroderma, but they can be caused by other more common autoimmune diseases. Scleroderma is fairly rare even among autoimmune diseases AIUI. Only the specific antibodies point towards scleroderma, so the other tests could tell you you are sick but not that you have scleroderma. I was symptomatic for years before the doctors figured it out. Muscle aches, chronic fatigue, chronic diarrhea. Lots of vague symptoms.\n\nMy mouth started acting up and it was about two years later (if I remember correctly) that I got my first rash. \n\nI think it took me about three months to figure out the toothpaste problem. Thought I had some sort of horrible disease. \n\n(oh wait...)\n\nIn a way, it was a blessing. That was my first clue that I could control much of the disease process by controlling exposures. Ok thanks for the info. It may be the sodium laurel sulfate. And interesting you were able to stop it with product change. Im using sensodyne currently A little late here.  But I am a periodontist. Unfortunately we cannot cure the sloughing gums just treat the symptoms. It was likely the SLS its common to have an allergy to that and cinnamon. Ask your dentist to compound magic mouth rinse. It has lidocaine for pain and a corticosteroid for inflammation and they can add any antibacterial or bacteriostatic agent. It has to be compounded at the pharmacy but most pharmacists are nice about it.", "Living Just curious if there are any readers with SSc still living a reasonably regular life with work, school, gym, social stuff and managing symptoms as they arise?\nI have read some negative stuff and just trying to determine how others cope. Not yet dx but very suspicious.\n\nWarmest. I have lived a mostly regular life with Scleroderma, though due to a limited range of motion and flare-ups triggered by stress, I have had to be very careful. What I have tried to do is focus mostly on what makes me happy and take it one day at a time. May I ask for how long you have had the condition? Best wishes to you. I have had it since childhood. Started developing symptoms at age 7, got officially diagnosed with juvenile localized scleroderma at 13 (I am turning 25 soon). As I have gotten older I have developed some new joint/ligament problems because of RA, but I am managing the best I can till I can get back to a specialist.\n\nAnd thank you! I wish you the same! I live what I consider a \"regular\" life. I have a full time job and a few hobbies. My symptoms are well controlled with medication and supplements. Was diagnosed at 22. I am very active, and so I have to really take care of my joints. I make sure to wrap, ice, go to chiro as needed. I like to take CBD supplements for pain and try to stay away from NSAIDS, narcotics etc. A regular sleep schedule with 9-10 hours a night is a huge help for me. If I start skimping on sleep I go downhill pretty fast. I am pretty introverted so not a lot of social activity for me but that is a personal choice. You can do it, you just have to stay within your means and know what your body can take and what it cannot. Thank you for the additional information. So your condition is localized and not limited or diffuse systemic? Thank you for the insight. What is your age currently/duration of condition? Limited or diffuse? No problem! It is localized to my legs mostly and It caused quite a bit of irreversible damage. Currently 29 and still limited but toeing the line to diffuse. Thankfully everything I have so far is internal so just looking at me you could not tell. I say everything, I do have some thickening on hands and feet and one spot on my thigh. I am not that lucky lol  Thanks for the insight. Best wishes. Any other members here with scleroderma managing to get by with a relatively normal life? You just described me and I do not know where to start. Please tell me more about your symptoms. \n\nDo you have morphea as well? I am late. May I share? I will try to list the main stuff! I do not remember if mine is Morphea, but I do have dents and other disfigurement localized in my legs from the tightening of the skin/muscles and scarring. \n\nAs far as symptoms go, I have a more limited range of motion. The skin affected is tight/hard to the touch. I often experience a lot of joint/ligament pain and in recent years now get tendinitis, sprains, and strains VERY easily. I could literally be doing nothing and pull a muscle in my neck (this has happened three times now now lol)\n\nI also get very fatigued. Some days are definitely easier than others though. Sometimes I feel great and can get a lot done, and other times I am down for the whole day.\n\nMy physical symptoms also get significantly worse if I am stressed, angry, or upset. I guess anything that triggers that fight-or-flight response. It sucks because I feel like I cannot be upset much or else it will throw me into flare ups. 13-14YO out of no where I had a small mark on my forehead above my right eye brow. Biopsy showed it was morphea(no other symptoms) 15YO spot has grown in size extending from eye brow to the top of my head. I go see UT Southwesterns shit ass doctors and they experiment with treatments. 4 more spots show up randomly on my body. 17YO reduced range of motion throughout body, mostly my hands and wrist. Doctors tell me I am exaggerating symptoms and making up symptoms. 20-24YO I have either gotten use to the pain or I am in remission. (Still have limited range of motion but it does not effect me really)  \n\n25YO pain has come back ten fold. Chronic pain throughout whole body limited range of motion throughout whole body. (Examples:Cannot reach any back scratch, cannot make a fist, cannot bend wrist and toes are sensitive NO ONE touches my toes.) \n26YO still cannot find a proper treatment. So I give up on doctors.  \n27YO skin is noticeably shinny and tight from elbows down and knees down. I wake up one morning and I cannot put any weight on my right foot. I have to use a walking cane for 7months. \n28YO pain everywhere and suffer limited motion with every joint. Ive forgotten what normal feels like. Some days are better than others. Stomach issues begin(loss of appetite, heartburn, also drinking milk is a 50/50 chance it is going to mess me up) \n\n29YO I have become scared of the pain. No one understands what I deal with. I ignore/hide symptoms best I can and keep things bottled up. \n\n30YO It fucking hurts and typing that for some reason made me tear up a little. But it really does fucking hurt all over. Struggling mentally lately with myself because in my mind I can do it but I physically cannot anymore and my mind cannot comprehend why I cannot. Why I cannot Wipe my ass with ease, or turn a fucking wrench, or throw a football or attempt to walk barefoot across the house. Muscle Cramping is now also occurring more and more frequently. I also shake my legs a lot to reduce the pain/cramps\n\n\nSome days are better then others. I am so sorry that it is getting even worse now.\n\nMine developed severe damage because of misdiagnosis. I wonder if I would have been treated at onset, if it might have lessened the severity of the damage.\n\nAlso I will personally punch the doctors who told you that you were making up symptoms because it is people like them that keep us from proper treatment. They are supposed to advocate for us - especially those of us with invisible illnesses.\n\nI have forgotten what feeling normal is like too. Being in pain/discomfort every day is my normal.\n\nBased on what you have said about how it is progressed with age and what some others have said, I wonder if there is something age related about the condition.\n\nIn any case, I hope that more research is done so we can get better treatment (and maybe someday a cure). Please do I was diagnosed at 28 and am now 31 and doing pretty well so far. Things were miserable at first and I was in constant pain but trying to avoid NSAIDs because of GI issues. While I tried to manage it with gentler therapies for the first year, ultimately I gave in and went on methotrexate (20mg pw) and it has been honestly a life saver. I have regained mobility and am in much less pain and was even able to start running. A couple months ago I ran 5k for the first time in my life so I am very impressed with that considering when this started it moved so rapidly I thought I would be in a wheelchair within a few years. I know it probably will not last but I am enjoying that accomplishment after a couple years of just continually getting worse. I am working on a PhD full time, and usually manage to exercise 2-3 times a week. I do reformer pilates which I think has really contributed to maintaining my mobility. I have a pretty good social life but it is a lot chiller than before I got this. I focus on small gatherings with close friends and only do something bigger around once a month (am in NZ so no covid). I have gone through periods of feeling really isolated and socially anxious but lately it is been ok. \n\nThere is obviously still problems, when I got a cold recently it knocked me out for a week and lingered for 2 more, I am dealing with a fungal skin infection that is  really stubborn and chronic dry eyes which are a constant irritation and I still cannot open a lot of bottles and jars. I also have to be careful to not overdo exercise, I have currently strained something in my hips and back and am taking a break. I do go through periods of intense anxiety where I fixate on how bad it could get. I go on research binges and find things out I often really wish I did not know. My face has also changed a lot which is really upsetting and has caused a lot of social anxiety but I am working on accepting it. I try to just see each symptom as a separate hurdle and try not to get overwhelmed. I am trying to just stay present and enjoy the freedoms I have right now in case they do not last. I am also in therapy which I think has helped a lot with shifting my mindset and adjusting to this. I tell myself that whatever happens I will adjust to that eventually too. It is hard and I am sorry you are dealing with it too, I wish no one had to have this and I hope you are doing ok \ud83d\udc95", "En coupe de sabre?! I will preface all of this by saying I am currently working with a team of doctors and going through a full rheumatological work up, but idk I cannot just sit here twiddling my thumbs waiting. \n\nSo.. I accidentally discovered ( on my forehead a couple of days ago. I was looking up something different that might explain wtf is up with my foot. Well I found something that sounded like it could fit, and then something popped up about a related condition called progressive hemifacial atrophy that affects the left side of the face. Well so I jumped on that because I have felt like whatever is up with my face is related to my overall condition, but have not really gotten anywhere with it because TMJ offices are like nah that sounds like a jaw issue, and the orthognathic offices are like hmm well that could be TMJ. \n\nSkirting through some asinine details, I sent my rheumatologist a couple pics and told him what I found, then continued reading later in the day and realized I had confused some terms and mixed up conditions within the scleroderma family. So I am laughing at myself for sending my doctor a bunch of nonsense I would gotten worked up about, and I tell my husband that I am 10 kinds of confused and that it could not be what I thought it was because I do not have the line, etc, and he looks and says that no, I definitely DO have something on my forehead. \n\nSo holy cow. Maybe I accidentally stumbled on the answer to wtf is going on? Or maybe a piece of the puzzle? Idk. Is this how it started for you all? I would noticed the balding spot the last few months when I pull my hair back, but I have never noticed the indentation and crack looking line around it. Pretty wild. \n\nIf it is en coupe de sabre, and I realize any answer to this is entirely anecdotal, does it seem like it is mild or just starting?

JURASSIC WORLD : MUNDO JURASICO - CineHoyts Veintid\u00f3s aos despu\u00e9s de los acontecimientos de Jurassic Park (1993 Isla Nubla ahora cuenta con un parque temtico de dinosaurios en pleno). YouTube star s recreation of Jurassic World trailer more entertaining. Jurassic Park, Isla Nublar now features a fully functioning dinosaur theme park, Jurassic World, as originally envisioned by John Hammond. Following the epic storylines of Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III, as well as the highly anticipated Jurassic. ##Jurassic World#\n#(\n#\n#\n###(\n#\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome experience Indominus Rex for yourself beginning this summer. After the first trailer aired, frustrated enthusiasts took to Twitter to voice their annoyance. Or is he just teaching them to dance? Trained, fighting Raptors We already knew from the film s official synopsis that Chris Pratt s character, Owen, works as the park s Velociraptor handler, and that the theropods, portrayed in previous Jurassic Park films as fearsomely intelligent pack hunters, would likely be an integral part of the Jurassic World plot. As well as giving us a glimpse of the I Rex, the film s second trailer treated us to some fearsome looking Dimorphodon a type of flying reptile known as a pterosaur. June 11 is also a month and a half after the release of Marvel s Avengers: Age of. The official release date for Jurassic World is June a spot that suggests the filmmakers are confident the movie will hold its place as one of this summers must see blockbusters. The first Jurassic World trailer, released last November, made it clear that the aforementioned new attraction is a hybrid dinosaur, created by splicing the genes of different dinosaur species. A still from Jurassic World 22 years on, Isla Nublar has an up and running theme park. A still from Jurassic World The first full trailer for the film featured a number of dinosaurs, including Stegosaurus, a herd of benign Apatosaurus, a valley filled with running Gallimimus and a scene in which a Mosasaurus leaps out of a pool and devours a shark both a rather grim. But its distinctive head ornamentation and ultra tough bony osteoderms can be traced from Theropods known as Abeliosaurs. A still from Jurassic World Guardians of the Galaxy star Pratt plays Owen, the parks Velociraptor handler: judging by the trailers and the clip above, hes a practical, everyman type. Indominus horns have been placed above the eye orbit through genetic material hybridized from Carnotaurus, Majungasaurus, Rugops and Gigantosaurus. Owen, a member of Jurassic Worlds on site staff, conducts behavioural research on the Velociraptors. He and the I Rex definitely have more in common than they think. Indominus Rex is a lady who lunches on whatever she can find She s a highly intelligent animal. We particularly enjoyed the shot shown in the rather blurred still below in which one of the creatures was seen swooping down and snapping up a tourist. But for anyone who can t bear to wait, last month the website Jurassic World News unveiled some leaked images of Jurassic World merchandise party plates and cups, to be precise featuring the new dinosaur. Will we see him lead them in a fight against Indominus Rex? It details how Masrani acquired InGen the company behind the dinosaur cloning technology used in the very first Jurassic Park film and goes on to state that the future holds any and every possibility. Picture that, but with better graphics and louder screaming. It also seems pretty clear that the hybrid will escape from her enclosure during peak season, when the park is packed with tourists. Thanks to the Jurassic World website, we also now know that the film s lab, used to create the hybrid, is called the Hammond lab. Here s the site s official description: We set out to make Indominus the most fearsome dinosaur ever to be displayed at Jurassic World. But for now, it seem as if the filmmakers are holding off on the big reveal, perhaps saving it for a third trailer, or for the film itself. We can watch a live feed of the park In an exciting new move, the Jurassic World site has launched aPark Cam feature, that allows visitors to access live feeds from different parts of Isla Nublar. A still from Jurassic World Meanwhile, Nick Robinson stars as Zach, Claires teenage nephew, and Ty Simpkins plays his younger brother Gray, ensuring that Jurassic World will fulfil its kids in danger of being eaten. Bryce Dallas Howard plays a scientist named Claire, who appears to be a key member of the team responsible for creating the dinosaur hybrid: expect the dont mess with nature message of the first film to be reinforced loud and clear. While we quite like the idea of nicknaming her Dommie the preferred abbreviation seems to be I Rex. Back in April, Palaeontologist Darren Naish, from the University of Southampton, called the film s decision not to have feathers a disregard for knowledge adding, It helps perpetuate the notion that dinosaurs were all scaly dragons, alien and unlike modern animals. Irrfan Khan plays Simon Masrani, head of the Masrani corporation, and owner of Jurassic World. Judging by the first trailer s frequent references to she see the above the hybrid is also definitely a female. A still from Jurassic World There will be Raptors. Indominus roar is estimated to reach 140 160dbthe same as a 747 taking off and landing. Dinosaur Digs version of Zoo Tycoon and accidentally on purpose set the T Rex loose? Scientists will have issues with it As with the earlier films which supersized the Velociraptors, and changed the shape of the T Rexs teeth there appear to be several flaws with the depiction of the dinosaurs and Mosasaur in the Jurassic World trailers. Thanks to the rather brilliant Jurassic World website designed to look like a promotional website for the film s theme park we ve now been given more info on the new dino, including a name, Indominus Rex, which translates as untameable king. The new dinosaur hunts for sport In the second Jurassic World trailer, Chris Pratt s character announces that the I rex is hunting for sport rather than just for food. According to the Jurassic World filmmakers, the full list of dinosaurs we ll be seeing is as follows: Ankylosaurus Apatosaurus Baryonyx Dimorphodon not strictly a dinosaur but a type of pterosaur a flying reptile Edmontosaurus Gallimimus A still from Jurassic World Pachycephalosaurus Parasaurolophus Pteranodon not strictly a dinosaur, but a type. The Hammond statue will link the film with its predecessors, and provide a nice tribute to the late Richard Attenborough, the actor who played Jurassic Park founder John Hammond in the original Steven Spielberg film. After many years, Jurassic Worlds attendance rates begin to decline and a new attraction, created to re spark visitor interest, gravely backfires. And it can reach speeds of 30 mphwhile confined to its enclosure. So dont expect a fluffy T Rex anytime soon. A still from Jurassic World In the film s second trailer, we caught a few tantalising glimpses of our leading lady: lurking coyly in the undergrowth, or terrorising a trapped Chris Pratt below. We d like to point out that, despite his horrified tones, Pratt has previously enthused about his own passion for hunting. Theres quite a lot of footage to go through and, so far, things haven t been too exciting: fans have been able to watch park workers taking their breaks, or preparing empty enclosures. However, the trailer scenes of Pratt happily motorbiking alongside a herd of raptors, and conducting some form of in pen training, suggests that he may well have learnt to marshal the animals. Furthermore, the trailers make it clear that, despite recent research suggesting that a number of dinosaurs were feathered, the film will be sticking to the traditional scaly look. Terminator: Genisys, ensuring that Universals dinosaurs wont be facing too much competition during their opening week. At first glance, Indominus most closely resembles a T. ", "SCL-70 Results I started seeing a rheumatologist because I have had inflammation in one eye, on and off, for the past couple of years. It happened after getting hit in the eye two years ago. I thought it was related to that, but it has come back 4 times within two years, unexplained. I am currently on a steroid drop since it came back in November. I recently had blood work done, my ANA came back positive and I also had SCL-70 test positive, 2.4. The rheum said he is not concerned with the SCL-70 result because I do not have any symptoms. He wants to start treating the eye by taking Methotrexate. I am going to another rheum on Tues for a second opinion. I am very concerned about the SCL-70. Of course googling does not help and makes me even more concerned about this. I am not sure if I trust this doctor being very nonchalant about the result. False positives are pretty common with the antibodies testing. They only diagnose based off symptoms. If you are not experiencing any symptoms of scleroderma, then it could have been a false positive and you have nothing to worry about. That said, methotrexate is also used in treating scleroderma as well, so you have got that going for you. If you want to be proactive, start recording any changes you notice in your health. Many of the early signs for systemic scleroderma are GI symptoms, joint paint, itching, Raynaud's syndrome, and swelling of the fingers. If you start noticing persistent symptoms, especially with your hands, then call a scleroderma specialist. Thank you for the info. I am currently not experiencing any of those symptoms so that makes me feel better. I will definitely be taking note of any changes though.", "Best centers for scleroderma Hello, I was wondering if anyone knew or had an opinion on who the best Rheumatologist are in the USA for scleroderma or who have the best results I would look into the Cleveland Clinic Scleroderma centers. I know they have them in Ohio and Florida, but I am not certain where else. If nothing else, they may have a reference list.  Dr. Donahue at the Cleveland \u00c7linic Rheumatology and immunology Center near Fort Lauderdale seems to be a kind, thorough, intelligent doctor. I drive there to see him once a year, and have a Rheumatologist locally. UCLA medical works with partners from around the world,\n\nTheir doctors know about Scleroderma.\n\nIf you want one of the best doctors in the US, look at Dr. Daniel Furst.\ngoogle dr daniel furst los angeles scleroderma The Scleroderma Foundation has a list of Scleroderma Centers around the US who are specialists in scleroderma and active researchers.  ( The University of Pittsburgh scleroderma center is very well regarded. My dad travelled there from TN for a consultation about his SSc progression and medicine protocol.

It has not changed a great deal since then however I have started to become rather anxious about it lately. Plaque morphea, this does not affect your airway if over the neck area right? I have just become so anxious and worried about my morphea that it has been hard for me. 21F, i have a large morphea legion on my collarbone up to my neck. almost never any problems besides GERD and chronic pain, but nothing interfering with my breathing. I have had my legions since I was 11. I was hospitalized once when my scleroderma was very bad and I could barely move my body. Still, I only had trouble swallowing large solid foods, no issues with breathing. In my experience, this is nothing to worry about. \n\nThis is just my experience, however, and you should probably call 911 if you have any problems breathing that you suspect is caused by your scleroderma.", "Pain in hands Does anyone have pain in their hand joints when typing on your phone or keyboard?  Or even using a mouse. I have had pain for the last month and it does not seem to be getting any better. I do.   \n\n\n\\- I eat a very strict elimination diet  \n\\- I try not to let my hands get chilled.  \n\\- if they do get chilled, I warm them in water  \n\\- I take breaks  \n\\- I have not had to do it for a long time, but Volatrin gel really did help with this problem\n\n\\- I am on aspirin therapy  \n\n\n  \nFor me, there is no one 'magic bullet' for scleroderma symptoms. There is a whole kit of things to eat, things to avoid, environmental things to avoid, tricks to deal with specific problems... The words 'disease management' really do apply. I manage this disease - every aspect of it.  \n\n\nAs time goes by it is getting easier to manage and I am feeling a hell of a lot better. I am actually having a day here and there where I feel perfectly well. That is a far cry from where I was last summer.  \n\n\nKeep trying. Do not give up, honey. You will find the things that help you. I use Arthritis Tylenol or Penetrex (a topical they sell at Wal-Mart/Amazon.) Hope you feel better, I have been there and not only is it painful but extremely frustrating because, obviously, we do everything with our hands. Did yours go away?

Suggestions? I do not know if its how I am eating or anything, but I have been having a lot of issues with my stomach lately. I have not been able to make a complete bm in a month and really losing my appetite (they think it might be tied to muscle weakness?). I have an appointment w/ a rheumatologist in a few weeks so my doc does not want to help me yet. Has anyone else had this problem? Are there any ways of eating or anything, really, that can somewhat relieve symptoms (in your experience)? Hi so I am on the Scleroderma Facebook groups I highly recommend those when seeking advise as they are alot more active.\n\n\n As for your issue it is very common for Scleroderma to effect GI first and alot deal with issues in this area. This could be because it thickening or a handful is issues associated with this disease. Most of the individual in the group would make sure you are seeing a specialist with scleroderma to make sure you are being treated properly because most rheumatologist are not skilled enough to be treating the disease quite yet. \n\n\nIf you have more questions I suggest reaching out to the Scleroderma groups on Facebook because j do not personally have GI issues but keep up with what others are going through. I have had problems with my digestive tract for as long as I remember. Very similar to yours. I cut out gluten, dairy and added sugars (+no processed foods)  from my diet and it is really helped and I try to eat as many foods as I can without all the damn pesticides (which is what I think the culprit is) I have been taking a medical grade probiotic called visbiome since I was diagnosed last year.\nIt definitely helps me because if I forget to take it for like a week, which I have done a couple of times, I start feeling worse again. Not just ibs symptoms but muscle aches too.", "Had these patches of itchy/thickened skin on my mid bad and shoulders. Thoughts on if this is a symptom of scleroderma? (SCL-70 positive).

There are a lot more definite signs than that. I have been told that normally people start with Raynaud's as first symptom. I have defined nailfolds but no Raynaud's so have been told not to worry Told by who? My doctor (GP)", "I am afraid I have scleroderma. Let me start off by saying my parents *swear* my issue is caused by excessive hand washing and my vitamin D deficiency.\n\nBut I am still afraid. \n\nThe main issue I just mentioned is my skin is VERY shiny on my legs and fingers. It is way worse after I shave (even my fingers, I am a hairy native American :'()\n\nI also have GERD, which got worse in the past few months. Along with this I have what everyone including my family and people with it think is raynaud's.\n\nI always had issues with acid, and shitty reactions to cold. This turned out to be nothing but an unfortunate, but benign issue.\n\n\nThe shiny skin and raynaud's is what bothers me. \n\nI am only 17 by the way. \n\n\nI have doctor diagnosed GERD, back and neck spasms which I have yet to fix, hypercalcemia after being sick, and vitamin D deficiency. (some say I also have a migraine issue) \n\n\nI have had countless blood tests, which included a test for auto immune disorders... But it could have missed my biggest concern. \n\nI have also had a few urine tests, a scan of my entire body pretty much at this point considering all the types I have had, doppler sonogram of my legs and arms it whatever it is called.. a test with my blood for inflammation, an ekg, my blood pressure checked a billion times, my eyes checked, blood test for my parathyroid, etc etc.. \n\nWhich would help most people with health concerns sleep at night- but I am most afraid they missed scleroderma or something similar. The new blood tests do not always see it, they often get a false negative. That is what I am scared shitless of man. \n\nI do not want to die. I am still afraid I have MS too. I just want to sleep without worrying. I know the skin issues/raynaud's are the first with scleroderma and another disorder to show up... I am scared guys I am sorry that this is happening to you.  You say you are frightened and unsure and the is a very real and natural response.  THe information on the internet can make you feel even more afraid.\n\nHave you seen a dermatologist?  I had many of the same tests you did, and a biopsy of one of the areas.  I had thickened skin that almost looked like hard plastic and the shiny shiny skin you mention.  Wherever it got shiny, eventually an itchy red rash with raised bumps appeared.  The itching drove me alost to insanity and then it would leave horrible ugly looking skin.  This went on for many months until I finally could see the dermatologist.\n\nAs it turns out I am lucky enough to have contracted morphea, which is a type of scleroderma that sticks to the skin.  It does not affected internal organs and for many people it runs it is course in 2-5 years.  Mine last me about 5 years although I still have some shiny patches which could eventually be involved.  \n\nThe itching is gone, my reynauds is still present but I have always had that along with some other auto immune diseases.  50% of my body (not my face though which is kind of nice) is rough, patchy, brownish or has other marks and areas of thick skin.  THe dermatologist has prescribed quinine, which seemed to stop the itching, but also some cream that I tried for a week but woke up one morning with sunburn like peeling all in the areas I applied it.  (Was mentioned in side effects) I quit using that.\n\nThe past year, after 5 years, I feel like it is mostly all behind me, but I was so afraid for a while.  If you have not seen a dermatologist I think that might be your best bet in finding something out.\n\nGood luck to you! Completely understand your concerns, have you had an ANA test? (autoimmune) and autoantibody test?  Have you seen a Rheumatologist. Also make sure you get the IFA ANA test.  I was tested when I was feeling the worst at the beginning and it came back negative, the rheumatologist at the time took the test result as me not having this disease, meanwhile the lab their office uses is not the IFA, a month later I visited a hepatologist (I have autoimmune liver disease) and he ran a bunch of tests, one of them was the IFA ANA test which came back off the charts with centromere pattern.   (   check out that site. Best of luck and try not to stress too much.  There is not much else that I could say to the excellent feedback that you got so far, but there is nothing to fear. Do try to focus on getting a comprehensive diagnosis. Whatever the result, speak to your specialist on what the best course of therapy would be. Discuss with family and friends, a strategy for being able to maintain it... and above all, do continue to live and enjoy life, despite the challenge. I have been absolutely honored to work with and for scleroderma patients, and you know what, I often see the beauty, strength, grace, love, and wisdom shine through the darker clouds that may define their condition.  Also, I forgot to mention, that if it is scleroderma (or morphea) that you have come down with there is one lotion that I accidentally came across that almost overnight took the scaley, dry patches away.  As long as I continue to keep my skin completely moisturized with it I do not get that gross feeling skin, even though it looks gross.  It is Aveeno Baby Eczema cream!  Maybe you want to try it?  The best thing, according to dermatologist, was to not let yourself dry out.  Worth a try maybe? Thanks hun. I will look for it since I always have dry skin anyway- but I forgot to mention I never got told I have it. I am just nervous.  I never got diagnosed with it bud, I am just just really really sure and paranoid. I cannot even get to a doctor soon ", "Just diagnosed with questions Hello, all!\n\nFirst of all, I was so happy to come across this subreddit and see that everyone seems extremely supportive here.\n\nI am a 33 year old male, and I was just diagnosed with localized scleroderma (aka morphea).\n\nThe dermatologist that diagnosed me does not seem too experienced with the condition, and I have trouble getting appointments. He left my biopsy results through voicemail, and he also has not returned my voicemail after I reached out with initial questions. I do lots of research online, and I am working on getting a referral to a scleroderma clinic/specialist in my town. \n\nI have been having a hard time coming to terms with the diagnosis. I am scared. The more I read about it, the more I realize that I should not be so negative. Many have a more challenging version, and they are brave and helpful. I hope I can be better in time.\n\nIn the meantime, I was hoping that I could ask a couple of questions that I cannot seem to find addressed through my research. I have sort of been obsessing, and it is taking a bit of a toll on my mental health. \n\nFirst, can anyone describe what a new area of skin is like during a flair up? Is it really apparent like a dark bruise, or more subtle and easy to miss? I have been looking at my body in the mirror more than I care to admit,  and I have been obsessing over spots that I think are beginning. \n\nAlso, from the start or inflammation, does anyone know how long it generally takes to scar? My dermatologist said in his voicemail that active spots are treatable whereas hardened spots are less so. As I said, it can take weeks to get into my dermatologist, and I have no idea when I can see the specialist. I feel that, if I have any active spots, I will miss the treatable window. \n\nIf you read all that, thank you. I tend to ramble when I am nervous. \n\nAgain, I am thankful for this community and any advice I might get here. Peace. Forget your dermatologist. This is way above his pay grade. Go see a Rheumatologist ASAP.\n\nCannot comment on your condition. I actually do not trust his diagnosis. \n\nGood luck! Yes, not knowing what is going on is super scary and it does not help to read the Internet. Do go see a Rheumatologist. Remember you have to be your own advocate for your health. If you do not like one doctor see another. They need to be available to you. That is their job. I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years. I have CREST. I also host a podcast for Scleroderma patients called Mogilsmobcast. We are a small community and we need to be there for each other. Step one: get in with a rheumatologist\n\nStep two: do not be afraid\n\nThough localized scleroderma does present challenges, the condition is 100% treatable and will start to become part of life. Your rheumatologist will likely put you on a medication regime; depending on your condition it may be a low dose of methotrexate and folic acid and possibly steroids if you are in the midst of a flare-up. This has been my experience dealing with the disease for 20 years as a 27-year old female. Yours could very well be different, of course, but hopefully that helps give you an idea of where you might head.\n\nIn terms of what spots look like, I have both dark patches of skin and areas that look shiny and feel thick and plastic-like. It is pretty easy to spot new patches, and in my experience with it, the patches tend to congregate around specific areas. I have it on the left side of my face and a couple spots on my back. You will know when you are having a flare up because the patches will feel different to the touch, but as long as you are on medication, the chances of a flare decrease. If you also want to monitor progression more closely, you can always take pictures every few months to see how things have or have not progressed. \n\nFor the last question, once you have a patch, it does not go away. Be sure to stay vigilant and get yourself in with a kick-butt rheumatologist with whom you can develop a strong partnership in managing it.\n\nTotally just my experience here, but I hope that all helps. If there is anything more I can help with, please do not hesitate to DM.", "Numbing Sensation in the fingers and hand I was diagnosed with scleroderma about 8 months, and just this week starting getting a numb tingly feeling in one of my fingers, which has spread to other fingers and sometimes the rest of the hand. It never completely goes away. This has never happened before, it has nothing to do with my fingers being cold and there is no colour change. Anyone else experienced this?  Yes-ish. but mine is typically triggered by vibration.\n\nIt is definitely a thing Raynaud's can do in response to stress or environmental factors. I get this all the time and have for years. It has not worsened and I have been checked out by specialists Pinched nerve probably.  I am very new to scleroderma and so I am not sure what kind of calcification issues *other* people have, but my nerves get trapped in mine and it causes neuropathy symptoms My mom has it for over 18 year, what I can tell it is: get use to the \"numb\" feeling you will probably going to break a lot of things, glasses, decoration, plates, etc it sucks and do not feel bad about it, just be careful...  eventually you will read your body and know when it is a \"bad day\" to grab things. Try no to touch direct cold things, like frozen food. They say that the numb feeling it is because you immune system it is accelerated and creating a lot of collagen. Or like my mom say: scleroderma it is attacking me xD. For my mom work warm things, mug tea and a long warm shower if it is really a bad day. ", "How long did it take you to receive your diagnosis? What were your early signs? Did your doctors come to the diagnosis quickly? It is weird for me... I do not know how long I have had symptoms, but I would estimate the onset was anywhere between 2001 and 2012. But who knows? I finally went to see a doctor about symptoms in 2019.\n\nI diagnosed myself, if I think about it. I had SEVERE digital ulcers that started on every single finger. By the time I got an appointment, 3 of my finger tips were just  gone and the others were all in different stages of melting away. I looked up how to better treat fingertips, found they were officially called digital ulcers, and then came across a presentation by a doctor at a scleroderma conference on digital ulcer care. Looked up scleroderma digital ulcers and was pretty convinced that is what I had.\n\nI was \"lucky\" in that my symptoms were very specific to scleroderma. That, and I had a doctor near a bigger city  willing to admit that she did not know everything about how the disease presents, in spite of having \"treated it before.\" She was willing to do quick research right in front of me and immediately ordered ALL the blood tests for that suspected diagnosis. I got the results back 3 days later and was in with a rheumatologist later that week. I am so happy your doctor took you seriously and acted quickly! I have a rheumatologist and she checked me for sjogrens but came back negative. She did a routine panel of bloodwork but I am not sure if scleroderma would show up in just basic autoimmune bloodwork or not? I am constantly torn between advocating for myself or just hoping its nothing. I have had Raynauds my whole life but over the last year or so the skin on my feet has gotten so tight, hard, and thick. I have seen a few docs and no one can figure out what is wrong. I feel like none of my docs look at all of my medical history and instead just look at one thing and if it does not make sense they just give up. I know it is frustrating not having answers. If it helps, I made a list of tests my doctor ordered. From what she told me when my results came in, the test she ordered pretty much proved Scleroderma. My rheumatologist did other tests for autoimmune stuff and I also have lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. So... yay, I guess...? I am glad I had thorough doctors.\n\nThis is a list of the tests my doctor ordered. Some of these tests just show things like inflammation or basic autoimmune responses. I believe the tests that involve ANA and all the tests below that are specific in narrowing it down to scleroderma. I used to know the specifics but I have forgotten now and I am sorry. Maybe ask your doc or rheumatologist to run these specific tests if you have not had them done in the past?\n\nC-Reactive Protein\n\nAntinuclear Antibodies\n\nANA Titer\n\nANA Pattern Legacy\n\nANA Path Review Legacy\n\nAnti-Centromere Antibodies\n\nComplement C4, Serum\n\nAnti-dsDNA Antibodies\n\nHere is a really great peer-reviewed resource that explains the tests and the results and what they mean.\n( Took Me about 3-4 months.

My ulcers would inevitably get infected since I was a cashier and touching a lot of things resulted in infections. Viagra helped them heal faster as well as the antibiotics. The BEST band aids for digital ulcers in my opinion are knuckle band aids when put on the right way they stay on until you take them off before that they will not budge. Also let them breathe at night aka no covering them while sleeping. Hope this helps and good luck! Thanks for the info! I am going to try the knuckle band aids because I do not have much luck with the ones for the fingertip. I tried uploading a how to video but I did not know you cannot attach vids. Good Luck! So do you have calcinosis?  does that go with scleroderma?  I have CREST so I confuse what causes what.

All of my problems are internal, so sitz baths and external topicals are worthless.  \n\n\nAny help or advice would be appreciated. Sorry you are having issues. My only GI involvement is related to the cycle of diarrhea and constipation. \nI take stool softeners to help with that. \n\nI am guessing that would not help in your situation. What does your doctor have to say?\n\nI have to admit, this is the first time I have heard of these symptoms, so I cannot even parrot back advice. \n\n I am so sorry about your GI issues.  My primary problem is GERD, but I have also had a fissure for the last five years.  It does not matter what I do to try to heal it - it just will not go away.   I wish I could help but this is the first I have heard of that. \ud83d\ude41 painful, burning cracks and fissures that come and go, chronic diarrhea and a rectocele.  &gt;Oh, lord. I am so sorry. That must be incredibly painful. \n\n&amp;#x200B; I am going to talk to my dr about trying some meds that can improve blood flow to the area and discuss therapies that will reduce the constriction of the involuntary muscles. Just that may improve the pain.  \n\n\nIf it does not work... I am done. This one problem has totally taken over my entire life and I cannot do this any more.  \n\n\nI have seen where a person has a colostomy bag for just 6-12 months to allow the area to heal, then they hook  them back up and try one more time. Sometimes it works. I do not know. Now you have got me wondering if abdominal adhesions and organs slipping around is part of this too.   \n\n\nWe do not just seem to have too much collagen and connective tissue. We seem to have the wrong kind of connective tissues (like scar tissue building up) and not the soft, flexible tissue.  \n\n\nIn my case, my uterus fell forward and stuck to my bladder. Over time, both organs fused together into one giant mass. My hysterectomy took hours longer than it was supposed to because the doctor had to slowly pick away at the adhesions in an attempt to save my bladder, veins, and nerves. Several feet of intestines were glued to the mass as well. (He did a GREAT job!)  \n\n\nI really wonder if that mess was my first scleroderma symptom.  Try Zinc Baby Ointment:  \n\n I will add that to the list. Thank you. Hi, sorry about your troubles. It might be caused by the opioid pain killers causing constipation. Do talk to your doctor.\nI use stool softener as well. Thank you for reaching out, but that really does not apply to my situation.   \n\n\nUntil three months ago, I suffered from 18 years of chronic diarrhea. Even when I began pain management, I was running to the toilet 5, 8, 12... sometimes 20 times a day. The first diagnosis was IBS, but after my Scleroderma diagnosis the doctors decided to blame that. Nobody had any solutions other than anti-diarrhea meds and electrolytes.  \n\n\nI recently got control of that by eliminating fiber from my diet. The painful parts are the rectal ulcers and fissures. I am under the care of two gastros, and I have had three surgeries for this over the last year. The last one was very a extensive total reconstruction. After all that, I am back to square one. My pulmonologist (sp?) wants me under the care of a gastro who is knowledgeable about Scleroderma, but I have no idea how to find such a creature.  \n\n\nSince this post, I have had considerable luck by treating the problem with butyrate and glutamine powders in a coconut oil/butter matrix. I found an interesting study where they treated Crone's patients with this type of enema and had very impressive results. Decided to give it a shot and so far, it seems to be working. After a year and a half of fighting this uphill battle, things are going very well. I am no longer in pain, bleeding, or prolapsing.   \n\n\nGetting control of the diarrhea seems to have been step one. I could not heal with the constant trauma. The butyrate and glutamine appear to be the final peg. Just give the cells the energy they need to restore and reconstruct.  \n\n\nIf you do a Google search on the words Scleroderma and rectal, you will find many, many links between the two issues.   \n\n\nI know I am oversharing, but if even one person reads this and it helps them, I will not be embarrassed.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B; I just wanted to reach out. I am having some success and thought you might be interested.  \n\n\nWhen I made this post, I was searching for answers.

After a year and a half of suffering and three surgeries, I am no longer bleeding at all, in zero pain, and no longer prolapsing.   \n\n\nI barely melted 1/2 stick of butter with 1/4 Cup of liquid coconut oil and some MCT. Not too much heat. Then added 2 tablespoons butyrate and 2 tablespoons glutamine. (I chose the butter because it is naturally high in butyrate and the oils to keep the mix liquid at room temperature. I deliberately avoided mineral oil because that has been implicated in triggering Scleroderma reactions.)  \n\n\nDuring the first week I did a water enema with every movement to reduce straining and pressure and to help keep the internal wounds as free of debris as I could, then I applied the oil. Now I do not need to do all that. It is now oil, movement, oil.  \n\n\nI must add, that this is accompanied by a low-fiber diet (to address my problem with chronic diarrhea). I do not know that that is applicable to other people at all.  \n\n\nI went into this some in another post on this thread.

", "What I Am Reminded of Every Scleroderma Awareness Month ", "Has anyone encountered symptoms this severe? My mother was diagnosed with Scleroderma a year ago having had symptoms for several months prior. She was working 60 hours a week at the time of her diagnosis. 4 months later she was sent home by her boss out of concern for her health. 7 months after her diagnosis she was hospitalized and required heart surgery. She spent 9 weeks in hospital before being sent home. She was eventually updated to diffuse systemic scleroderma. \n\nShe is unable to eat due to her severe gastrointestinal issues, and is on a drip feed bag 12 hours per day. Her weight has dropped to below 40 kg (6 stone/84 pounds). Additionally she vomits frequently and violently, and suffers from frequent and severe heartburn. She has lost all use of her right hand and has extremely limited use of her left hand due to the skin hardening. In addition, she cannot walk up straight due to her legs and feet hardening and walking itself is incredibly difficult and painful. To leave the house she requires a wheelchair. \n\nI am now her full time carer (in addition to being a full time student). She is unable to do so many \"insignificant\" tasks for herself such as opening drinks, opening doors, adjusting heating (we have a gas fire), picking up after herself (which she feels incredibly uncomfortable with). She is unable to get to bed without my help as she has to crawl up the stairs and is unable to hold her heavy drip feed bag, then I need to help her into bed and pull her covers on as she is too feeble to pull them herself. Luckily she has enough use of her left hand to be able to clean herself! I could list hundreds of things, but I am sure many of you will already be familiar with them all. \n\nShe started chemotherapy last Thursday in an attempt to reduce her symptoms, she will be on it for 6 months with 1 dosage per month. She got a PICC line inserted directly into (or next to?) her heart. One week after the first dosage and she is vomiting even more than before (which was already a substantial amount) and she is feeling awful in general. Tonight is the worst I have seen her since she was hospitalized. She was literally unable to sleep last night and all through the day, in severe pain/discomfort and has been vomiting all day long (which I need to clean since she is unable to lift the bag she vomits in due to the weight of the vomit). So after a bunch of googling (the same stuff I have done before with nothing new) I had the random inspiration of checking Reddit. \n\nI have seen every symptom I have listed posted by other users in one form or another, but I have never seen a combination of all of them at once and in such severe form. Her scleroderma specialist told her that of all the patients he is seen, she is in the top 3% for severity. Given that we are in the U.K and the disease is virtually unknown here, I have no idea if she is a standout here or a standout for everyone with the disease. I am also very concerned for the progression of the disease as she has only had it for 2-3 years and is already so severely impacted. I am bluntly aware that this could be (or already is) life threatening and I can deal with that. But the idea of her having these symptoms for 5, 10, 20 more years and only getting worse is heartbreaking to think about.  She is still being assessed for disability needs (which is why we do not have things like a stairlift yet) and is constantly changing medicines (of which she is on at least a dozen). \n\nHas anybody encountered (or suffers from) a case as severe as this and if so, what are your experiences?

She probably was thinking only of the diffuse kinds.\n\nGood luck, keep at it until someone can give you an answer and some help. Hi there. Only a specialist can say for sure but, yes, this looks like it could be a very specific type of localized scleroderma called Linear Scleroderma or 'en coup de sabre' (as someone else already pointed out). I actually have localized scleroderma--both generalized morphea and linear scleroderma, and my linear scleroderma overlaps with another condition called Parry Romberg Syndrome.\n\nA GP is not going to be qualified to make this diagnosis. A dermatologist who specializes in autoimmune disorders *might* be able to but your best bet is finding a rheumatologist who specializes in scleroderma. My scleroderma started to appear when I was 4 years old but I did not receive an accurate diagnosis until I was 31. I was doctor ping-ponged my entire youth because none of these GPs/dermatologists ever thought to refer me to a rheumatologist. It was an incredibly traumatic way to experience adolescence, and I eventually gave up entirely. Then one day, I literally saw Parry Romberg Syndrome on a medical tv show, experienced a 'holy crap' moment, pieced the rest of it together with linear scleroderma and morphea through my own research, and found appropriate treatment from there. Hopefully my experience can spare you years. Here is  a pic of my linear scleroderma if that will help: ( Please feel free to ask me any questions. Best of luck to you!! This is almost definitely en coup de sabre morphea. Get to a doctor!\n\nHow long did it take to get from a small patch to this? I am not surprised at all that your doctor did not know what this was. I had a very hard time getting diagnosed and I was pretty sure I knew what it was from the get-go. You need to see a rheumatologist. Preferably one that specializes in Scleroderma but they are very hard to find. I saw two rheumatologist you had not even heard of it! I would be absolutely shocked if this was not localized scleroderma. It looks exactly like mine. They can do biopsies, I also went to a dermatologist and they biopsy too small part of my morphea and diagnosed it. Hi,\n\nYep, this could be 'en coup de sabre' type of linear scleroderma.\n\nGo see both a dermatologist and a neurologist because if you are experiencing headaches, linear scleroderma on the head could sometimes lead to epilepsy or eyesight problems, so best to take all steps necessary.\n\nGoood luck from a fellow scleroderma warrior \ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc22", "actemra unavailable due to covid I was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis as a 21 year old female with interstitial lung disease two months ago. I have two small ground glass nodules on my lungs. these were actually found on accident during a CT scan on my stomach trying to find out why I had spent 3 months throwing up multiple times a day. I went to the rheumatologist who immediately diagnosed me with ILD-sscl and said we needed to do very aggressive treatment but I was lucky that a new drug had just been approved for this exact diagnosis, called Actemra. I had a follow up visit so they could put me on the treatment, but instead they broke the news that although Actemra is the only Biologic approved for this condition, it is being used to treat covid patients and the Actemra is on back order because of it. I was not given any indication of how long it may be until they will have it in stock for my \u201cnonemergency\u201d conditions.

Hi, so I am 21 and for about a year and half now I have been progressively getting very ill, but have been chronically ill for most of my life. My symptoms are very autoimmune and I am already diagnosed and treated fairly well for Hashimoto\u2019s. \n\nMy most debilitating symptoms are profound fatigue, episodic muscle weakness, and diffuse pain in both my joints and my organs and stuff. This results in limited mobility and affects my gait on occasion. \n\nThe only really unique symptoms my doctors have found and can scientifically observe are that my blood pressure spikes from my typical resting 110/75 ish to about 145/ 85 and up to the 170\u2019s systolic without any warning whatsoever at completely random times. I have kept lots of journals and it is not postural or stress related, just random. And that I struggle to digest foods and often have very recognizable bits of foods, like spaghetti and meats not just vegetables, in my stool, yet am gaining weight rapidly, 30lbs in 3months. I started a year ago at about 145 and am now 200lbs, and it is only that \u201clow\u201d because I spent several months forced to walk 3-5 miles per day despite my limited mobility. \n\nNow to why I am posting here. My blood work has been one of the only things that is keeping my doctors on my side and believing me. One constant since a year ago when this started is that I always have a positive ANA test and high Scl-70. Sometimes I come up with RNP, sometimes sedimentation rate is off, thyroid levels are normal, TPO fluctuates. But Scl-70 keeps steadily climbing. \n\nEvery doctor I have seen takes one look at my skin and tells me it is not Scleroderma, and I am not saying they are wrong or telling them that is what I think it is, it feels like they are saying it more for themselves than me. I do not have any CREST symptoms or even Raynaud\u2019s. But, I have done my research and I know my body and I can say for certain that every organ in my body is not right, I have lost all my flexibility, if I try to touch my toes I can only touch my knees. I am unable to breath as deeply as I used to despite daily breathing exercises, and whatever is going on is doing some serious damage that I feel like is irreparable. And if it is not Scleroderma, it is something that is affecting my whole body in a similar way. \n\nBut I am writing this all out to see if any of you may know more than the doctors, as patients often do. I am wondering if anyone here has systemic scleroderma without skin involvement and how that was diagnosed. I am wondering if anybody knows of conditions that manifest with that Scl-70 that could cause this. I am okay with hearing \u201cnope please leave.\u201d I just truly have no answers other than that I have an autoimmune condition, and I would like to know what to expect ya know. Cuz at this rate I feel like I am going to die in the next 5 years while my doctors are dilly dallying with low dose steroids because they do not know what they are dealing with. I am frustrated, I hope someone can help. No idea. Commenting for visibility. Praying for you. I am not a doctor, but (  Does not explain the blood pressure spikes, but could potentially fit the other symptoms. I had the same thing, with no explanation at all. I have found that magnesium supplements help a lot, but if I stop taking them it comes back. I recommend trying an elimination diet to pinpoint any potential food allergies or intolerances and try magnesium. I would love to hear what you find! The scl 70 test is prone to false positives:\n\nI had a high positive multiple times from Mayo clinic's lab, &gt;8.0 (highest it reports) withreference range &lt; 1.0. But I do not have scleroderma... I got retested through RDL labs and was negative, and I do not have scleroderma-specific symptoms. So consider getting tested through RDL if you can.\n\nHave you been to a specialist in scleroderma? There are some.other things they can look for, e.g. they could do a nailfold capillaroscopy. A pulmonary function test might also be a good idea. Scleroderma without skin involvement is rare, but can happen. It is called systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.\n\nIf you can rule out scleroderma (honestly I bet it is something else) then it sounds like you may have some kind of autoimmune dysautonomia. See about getting the Mayo panel for that. Yeah, it is none of those. At this point everything that might appear on a top 50 list of autoimmune conditions has been ruled out. I have gone through an elimination diet several times in my life as I tend to develop allergies and intolerances very regularly. Right now I am mostly paleo and eliminated beans, lentils, red meat, mushrooms, and fish. But I think I need to eliminate something else now, it is lookin like probably leafy greens which is making me nervous cuz like where will I get any natural nutrients?  As for the magnesium, I do not do well because it is a natural laxative and I get severely dehydrated. Yeah so I have been tested from several labs using both methodologies I am aware of with very consistent results and pattern of increase. \n\nThe capillary test is interesting. My current rheum is the \u201cscleroderma specialist\u201d I was sent to, but he really just checked my skin and moved on and I do not really like him. He weirdly does not show me my blood results he just says vague things like \u201cyou have many non specific indicators of inflammation\u201d but does not tell me which ones and acts weird when I ask for the results, so I have resorted to having him send my results to my neurologist who then gives them to me. \n\nAlso do you know what types of tests are on the dysatonomia panel? I have had lots of tests done already. Getting involved with the Mayo Clinic or any hospital system is not really an option for me because of the increased cost. You do not need to do it at Mayo, other labs send your sample there.  Here is a page about the test:\n\n\nMaybe you can find another scleroderma specialist who can take the possibility of sine scleroderma more seriously? I know though that they do not exactly grow on trees. I had CREST  diagnosis for almost 15 yrs before I had skin hardening in my hands only. Now I have gastric dysmotility but methotrexate took care of the hardened skin. \nUntil I had the skin hardening some times they called it mixed connective tissue disorder and sometimes scleroderma. \nBest of luck. Sorry you are having health problems!! I was going to go into a whole spiel here, but I will keep it concise...\n\nIt is been mentioned already:  **nailfold capillaroscopy.** After 8 months of pilfering around with different doctors, and finally being assigned a tertiary care lung doctor (after my lung biopsy), he walked down the hall, gathered up the rheumatologist (an older gentleman) who grabbed  an  ophthalmoscope, and looked at my nail beds for about a minute. They consulted for a bit and voila: diagnosis is systemic sclerosis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps and I truly hope you get answers soon. Dysautonomia is also worth looking into for the blood pressure spikes", "Anti centromere, false pos? Does anyone know if splinter hemorrhages are tied to scleroderma? I get them on the nail plate ( not the nail bed) and I have anti centromere without raynauds. They could not diagnose me despite my blood test saying I had it because there are no clinical signs. How common are false positives with anti centromere? My main symptom is joint and muscle pain. I am considering a retest with another lab.", "Waiting to hear from the Doc after blood tests (Canada) Hello! I have had bad thumb nails for a long time (I am a 44 yo female). The horizontal ridges on my thumbs have been bad since around the end of highschool, mid highschool. More recently I had noticed my range of movement in my right hand and hand strength is getting worse. Also the nail ridges have gone both ways and now there is a yellow? line down the vertical middle of both thumbs. I also have chest pains and have said for years I think something is wrong with my lungs or heart. Pain when breathing in that comes on fast, seems sharp then leaves within minutes. Also, reynauds now and again but nothing too bad or serious. My mom has Lupus, Aunt has MCTD and my brother might have Lupus as well. My doctor is now testing me, saying maybe scleroderma- Most results came back ok so far, (no SLC-70 test yet?), my ANA was 0.2, so negative. My WBC is a little high at 10.1, and my neutriphils are also high at 7.1- My thyroid pero was good, Rhuematoid Factor was good.... any ideas if this is scleroderma?  (I have to wait to talk to my doctor about the results, but I can log in and see them!) I do not have any rough patches on my skin, if I go in the sun I do break out in a rash. Heat rash is common for me, sometimes when coming out of shower my face looks a little rashy? Anyway, I feel like it is hitting my lungs (fatigued, quite a bit sometimes, out of breath- normal weight range, sometimes I suffer from a lot of nausea and do not eat all that well.) Reverberating pain down my arms- oh and the newest thing, I am waking up with feet that feel a little swollen- my hands often feel swollen esp when I walk... any ideas? Sound and look like scleroderma to you fine folks? Thanks for any comments, I do really appreciate the hive mind here! Hello! I am sorry to hear you are suffering with these symptoms. I was diagnosed with Scleroderma a year ago.\n\nI have always been told that while blood tests are essential, they are not always the indicator of scleroderma. There is a whole picture that they need to evaluate based on symptoms, blood work and familial history. There may be a condition that needs to be ruled in/out.\n\nI was able to see my results before my doctors appointment and the conjecture of \"if\" drove me insane. I would read up on the results and document your questions and symptoms for your medical team to present when you meet.\n\nThat all said, some of what you are telling us is what I have. Particularly the aches and pain in the feet immediately after waking up.\n\nMy nails have ridges (started 10 years ago) but not entirely similar or as severe as yours.\n\nReynauds - Same here. I thought it was a funny trick at first. It was one of the first visual symptoms.\n\nRashes - I have tiny red spider vein blotches  on my face and nail cuticles.\n\nI am Canadian as well. A year since diagnosis, I was put on an immunosuppressant and a cocktail of other stuff. It has made a world of difference. Rest assured, there will be a diagnosis and treatment for you.\n\nI hope you get the answers you need soon. Reach out any time please.\n\nEdit: engrish . THANK YOU! Yes I am going insane researching all sorts of stuff, and it went from terrifying to ok, I just have to deal with this. I feel I have been a little ignored by my doctor over the years, and now I have a new one. She seems to be following up and believing me. I hope you feel better with your treatment plan and I hope I soon find mine! Right now I am trying all sorts of medicinal mushrooms. I just need to know what I am trying to heal/help so that I can pin point my focus! Cheers for this reply, I really appreciate it. Happy to help! I understand how you feel. Education is power but, sometimes what we read online does more stir feelings of fear and panic. Right after my blood work, I went right to Wikipedia / Google and read about Scleroderma. Bad idea. I had a death sentence in my head for a month which was traumatic.\n\n After seeing my doctors and networking with the local scleroderma society, I felt way better. You will feel more in control knowing what your situation is versus something murky. Pinpointing just like you say.\n\nI am sorry you felt dismissed. It is sad when you reach out for help and get this treatment in kind. You are your #1 advocate and that is a job in of itself is not it?\n\nI hope the shroomies help. Anything like that, if it can help you, more power to you. The meds they may put you on do wonders but they are also fairly delicate to monitor. Do not be afraid to tell them about any natural or alternative treatments you are on. They are valid. Hmm that looks different for sure. One thing of note though is that your nail folds look fine aside from the thumbs, and even then it does not seem nearly as bad as mine. \n\nCertainly that is not confirmation or anything, but it is something that \u2018does not fit\u2019. Ok thanks muchly! My newest thing is shooting achilles pain like never before on one foot, after no exercise. I guess I just need to go down the blood test rabbit hole for a while till we figure this out. Blood tests are a good start but not a silver bullet. \nI am negative ANA and whatnot, but I definitely have diffuse systemic. \n\nNow, I am not a rheumatologist, however I would say your symptoms are very very different than mine. \nGiven your age too, I feel like it is less likely to be scleroderma, or if it is, that is very mild. \n\nFor perspective, I am male, and diagnosed by accident in my mid 20\u2019s. Raynauds is extremely prevalent, and skin tightening is unmistakable. \n\nIf you have any questions, I would be happy to answer. \nBest of luck! Poor digestion can cause poor iron absorption, which can cause shortness of breath and fatigue, so that might be something worth looking into.

Today, I was diagnosed with Limited Scleroderma (CREST Syndrome) after grappling with swollen and tight fingers, Raynaud\u2019s, esophageal dysfunction , etc.\n\nI was wondering if this specific type of scleroderma will eventually lead to microstomia (small mouth that is common in people with scleroderma). \n\nAny answers would be very helpful! I am recently diagnosed too. Well it was 1.5 years ago but the last year was too weird to count lol. \n\nMy doctor had me on methotrexate, it helped quite a bit but then the side effects hit and badly. It got to where they outweighed the pain and discomfort from the scleroderma. \n\nI had not read about smallmouth until your post, sigh, so yeah it looks like a concern I needed to be aware of due to TMJ and Sjogrens. Everyone is progression of the illness is highly individualized. You may not see that symptom develop for you, but you might. I will say from talking with other scleroderma patients in support forums, the small mouth phenomenon is not the most common potential progression. It is hard to say. I have CREST and was diagnosed in 2019. Over the past couple of years have now developed (sigh) small mouth. Its causing a lot of dental problems and every visit to the dentist is painful as my jaw cannot stretch for dental procedures. Have had multiple root canals done and cavities have increased in this 2 year period. I was on methotrexate but it did not help much. Now on MMF + prednisone + HCQS. I had all of your symptoms above but also suffer from nosebleeds. Hang in there. Thank you so much for your well wishes; this was very helpful! If I may ask, how long did it take to progress and was the change dramatic? I began to notice in the past couple of years after the diagnosis but have a feeling some of it would have started earlier. It took around 5 years to get a proper diagnosis actually. It is not too dramatic but yes I struggle when I have to take a large bite e.g a burger / sushi :( Eating food definitely takes longer than usual.\n\nI try to keep the mouth area moisturised and there is a chlorhexidine mouthwash prescribed by my rheumatologist that also helps somewhat for dry mouth.

I am sorry, I have no clue how to answer that. My only test was a skin biopsy years ago. Hi sorry, I am Dad! :) Sorry, my cat pushed send. I had to wait over 2 years before I had an actual answer about my condition - it sucks. I paid for a private dermatologist once and they were way more helpful than NHS, but that is as expected. Good luck When I got biopsied my dermatologist said that if my test came back positive it was morphea, and if it came back negative it was lichen sclerosus. Maybe your derm thinks you have a type of lichen sclerosus or planus that causes hyperpigmentation? \n\nIn any case they would probably just keep an eye on it, so the diagnosis is not super helpful.\n\nPS, careful googling those conditions. Doctors are only really concerned when it shows up on private parts because it sometimes becomes cancerous in those locations. Contrary to what the articles say, you can have patches anywhere. This looks like what I have, which is absolutely morphea.

I have a long miserable story. 36year old male. \n\nEarlier this April, I came back from a trip from Canada to the States. For 3 weeks I felt tired, bloated, had a little bit of a dry cough, so I thought maybe I got COVID so I self isolated for 2 weeks. At the end of April, all of a sudden I started to feel complete numbness in my right arm, was shaky, hands freezing cold. Eventually after a few hours I felt okay. Then a few days later while showering, I started to get numbness in the back of my neck, shoulders, arms, felt shaky and weak so I decided to go to the ER. While going...my heart rate erupted, heart rate was through the roof and blood pressure too. I thought I was having a heart attack. Through labs, it showed I did not have a heart attack. They did a bunch of X-rays and CT scans and all looked normal. Covid test also came back negative. \nSince this incident, I have not been the same. I went to go see many different specialists because I was having POTS (increased heart rate while standing), increased blood pressure while standing, bloating/stomach distention, gastritis, weird swelling inside my cheeks, extreme fatigue, brain fog, high triglycerides, and felt a tightening feeling in my face, sides of the neck, and arms. \n\nI was making a slow recovery up to November but now the symptoms seem to be flaring up again. In addition, my finger joints have been feeling tight, my right thumb has difficulty bending and hurts, my calf muscles feel tight when I walk, and sometimes my face feels tight. My feet and hands feel cold but they are not changing colors like the pictures I have seen. But both big toes have a thicker darker skin on them that formed this year. \n\nI have done bloodwork all throughout the year and tested ANA 3 times including a few weeks ago. All came back negative. Rheumatoid factor and sjogrens negative. Only weird one was my ferritin levels were really high for most of the year. White blood cells are on the low part of the range. \nI am seeing my primary regularly but my appointment with my new Rheumatologist is not until the end of January. Any thoughts? Hello, sorry you have been experiencing these health concerns. I hope you are feeling okay.\nDo you have any other symptoms? Heartburn/reflux, telangiectasia\u2019s, nail fold capillaries changes or redness around nails? Thanks for your reply. I was told by my ENT doctor that I had acid reflux in May so I was put one famotidine (Pepcid) at first, the put on prescription nexium. No nail capillaries look normal color and new redness of swelling. That is a good call....I did not even know that was a symptom. I have redness in both my cheeks since may but I feel like that is coming from some gland swelling underneath or something. It is does not look red and veiny like some of the google pictures. Sounds like your symptoms may be caused by a anxiety and stress. It is crazy what your body and will do when you do not have control of your mind. A lot of your symptoms can be caused by anxiety and stress. If all your blood work and testing came back okay, try to relax your mind. Still be aware incase you do have any new symptoms just to check it out so you can obviously rule out any diseases. It is highly likely that if you had Scleroderma you would have gotten a positive Ana test. Being that you never had a positive covid or antibody test it is hard to say. Work on your stress and or anxiety and you will slowly feel better. Wishing you the best. Thanks for you reply. I have ever had anxiety before, but I totally get it. I cannot deny this has not been a stressful journey. I try my best to relax my mind. \nI even gave in midyear and tried anti anxiety meds. They did not change my physical symptoms and due to the extra side effects, I stopped after 2 months. It is tough because I need to figure this out and look for solutions. If I do not take action, no one is doing it for me... and it has not resolved itself after 7 months. Well stress will do it to you. Stress causes many disease to manifest. Stress will kill. I actually was told this from a Xray tech a few weeks ago \u201cdiseases will kill you but stress will kill you faster\u201d, and it is 100% true. As of right now all of your blood work is fine, all your radiology results are normal, I am not saying it is 100% in your mind, but knowing that you have all of these positive results should ease your mind some. \n\nAlso, keep being an advocate for your health as well. If your symptoms keep getting worse you absolutely should seek treatment or find an answer. Along this journey, try to work on both your stress and anxiety and your symptoms should ease. I actually have dealt with a good amount of your symptoms, could it be from Covid? Idk, I did have Covid in March but did not start developing symptoms until August. \n\nMy primary doctor was convinced I had an autoimmune disease, but all of my blood work came back okay.

I have always had anxiety but right before some of my symptoms started which included trouble swallowing,  I was HIGHLY STRESSED. \n\nIt took a few months and i am still not 100% there but once I started working on my stress &amp; anxiety I felt 75% better, a lot of my symptoms disappeared. Only thing that is questionable is that I have lesions on my bones which they are still trying to figure out the cause. Tomorrow should be my last scan though, but other than that I feel much better.

My ANA screen for RA always comes back negative but I have RA. Your symptoms sounds like an autoimmune disorder. Do you have thickening of your skin, Raynaud's, or reseeding gums? These are all common symptoms of Scleroderma. I have Lupus w/overlapping Scleroderma, RA, Antiphospholipid Syndrome, Sjogren's, Fibromyalgia, and two blood disorders. I also had COVID19 in March and was a long hauler. I had cytokine storm symptoms for months. I also went to the ER due to my elevated heart rate. It was in the 150s, but they ruled out an heart attack. My d dimer, liver enzymes, and cardiac enzymes were elevated. They ruled out cirrhosis, pericarditis, pleurisy, pneumonia, and blood clots. My oxygen levels were low and I had difficulty breathing. I was anemic and my body hurt. They ruled out autoimmune disorder flare ups. They ruled out the flu and they did not test me for COVID19 then. My primary, hematologist, and rheumatologist treated me as if I had COVID19. I also supplemented for months. \n\nIf I were you I would discuss Seronegative RA with my rheumatologist. All of my autoimmune disorders are currently in remission with the exception of RA which is kicking my butt. The Methotrexate and Prednisone is not doing anything to help. I hope you find answers soon. Thanks for your thoughts. I will try my best to de-stress as much as possible! Good luck with your scans. I wish you the best as well! Thanks for your reply. The only dark skin thickening I have seen in on both of my big toes right at the joint. I have cold feet but not the typical raynauds discoloration and does not look like receding gums. (I did not know about the gums , thanks). I will mention seronegative RA. My primary doctor also told me lots of people have versions of RA and test negative in bloodwork. I also tried a prednisone dose pack and did not see any symptoms improve. \nSounds like you are dealing with a lot and I wish you the best! Thank You!", "Could that be scleroderma? It feels dry when it is touched. Also, there are random patches all over the body. They appeared 1 week ago.  It is hard to say because Scleroderma manifests differently in different people who have it. \n\nI would not want you to panic thinking it is Scleroderma when it could be another skin related condition.\n\n I would suggest visiting a general care practitioner to see what they think and what their recommendations are.\n\nThey might send you to a dermatologist or a rheumatologist to do some tests make sure it is not something else that is causing those random dry patches of skin.\n\nHere is hoping you can get some answers and here is hoping it is nothing too serious!", "Could these be signs of scleroderma?

For those of you who got cleared to get the vaccine and got it. What was your experience like. I had extreme drowsiness after the 1st Pfizer vaccine. The 2nd was not so bad. I was fine! No side effects at all. When I had the first Moderna vaccine, my arm was a little sore for about two days. The day after the second vaccine, I woke up feeling achy all over and very tired but then I felt fine by the afternoon. I have had 3 Moderna shots. Absolutely no issues. Will get a 4th in 2 months and will not even second think it anymore. Getting my flu and other shots in about 3 weeks. Calm down on the shots. A 4th is not even advisable. The FDA just approved a first booster today. You think you are ahead of the $cienxe? The reccomendations are different if you are immunocompromised, which would include being on immunosuppressants like some scleroderma treatments. I am guessing they are working with their doctor on this plan, who probably knows more about it than you do. The \"immunocompromised\" thing is such a slippery slope. Some people do not actually qualify as that, but they are still getting early boosters, before being approved (at a different dose). It exposes them to more harm when it is properly experimental, which a 4th dose is. I am a transplant patient. I have a Rheumatologist and Hematologist advising me. \n\nThat being said even if I have 3 so far, I was late to the game out of precaution of side effects. Once those passed, I just follow their advice. No reactions at all and I am about to get a third dose. I got the Moderna vaccine. 1st was fine, no symptoms.

The calcinosis would be raised and hard They can be deep enough that you cannot even see them at the surface. Those little buggers hurt when they get in the way of typing. without a diagnosis or any symptoms its unlikely your first sign of scleroderma would be calcinosis.  typically the deposits are a result of ongoing inflammation in an area.  i think you are in luck with this one - i can understand your concern tho, i hope your family member is getting treatment that is working for them!  i also hope you never actually see the first sign of an autoimmune disorder, its much nicer when our bodies do not get so hyper reactive!!

I feel like I spend at least a third of each medical appointment providing evidence for the diagnosis. I have no clear plan of action. It is beyond frustrating and terrifying. Go to another rheumatologist. My first rheumatologist did the exact same thing. Took one look at my skin and said no way it is scleroderma. Stayed with him for 3 years because I thought well he is the dr he knows best. I kept getting more and more sick. My husband begged me to see someone else. Got a recommendation for a great rheumatologist and I did not even tell her I suspected scleroderma. Just told her my symptoms. She had my bloodwork done in office and within two days she called me personally to tell me that I had limited scleroderma and had called in various prescriptions to my pharmacy already and wanted me to get started on them right away.

It is a complete battle with insurance, but the only thing that helped me was going to a larger regional type hospital. You are absolutely right.

I had never previously had a positive ANA until last week. My new rheumatologist changed my diagnosis to UCTD bc she said the joint damage was very minor and could be due to chronic inflammation from any SARD, and she did not think it looked specific enough to RA. I have a family history of Lupus, Sjogren's, and RA. I do not know of anyone in my family who has had scleroderma. \n\nI have had joint paint for about 4 years now, and had never considered scleroderma to be a possible cause, but when reading about it, it seems to fit my symptoms. My first rheumatologist tested Scl-70, which came back negative, so I thought we had ruled it out, but at my appointment last week, after looking at my appointment last week my new rheumatologist told the fellow she was training to add the sclerosis panel to my tests. My toes are always kind of purplish and cold and I do have some hardening of skin in my pinky toes, but I thought it was just calloused. \n\nI also have pretty severe acid reflux and dysphagia, but I have also been diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis, which I thought was the cause, but it has been worse lately. I also have pretty consistent diarrhea and was tested for IBD earlier this year with negative results. \n\nIs it possible to have scleroderma with a speckled ANA? I thought nucleolar pattern ANA was related to scleroderma. \n\nAnother question: everything I read about scleroderma symptoms does not list anything about fatigue or other general autoimmune symptoms? Every evening I get a fever of about 100 F and will feel very nauseous. I have heard this is common in autoimmune as your natural cortisol levels, which can prevent those symptoms, are lowest in the evening. Do you find that you have the \"generic\" autoimmune symptoms of fatigue, brain fog, low grade fever, etc? \n\nAnother question: Xrays show I have sclerosis of SI joint, would this be related to systemic sclerosis or scleroderma? I have been told before that it was caused by my mild scoliosis\n\nI obviously do not know yet if I have scleroderma or what, I waiting for my doctor to call me! I think I want to ask if she can also test anti-dsDNA, because I have had present but low levels of it in the past, and I also have several symptoms of lupus.

We initially thought it was a reaction a new brand of soap, so we removed that from the home but his hands kept getting worse, now with swelling in some joints\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe went in to see the doctor last week and she diagnosed his pinky as having cellulitis, maybe eczema and possibly warts growing on his other hand. He has a history of warts but never eczema. He was given an antibiotic and a steroid cream for eczema.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis hands have not gotten better and are getting worse with new sores and hard / rough spots. The swelling always gets worse as the day goes on. We called the doctor this morning but have not heard back. We have always suspected he is had Raynaud's because the way his hands and feet react to cold but never thought much of it until now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand we cannot be given a diagnosis online -- we are just so scared and anxious right now being in limbo - can anyone give some insight or give some tips on how to relieve some of these symptoms? I hate seeing him like this, and with it being his hands it is hard for him not to constantly look at them and obsess. Thank you again, I just want to give him some peace of mind and relief. They kind of look like my Calcinous bumps and my digital ulcers. I would definitely go see a rhuemotogist and get some labs done. If you cant get into a rhuemotogist fast enough and you are super worried then see a Internist, I would Google sclerodoma docs in your area and go from there. The finger ulcers, hardening skin, inflammation and cold hands does fit the profile. That is where it started with my cousin and the hands are a major site for me. But it was my lower legs that really told the tale. Then did not start acting up until years after the hands did, but when that developed, that was my doctor's clue. Thank you. I googled some docs and a couple came up as accepting new patients - sorry for my ignorance, but does that mean we can call to schedule an appointment without a referral? Also, how are you faring with scleroderma? Has it been manageable for you? My husband is a professional musician and uses his hands for everything (I suppose everyone uses their hands for everything...) but I am so worried about his ability to continue playing since music is everything to him. Thank you again. Thank you for replying and I am so sorry you have to live with this disease. How are you faring? Is there anything you have found helpful and might recommend we do while waiting for an appointment? I picked him up some cotton gloves and a good moisturizer. The gloves are to protect his hands but mostly keep them out of sight (out of mind) to ease his anxiety. \n\n&amp;#x200B; I am not sure if you need a referral idk how your insurance works. I would call one of them, (whichever has the highest rare disease knowledge rating) ask what needs to be done to make an appointment. My sclerodoma is being managed best it can, however I am currently disabled, I was a lineman so I too used my hands alot, they do not work well anymore, I have also lost a tip of one finger from cellulitis and had to have a debridement surgery on another one from the reynaouds being too bad, basically caused frostbite bite and my fingertips turned black but theres medicines and finger stretches he can do that helps alot. This fits scleroderma. Please make sure you see a rheumatologist or someone who specializes in the field. For years my mother\u2019s condition was misdiagnosed as allergies and dry skin by general family doctors, allergists, and dermatologists. It was not until she had lung damage that she saw a rheumatologist and was officially diagnosed. Thank you for responding. How long ago was your mother diagnosed, and is she doing alright, considering?  I will be making more calls tomorrow to hopefully get things moving. I really want to be wrong. Like others have said, it sounds like it very well could be. I had to get a referral from my PCM to see a rheumatologist, who then did testing. Definitely try to find a rheumatologist who specializes in scleroderma. I received a lot of outdated and misinformation from the first rheumatologist I went to. Does your husband have any other symptoms? There are a few different types of scleroderma so try to read up on them as they have different symptoms. There is a lot of good info here  Best of luck and hope you get some answers soon.  My scleroderma was diagnosed at an acute care clinic through simple bloodwork while I waited. I may have been lucky because the doctor who saw me had a hunch due to seeing it before. Your husbands GP may not have a clue what to look for. Insist on him being tested for it. I have CREST, so my rheumatologist put me on Amlodopine and Nitrobid cream to encourage bloodflow, and I do hand warmers and mittens in the winter to keep the Reynauds at bay. My finger sores come and go, but they are mostly mildly irritating and do not stop me from doing things I enjoy. The two drugs really do help. Whether or not you can self refer depends on your insurance. If you cannot, I would ask your primary for a referral. He will have to see a rheumatologist if it is scleroderma anyway so they can formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, keep the wounds clean and use a no frills moisturizer like SBS 46. Liquid Bandage (applicator not spray) under a heavy duty bandage helped me do my job with minimal pain (I type for a living) until I started on the dilators. Best of luck to you both! She was diagnosed November 2018. I had encouraged her to see my rheumatologist for years because I knew what she was experiencing was autoimmunity. She experienced symptoms for at least 4 years before finally seeing a specialist. She is doing better now that she has been prescribed a steroid and immunosuppressant. Hope to see more progress soon. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. She was diagnosed November 2018. I had encouraged her to see my rheumatologist for years because I knew what she was experiencing was autoimmunity.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I have had to totally change my entire lifestyle. Diet, moisturizer, chemical exposures, hair dye, hobbies, everything. That has made a huge difference. \n\nI work with a team of specialists and my rheumatologist has made a difference. \n\nFor the skin ulcers I sometimes have a bit of luck with an over the counter hydrocortizone cream. The biggest help is to prevent chemical exposures and moisturize with a natural oil. Emu or coconut oil both work well. But I have used straight butter with a good result. No mineral oil. Mineral oil is actually a known trigger for scleroderma.\n\nHe may not have this disease at all. The body sometimes does weird things. Definitely needs help, though.  Very well could be. I have seen ulcers like that. Get to a Dr please. this was very helpful, thank you. i am glad you have found ways to give yourself relief - changes are always so worth it when health is at stake. we have an appointment for next week so we are feeling relieved about that. his hands have gotten a little worse but we have been keeping them warm, covering them up and using moisturizer along with avoiding foods he has known allergies to. hopefully it is just some random weird thing, but if not it is nice to know there is a supportive community here.  i am glad to hear she is doing better now, that must a such a relief for both of you! we have an appointment for next week so fingers crossed for the best (pun not intended).  thanks for the tips! we went out and purchased the liquid bandaid so he will be applying that before work. his gp wants him to come in before she sends him for a referral so we will see her next week. in the meantime he is been wearing cotton gloves with a moisturizer during the day and in bed. he has had new bumps crop up in the past couple days but we are doing the \u2018plan for the worst, hope for the best\u2019 approach right now.  Haha! But seriously, hoping for the best for the both of you! ", "Question about Raynaud's I have got a probable case of limited scleroderma (I have to find a new doctor, my current one is not great) and I cannot seem to find anything about this online. With Raynaud's, is it possible for only the part of your fingers exposed to cold to go white?\n\nFor example, if I am holding a cold drink, only the skin that was touching the glass/can/whatever  turns white and numb, but not the whole finger. The entire inner part of my hand will be white, but not the back of my hand or fingers.\n\nPlease let me know if I have described this badly, it is hard to put into words Hey. Yes I believe it is, sometimes that happened to my mum who was diagnosed with scleroderma (diffuse) Why is your case \u201cprobable\u201d? Like 1/3+ of people have Raynauds. I am not even sure what you are describing -is- Raynauds. Lots of \u201cnormal\u201d people get what you are describing. I have got some bloodwork that shows positive ANA and anticentromere antibodies, as well as a lot of the symptoms of scleroderma (tight, shiny fingers, joint pain, shortness of breath, etc). The bloodwork has also ruled out other things like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. I am just not sure if I have been officially diagnosed with limited scleroderma because when I went to the rheumatologist they were really unclear about it\n\nI am not sure what I am describing is Raynaud's either, I am just trying to figure out if it is that or idk, poor circulation or something It does not -sound- like Raynauds but I do not think Raynauds is a very specific thing. Not a doctor but I think it is generally whole fingers/hands. My partner without Raynauds gets the cold=white thing.\n\nShortness of breath is super scary though. That is originally what brought me here (and a genetic history of SSc). Assuming that is being dealt with I would not stress the Raynauds at all. Gotcha, I could not find a clear definition online as to whether Raynaud's is specific to whole fingers and hands or just loss of circulation in general. I also did not know whether to bring it up to my rheumatologist, I have had 2 appointments with her so far and I kind of forgot this was a thing that happens to me\n\nI am not concerned about it, I had just noticed the other day that my hands do that and my husband's do not. I have got some tests ordered to check out my lungs and heart (bc I get heart palpitations too, yay), hopefully I will find out what is wrong Here is hoping the lungs is not SSc! Shortness of breath can be a bunch of stuff so odds are good but that is the relatively scary diagnosis!\n\nYou can mention the potential Raynaud\u2019s but they are probably just going to say what my Rheum did: \u201cWear gloves unless you get ulcers.\u201d I hope so! I have got issues with anxiety so that may well be the issue, but I do not want to bring it up since I immediately get dismissed as nothing but a \"nervous young lady\" if I do.\n\nI will keep the gloves in mind! God knows it is painful to have to touch anything that is cold Yeah I have anxiety and was dismissed for years. Finally got a Pulmonary Function Test and\u2026yeah below normal levels. Fortunately it is looking like a non-scleroderma skeletal thing is the cause, and it will not get worse. But definitely do not accept anxiety if you are not convinced! Oof, doctors such sometimes. I have had anxiety for many many years and my lungs have gotten a lot worse in the past year or so, so it is definitely not that. I have got an x-ray, a high resolution CT scan, a pulmonary function test, and an echocardiograph of my heart coming up.

I have struggled the past two years with many things. I have been getting these bumps / dots on my chest for years, could this possibly be a symptom of scleroderma? thank you so much in advance.  Do they go away after time or are they permanent once they appear? If you press on them, do they blanche? If so, it could be **telangiectases**. Having that does not necessarily mean you have or will develop scleroderma, however, because it is seen in a multitude of other conditions.\n\nedit: spelling they go away after some time, but yes they do blanche. thank you so much You are welcome. If they go away, then it likely is not **telangiectases**, which are permanent once they appear. Hi, my name is Denise. I have systemic scleroderma. I live in RI and have a dr in Iowa who treats scleroderma w antibiotics (Antibiotic Protocol)and puts people into remission 80% of the time. People f all over the world are being saved by this doctor. I would be happy to talk to you family member about this treatment. They saved my life. I was 88lbs and slowly dying. Call anytime. \n401-339-2323 \ud83d\ude0a sorry about the close family member, i was expecting a question about how to help them-  \n\u201cA small percentage of all cases of systemic scleroderma have been reported to run in families; however, the condition does not have a clear pattern of inheritance. Multiple genetic and environmental factors likely play a part in determining the risk of developing this condition.\u201d\ni think you will be fine, a rash usually isnt the first sign of this disease. \ni hope your close family member is receiving good care and support. i have raynaud's syndrome , joint pain, fatigue, unexplained rapid weight loss. i am sorry i know this is not a genetic condition but my family member has been experiencing similar symptoms. thank you so much! Sounds like scam. Scleroderma is an auto-immune disease, antibiotics will not help. Did you go to a rheumatologist? It is not. I am living proof. Exactly! This is dangerous advice! Scleroderma is a very serious illness if you think you have it you need to be going to a rheumatologist. And antibiotics could possibly cause more harm depending on the type of scleroderma if you even have it. A lot of us have serious GI issues and yeast and thrush issues that certain types of antibiotics can aggravate and or cause further damage. I have had scleroderma for about 17 years now, my spots do not look like that. They are not raised, but flush with skin but hard. Also it does not go away. \nThat to me (not a dr.) looks like an allergic reaction (mom of 3 kids with light allergies) I am sharing what worked for me when I was dying from systemic scleroderma. I went to Iowa for this treatment and it put me in remission. I got my body back and my range of motion. I could dress myself and eat food without choking. I was not in constant pain anymore. I am able to do yardwork and live a pretty normal life now. I take antibiotics instead of drugs that shut off my immune system. I am doing pretty well to say the least and I am just trying to help other people. This is not dangerous advice. I also do not eat any sugar or grains.You can control yeast with your diet. I eat protein and vegetables and fruit. I also take probiotics to balance the antibiotics My morphea looked a bit similar to that.

I have been diagnosed with (most likely) systemic scleroderma for about 3 months and i havent had a flare up since the first check up. I havent been on any meds and have not had any symptoms. It is also summer and I am not currently in school, so I am wondering if anyone else\u2019s flare ups are stress related? My symptoms were basically swelling in fingers and that is about it. Did anyone else diagnosed with scleroderma have very mild symptoms. Seeing pictures and reading about the manifestations has scared me a bit. Any advice and reassurance would be appreciated! My symptoms do not yet include ulcerations or morphea (diagnosed via scl-70 and ANA - have chronic pain, exhaustion, inflammation, Raynaud's, brain fog, and costochondritis.) But stress is a major - but not sole-  indicator for my flares.  I find myself very confused about my disease and my body no matter how much I read. Stress is the sole reason for my flare-ups. Puffy fingers are common in early stages. That is all I had at first,  too. I am on methotrexate to calm my immune system as I have morphea as well. Over the next 2 years, with more stress, I developed GERD &amp; Raynauds. Now I have inflammation in my fingers &amp; wrists like arthritis.

Seeing a specialist in January, but surgeons suggested scleroderma as a possible dx to research  In the last three months, I have had two laparoscopic abdominal surgeries for internal bleeding. I also had an invasive drain procedure following the second surgery for a large seratoma that developed. Both of my surgeons, who are partners, agree there is something going on that is likely auto immune. Scleroderma was suggested since the only noticeably unusual health problems I have had are a persistent, worrisome skin condition for a little over a year now that has also left me looking dappled. Please check my post history to read descriptions of the condition at the time it was really peaking. Abbr feel free to contact me anytime with anything that strikes you as related! Caveat: I do not have scleroderma. I had positive test results, did a lot of research, saw a specialist, and we are confident now I do not have it. But that process is what gave me some understanding of it.  \n\n\nI do not see anything that is obviously scleroderma. You have darkened patches of skin that look more like urticaria pigmentosa to me. That might be something to look into, along with possibly a mast cell disorder. The hallmark of Scleroderma is *thickened* skin, especially hands (but not necessarily limited to those). Also, almost everybody with scleroderma experiences Raynaud's phenomenon. If you have one or both of those symptoms, you should find a specialist to get worked up. If you do not have either of them, you probably do not have scleroderma.  \n\n\nEither way, it is likely worth seeing a rheumatologist to get an ENA panel. That will test your ANA level which can help point to an autoimmune connective tissue disease, and it also tests some markers for specific autoimmune diseases (like Scleroderma, Lupus, and Sjogren's) I have Limited Scleroderma CREST Morphea...&amp; it does not look like a Morphea patch or related flare-up rash. A skin biopsy would clarify more. Try, I know it is difficult,  but try to reduce stress. That is what causes a flare up of autoimmune conditions. Get a biopsy for sure.

I am currently being treated with methotextrate for my aggressive morphea. Mine was spreading very rapidly. I had many symptom besides just spreading of the plaques, this included fatigue, joint pain, weird muscle fatigue, generalized itchiness. I noticed joint pain went from all the time to 2 days a week at the 8 week point of treatment. I initially was also put on presidone 10mg a day to get me out of a flare. At the  8 week point when I still had some joint pain we added hydroxychlorquine and after a month I was joint pain free. The itchiness was gone on the presidone but came back turns out i also got ezcema at the same time and would a year later be diagnosed with hydradentits suprativa. At 4-6mths mark on methotextrate i noticed my plaques slowed down. At 8 mths they stopped and I would say I have been in remission since. I will begin tapering in October to see if I stay in remission med free. I have also been off hydroxychloriquine for months now and that seemed to be what was aggrevating my HS. Methotextrate gave me my life back a symptom I missed was loss of range of motion I couldnt put my own sock on at 22. Im 25 now and my life is back to normal minor hair thinning and dry shampoo it gives it enough volume no one would notice. I also had nausea the first few months but only really bad a handful of times that I missed school. Youll also be prescribed folic acid for your off days only take the amount  prescribed it interferes with the methotextrate and so does the hair meds. So you have to talk to your doctor about what youll  be allowed to take with it. Another thing to not is folinic acid is sometimes used in the case of more severe side effects. Feel free to ask me any questions. For me it saved my life and was worth it even though im over giving myself injections. Hi wow, so young! I was diagnosed at about 33 now 41. I take methotrexate tablets, folic acid and mycophenelate and the progression has halted so I am stable now. But my specialist has not said I can come off meds completely any time soon. Though I would like that. I was briefly on methotrexate injections when I was 13-14 but I stopped taking it (I am 25 now)\n\nIt made my smell extremely sensitive and I struggled with nausea/vomiting as a result. It also made my arms very tender/sore and made it difficult for me to do certain physical activities.\n\nIt was not really improving my symptoms and was giving me more adverse side effects than anything, but that is just my personal experience and I am sure it helps a lot of other people. I was on methotrexate injections for a year when I was 16. It stopped the progression of the morphea and I have been in remission since then (turning 22 this week). I was also on prednisone.

A while ago I (23F) got some bloodwork done due to my ongoing forearm/wrist/hand pain and I was discovered to have a positive ANA result (1:800, nucleolar pattern) with everything else coming back normal. Since then I have seen a rheumathologist who ran more blood tests (normal TSH, low but still within normal range c3 and c4, ana 1:400 nucleolar pattern) and asked for symptoms that would indicate arthritis, Sjorgen's, and Lupus. She did not ask questions regarding SSc. Since I do not display typical rheumathoid joint pain (no morning stiffness, no swelling...) and do not display symptoms of the aforementioned conditions (except frequent oral ulcers) she let me go. Since then I have had a rise in health concerns. I have been experiencing more fatigue, had days where I felt like I had a really bad fever (except that my temperature was actually fine) with headache, limb pain, and general weakness and fatigue. My frequent sore throat turned out to be acid reflux and I experience more issues with my esophagus in general, regularly having esophageal spasms, having a constant globus sensation, and my esophagus feels tight, especially when swallowing. However, I have no actual issues swallowing the food. I have also developed peridontal disease within the last year despite being only 23 and performing good dental care all my life. I have found out that that systemic sclerosis is associated with ana nucleolar pattern and displays esophageal issues as frequent symptom. I am now wondering if it is worth it getting a further check up by another rheumathologist who knows more about SSc despite not having key symptoms of skin hardening or raynaud's. Found these weird red dots on my thumb but cannot tell if that means anything. Mainly asking for advice because I have a lot of medical anxiety and have a hard time telling if seeking medical care is appropriate or if it is just my anxiety playing games. Thanks in advance. Here is a link to a picture of my thumb, cannot tell if these red dots/cappilaries are abnormal:   As far as the red dots on your finger, I would not worry about them as long as they are not showing up in multiple places or bothering you.\n\nI get tiny red dots all the time and they are unrelated to my scleroderma.\n\nAs far as the other symptoms, it never hurts to get a second opinion because early intervention is key to preventing long-term damage.\n\nI wish you the best of luck getting this figured out! Thank you! Always get new symptoms checked out. If your Rheumatologist does not take you seriously get a second opinion, many do not have experience and do not understand the dangers.\n\nRed dots are not much to worry about, usually side effects of Raynauds. Have about 20 on my hands right now and consider myself stable.\n\nYou can have Diffuse with very mild skin issues, always get checked out. Also a lot of the stuff you describe could be side effects from medication. Prednisone for me is pure agony. I am a 36M and have hot flashes like a 55 year old menopaused woman. That and Addisons.

Any suggestions for what other doctors I should see? Or is this not something to worry about? You should definitely go see a dermatologist as well. PCP probably will not be able to give a confident diagnosis, you need a biopsy Yeah my PCP did not think it was anything to worry about, she thought it was a bit odd, but could just be a vein? I do not know. I am seeing a derm on Friday. I have been trying to look back through photos to see if I have had it for awhile and it is possible I have had it since 2017 and just noticed it recently. Do you know how fast these things usually progress? Mine just appeared out of nowhere one day, and the first PCP I saw said it was \"probably\" eczema, she was not concerned at all. The second doctor did not feel confident enough to diagnose and sent me to a derm. If the derm is worth their salt they will suggest a biopsy Has yours progressed at all? Or largely stayed the same? Mine is so subtle right now that as long as it does not get worse it would really be fine. It is just so hard to find good info out there on the internet. Mine did not progress, but more popped up over the course of a few months. I do not have any on my face, they are mostly on and around my abdomen, and there is a couple on the middle of my back. My derm said that we caught them early enough to treat them, so hopefully I will be able to get rid of them. The topical treatment I am doing has made them noticeably softer to the touch and lighter in color so far Has anything else changed since your post? Yes, I have been using a topical treatment and it is been working, albeit slowly. The spots are getting a lot softer and lightening in color Thanks! That is ready good to hear! Has the coupe de sabre changed in any way? I am worried I might have it too and I am not sure what the best course of action is I do not have any marks on my head, just on my abdomen and back. If you are worried that you have it you should go see a dermatologist ASAP, preferably one that specializes in auto immune disorders if possible. The earlier you catch them the more treatable they are. If you let them burn out you may not be able to treat them. Ahh right thank you! I do not have any marks (I dont think) just the linear dent :S Do ylu think the dermatologist will be able to help with that? Will the doctors recommend it?\nThank you again! Hmm I do not know, but definitely see a doctor as soon as you can Thank you! I saw a doctor today, they said they do not think its anything but there is been a slight pain for the past few days. They have put me on a waiting list for a dermatologist but said it may be 6 months...idk what to do to slow it down Hi, has yours changed in any way at all? I think I had the same thing as you. A slight dent since around 2017/18 but as of the past week there is been discomfort and now from the past 3 days I feel like its slowly getting more noticeable...I am worried that it will get worse. The doctors think its nothing to worry about and had not heard of en coup de sabre but has put me on a waiting line for a dermatologist...\nWhat happened when you saw one? Speaking from personal experience and personal experience only I waited about the same amount of time for my appointment and it was fine. If your health insurance does not require a referral you could shop around if you felt strongly about going sooner but if you need a referral you may have to just hunker down and keep an eye on it for a bit Mine has not really changed, at least not that I can tell. I did see a dermatologist and she said to come in if I ever noticed it getting worse. She thinks it is mostly likely a fissure in my skull where pieces of my skull connect. She also said the one thing that would indicate a coup de Sabre is an actual hardening of the skin. So if you can pinch the skin together over the dent, it is probably fine.", "How do you manage your Raynaud\u2019s? 30/m here, officially diagnosed with CREST a few months ago. I have dealt with Raynaud\u2019s for a while now and it seems like it is getting more and more frequent lately. Is there anything you do to make your Raynaud\u2019s episodes less frequent or easier to deal with? Medication wise, calcium channel blockers, vasodialators, nitrobid ointment on fingers with bandages or disposable gloves so it will have time to absorb.\nMy rheumatologist said keeping your core body temp up is important too. \nOther than that, they are expensive, but rechargeable heated gloves are very nice to have around, especially when going outside. A cheaper option is to also keep heating pads near any places you spend time, living room, computer, bed - It is a nice quick heat source. My rheumatologist has me on a vasodilator and it is worked really well in controlling it. I rarely have an issue now and I had it so bad before I thought I was going to lose a toe. Cialis it is the best. My dad used vasodilator medication and Smartwool base layer clothes for everyday life. Always had a jacket handy. Keeping your core temperature warm will help your extremities. \n\nHe used HotHands (little heating packs) in his mittens for cold days. \n\nHeating pad to fold over his hands when he was in his recliner. \n\nHe also got a car with a heated steering wheel, which was surprisingly helpful. \n\nSome folks use battery-heated ski gloves, but dad decided that was too much fuss. I agree strongly with the keeping your core temp up recommendation. The thing that works best for me is to really get my heart rate up by running in place if I am inside, or energetic dancing , lol, or if I am outside to actually run...uphill is the best! Handwarmers work for me for prevention but increasing my heart rate is the best cure, IMO. Also, the worst thing for my Raynauds ever is eating...it must move all my blood out of my extremities and into my stomach. Does anyone else have this problem? My Raynauds is almost all hands, so I do not have much to say on feet except that non-metallic safety toes in good boots are great.\n\nThe Zippo hand warmers are lifesavers. The catalytic ones are better than the electric but the ones that look like giant beans are good enough and can double as a power bank. \n\nVibration can also be a trigger, so antivibration gloves when doing tasks like mowing are really helpful, too. If you happen to ride a motorcycle, cruise control is good and heated grips are a must. If you like a sportier bike, options with a cruise control are quite limited - BMW, KTM and Suzuki are the only ones I could find when I was looking (Super Duke GT is killer!).\n\nOn to digital ulcers. They can arise spontaneously but my experience is that more often they are some sort of tiny injury that just decides it does not want to heal, so keep an eye on anything that does not seem to be doing what it is supposed to. My rheum currently has me on nifedipine, and I try to always have gloves around me at all times. I wear a pair of cotton gloves to keep my hands soft after putting on lotion and then i put on regular winter type gloves. Having small heaters work really well and getting a vest is recommended to keep core body temp. I too take nifedipine and my rheumy recently doubled it when my raynauds episodes started increasing recently. Stress made my raynauds much much worse and I had a job with high expectations and stress levels.  But after I stopped working the number and intensity of the episodes significantly decreased. At a bare minimum, I never ever go barefoot; I always keep my core toasty, and I never go into my freezer without mittens on my hands. Practical advice. It' not cold or hot that is the problem but temperature changes. For me it is a change of 5 degrees. So silk socks and a good pair of gloves.\n\nAnd here is the big one. Avoid stress. Good or bad.

This swelling also leads to skin tightness and a patch of white sometimes,  sorta like what you see in a raynauds example but usually round and just encompassing where the hard lump is.  This all usually goes away by the next morning if I take it easy. \n\nDoes this sound like a schleroderma symptom?

Hi All, \n\nMy mom just got a confirmed diagnosis of morphea (confirmed by her derm via a punch biopsy). Her plaques are on both legs (spreading from ankles to lower legs). We are seeing the derm later this week to go over next steps but I have a hunch she might have systemic scleroderma for the following reasons: \n\n\\- She started also getting shortness of breath, fatigue and dizzyness around the same time her morphea started appearing this past summer / fall. We saw a pulmonologist back in the summer to figure out what the shortness of breath was caused by but after running some tests, he was not able to offer any conclusive diagnosis.   \n\\- Additionally, she had bloodwork done in the fall as part of her annual physical and the total blood count came back with abnormally high Eosinophils. From online reading, it looks like high Eosinophils can result from infection, cancer or indicate certain autoimmune disorders (I am thinking possibly scleroderma or shulman's syndrome).\n\nFor immediate next steps, I will ask her derm or general physician to run an ANA test. But I am curious to see if anyone here knows how specific of a diagnosis we can get from an ANA test. Will the ANA test be able to delineate between systemic scleroderma or skin-only morphea?  Or will the ANA test come back positive for scleroderma regardles if it is systemic or localized and we will need further testing ordered by a rheumotologist to narrow down the diagnosis.? \n\nAlso, if anyone has any experience with high Eosinophils, that would also be appreciated! Both her derm and general physician are stumped on this and are not able to confirm or deny if it connects to scleroderma. \n\n  \nThanks in advance!!", "Local girl battles rare, terminal disease  \"Scleroderma is a journey I never planned or asked for, but I\u00a0chose to love life, hate the disease and fight.\"\n\nFeeling inspired to fight hard and love harder.

I have been diagnosed with Raynaud's, Premature Ovarian Failure (early menopause), and Gastroparesis (my stomach does not digest food), with the gastroparesis thought to be caused by something autoimmune. My rheum studied at University of Texas where there is a scleroderma program so I trust her judgment that I do have SSC but the clear symptoms and  antibody results we are waiting on my body to produce.\n\nMy body's response to winter weather and sudden cold snaps went sky-high this past winter to a level that I had not experienced before. It put me into a flare with symptoms being a 10/10 where I could not move and breathing was difficult to focus on (those are the worst days I am sure you all know). During that flare, I also developed a rash on both hands that led to dry, cracked skin and a pigment change occurred where the rash was. My symptoms have been getting better with the warmer weather, but overall they are more severe and common than a year ago.\n\n It is weird thinking that because I am experiencing worsening symptoms I could get diagnosed with a specific autoimmune disorder (even if it is not Scleroderma).

So I was diagnosed in my early twenties. I am now 35. I have had a few problems over the years (very dry patches on my feet, legs and hands that peeled. Then same thing on my lips and around my mouth. Both went away within a few months) I struggle daily with extremely low energy, have for years. Hard to even talk myself into getting out of bed some days. I have tried B12 (kept me up at night) and changing my diet. I do not have a dermatologist. My grandmother died from this and I guess I am kind of afraid. Does anybody else have problems with low energy? What helps? Could I possibly have been misdiagnosed?? I have had limited scleroderma 28 years. I often have low energy. I think sometimes it is the body telling me to rest, but I also take B12 in the morning because if I take too late on the day then it will keep me up too. A couple of other vitamins scleroderma patients sometimes take are D3 with K2 and also iron. But you should have your blood levels tested before taking D or Iron. \n\nAnd the quality of the vitamins is very important. \n\nSome foods can make you tired. A functional medicine doc or functional medicine nutritionist should be able to help you figure out if you have food sensitivities that are causing fatigue. I tried taking the B12 in the morning and halving the dose, both kept me up at night, so I stopped. So are over the counter vitamins enough for you or do you have a prescription? I will have my levels checked before I do anything. Just curious. I am constantly exhausted. It worries me because sometimes the fatigue literally slaps me in the face and hard. It worries me at times how tired I feel, then somedays I have regular person energy. Regular person energy. I have actually called it that in my head. It is so weird. A couple of weeks ago I woke up full of energy. I got outside, mowed the yard, weedeated, killed some anthills, helped my fianc\u00e9e build a chicken coop... I felt like a goddess. I went over what I did the day before, what I ate trying to figure out what I would done differently. But it was just regular shit. I did not want the day to end because I felt normal for once. Then it was back to feeling worthless the next day. I was pissed. Superhuman powers!! I can totally relate. It sucks when that energy wears out. I always wonder what my  body liked that I did to make me feel normal also. I am sure it has to be something I have eaten or a combination of things. It is such a huge difference from the way I normally feel. If you figure it out first tell me what your secret is lol I will share with you when I figure it out too :) Deal!! I have never wanted to be average in anything in my life and now it is the thing I want most. I use \"over the counter\" but several come from my functional medicine doc office, since they are only available that way.  She is picky about the brands she recommends b/c of quality control reliability, but has helped me find good over the counter brands. There are many different forms of B12 and not everyone can tolerate all of them.  I cannot handle *any* methylated B vitamins.  This could perhaps be why they are not working for you.  Unfortunately other forms are not very bioavailable....so the struggle is real, as they say. What is your diet?  how is your sleep? ", "Newly diagnosed with Scleroderma Hi.  Just wanted to introduce myself here.  Maybe my journey can resonate with others and we can give each other some tips on how to manage this disease.  I was just diagnosed with Scleroderma a couple months ago.  The doctor said that I do not have a very severe case yet.  Her greatest concern was just that I make sure that I have yearly checks that my lungs stay healthy and I need to be careful about heartburn (she recommended taking Prilosec every day) I have been having some various health problems for several years, and they even ran a battery of tests after I had a stroke, as I was young for having one (44 at the time.)  \n\nAnyway,  the stroke left no side effects.  They thought I might have lupus which led to the stroke but the tests could not confirm.  I finally had more tests taken this past Summer/Fall.  Really, it was the Raynaud's syndrome that I thought might just be arthritis (which runs in my family).  But it appears to be Scleroderma.\n\nAll that said, I get tired so easily.  I will do just a small amount of housework and want to sit back down.  It makes me depressed because I feel like I have to pace myself to get anything done and many days I feel like I am not accomplishing much.  Thankfully we are in a situation where I do not have to work right now (I cannot even imagine having a full-time job with this!)  \n\nI had already gone gluten free before the diagnosis and found that helped my energy level substantially.  I just thought maybe my problems were due to gluten issues.  But the rheumatologist said that avoiding gluten was a good idea because it lowers the inflammation.  She said I could avoid sugar and dairy too.  I told her I might rather die young. ;)  LOL  Seriously though, I have started to think about avoiding sugar.  That will be hard though.  \n\nI have also added several vitamins to my daily regimen.  In addition to a multi-vitamin, I added turmeric (for lowering inflammation) as well as fish oil.  I do feel good when I take Ibuprofen too, but I try to limit the amount I take as it can be bad for our livers to take too much of it.  \n\nAnd, the silver lining in it all, is I now feel more justified in getting foot reflexology treatments.  There are several local places that charge $25 an hour (tips additional of course) but I find that the lengthy foot and hand massages are really helpful for me.  The most painful part of the day was just getting out of bed in the morning.  It was like pins and needles going up my legs when I would stand up.  The foot massages really reduce the pain and for a few days I feel way better. I guess the massage therapy helps with blood flow and circulation.  So, it is nice to have a reason to go.  I used to feel like it was just an unnecessary luxury.  I am now just budgeting it in for once a week as a treatment.  It has been a couple of months I think it has helped quite a bit.  \n\nOh, and I am becoming really careful to carry around gloves now too!  My doctor said that I was blessed to live in a warm climate, because our hands and feet get so cold.  I have noticed it more than ever this year.  Even touching cold things in the freezer is super painful now.  I cannot imagine living somewhere colder than here.  This winter has been pretty chilly already though. Sorry to hear about your diagnosis and health problems. I quit gluten, dairy and most sugars and feel a lot better. I do not know if its made a difference in my disease progression but I feel better in other areas of my life for sure including heartburn and GERS! Just wanted to include that and encourage you to try it! I also quit gluten and sugar and it has made a difference. Be careful with the ibuprofen. It caused erosion of my husband \u2018s esophagus. I am definitely keeping that in mind.  I think it is such a difficult choice to make though, as just going gluten free for the past several years has been a challenge.  My husband has allergies too, so it already feels like we are on this strange diet. (He cannot have soy and also has problems with various other things such as MSG, canola, some mustards, leeks, and cabbage)  \n\nI am drinking a latte right now (with sugar) and thinking how can I give up dairy and sugar too?  I eat yogurt almost every morning.  That is kind of my main staple, as well as two or three cups of coffee with cream/sugar too.  Sigh.  But then if I am tired all the time and have no energy I guess these are the difficult compromises we have to make.\n\nI have not really struggled with GERD or heartburn yet, maybe some subtle signs that it is a problem, but I was told that is one of the most dangerous things to watch out for. The gluten free diet has not been horrible.  Giving up sugar though?  That seems so much harder than gluten to me.  I love my morning coffee with cream/sugar.  I love chocolate.  I really do not like any of the sugar substitutes either.  I actually get major migraines from aspartame.  Sigh.  But if I keep feeling tired and no energy I will have to give this a try I think. I have read this.  The doctor even told me to only use it sparingly.  I try to avoid it, but if I am going to have a day where I need to be active I will take it to basically keep up. I like coffee with cream, chocolate, etc too. \n\nI make my morning coffee with half and half and/or heavy cream and dark chocolate powder...(Hershey's)As far as sugar substitute Splenda works for me (Within reason) it overall seems to work well, minimal digestive issues.  \nHope this helps. I will use Splenda but I can get some stomachaches and bloating at times from it. Giving up sugar is extremely hard for the first 3weeks if you get over that hump it is gets so much easier. Look at the Keto diet. I make coffee in the morning with 2 tablespoons of butter, one tablespoon of coconut oil blend altogether and at first I put some whip cream on top and it is pretty good.

Please share your experience what did you have done and why ... did it help and boost your confidence? Or just any surgery for functional reasons or cosmetic reasons Often when I say I have had plastic surgery, I am a bit fearful of the stigma that can sometimes be associated with it especially from those who do not understand what scleroderma is, but I had two major rounds of it and they had huge impacts on my self-esteem. I had fat injections along the damaged areas of the left side of my face to make the left side look like the right and to create more natural looking features. While I am immensely proud of having scleroderma as it is made me who I am, I am honestly also just as happy to no longer have to get questions from people on it outright (like, \u201chey, what is that thing on the side of your face?\u201d which has happened before). Thank you for commenting i know what you mean like i never thought of having plastic surgery till i got this illness and hey were just getting back our features i dont see nothing wrong with that! I had jaw surgery and genioplasty while i needed it for certain functioning reasons it also aesthetically made me look more attractive. Im looking into getting my lips done and also fat grafting to the face and lips. Im glad yours went good. Exactly! Right there with you. If it is done for the right reasons (and our reasons absolutely are), I totally support plastic surgery. It made a huge difference for me, and I am happy that I chose to do it. hi there how were you able to find a good plastic surgeon? i am sorry this is a big question but right now i am attempting to find one to fix a side of my face as well. i have had no success with a hyaluronic acid/i think it was juvederm filler Yes, I had juvederm filler a few times in my lips before getting more significant surgery done! The juvederm was only temporary and faded after a few months. I was recommended to a surgeon by my rheumatologist when I was previously at the Cleveland Clinic. So your doctor would be a good place to start. The surgeon I saw was Dr. Bahman Guyuron, who is also based in the Cleveland, Ohio area if you are U.S.-based. Otherwise, actually speaking to my dentist about it also gave me some leads! He was able to connect me with someone who worked on mouth reconstruction needs who then recommend Dr. Guyuron. So that may be an avenue for you also! What was your surgery called? Thanks for the info! I do not believe there was a term for it, that I can recall. To be more specific about it, doctors took fat from other areas of my body and injected those deposits into the impacted areas of my face. No incisions. They also used stem cells in an attempt to counter the scleroderma (it did not work, but no harm in trying!). Total recovery time was about 1-2 weeks. Oohh i think that is a PRP fat graft. Sorry it did not work for you i read that a lot it will last for a short period of time and then your body will reabsorb. Thanks for sharing! To clarify, the cosmetic surgery worked and held! That part of it was successful. The stem cells, however, were unsuccessful. This was a new treatment at the time, and the theory was that the stem cells would stop future localized scleroderma flare-ups. This did not happen; I just had him give it a shot because he was doing work all up in there anyway so why not? Ahhh ok thank you for clarifying Im happy it at least benefited something for you! Take care :)", "Children with suspected localized scleroderma should see specialist ", "since ptsd is common with this illness. ", "Wondering about coup de sabre.  I was diagnosed with localized scleroderma at the age of around 10 to 12. I had one patch on my back which resolved, and I never thought about it again. Now at the age of 40, I am noticing this vertical indentation on my forehead. It is not very noticeable and there is no discoloration. I plan to check in with a dermatologist but thought I would ask for some opinions here from people who have experienced it. what is coup de sabre?  decades of living with scleroderma but not heard of that. A linear form of localized scleroderma specific to the forehead. I am not sure how I came across it to be honest, but when I saw that it was a type of morphea I wondered if this could be what I have (even though it is apparently rare). How long have you had it for??\n\nI have not had coup de sabre so I cannot say for sure but it does look like it could be starting there. I hope not though. It is difficult to say for sure, but it has been at least a couple of months. I tried to look back at photos but it is not easy to see in pictures since it is so faint. I have the EXACT same thing! Same location! Have you had it long? Was it diagnosed?  Heeyoo, got linear scleroderma as well. Started on my forehead and it progressed around my scalp and diagonally across my face/jaw. I cannot grow facial hair on the right side of my face as a consequence. \n\nYour case appears fairly mild, so that is pretty cool. \ud83d\ude0e Actually it is specific to skin in general (derma) and progress in a straight line (linear). Forehead is the most common place but it can occur anywhere on the skin.\n\nThere is usually some discoloration and it gets itchy intermittently. Onset typically occurs in childhood and fizzles out in mid to late adolescence. Should add that my (28M) onset occurred when I was 8 and stopped around age 14. Living in Canada (woo!) I had three reconstructive plastic surgeries free of charge. Still itches sometimes and occasionally becomes purplish like a bruise. From what I have read, en coup de sabre refers specifically to the forehead. Thanks for your response, and for sharing your experience. Mine is definitely mild; so mild infact that I wonder if it is something else! Mine started last summer it it is not quite as far down on my forehead yet. I live in a rural area and even when I travel a couple of hours away it seems I cannot find a great rheumatologist and or derm, especially one that is a specialist in scleroderma. So now I am trying the immunologist dr route. I cannot get in for a few months. It is both extremely alarming and frustrating. I have definitely had morphea start as an indent in my skin but also sometimes it starts as just a brown spot. Really hoping it is not en coup de sabre! I was referring more to linear scleroderma, en coup de sabre is just when linear scleroderma happens on the face--I see where I misunderstood you. How did you get your morphea to resolve? I also have lower back morphea I was young and only had the one patch. I was not treated and it eventually faded out on its own (I have no recollection of how long it was). It faded to white, and is barely noticeable now.", "I need a new doctor You guys. My test for SCL-70 came back negative. I am getting worse. I messaged my rheumatologist. This is the two responses I received:\n\n\u201cThanks for the pictures, that helps. I reviewed your chart extensively, I have a very low suspicion for scleroderma (labs are negative, etc). That being said, I do not have an explanation for the peeling and skin changes on your finger tips. For now keep using the topical steroid from derm and keeping them protected. I wonder if it is worth checking in with derm again to get some more possibilities?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am sorry you are at your wits end with all of this. The arm falling asleep and finger tip peeling are not from an autoimmune disease. Our focus is on certain automimmune diseases, so there is little we can do for this. Follow up with derm and see if your PCP has any more suggestions in terms of your arm falling asleep.\u201d\n\nWhat? I have used the same cream for 7 months. Does not a rheumatologist generally cover all autoimmune? There is no other tests they can run? I went to dermatology bawling and all she could do was try a nitroglycerin cream. \n\n( That is definitely not scleroderma, you would be seeing a bunch of other things wrong and scleroderma is life threatening so be glad it is not that. See derma like the doc said. And if toy want go to another rheumatologist. But do not mention scleroderma, because that will just waste time and prolong your pain. Keep it covered I would not say definitely. My fingers look a lot like that when my Raynaud's has been busy and my hands certainly do fall asleep easily as a result.\n\nBut every autoimmune under the sun has Raynaud's, so... yeah. My two biggest symptoms of scleroderma are GERD and Raynaud's, the latter of which leads to (among other things) peeling skin on my fingers and my hands falling asleep easily. Some of those sores also look like they could be small digital ulcers. Raynaud's was also my first symptom I noticed.\n\nHowever, it seems like most autoimmunes have Raynaud's to one degree or another and YMMV within groups. Did they just do SCL70 or did they do others like anti-centromere or DsDNA? Anti-centromere is also indicative of a type of scleroderma and DsDNA is typically Lupus related. Just scl-70. I have had gastro issues for years along with organ failure and a stroke. I am taking medicine for the Reynauds. I just really feel defeated and like I am crazy. Yeah, I would try to get anti-centromere done as well, there is A and B as I recall. A is CREST associated B is something else, as I recall. IIRC there is also an SCL 100. That Is why I am saying definitely. There would be a few other problems if they had scleroderma and it seems like they have been dealing with this for a little. No complaints of tight shiny skin, no complaints of swallowing issues, no complaints of finger stiffness, no positive scl-70. This is easily not scleroderma Thank you. I had no idea there were so many different tests. I really like how you gathered all of my medical history from this one post. I am not going to go off on one post about the tight shiny skin (that I do get on face and fingers), or the fact that my first symptom 4 years ago was difficulty swallowing, or the GERD and the colitis and the reflux, or the organ failure and the stroke. I hope it is not scleroderma. I would also hope my doctor would be seeking a solution instead of saying \u201cweird, I do not know\u201d. Why would you post one random symptom and not the others? Especially Raynaud\u2019s.... which is so common and stands alone more times than not? \n\nDid you come to complain or seek advice? Because if you came to vent it is a little out of touch to vent to people actually diagnosed with something you \u201cthink\u201d you might have. Did not want to assume you would do that...\n\nAsking for advice or suggestions, makes sense and is 100% okay to do, I would imagine that is half of what we are in this group for. Which as someone who has scleroderma (diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis), i would love to help with. With that said, if you are going to ask for help with a pseudo diagnosis give the people you are asking the correct information. \n\nDiagnosing scleroderma is very difficult as there is no one test that can tell you that you have it. So when you make this post only outlining one symptom there is nothing else anyone can go off of but your word. Anyone would need to know what symptoms you are having related to scleroderma to understand. ESPECIALLY when the symptom you gave us was Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. \n\nHelp us help you Oh, there is a ton of them for different autoimmunes.\nI do not think this is anywhere near a complete list but it will give you an idea.\n Im going to call bullcrap on your doctor. Fingertip peeling does occur for alot of us. As for tingling and buzzing in hand is usually carpal tunnel or tendonitits but it can be autoimmune related. You should of posted all symptoms because at first I was going to say it doesnt sound like scleroderma could of been the only possibility. But back to tingling that  can bew AI it can even be MS its one of those warning signs. However I get it with my morphea. You should be on imnmunosuppresents to stop it from progressing further you should see a scleroderma specialist you can google one in your area There are other things that can cause Raynaud's. I imagine if it was bad enough the finger tip problems would occur similar to scleroderma. Thoracic outlet syndrome can cause Raynaud's and arm numbness. Thank you! I would assume the doctor would have done more tests to follow up and narrow down what it might be. I am so sorry you are going through that... I wish no one had to go through the same battles I did. My best advice is to listen to your own body and do not stop advocating for yourself.  If your rheumatologist is not hearing you, find a new one. My former rheumatologist (Yale educated, top in the country) diagnosed me with leukemia, some other hematology things... and told me that my symptoms were absolutely not autoimmune related.  She was actually downright dismissive and rude.\n\nMeanwhile, My GP kept running tests because she said \u201cthis is not normal. I really think you have lupus.\u201d  Thank god she did because my ANA eventually popped up positive. The scleroderma specialist I finally saw went \u201cdid your rheumatologist even look at your nail folds?\u201d  I eventually saw a second scleroderma specialist and FINALLY have a doctor I have complete confidence in. He said I am classic early scleroderma and we are going to manage this together.  I no longer feel crazy, overwhelmed, or alone. \n\nDo NOT give up. Unfortunately, you may have multiple doctors misunderstand. You know your body. You KNOW this is not normal. Keep fighting. And do not stay with a doctor that may be listening.. but is obviously not hearing you. \u2764\ufe0f", "19 male, Scl-70 positive once at 1.0 and then rheum redid blood tests and scl-70 came back 1.1 Is this scleroderma? I have full body pain every day notably in my lower back, neck, and then joins all over my body. When I am cold my limbs convulse and tremor and if I am laying down when I get too cold I get trapped laying down in tremors and them I get this warm sharp feeling through all of my nerves, I guess, especially sharp in my palms. Nothing helps with the pain. My rheumatologist says that even though my scl-70 positive twice he does not think I have enough skin involvement to call it Sclero. Instead he diagnosed me with fibromyalgia and primary reynauds. I was given Gabapentin but now whenever I get hot on top of my previous hot/cold sensitivity I feel this itchy pin prick sensation travel up my nerves. Only notable skin involvement are painful bumps on my scalp  Hdhe Raynauds is primary symptom of scleroderma. To me it sounds like you have it. Did you get your ANA pattern checked? If it comes up as nucleolar pattern that will also signify scleroderma.  They did a pattern but I cannot see the results on the web portal I am not a rheum, so I would trust what they say over anything I say in a heartbeat. But I have heard that SCL-70 is primarily indicative of the diffuse type of sclero, which may or may not have the hallmark skin involvement associated with the limited type.\n\nThat being said, you could very well not have sclero, since it is a disease that is diagnosed by symptoms and not by the blood work. Get a second opinion from a different rheumatologist, and be aggressive about getting tests, specialist consults, and providers you like.\n\nOn a final note, my rheum always stresses that the number is irrelevant. 1.3 is not worse than 1.0, that does not mean your disease is worse/better. The only thing that matters is the effect on your body. Do not focus on the number, pay attention to the condition of your body because that is where all your answers will be.\n\nI will be wishing the best for you as you try to find an answer to your condition. Do not forget to eat/sleep well and try to avoid as much stress (health-related and otherwise) as possible! These can be more important than many people realize. I had the same scl 70 positive twice, and ana positive and my rheum diagnosed me with scleroderma. I thought I had fibromyalgia, which is why I first went to her. I do not have a lot of skin involvement either, imo. The skin on my legs is extremely dry and is maybe starting to get hard but I am not sure because there is no bands or anything. The skin on my legs is just never soft anymore no matter how much oils and creams I use. I have a spot on my scalp that gets crusty and has no hair that my dermatologist just shrugs their shoulders, and I have lost almost all my eyebrows and half my eyelashes. Other than that, I was having ibs type symptoms (which has gotten better with super strong probiotics), joint aches and muscle aches allover like you (which is improving on Plaquenil), and I have extremely cold feet, but not so much my hands.  Damn this all sounds familiar, my hands are cold but my feet are always extremely cold. Thanks for the comment ", "systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma Hey,\n\nI am going to ask my question up front. How is systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma diagnosed? It would appear that its almost impossible to diagnose until it impacts your lungs if google was to be believed.\n\nA few months ago I made a post that ill link ( for reference. My medical adventure has made a bit of progress. They re ran my ANA, found it was negative but I still had a positive SSA of 7.4 (range of  &lt;1.0 = NEG). My Rheumatologist ran a bunch of other tests which found nothing.\n\n Meanwhile my GI ran another abdominal CTA scan, which found wall thickening of my colon. They also ran calprotectin test which tested positive for intestinal inflammation. They then ran another colonoscopy, endoscopy as well as a capsule scope, in which they found nothing and the biopsies found no signs of IBD. All they found was scarring in my esophagus and stomach, but I do not have acid reflux. They also ran a Prometheus test which also ruled out IBD. \n\nThe Rheumatologist stated that I do not have any visible or hallmark symptoms of Sjogren's, Scleroderma or any other connective tissue diseases to meet the criteria for diagnosis. HOWEVER, he brought up the IDEA of systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.\n\nMy GI is at a total loss, up until recently he had diagnosed me with IBS and nonspecific esophageal dysmotility. But the recent CTA and other tests made him question if it is that simple.\n\nI have not seen my pulmonologist since the post I made, but as I said in that post, in September of 2020 my lungs tested to be functioning above expectations. \n\n**Just an overview of my symptoms and diagnoses...**\n\nEsophageal Dysmotility\n\nSlow transit constipation (  intestinal dysmotility )\n\nNon-acid reflux\n\nAnd more disgusting GI issues, essentially my entire GI system is borked.\n\n**What I do not have...**\n\nNo dry mouth or eyes\n\nNo skin problems\n\nNo apparent breathing issues\n\nfunctioning heart\n\nfunctioning kidneys\n\nIt appears all my doctors think I have an autoimmune disease, but none of that have been able to prove it so far...\n\nThanks. A lot of people start out this way with no definitive diagnosis. They usually refer to it as undifferentiated connective tissue disease. It may or may not turn into a specific diagnosis later. It is a long road, for some, to getting diagnosed. Continue to get your ANA tested yearly, along with maybe a lung function test or CT scan of the lungs. Also, keep a journal of your symptoms.", "Bizarre presentation, looking for people with similar experience I am a 30yo male. Looking for someone with similar symptoms. Specifically I am trying to decide whether to get a second opinion or trust my Rheum\u2019s somewhat dismissive \u201cdo not worry about it\u201d advice.

Would not hemmorhaging due to reynauds by definition be secondary, scary raynaud\u2019s?\n\n- Parent with asymptomatic but diagnosed CREST.\n\n- Ana positive at 1:40 (low, I know) Homogenous and Speckled but no specific antibodies including Scl-70, ACA, RNP, and RNAP. \u201cUnknown clinical signfigance\u201d according to my Rheum (who may actually be a robot)?\n\n- Mild to moderate joint pain but I rock climb regularly. It seems to be worse than any of my similarly active friends get but definitely correlated.\n\n- Tiny small \u201cscars\u201d on joints. About 1 cm long. Do not seem to be from specific trauma.\n\nThanks I am advance. I am riding the anxiety train and appreciate it! Hi there. I do not have similar experiences to you, but I can share that my scleroderma specialist (Northwestern) told me that the nail fold capillaries are related to the raynaud's. So, that does back up what your rheum said. My initial PFT and echo came back with very mild abnormalities. It is entirely possible that you could be very early in prognosis so not seeing any signs of problems. If you are having lung issues, you may want to do a PFT to see if you have something going on-- that can determine if you may have asthma or something else causing the functioning issues, whether or not that may be related to scleroderma.\n\nI am curious how your parent was diagnosed with CREST? My scleroderma specialist was very direct with me in how it is diagnosed, and it required a number of present symptoms to be diagnosed. When I first started having signs, I tested positive for RNA Pol3, had joint pain, raynaud's and GI issues. They gave me an unspecified diagnosis and did not give me the full scleroderma diagnosis until I started having visible skin thickening, which took a couple years to develop. The only reason they talked to me about scleroderma early on was because of the presence of the antibody, but people can have the antibody without ever fully developing the disease, and you can develop the disease without the antibodies. It is not well understood.\n\nRaynaud's is somewhat common and seen in a good number of autoimmune disorders. It is possible you could be developing a different autoimmune disorder, too. Or you may just have Raynaud's. I would not zero in on scleroderma quite yet because it seems very early and you do not have many symptoms developed.\n\nI think it makes sense to get a second opinion anytime you are dealing with autoimmune disorders--many are not very well known, and so many of them have some overlap with symptoms. Write out a list of your symptoms and start logging symptoms daily. This will help you notice any trends (e.g., if you have joint pain exclusively following climbs or if you have it randomly). I would also recommend starting up turmeric supplements and cutting down on any foods that increase inflammation. With a positive ANA, that points to something autoimmune, which means your symptoms will be helped greatly if you modify your eating habits shift to reduce inflammation. There is an autoimmune protocol diet that is a structured approach to identifying specific foods that make cause symptom increases for you. I highly recommend it. It greatly reduced my pain frequency and severity. I feel sorely lacking to respond to this question, but I do have one piece of advice.\n\n Seek out a specialist, if you are in the US consider Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, etc. They have offices across the country, not just at their main location. What I have found is general Rheumatologists do not always know the details - scleroderma is rather rare.  Since I established myself with a specialist that I see once a year, I can get in if I ever need to without waiting for a new patient appointment .  I see my regular Rheum every three months or if I need them, and they read what the specialist says and pretty much follow that advice.  When I established I was nearly Asymptomatic, but now I know the signs of advancement that mean I should call them and they monitor me year to year.  \n\nAdditionally, I find the Facebook pages are very active, while reddit scleroderma groups are quieter. This is great advice. Specifically the journaling. \n\nMy PFT came back with mild restriction (FVC 80%) but due to a normal lung capacity the pulmonologist said it was a \u201cnormal\u201d PFT. They still scheduled the X-ray and CT which were completely clean. No asthma, also tested. That was a year ago. Next month I am getting an exercise function test. This is the big concern. I am optimistic it is not scleroderma/autoimmune related but unsure.\n\nAs for the CREST diagnosis I am not sure of the rubric, if any, they used aside from antibodies (ACA 1:640? I think). Several years ago now. \n\nWas planning on trying the AIP diet but this is definitely more encouragement to do so.\n\nZeroed in on Scleroderma because of the parent with it (probably) and Raynauds+Nailfold bleeding. Interesting to know this non-specific. Thanks I appreciate it. The advice on specialist is good and it is basically what I was leaning towards! The antibody testing can have false positives. If the parent does not have any symptoms, they likely do not have CREST, especially if they have not had any symptom progression years after the test. My rheum had me do the antibody testing twice, and the scleroderma specialist ran them a third time to confirm through a separate lab because of the potential for false positives. \n\nMy rheum dismissed my early testing too. My echo had a couple mild issues, but he said it was not abnormal so he was not worried. He did not get concerned until my PFT came back with some \"unusual\" abnormalities that do not even relate to the scleroderma. My specialist was more concerned about my echo than the PFT, but my rheum had me do a repeat 6 months later to see if there was much progression. \n\nI have lucked out that mine is very slow-moving. That is the hardest part about the illness I think. You do not really know how it will go because everyone is progression is unique and varies quite a lot. All forms of scleroderma should only every be diagnosed based on clinical symptoms. So an inexperienced doctor in scleroderma could of given that diagnosis if they are asymptomatic. So I would not hold onto that if they diagnosed based on antibodies. Now Scleroderma does have a genetic component if you are native there is a connection there. There is also known things to increase your changes like silica. It may be worth seeing a scleroderma specialist to be safe. You can find them on ( or you can find a scleroderma center. Now as for the Raynaud there are two types primary and secondary. Secondary Raynaud's is what I believe you get with scleroderma and is caused by it for the systemic forms. Morphea patients can have Raynaud's but for them its primary and not related. Autoimmune diseases run in families but sclerderma in most doctors opinions does not have a genetic connection some say it increases your chance by 1% but theres no proof. Considering you have some of the clinical symptoms id see a specialist and get their opinion i was going to respond with an answer similar enough to this one that i am going to be lazy and just let you know that i agree and think its good advise-  you may be asymptotic or minimally so now and that could change in a few years. stay in touch with your dr and let them know if things progress. Hi could you please PM the name of your specialist? We are in the same area and I am desperate for a new rheum who will actually address my symptoms instead of just pushing plaquenil. There is a specialty ( on the scleroderma foundation website that may be helpful. This may help you find someone in your insurance network better than me just naming mine.", "Lab info reading  Flow chart for labs Thank you for this!

Medicine has improved a lot and so has the knowledge of scleroderma it might make life more challenging but as long as you are getting treatment now they can slow it down a lot. My advice would be to see a Scleroderma specialist. If you are in the states you can find them on ( you will be able to find your nearest scleroderma specialist or nearest scleroderma centre. If you are diagnosed you will most likely be put on an immunosuppressant to stop/limit progression and for some put them into remission. Remission can be your whole life or it can be a month. There is no way to predict it. I recommend checking out the scleroderma foundation youtube channel if you get diagnosed as well as ( and the scleroderma education project. Getting a diagnosis of Scleroderma is not a death sentence. I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years. I have had plenty of challenges but am living a full life.

Is this something related to scleroderma or just a bad gut? I take probiotics and gas x like its candy. I have been diagnosed with IBS in the past. I had the same thing for 15 years before getting other symptoms of Scleroderma, I found limiting certain parts of my diet was the only real way to control it (other than PPI's).  For me going veggie was the main fix, but other things work for other people. My daughter was recently diagnosed with scleroderma, but she is been complaining of stomach pain for like six years. When the stomach pain first started there were lots of test done with no conclusive help, but when we found scleroderma for other reasons, I suspected that her stomach pain might be related. I am going vegetarian and it took care of a lot for me. There is still something triggering me and I am not sure what yet. I have extremely low motility from sclerodoma attackin small intestine. Took years to figure out. That also gave me an odd form of IBS-cic. The burning in the stomach I also have and is from the esophagus shrinking. Have you had colonoscopy and upper endoscopy? You are probably experience GERD which is super common in Scleroderma patients.

One thing that took me years to figure out was chewing up Gaviscon tablets when I am getting a burning stomach helps me tremendously and fast. Secondly, with Scleroderma gut motility is a huge problem. With this motility issue you can develop SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, it also causes a lot of uncomfortable symptoms like excess gas, burping, bloating etc. I would get checked for SIBO, if that is what you have because of the slow motility probiotics are probably making your everyday symptoms worse.

Thank you 20+ year an coup de sabre champion here, meaning I have had a few rounds of filler in my lifetime! I had pretty decent experiences with juvederm. It evened things out, and I got it done about every one to two years. The first time I got it done was tough, as I did not get in with a surgeon who was particularly well-versed in the needs of scleroderma patients. I have found personally that the scleroderma-impacted areas on my face are especially sensitive to pain. If you have a similar experience, I would recommend bringing that up with any possible surgeon. Do note that once you find the right doc, the injections take anywhere between five and ten minutes and are a breeze. You may have some swelling and bruising, but it goes away after a few days generally. When I was still getting filler (I later ended up having more permanent plastic surgery done), I had a great experience with my local dentist, who explained that dentists are more attuned to preventing pain in the face area.

I have been getting the runaround from my rheumatologist for the past few months. Most recently she has decided that my symptoms might indicate scleroderma and she wants to put me on plaquenil. But after researching more about the disease, I am fairly certain this is a misdiagnosis and I do not want to go on any medication until I am certain (or at least less skeptical) of what I have. I am do not have a medical background, but something just feels wrong about this diagnosis. I figured people who actually have the disease might be able to shed some light. \n\nSome info: 36yo female. Diagnosed with hypothyroidism and Raynauds at 19. Nothing more done by any docs beside prescription synthroid. About 9 months ago became very symptomatic and was finally diagnosed with Hasimotos. Also had a positive ANA test (1:80). Symptoms included hair loss, depression, brain fog, mood swings, fatigue, and severe itchy skin and a total body rash. \nSaw a rheumatologist about 6 months ago and tested negative for all common autoimmune tests, but still had a positive ANA (this time 1:640). Adopted an AIP lifestyle and adjusted my thyroid meds and have seen improvements on all symptoms except the itching and rash. Saw a dermatologist and allergist, both think my skin issues are autoimmune. Went back to the rheumatologist who then decided it is scleroderma. I have no joint issues, my skin is relatively normal aside from the rash. CT scan and echo have come back normal. Recently saw an endocrinologist who did an ultrasound and my thyroid is basically gone. He does not think the itching is thyroid related but he also seemed skeptical of scleroderma. Lupus has been thrown around and so have othe autoimmune issues, but the only antibodies I have tested positive for are Hashis. \n\nI am exhausted from all of this and I just want my skin to stop itching, which I was told the plaquenil would not help with. I am so confused. Any insight or help would be appreciated.  I am so sorry you have been having so many health issues recently!\n\nI was diagnosed with limited scleroderma based on my positive ANA (&gt;1:320) and positive centromere B autoantibody (&gt;8.0) three years ago, in combination with my symptoms which include inflammatory pain in my rib cage and lower leg, GERD, and some tiny calcinoses in my fingers.  I do not have the classic Raynaud\u2019s, but I have been told that not everyone who has this does.\n\nIf you have not had the centromere B autoantibody test or the SCL 70 autoantibody test, I would suggest that you ask your rheumatologist to perform them.  The first test can help identify limited scleroderma, formerly known as CREST syndrome, while the second can help identify diffuse scleroderma.  These two forms carry different prognoses and can manifest in different ways, so it is helpful to know which one you are dealing with.\n\nMy understanding is that if you do have scleroderma, there is no one cure for the disease, but you can treat the symptoms.   I believe some rheumatologists may treat it using methotrexate, or other immune-suppressing drugs.  I have no experience with plaquenil so I cannot offer any info on that.  Actually, I am not currently being treated with anything because I am undergoing IVF.\n\nBest of luck to you as you move forward.  I hope you feel better and that you can find a treatment that helps with your symptoms.  \n\n Thanks so much! \nI did have both of those tests performed back in January and they came back negative. I also just had my ANA redone in April and that also came back negative for the first time. I am confused by the scleroderma diagnosis if both of the antibody tests came back negative.  I had a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis when I was not testing positive for it. I was on plaquenil for 1.5 years. The plaquenil helped for the first half of that time. I had problems with the generic brand so the needed the brand name which was expensive. It may help more than one autoimmune issue. The plaquenil is very mild in that it is not a biological medication; it is also safe enough to use while pregnant (that is their point to show how safe it is to take).", "Vertical dent on forehead (not visible in the mirror, but very noticeable when you touch it) I have a weird dent right between my eyebrows (a little more to the right).

Hey guys. \nAbout a year ago, i had constant swelling in 2 fingers that would flare up every couple weeks for about 2-3 months. I decided to get some blood work done, with everything coming back negative, including an ANA multiplex reflex test. I decided to go to a rheumatologist to get more thorough testing done and so ordered a full blood panel. My ANA using the gold standard IFA was negative, however my SCl-70 was slightly positive (score of 44 with 1-30 being normal). He had a medical assistant call me and tell me i was diagnosed with systemic sclerosis and that was it. I was in constant anxiety for 6 months because i just knew my life was going to chance. However, it just did not sit right with me that i had no new symptoms and my swelling was gone. I have occasional joint pain but nothing that lined up with scleroderma, therefore I went to my PCP and she ordered an ANA multiplex again as well as the Scl-70 antibody on its own. Both came back negative. I thought i would be relieved but I am still constantly over analyzing my body everyday. Even after I got the negative test results, i still felt paranoid. I pinch my skin everyday to reassure myself that my skin is not thickening and that i dont have scleroderma. However, for the past few months, I have had a constant lump in my throat which I assume is due to anxiety. But then last week, i started having full on Heartburn and now I am anxious again that Im developing symptoms for scleroderma.

I have been trying to do some research but have not come up with any solid answers. Anybody have any knowledge about this that they can share?

She was feeling better for a while but now she has been having worryingly high heartbeats per minute  with her having over 100BPM just when taking it easy after waking up. \nShe is very worried herself and naturally I am worried too. Do you know if this is some kind of a new stage to the scleroderma and if it is anything severe to worry about? Thanks in advance.

The scelroderma suspicion has risen from a seemingly incurable bout of GERD I am suffering from, and I realised that I may have other symptoms - however, ever so marginally. In terms of tight skin, the only real occurrence seems to be over my spine (which does not seem like a traditional symptom), however, my feet have light Raynaud's and red marks.

The scleroderma foundation also has a YouTube channel I highly recommend checking it out they have videos from all the scleroderma conferences where the top experts in th4 field speak. I recommend looking at the localized scleroderma video from 2018 it talks about all forms of scleroderma not jsut localized so its worth giving it a look. It talks about diagnosis which should always be done by symptoms. A skin biopsy can tell you you have scleroderma it cannot distinguish your subtype but may day morphea it should say excess collagen again outdated information. All they can see from it is excess collagen pointing to scleroderma. There are blood tests but again most doctors do not know all the antibodies to test for and some with scleroderma are not showing antibodies this probably just means we are missing an antibody in the research that we are not looking for yet. \n\nMy recommend would be yo read up on the two websites I mentioned and checkout the YouTube channel.

Had it since I was 15 (male), now 21. Has remained same, just worried of this being Morphea. Any views are welcome.  I have had morphea since I was a year old (I am now 24) so I am not a doctor but based on my experience I do not think this is scleroderma especially if it has not changed in 6 years. Is the area easy to move around when you touch it, or does it feel tight/dense?\n\nEdit: considering you have hair growing from the lesion I doubt it is related, and if it is, the lesion is not active from what I can tell, so not something to really worry about I would say. Morphea makes the affected area pretty much impossible for hair to grow. No it feels okay, no tightness or weirdness. Its just that I grew it suddenly around when I was 14-15 and it has remained the same since. Just been worrying a little bit too much about this lately. Thank you for taking out time and writing and replying. I am a super anxious person and this does ease my anxiety. You are very welcome and yeah that is perfectly fair. I can get very anxious about this stuff too. Honestly though as someone who is had it almost her entire life and seen many doctors, I think you are okay.  If it feels like normal skin it is certainly not active morphea and therefore it is not something to worry about. Could just be pigmentation changes similar to developing a normal mole or freckles.\n\nIF it starts to get red or stiff and feel like scar tissue and the hair starts to fall out (these are signs to look for), then try to go see a doctor (does not have to be a specialist but ideally one with some dermatology and/or rheumatology experience). What they would do is freeze the area with a local anesthetic, take a quick biopsy and send it to the lab for results. In most cases, morphea does go away on it is own within a few years, and is usually not a life altering thing, so even if it was morphea I think it would be manageable. But again, I do not think you are dealing with morphea, just explaining this all in case more info will give you some comfort. Feel free to ask me any other questions if it helps, I can answer from my own experience. I have linear localized scleroderma, and based on this photo I do not think this looks like morphea - however, I would keep an eye on it and maybe get a dermatologist to take a look at it just in case (since everyone with Scleroderma experiences it a bit differently). If it is not bothering you and has not changed since it appeared, I would think that it is likely something benign. Does not look like any morphea I have or have seen. Thank you very much, I feel so much better already. I am sorry that you have it, and all the stuff you have had to go through, sending looots of prayers. But if you do not mind me asking, do you think that morphea starts this way? Like first a brown patch that stays for a couple of years and then starts turning red and all. I know i sound really paranoid but that is just the anxiety talking. I saw a dermatologist when it started, two if I remember correctly, and they just thought it was a birthmark thing that developed later in life. But thank you for taking out the time and replying, and i am sorry that you have had to go through, I can only imagine, sending lotsss of prayers. Thank you for replying, it does eases my really anxious mind. I am glad that a dermatologist was able to check it out! And I am glad that it seems to be something harmless \u2014 either way, I hope it remains so and I hope it goes well!\n\nAnd no problem! I know how worrisome it can be not having answers for something like this since it is very hard to diagnose.

I have Raynaud\u2019s, acid reflux and swelling in my fingers. I went to my doctor about the swelling and he ordered bloodwork which included  a negative result for ANA. Doctor referred me to a rheumatologist who took more bloodwork at a different lab and the ANA test was borderline. Rheumatologist took more bloodwork and then told me I had two common markers of scleroderma and one uncommon marker, but she did not explain what these were and the panel is difficult to read.

They most disappointing thing for me was that i never regained normal finger movement. Got slightly better with physical therapy but little by little it effected more fingers and they got worse. The finger swelling is not actually swelling if you have scleroderma. It is a little but it is mostly your skin getting so thick it feels like swelling. I am sorry you got this so young Thanks for your comment. It is only gotten slightly more painful to move my fingers over time but I only have to keep the one I got the cortisone shot in straight all the time. How old were you when you got diagnosed/ how old are you now if you do not mind me asking? I am 34 and got diagnosed at 31.

I just recently got on this app and wanted to look for a community of people exchanging information about Morphea/Scleroderma.

I got diagnosed last year with localized scleroderma that started out about an inch in size and is now over 8 inches and spreading like crazy. My doctors treatment has consisted of two topical medications that have not helped with improvement or slowed progression. Im on here to see what has worked for other people. \ud83d\ude42 8 inches is 20.32 cm", "False positive maybe?  I was diagnosed with systemic scleroderma 4 months ago with the only symptom being swelling in fingers that would come and go. Since my diagnosis, i have not had a flare up and have been symptom free. Reading up on the condition has honestly scared the crap out of me as I am only 22. Is there a chance that this could be a false positive? I am considering getting a second opinion as my RA and ANA tests are always consistently negative (only tested once for Scl-70 tho). Any advice or reassurance would be appreciated!! I am still in the process of getting diagnosed myself, so all I know is what I have read - take it with a huge grain of salt. Obviously only your doctor can you give you a final call on this. Also, I think it is always a great idea to a get a second opinion if you have any doubts at all, so go for it! In particular, you might want to consider seeing a Scleroderma specialist.\n\nBased on these results, it looks like you are high for antibodies that indicate lupus (ssDNA and SSB) and scleroderma (SCL-70). I have heard of cases where people are diagnosed with lupus without ANA, so your negative ANA is not a guarantee that it is false positive.\n\nThat said, my understanding is that diagnosis is substantially based on symptoms, of which you have few/none! That could mean you have mild or \"pre\" lupus or SSc; it might also mean that you never develop symptoms. The good news is that you know about this really really early, so you and your doctor can keep an eye on it and prevent it from ever getting out of control in a way that damages your body.\n\nI know getting diagnosed with this is terrifying. But you are in a GREAT place right now. You do not have symptoms and you are armed with knowledge that this could appear later in life. If you find out from your doctor that this is a real concern (and maybe it will not be!) you are better placed than 99% of patients to manage and prevent it. You do not know how reassuring your message made me feel! Thank you so much. I think I will go get a second opinion to be better prepared! Thanks so much. I have a positive SCL-70 and positive ANA.  The fear I had about my results was based on an idea and not on reality...I mean, I do not know if I have SSc or what life will become if I have it. But I know that I have handled life's obstacles so far and I can handle this one too. This thought finally gave me some peace, even in the absence of answers.\n\nRegarding false positives, I found this:  ( \n\n\\--&gt; It says that the rate of false positives for SCL-70 is very high. There are also a lot of academic journals claiming that up to 25% of people with lupus have a false positive scl-70. Your ssDNA is positive, right? I know nobody wants to have lupus, but I actually found it comforting that I might have SLE and not SSc He said that the ssDNA in my case is more indicative of sjogrens and not lupus since the other lupus factors tested negative. I am more than okay with having sjogrens as it is manageable. The scleroderma is what caused me to panic. He also has not really elaborated on what type of i have. The most info iI\u2019ve gotten from my doctor is that it is most likely systemic and that we just treat the symptoms as they come (which i havent really had symptoms) If he is basing his SSc diagnosis on bloodwork and puffy fingers, that is pretty tenuous. I am not saying you do not have SSc because I have no clue. But I would have a hard time accepting a diagnosis that I had not been convinced of. I know the diagnostic process is nightmarish, but it might be worth it to dive back in for a second opinion. That way you would at least know for sure.\n\nI am not a doctor but I know math. From the information you have provided here, the statistical probability of SSc seems very unlikely. ANA is positive in 60-95% of people with scleroderma but you tested negative. Typically SCL-70 is only positive in people with extensive skin involvement, which you do not have. Scleroderma typically affects middle-aged people but you are young. When probabilities stack up like that, the numbers fly to negative infinity. He is saying \"it is possible to have limited or sine scleroderma\" and \"it is possible for a young person to have scleroderma\" and \"it is possible for an ANA-negative person to have scleroderma\". But how likely is it for ALL of those things to happen all at once?? WAY less likely. That is not even accounting for the high false-positive rate of the SCL-70 test.\n\nKeep in mind that double-checking the SCL-70 with the same test method means jack shit. It is likely to return another false positive in the same person. If somebody wants to check your SCL-70, ask how you can get it done by the ID method. You could ask r/scleroderma how to do that too.\n\nLook, you might have SSc. But the doctor who diagnosed it is a fallible human and you should not have this weighing on you when it does not even sound like it fits. I am rooting for you xx Thank you so much for your input. It is so scary being diagnosed with something that most people do not know about, therefore it is hard to talk about. I appreciate you taking the time out to respond. Your thought process was exactly what i was thinking but i thought maybe i was overthinking it. I will definitely be getting a second opinion. It is no problem at all! You are  just thinking critically and logically, not 'too much' :) Please do not hesitate to message me if there is anything I can do.", "How to support my mom going through a bone marrow transplant?

You might check out the scleroderma foundation's website to find a scleroderma specialty center near you to see a rheumatologist there.

Ana pattern indicated systemic sclerosis. Does any one else experience this? Thanks in advance!  Yes this is similar in appearance to what my mother experienced as initial scleroderma symptoms, but she also has lupus as well. I would follow up with a rheumatologist about these concerns. Best of luck to you. I experienced exactly this too. Plus purple fingers and face rash and chills and fatigue. My research points that it might be caused by latent EBV virus. I tested for EBV and I had high level of EBV antibodies showing it is in my body. Doctors do not think that latent virus can act but research points to the contrary. \nCurrently I am taking high doses of NAC and doing a strict diet (no gluten no eggs no dairy no sugar no alcohol) and my symptoms have gotten better, especially after stating to take NAC. I continue with NAC and will add monolaurin (will order or simply eat raw coconut oil every day). Google EBV and autoimmune diseases You take NAC orally or IV?  I have just started NMN, a NAC precursor. My hands and feet look similar. Finally got referred to a specialist after about 4 months of trying and symptoms getting worse.

My grandma was diagnosed a few weeks ago, but I am struggling to understand how her symptoms are caused by this disease and why medication does not seem to be working. She does have hardening of the skin, they did some kind of a test on a patch of affected skin and that is how they diagnosed her. But also her face is swollen like crazy (I was face-timing her and honestly got scared), and she is constantly feeling unwell. Apparently she cannot even go to the grocery store across the street, or wash her own hair without help. I feel frustrated by her doctors who do not seem to be doing anything. In fact the only doctor prescribing her stuff is her dermatologist. They gave her some sort of cream and she said it did help somewhat with the swelling, but I saw her through video chat and it still looks quite bad.\n\nI have been reading up on this disease but face swelling and being so sick you cannot walk across the street are not really mentioned in the symptoms. Is this normal? Is it normal that the only doctor doing any treatments is a dermatologist? Any advice I can pass on to her? She needs to see a rheumatologist. They can get her the treatment she needs. Also, have her start taking turmeric daily and cut out nightshade vegetables from her diet if she has not already. It will help with the inflammation. Thank you so much I will pass your message on to her Sadly this is common because there isnt much that can be done a this point. All therapys treat the symptoms of Sceroderma not the root cause: cologen over production. Doctors know what causes it... but not how to stop the production of collegen. \n\nIf your grandma suffers from Raynauds as well blood thinners can help, but come with thier own set of risks so most docs will do a risk assessment to see if the benefits out way the risks (my doc thinks the risks out weigh the benefits in my case at this point in time)\n\nThe boating may be a side effect of her current meds. Maybe chat with her doc again?\n\nIn my moms case she was always tired, had trouble getting around and lost mobility as the disease progressed. She ended up loosing a toe and finger which greatly impacted her independance. I am not sure about Raynauds, but as far as I know it has not been mentioned. The face swelling is actually one of the symptoms that cauded my grandma to see a doctor in the first place so definitely not caused by any meds.\n\nThank you for the response! Hi, I am so sorry about your grandma. Please encourage her to go to a scleroderma specialist instead of (or as well as) a regular rheumatologist,  since this disease is rare enough that most rheumatologists have never had a patient with it. If she lives in the U.S. this website will help you find the nearest scleroderma center: \nThis is really important! There are some good treatments out there, but most docs will not know about them. Best of luck to both of you. Its awesome that you are such a caring granddaughter. Look up CREST syndrome. Sceleroderma can present in some weird ways such as:\n\n\u00a0The acronym \"CREST\" refers to the five main features: calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia.\n\nIts fairly rare to see just the hardening of the skin. So for best treatment you should always see a scleroderma specialist these usually are rheumytologists who have specialized in scleroderma. If you are in the states you can google them in your area or checkout ( As mentioned diet changes for reducing inflamation do help some. Now just treating the symptoms is common but there are treatments to slow progression or evewn put it into remission. Immunosuppresents help with stopping the body from attacking itself. We can go as far as stem cell transplants but those are a worst case senario. There are great treatments out there and finding a specialist will be key it can be 6 hours away but once you have one on your team they can work alongside a local rheumy. Now you didnt mention the type of scleroderma even and im suprised shes not diagnosed with morphea cause that is usually non specialists default after biopsy. Now you didny say why she cant do the tasks. It could be muscle fatigue, shortness of breath, even pain. There are alot of baseline tests that have to be done soon to monitor progression. These include Pumonary function test and an echo so they can monitor progression these are generally done every 6 months to a year. I would start with getting her expert care because creams is usually what non experts do and that doesnt even usually help morphea patients and it sounds like she has systemc scleroderma potentially limited systemc scleroderma which used to be called CREST this is old naming though. There is also diffuse systemic sclerderma. Now to diagnoses between the types of scleroderma both systemic versions and localized it takes symptoms mainly. They can do antibody tests to see if she has the antibodies but this is really only helpful once we know the type since trhese dont always guarentee type but it can help wit hknowing the progression. You can get biopsies that would come back as positive for excess collagen sometimes the lab techs call it morphea which causes alot of misdiagnosis. A good scleroderma test is the nailfold capillary test since scleroderma actually looks really distinct here. So try not to worry but you probbaly will need to advocate and help to get her proper care with a specilaist in scleroderma. Now for self education since I think knowledge is power if you look in the right locations. So we have ( and the scleroderma education project. We also have the scleroderma foundations youtube channel which holds all the conferences. I would suggest the video from 2018 for scleroderma foundation called the localized scleroderma (morphea) it actually goes into all types and diagnosis. Feel free to reply here if you need to know more or PM me Also to note a very good place to get information is the scleroderma pages on facebook ones called scleroderma onces called scleroderma support group. Now not everyone in there knows things as medically as they should but there are 3 main people making comments and helping out. Plus everyone else shares there experiences we even have a researcher in scleroderma treatments on the page I have scleroderma on my face and sometimes have extreme swelling on my face and hands. \n\nI recently started a low histamine diet and it has dramatically helped with inflammation and irritation. As a Systemic Scleroderma patient, I believe the disease affects everyone in a different way. My hands were really swollen. My doctor said going vegan lowers the inflammation that Systemic Scleroderma, as well as other autoimmune diseases, inflicts. I hope and pray your grandmother gets better. Hugs \ud83e\udd17", "Food feeling stuck in chest. Background: In the diagnosis stage. High titer centromere antibodies. 30 F. No current skin involvement. IBS and seasonal asthma. \n\n\nI thought I was being paranoid by trying to piece together issues I have had when eating. I want to know if you have experienced these issues:\n\n1. Trying to swallow food and your body not complying, like literally my throat is working against me now and again. \n\n2. Food is stuck in my chest. I feel it in my chest. I had to drink warm tea to help push the food down. It backfired at first was really painful but the food finally went down. \n\n3. Extreme nausea when eating a meal and after. Not a large meal just a normal meal. \n\n4. GERD. Like dry cough choking in the middle of the night GERD. Countless gag sessions have happened in the middle of the night.\n\n5. Difficulty breathing after eating. Feeling too much pressure, like if I had over eaten but in reality have only had a half cup of rice and maybe 1/2 oz of salmon. \n\n6. Bloating and gas that is extremely painful. I should buy stock in Gas-X.\n\nI have had these issues for years and thought it was how everyone felt, now realizing it might not be normal. Also, with stress my symptoms have gotten worse. My rheumatologist recommended OTC omeprazole and to watch for worsening symptoms, about 2 weeks ago. My Omeprazole came in from amazon today, I will.start there. \n\nCould this be related to scleroderma? Any advice? It very likely is...swallowing issues might just be the most common manifestation that the disease presents with. Like you, I brushed mine under the rug for a long time and now looking back I feel so stupid about all the little things I convinced myself were just aging or allergies or whatever else. That is exactly what I attributed it to was me getting older and allergies. I am just to the point where I almost dread eating. There are some foods I can eat with no issue and rice is usually okay but not tonight! For me this was not one of the first symptoms, but something that developed later and has been getting worse continuously. My new rheumatologist suggested taking anti-reflux medication and it has actually been helping a lot: since I have started taking it, it has become a bit easier to swallow and push the food down, the sensation of chest pressure and burning has ceased to be common as well. I recommend looking into it. Btw I have had scleroderma for 20 years at this point and with the right medication it is manageable. What anti reflux medication are you using?\n\n&gt;Btw I have had scleroderma for 20 years at this point and with the right medication it is manageable.\n\nThis makes me feel better. I know everyone is different but this gives me hope, so thank you very much! I take omeprazole daily. \nAs far as I know, stomach acid burns our esophagus and that makes it not work properly, and omeprazole blocks the release of stomach acid. So far I do not have any noticeable side effects and it actually also helps me with nausea as I am currently pregnant. But you have to of course talk to the doctors first before taking it! Same same same! Eventually i built up strength in my esophagus again but at one point i had to turn my head to \"bear down\" on my throat so i could swallow, maybe ask ur doc about physical therapy? 20+ years for me too! \ud83d\udc4d Yes OP I have had all of that. Some days are better than others. Some days I eat three bites of food then I cannot eat more. Between the feeling that I am choking, food I just swallowed is stuck, and nausea..it is too much. I have not had any tests or anything to see exactly what is going on. Get a GI to breath test for SIBO.  The reflux and bloating issues sound exactly like what happened to me when I had it.  The swallowing issues I get as well but I do not know if they are directly related to that aspect. Lol I am the same way. I freak out with medical tests! I am the same I can start eating normally and then a random \"no, you are not going to swallow\" happens. It is frustrating, I almost dread eating. I will ask my rheumatologist. With everything the way it is, Kaiser is suggesting no in person visits. Yeah ideally they could just do the test in your car or something, it is literally drinking sugar then getting breathalyzered every 10 minutes or so Oh wow. That sounds easy. It is that orange glucose drink isnt it? That stuff is gross warm. It was clear for me, it is somethign more complicated than Glucose, cause glucose is about the only sugar that sibo doesnt mess with because you absorb it too fast. Sounds like EOE which is also auto immune related. Ask your rhumy about it. I have the same symptoms and similar test results and my GI did an endoscope and diagnosed as EOE.   I have bad food allergies and my esphogitis will flair if I do not watch what I eat. I was coming on here to say this. I have EOE too and this sounds like that. What is EOE? eosinophilic esophagitis - here is a good article  I love food, but do not like eating it. I dropped like 35 pounds after my diagnosis because I was afraid to eat. Fortunately I have put back on 5 or 10 of those pounds, but I still do not enjoy the process of eating I am glad you are putting weight back on. I am in the same boat I have dropped 10 pounds by not eating as much due to fear. Though I had an extra 15 I needed to drop anyways but wanted to do it in a healthy fashion. Followup- turns out this is a known higher likelihood incidence with Scerlo variants.  (guessing its food passing slower than normal that causes it.)  Sounds just like me again. The first 10-15 I needed, but after trying the AIP diet I just could not get enough calories. You can only eat so many carrots before you would just rather not eat lol. Wishing you good news on your diagnostic journey, it can be long and tedious (though your antibody is highly specific so hopefully you will get on the right meds soon). Let me know if you would like to keep in touch along the way. Of course I would love to keep in touch! I need to implement the AIP diet even though my rheumatologist has not suggested it yet. It can be very helpful for reflux and bloating specifically. A lot of people say it helps all their symptoms, but for me it was just those two...still worth it and I will probably get back on it after this quarantine is over. I have all of these symptoms too, I have been diagnosed with scleroderma for 8 years now, I am 19. Wild. I just got diagnosed with morphea. I have had a spot on my abdomen for years (decades? Hard to say) that is undergone some changes recently. The past couple of years, I have had the exact swallowing issue you are describing. I am sorry to hear you are having some swallowing issues. How long did it take for you to get diagnosed? \n\nI have found that eating foods that are not starchy or dry helps a lot. I am pretty sure the spot on my abdomen has been there since about 2005. I distinctly remember because I was in really good shape that year and my six pack was slightly bigger on that side. That is the same spot they took the biopsy from (no six pack these days except the one in my fridge lol), which was confirmed as morphea. The diagnosis was just confirmed today, and I went to the derm last week. It was a PA that I saw, and her first instinct was morphea, and that is what the biopsy showed. I am pretty impressed by that, considering how rare the condition is. My PCP initially diagnosed it as a lipoma a few months ago, but obviously that was not correct. Do you take Prilosec OTC? I was given that cause my medical coverage sucks and I read the side effects. It seems that you are not suppose to use it more that 15 days in a row I am not in US, so the brand names can be different.. the medication I am prescribed can be definitely taken long term so I think it is not Prilosec.", "Does the thicker skin here look like scleroderma?

If tests are negative and you do not have skin symptoms, it likely is not scleroderma. You can always get a second opinion and re-do the labs, but most doctors only diagnose off skin symptoms. I truly mean this in a kind way. It does not to me like you have scleroderma. There is a points system that is used to diagnose scleroderma because you cannot do it by tests alone and I really do not think you would qualify. I cannot remember what it is called, but you can Google it. But... I kind of get the feeling that your issue is anxiety or some kind of hypochondria. You say it yourself, so I think you know.

I do a lot of reading online to see if I can figure out what is going on with me based on my bloodwork results. Prayers for all my fellow warriors! \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f I do. The calcinosis is the most uncommon symptom that I have. Though when they do show up, they are small, hard lumps that can or cannot be popped, depending on where it is. Okay thank you all for the information. (The original poster).  I know there are many variations I believe I have a few in the CREST acronym. I just wanted to ensure I had the correct board.  Taking my first dose of Methotrexate and so far so good. I have it and am new to this board too. Was diagnosed in November 2018. So far I have had 3 of the five symptoms within the CREST acronym (plus others not included in it). I am happy to answer any questions about it here. :) Yes. I have CREST. It is a scleroderma thing. It is rare. I got diagnosed with lupus and a handful of other autoimmune diseases almost 6 years ago. My Dr. then diagnosed me with CREST almost 4 years ago. It is got a pretty bleak prognosis. It is also called limited scleroderma, but CREST is an acronym. I think there are a couple of things in CREST, that differ from limited scleroderma. I could be wrong, but the reading I have done\u2026 My daughter has centromere at 1:320. Her anxiety is through the roof. She does have some reflux but no skin issues. She is only 21 and has so much going for her. I dont know what to do to help. Is her level indicative to diagnosis ? Hi Denise, that is so good to hear. I too have been looking at the antibiotic protocol for my 20 year old daughter who has positive centromere at 1:320. Reflux is her only symptom no skin issues. Do you mind me asking what you were diagnosed with? Who is the doctor? My daughter has a positive centromere 1:320 with mild reflux. No skin issues. Bloodwork done October 2021.  Not really sure where to go from here. Rheumatologist said see you in three months and get more bloodwork. So what do we do? Just wait? I feel like we should be doing something. Hi, I have six auto immune disorders, one is diffuse systemic scleroderma. The doctor is Dr. Susanne Landgrebe in Iowa. She was trained by Dr. Sinnott from Aida Grove Iowa. I went to Iowa and saw Dr. Sinnott back in 2014 and he put me into remission thank god because I was supposed to die in 2015. Best decision I ever made\ud83d\ude42 Ida Grove, Iowa\nSo I recently heard that Susanne may have leukemia but I also learned that there is a doctor in California doing this as well. You can get a list of all the doctors who do this from the road back foundation. Good luck to you. Feel free to call w any questions 401-339-2323 thanks That is great to hear. Are you still on antibiotics? I may call you. Are you on the roadback fb page? Sorry this took so long. What doctors has she seen? General or Rheumatologist? If yes, what have they said? Rheumatologist. Rheumatologist looked over every inch of her body and found no skin issues so other than the reflux no symptoms. My daughter has to get more bloodwork scl70, c3,c4 and urine and has an appointment with rheumatologist in a couple months. Not knowing what is wrong with you, can be soooo scary. Would she be willing to go to a therapist? It might be helpful to talk with a professional. If her reflux is mild I would say yeah, waiting until the next appointment with her rheumatologist is perfectly fine. If that gets worse, if she has trouble swallowing, or if she starts losing weight because of the reflux, you will want to see a gastroenterologist, based on my experience. CREST syndrome/limited scleroderma generally progresses pretty slowly, though, so unless things get worse I would say just wait. Yes I am still on them, you have to take them forever to stay in remission. I am not mentioned in the road back as far as I know. I honestly have done close to zero research in that foundation because honestly they were extremely helpful for me but they have been for other people. I found out about Dr. Sinnott through a woman, then I learned about the road back foundation Call anytime \nHope you feel better \ud83d\udc9c", "Plaquenil and headaches? Recently i started having a weird \u201cdazed\u201d sensation where i felt like my eyes were strained and my head felt heavy at all times. I thought maybe it is my eye prescription changing but the optometrist said my RX had not changed and my eyes looked fine. Then i realized plaquenil can cause headaches....has this happened to any of you? I have not connected headaches to my use of plaquenil (taking 15 years) but that does not mean it is not causing yours. It is worth a call to your doc. First time I took it I felt like I was going to die. It was the worst headache of my life that and it is would make me anxious and GI Ave time panic attacks. Did you keep taking it?  Did those go away eventually?  Or did you have to find another option? I am still taking it and the headaches did go away (unless I skip a dose). The nausea gets better if you take it while swallowing a bite of food as for the anxiety and panic attacks I went on Lexapro and xanax. \n\nI eventually stopped taking Xanax after a couple of months since it made me sleepy. I am still on lexapro but I have not had a problem since. \n\nIf you are looking for another option Azathioprine works just as well but it also causes nausea. Good luck \u2764\ufe0f", "Prednisone Advice I was recently diagnosed with en coup de sabre linear scleroderma, and I am about to start a high dose of prednisone. Could anyone share their experience with this medication? Will this effect my ability to work? I know everyone reacts differently to meds, but I would love some advice on how to best prepare. Thanks!", "Holistic treatment alternatives Does anyone know of any? Have any, and particularly ones that are breastfeeding safe? This is probably a question for your doctor. I do not really know about what is safe for breastfeeding. \n\nI know that I am doing a ton of things outside of medicine to help improve my symptoms. Things I do: \n\n* Daily yoga for mobility (there are hundreds of great free videos on youtube, and even youtube videos on yoga for scleroderma patients). My yoga practice is probably the best thing I am doing for my stress and joint pain.\n* Hand exercises for dexterity.\n* Take turmeric daily.\n* Take regular baths with aromatherapy bath bombs for self-soothing/stress release.\n* I have also have heard a lot of positive remarks on CBD products from the scleroderma facebook groups, so I got some CBD lotions and bath products. I do not really notice much of a difference on the low dose CBD products, but I had a high concentrated CBD bath bomb that was *amazing* for my joint pain.\n* STRICT control of my diet to minimize reflux/GI symptoms. I cut gluten, artificial sweeteners, sweets, dairy, high sugar fruits, and nightshade vegetables. I am trying to find a new doctor at the moment, my doctor does not really care to answer any of my questions, I have gotten more results/responses from here. Yes, I realize that this is not a medically licensed board. Fair enough. You could also try calling a Scleroderma specialty program or the Scleroderma Foundation while waiting to set up with a new doc. They might be able to give you some general guidance or help you find a suitable doctor near you. I have tried reaching out to my local chapter a week ago and am still waiting for a response on a doctor \ud83d\ude2a\nCalling a specialty program, could you give me more insight on that. Yeah--What state are you in? Not every state has one. Also: Are you on facebook? I know it is not ideal, but there are literally THOUSANDS of people with scleroderma in the groups there who are very knowledgable on these things. They are very active in the groups, unlike here.\n\nI deleted my facebook years ago but after hearing how active those groups were, I went back on--I have learned so much and found it very helpful to see what they post and what their doctors tell them about different things. I am in MO and I am not on social media, facebook creeps me out the most. Oof. I think for MO, your closest option is Northwestern in Chicago. It does look like a couple rheumatologists in St. Louis have some experience working with scleroderma though. Dr. Temprano, for one, but I do not know how good they are. The Northwestern Scleroderma Program is *highly* recommended by other scleroderma patients. They are able to do virtual appointments, but the initial meeting has to be in person so that may not be realistic for you. Facebook creeps me out too. But like u/rrirwin said I also appreciate the insight from the members in the groups. Consider creating an account with another email address and using the Firefox browser with the Facebook container add-on. It keeps Facebook from using trackers to track you across websites. It really works. Happy cake day!! Oh thanks.. Did not even realize lol I would not say alternative (which denotes that you take one thing instead of another)...but personally I am on tofactinib and hydroxychloroquine and have been on methotrexate in the past. However my regimen of complementary herbs/vitamins/supplements have given me a better quality of life while being able to effectively reduce my drug intake/keep my health stable (under medical guidance). There is a whole world out there of people who experiment with immunoglobulins, traditional herbs, terpenes, endocannabinoids (CBD and non CBD), food/vitamin based nootropics for brain fog, ketosis, phytoestrogens/phytotestosterones/growth factors, trace minerals, vitamin d, probiotics/pre-biotics, phototherapy, but also gene therapy (I come from a both high tech and ultra traditional \u2014 like foraging/plant gathering background). What is appropriate for one person (risk tolerance, safety tolerance) certainly may not be for another (this also goes to the idea of companion medicine).\n\nThere is a bunch of specifics on food that may or may not help your quality of life too. My family came from TCM practitioners and work with the American Herbalist Guild/studied under a Karuk herbalist so there are specific contraindications for breast-feeding. Most food, light therapy (like UVA1, near/far infrared are most common), probiotics (like visbiome) may be safe though can modulate breast milk production. Trace minerals like zinc, magnesium, etc I would talk with the doctor because they should get a baseline of where you are. Some herbs are known to act as anthelmintic so as an example, some herbs can in fact not be helpful (or can do harm). Many autoimmune patients are low on vitamin D. You can easily overdose on herb supplements/they may not be delivered to your body so during breastfeeding it may be advisable (especially since you are an autoimmune patient) to speak with a doctor (medical doctor). They should know a bit about contraindications/there are tools available (made with herbalists and NIH for example) to professionals (that they can then apply their training and your medical context to give you better advice).\n\nThe number of studies/power of those studies is way low, so with all of that said, it is not that these applications will \u201ccure\u201d or even bring about marked improvement. They may be too expensive/time consuming (too many things to remember, go out and get) to be worth it especially since you are a patient and also have a little one. Drug development was meant to improve lives at reduced cost burden and overall burden while promoting health safety. However I understand personally the desire to improve health outcomes (a constant battle), especially since scleroderma has no cure and the drugs have significant side effects.\n\nCongratulations on your little one and wishing you and the baby health and joy.\n\nPlease always work with your medical doctor about any specific questions you might have on changing your medication, or adding something to your health regimen. You could also find some MDs/DOs who are also \u201cholistic-leaning\u201d on the IFM network, American Herbalist Guild. Make sure to cross-check their records to with FSMB. And if you are at a major medical research institution, please do not drop that support network. Peace. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "Confused and scared To start out in a 32 year old male who is extremely active. I have had some chest pain and reflux so I went to a GI. They performed an upper scope and a esophageal manometry. They just called me and said I have connective tissue disease scleroderma. They scheduled an appointment with the rheumatologist a month out. I am terrified and do not know what to think. I know this is scary, but it is survivable. The next two years of your life is going to be consumed with specialists and tests as they go through every affected system and establish your base-lines. That will ease up, I promise. But this is when you find out how bad it really is - or is not.   \n\n\nThe rheumatologist will probably start you on Plaquinil (sp?) and that will mean you have to keep up with your eye dr appts for the entire time you are on it. I am not seeing anyone suffering side effects (other than the possible eye complication) from the medication, but it does take a few months to do anything - if it is going to work at all. If it does not, there are other medications to try.  \n\n\nFor me, the pulmonologist was the worst one. The lungs are the real killer and if they are fine, the prognosis is annoying, but not fatal.   \n\n\nYou are going to have to figure out what triggers the disease in you and that takes time. For me it is mineral oil, spray paint, wood stain, gasoline, and harsh cleansers. Basically anything that puts off fumes. That is pretty common for the disease.  \n\n\nIf your esophagus is affected, odds are that the rest of your GI system is not happy either. Lay off the fiber. We now know that fiber makes the GI complications from scleroderma worse.  \n\n\nContinue to stay active and take care of yourself. Keep your circulation going. Do not let yourself get chilled. Do NOT drink alcohol. Scleroderma is very destructive to the capillaries and alcohol makes that SO much worse. Even one drink can cause circulation issues and you do not want that.    \n\n\nFor me, eating carnivore, upping my saturated fat intake, cutting back on Omega 6, and taking a LOT of Omega 3 really did help. I have not had a flare in months and the disease really was killing me. I am also on aspirin therapy. I just had to go as anti-inflammatory as possible. I have had remarkable improvements over the last six months with these steps. I still have some circulation issues because the damage is done, but it is better. Do not know if this would work for anyone else, but it is saved my life.  \n\n\nReach out with any questions, take a deep breath, and know that a lot of people live to a ripe old age with this disease.  How long have you had it and what systems has the disease spread to? \n\n\nFor the last several months when I take deep breaths I hear my chest making a popping noise. Would this be contributed to that or is it just a coincidence? \n\n\nMy rheumatologist appointment was scheduled a month out due to this not being an emergency. How the hell is this not an emergency? It sure feels like one to me. I feel like I am losing a month of momentum that I might otherwise gain more life. \n\n\n Do you think the GI could have misdiagnosed me? Or is it pretty obvious.  Keep your appointments.  Thinking back, I definitely had scleroderma in 2012, but there were symptoms before that. I was not diagnosed until Dec 1, 2017. Did not start medication until three months later. And it took another three months before I could definitely say it was helping. \n\nSo a month is not that bad of a wait. Took me three months to get in to see mine for the first time. This is a slow disease. The fastest I have heard of it killing someone was two years and they had heavy pulmonary involvement right from the start.\n\nFor me involved systems are:\n\nGI system. That means everything from my lips to... the other end and everything in between. The symptoms mimic ulcerative colitis and IBS (which I usually tell people that I have because they understand it), GERD, ulcers in the stomach and small intestine. Leaves me vulnerable to SIBO and fungal infections so that is always going to be a constant battle.\n\nSkin. The rash reminds me of Shingles. Mostly on my legs and fingers. Flares on both sides at the same time. Also have skin thickening on my fingers and palms. Face is a little better than it was and I can smile again without taking a journey into uncanny valley.\n\nReynaud's. That is the capillaries. Serious circulation issues that cause damage to every organ in the body. I do have some problems with decreased blood flow to the brain when that is acting up and then I get ringing in my ears and visual auras. This also causes issues with my eyes.\n\nMuscles. Myositis. Exercise induced. When they took my gallbladder out it was loaded with histamines and white blood cells. This makes me very weak and is painful as hell.\n\nI cannot know about your chest. Nobody can know until you see the pulmonologist and get a ton of tests done. You are going to need breathing tests and imaging. \n\nIf your lungs are jacked up, expect things to happen. Once they go, you are in trouble. So they will start you on a stronger medication right away. The goal will be to save your lungs - even if that means destroying the rest of you. And that is the right call. Your guts and all the rest can heal. The lungs cannot come back from the damage. My pulmonologits does nothing but lung transplants for Scleroderma patients in Houston. He flys in to our town to help the handful of us who are here once a month. \n\nWhen my lungs came back good two months ago his PA actually cried with relief with me.\n\nThe rest can be controlled. The rest can be dealt with and managed. \n\nSadly, you are going to have to do everything that you can for yourself. \n\nMy friend, here is the part that is going to be very hard for you to accept.\n\nThey cannot fix this. They cannot make this go away. There is no cure. From a medical standpoint, there is not much they can do for you. They can manage symptoms to a point and that is about it. If lungs are bad, they will become very aggressive in an effort to buy you more time. If the lungs are not, then you are going to have to do everything in *your* power to control the monster. What you eat, your shampoo, your laundry detergent, your vitamins, your cleaning products, the carpet under your feet, the fabric your clothes are made from, and the very air you breathe will affect you in obvious ways. \n\nBut you do have control over much of this. Once you figure out what works and what hurts you, you will begin to get on top of this to a point.\n\nNow the disease is the most aggressive in the beginning. Then it does seem to stabilize - or even improve - for most after a few years. Never going away, but not as violent as it starts.\n\nRight now, my lungs are clear, but that can change at any time. Same for my heart and my kidneys.\n\n----\n\nThe typical progression of medication goes something like this: \n\nPlquinil (sp?) \nA low-dose chemotherapy drug. Is not as bad as it sounds.\nActual chemotherapy. That is as bad as it sounds.\nLast resort is a total reboot of your immune system. They will only do that if your lungs have been targeted. The bad is that there is a significant mortality and failure rate. The good is that it is the only treatment that is ever offered a *real* remission.\n\nFor the next month, focus on cleaning your act up. Treat your body like a temple. Keep exercising. Cut out the inflammatory foods (grains, nightshades) and take Omega 3 with every meal that you eat. Switch out your personal hygiene products for the mildest alternatives possible. Get sleep. Learn how to listen to your body. If you start to have problems, really think about what you did the day before. What you ate. What you were exposed to.\n\nThis is going to take a long time. Tests, tests, tests. You need to settle in for the long-haul. Things might get worse before they get better. This is a disease that you have to live with, but most of the time you can actually *live* with it.\n\nWhen you talk to the rheumatologist, make sure the pulmonologist is your first referral. I do not know if it will do any good, but tell him that you are anxious and ask him to put a rush on it. This can be justified with the symptoms that you have. Expect to get a dozen vials of blood drawn that day and more after that. \n\nIt is going to seem like they are moving horribly slow but it is because they have to move slow. The first med takes months to do anything. Everything is 'try then wait and see.' \n\nJust hang on and control what you can. \n\n I am thinking that there had to have been blood work done at some point. It is usually blood tests in combination with imaging or other physical markers. If your blood work comes back hot and you have some of the symptoms, that is where they make the call. You can have bad blood tests and never express symptoms.  \n\n\nI have never heard of a doctor diagnosing scleroderma based on imaging alone. But I am not a doctor and there may be unique symptoms that I am unaware of. Do not Google the illness! Take your situation the way it comes, day by day. Ignore what others are going through.  Could you elaborate on \"lay off the fibre\"? What is the source for this?  Here is one study that found that scleroderma patients who ate a high-fiber diet had bad - sometimes even fatal - outcomes.\n\nScleroderma slows bowel motility. The fiber does not change that. It is much easier for people who have Scleroderma to become impacted.\n\n\n\nI do know that personally, eliminating fiber from my diet had an extremely positive impact. I have heavy GI involvement and the high-fiber diet that my doctor recommended was turning me inside out. You are not supposed to bleed when you poop! I would swing back and forth between terrible diarrhea and constipation. \n\nI will not say that eliminating fiber cured all my ails, but it was definitely a large piece to the puzzle. That is v helpful, thanks so much. I am having similar issues and am looking to make a change.\n\nWhat are you eating now that you have cut down on fibre if I may ask? That \"crackle\" can be a sign of interstitial lung disease. Find a scleroderma specialist ASAP. A normal rheumatologist is not going to be enough. When you make the appointment, let them know you have chest pain and breathing problems and that you would like to get on their waiting list for taking cancelled spots. Hopefully they can prioritize you.  \n\n\nYou also might want to see if your primary doctor or somebody can do an ENA panel in advance. They should test your ANA, SCL-70, and centromere antibodies at least. I would guess you will come back positive for SCL-70, but the specific antibodies you have will be valuable to your rheumatologist.  \n\n\nFWIW I have been waiting since December to see a specialist, and I see them at the end of this month :-(. Fortunately my symptoms are all manageable and mild right now, so I did not need to be seen urgently. But I definitely have syymptoms and have a very high SCL-70.  \n\n\nGood luck, fellow new scleroderma bro. Not the club I wanted to be in, but whatever.  \n\n\nOh, and you should think about joining the Facebook Scleroderma group. It is very active and informative.  \n( It is definitely unusual for a GI doc to diagnose scleroderma; they generally do not have the expertise. Did they run a blood test yet?  \n\n\nThat said, the GI involvement and the lung crackling you mentioned elsewhere are more than enough reason to get evaluated by a rheumatologist; particularly a scleroderma specialist if at all possible. ((deep sigh)) People think I am crazy, but I am eating Carnivore.\n\nLast August I was at rock bottom. My circulation was so bad that my legs looked like I was carrying around two water balloons over my feet. My resting heart rate was holding steady at about 120. The inflammation was literally killing me. I would been pooping blood for 18 straight months and the pain of the rectal infections was the worst thing I have ever experienced for such a length of time. My skin was retracting on my hands and face. I had large open sores on my legs from a chronic scleroderma flare that burned like nettles 24/7. I would begun to have symptoms of TIAs. Hell, even my vision was failing.\n\nEverything said that I was a body in distress and my doctors were very concerned. There was no way I was going to make the first 10 year estimate on the prognosis. Frankly, I was dying and I knew it.\n\nI would heard about these crazy people trying Carnivore for autoimmune diseases and I thought, \"Screw it.\" I literally had nothing to lose. I would tried every diet and supplement and snake oil cure that I could legally get my hands on and nothing had helped. I at this point I just had to try something. Quitting is not an option for me. For the first time in my life, I just plunged in and did something without prefacing it with 100 hours of research in an attempt to validate the attempt.\n\nOne week. Within one week there was improvement. Not a cure. Not a miracle. Just a little more clarity and energy. I definitely did not feel worse.\n\nAnd the gawddamn diarrhea stopped. I lost 8 inches off my waist in one freaking week. That is a LOT of inflammation. I could actually breathe better.\n\nIt took just a few weeks for the anxiety to dial down remarkably. Three months for genuine mental clarity. \n\nThat was in August. By October I was improving by every metric, but still bleeding when I went to the bathroom and in pain. I hit the Google machine and dug until I found a study where they successfully treated patients with ulcerative colitis with enemas of glutamine and butyrate. Again, I had nothing to lose so I ordered them off Amazon and made myself a butter/MCT/glutamine/butryate enema. Took one a day every day for a week to clear it all up and did a few extra days for good measure. I do not believe this would have worked as well had I not already been eating Carnivore. It took the test subjects a full month of treatment to get their symptoms under control.\n\nIt was less than a week for a full remission of the gut issues. I have not had any problems with that since. (And yeah. I say a prayer of gratitude every single time I go to the bathroom without pain. Probably always will.)\n\nI have not cheated once. I have not wavered. Every time things are tough and I am tempted to put something stupid in my mouth, I do not do it. And I do not regret that decision. \n\nIn the latest evolution in the sage I got a StrateGene genetic analysis. I found out a whole bunch of answers to the mystery that is Pepper's stupid body. I have multiple genetic mutations that jack up my folate pathways. I cannot process Omega 6 well at all and that is how I was made. Those are probably the two biggest ones that contributed to my problems, but there is so much more. \n\nI eat Carnivore. If it had a face, I can eat it. I am trying to cut down on my Omega 6 intake right now, so I am in the process of making adjustments in that department. I do take vitamin C, D, cod liver oil, and I keep up on my electrolytes. I take many of my prescribed meds, but there is so many I no longer need. (I should post a pic of my \"I do not need this crap!\" pill box. lol!)\n\nI do use herbs and spices and I eat raw eggs and egg yolks with a pinch of monk fruit sweetener and a dash of cinnamon every day. \n\nThe supplements that I am taking as dictated by StrateGene have made a massive difference. (I am not going to list them here because they only apply to me.) I am not far from using the words 'full remission.' I will never say 'cured' because I am not. If I waver one tiny bit from this tightrope I walk every day, I will plunge over the edge.\n\nMy face has full mobility back. Yes, I do my stretching exercises faithfully like a good girl. I do not know if my face is better because of the diet or if I just have more room because I have lost 83 pounds. (That includes all of 2018. Not just my time on Carnivore. I think I have dropped about 50 pounds on just Carnivore.) It is probably a bit of both, but I am leaning toward the diet because my hands have improved, too. The skin on my fingers looks very close to normal now. Not so thick and tough. Oh, and no more pimples. So I have got that going for me which is nice.\n\nGERD is over. The swelling in my throat is gone. No more ulcers. Right now, all of my organs are doing what they are supposed to. My immune system is suppressed and I do have to do a round of antifungals every month. I just posted a celebration post to r/carnivore because my heart rate is normal and healthy for the first time in my life. And I just got new glasses because my vision has improved so much that my old prescription is all wrong. \n\nI was doing Keto from New Years 2018 through August and I was already losing weight on that, but it did not touch the Scleroderma. I was eating pure, whole foods (I thought) and everything was homemade. I would gotten away from additives (I thought) and was doing the best I could to eat for health. And it did not do one bit of good.\n\nI had to stop eating the freaking plants. The twice-daily salads with a sprinkling of nuts. The broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, celery sticks, and all the rest. The damn plants were killing me.\n\nIt took five freaking months just to work all of the calcium deposits out of my body from the stupid oxalates. I am so angry at the damage that I did to myself in the interest of 'health' you have no idea. The better I feel the more robbed I feel.\n\nIf you have anymore questions, I will answer to the best of my ability. \n\n------\n\nIn case anyone was wondering, I had to run before, but here is two more places where they point out that fiber can be hazardous to our health. (They must have *finally* updated. It did not look like this five months ago.)\n\n\n\n They say my motility is very low in my esophagus and that they expect it to be scleroderma. So they scheduled an appointment with a rheumatologist to confirm.  I am not a doctor, but I do not think low motility in the esophagus is specific to scleroderma. Perhaps they saw other signs. Maybe try not to worry too much in the mean time, but definitely definitely see the rheumatologist. I am terrified. My finger nails are purple from low circulation and the popping noise in my chest (which does not have every time) coupled with the pain that goes in and out. My second kid is due in May and I imagining their life without me makes me so sad.  I am sorry. It is very scary. I have 3 kids and I am the breadwinner for my family, and I scared myself a lot by reading too much.\n\nBut try not to scare yourself too much. I would not fully trust the diagnosis until you have seen a rheumatologist. And there are treatments that can slow down the progress. The lung disease treatments have gotten better in just the last few years, and stem cell transplant seems pretty effective for a lot of people and is getting much safer lately.\n\nTry to find a scleroderma specialist near you and schedule an appointment now; do not wait until you are done with the other rheumatologist appointment (I am assuming the appointment is with a regular rheumatologist, not a specialist/research center). But I would keep the existing appointment; it is hard to get in sooner.\n\nGood luck. Wow, amazing. Thanks so much! I will sit down properly tonight to read your story in peace. V happy for you you are on track!  I had a genetic test that showed 2 genes related to poor folate metabolism. Is there a connection to Scleroderma? \n\n Yes, actually. The did a study not too long ago where they tested a handful of micronutrients in established Scleroderma patients. I believe that selenium was #1 and folate was #2. \n\nThey came to the conclusion that Scleroderma patients struggle to get their micronutrients.\n\nWhile that may be true, it think it is a bit premature to assume that the Scleroderma causes the deficiencies. There is a possibility that the deficiencies trigger the disease in vulnerable patients.\n\nDid they tell you what to do about the deficiencies or only that you had them? One more question (if you know). Do you know what the gene snips were defective and how many mutations you had on each snip? I am just copy/pasting from the Promethease report. The website says the first 2 are not that rare, however I am thinking they could have some cumulative effect.\n\nrs1801131\t(A;C) - Possibly impaired folate metabolism MTHFR rs1801131 (C) or MTHFR A1298C is a mutation in the folate pathway, specifically in the enzyme involved in converting 5-methylfolate (5MTHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF). Defects in folate metabolism can increase the risk of neural tube defects and possibly contribute to risk of stroke / heart attack. Unlike rs1801133 or MTHFR C677T, this mutation does not lead to elevated homocysteine levels, however some studies have suggested that there may be a synergistic effect in individuals heterozygous for both mutations.\n\nrs1801133\t(C;T) - 1 copy of C677T allele of MTHFR = 60% efficiency in processing folic acid = could have somewhat elevated homocysteine and low B12 and folate levels \n\nrs602662(G;G) - Lower vitamin B12 levels We found that the SNP '''rs602662''' was significantly associated with the levels of vitamin B(12) (p value&lt;0.0001). We also found that individuals adhering to a vegetarian diet with GG (homozygous major genotype) have significantly '''lower''' levels of vitamin B(12) in these individuals. I get the purple fingers a lot, the cold really gets to me. I try to stay as warm as I can, always keep gloves with me, and I try not to put my hands in any danger. I will get cute sometimes that will take forever to heal cause of the poor circulation, but I still try to live my life. \n\nMy docs are also concerned about my esophagus motilitywise. I keep a list of foods that do not agree with me, I always have a liquid with my when I eat to help the food go down, and I really try to watch what I eat. \n\nKeep your head up, you have a family and people who love and care for you, it will get annoying sometimes but they are there to help, I have had issues with my family and my meds and just me being sick, but you can die an old old man so long as you fight for it. I have been in it for only 4 years, my sister has been dealing with lupus for almost 20 years now and she fights and keeps her head up.  I also got recently diagnosed February 2019 so I can relate to the confusion and being scared. I also recommend not looking it up you really will scare you more. I am 22f and mine was just weird bruise on my thigh that now covers most of that thigh and my shin. I went to the doctor as soon as I started to not look like a bruise (it started to look dry, translucent, whitez shiny, scaly) which was November call in and an appointment in December where I had a biopsy done. My GP was rally confused on what it was and thought it was effecting my fat so it was a really deep biospy. At this point I had googled high and low and expected a scleroderma as the result. When I went back in to seem GP January 15. I was told Morphea at the time whcih sounds like the best you can hear.\n\nI met my rheumatologist in late January and started my methotrexate last Monday at 0.6cc and am now at 0.7cc we changed it to Saturdays just incase I get symptoms from it. My dosage at the mean time will be 0.8cc moving forward. I am supposed to watch my skin like a hawk to see if it is progressing faster if it is I have to get back in immediately.\n\nI am also super scared cause I mean if it is worst case scenario that is 2 more years which is terrifying. Especially since the meds will not even start maybe working till April.\n\nI also have joint pain in my knee and ankle where the scleroderma defiantly is. I also have extreme itchiness im really concerned that the itchiness could be where it shows up next. But it is not presenting the the same it is like a rash for me this time so ill be phoning my rheumatologist tomorrow cause if it is spreading faster we need to nip it in the butt. It does not feel or look like my leg at all it is more rash  like. However I woke up today after my shot last night and I do not have a much joint pain so let us hope that is a move in the right direction and not a fluke.\n\nMethotrexate is a really common way to treat scleroderma at least in my area. I just got all my blood work done two Fridays ago and go in for my echocardiogram in two weeks the pulmonary function test has not been scheduled yet. I actually had my x-ray done once my GP found out it was may be Morphea and alot of blood work. So we can develop a baseline and have those test redone pretty frequently in the beginning.\n\nI still have not been told whcih type I have which is also concerning. If you want to talk feel free to contact me although most people in here have had the disease longer and better understanding.\n\nCurrently I am diagnosed with sclederma and an treated with methotrexate. This is in Canada, BC. Since treatment may vary by country. Also if anyone else wants to reach out to me or is willing to let me talk to them I would love to discuss about the itchiness cause I cannot find much on that online and would like to understand it better. The one thing i will tell you is get your self a BP machine. My gf has the disease and works out a lot but she had a hypertensive crisis. 220/180. So now she checks it daily as a precaution.    What happened with the crisis? ", "What do you do when the people closest to you have no interest in even understanding your disease and are totally unwilling to consider the outcome? I find myself in a bizarre situation.   \n\n\nNobody who I love (who loves me) will discuss the situation. At all. No questions. No concern. They just act like it is not happening. When I try to talk to them about the situation, they make a joke and/or just change the subject.  \n\n\nEverybody gets that I am sick, but nobody really understands it and none of them WANT to understand it. I have nobody to talk to. If I am sad because I figure out that there is another food I cannot eat (I have serious GI involvement) I hear, \"I am glad I do not have your thing!\" or \"Ha! I can still eat all the fiber in the world. I actually need it to get through the day!\" Then subject change.  \n\n\nMy husband is the king of volunteer work. I am not joking. \"The Volunteer of the Year Award goes to...\" Him. Every time. He spends hours every week volunteering for four different organizations. He just took a huge pay cut to change jobs to help people with PTSD full-time. More fulfilling work. \"A calling,\" he said. I support that. This is a wonderful thing.  \n\n\nBut with me, he is so dismissive of the entire situation. I mean, he is doing the laundry. What more do I want?  \n\n\nI am literally dying and the people I love, trust, and depend on just do not register it. I feel like I am in a bubble on another planet all the time.  \n\n\nNot one person cares enough to watch a video with me or do a Google search or even to ask a question. Let alone let me talk about it.   \n\n\nAnd I do not understand that. When one of them is sick or hurt, I am all over it. I am looking up dietary guidelines and treatments and clinical trails all day. I do not understand not having one person who cares about the illness that is sapping the life out of me. You would think that somebody would be curious enough to hit google for ten minutes. But how can they when they do not accept that I am sick to begin with?  \n\n\nI had my first pulmonary function test today and nobody cared about the outcome. I have had four GI surgeries (and two endoscopies and three colonoscopies) over the last year and a half and they wonder out loud when I will be fixed and if that will finally do it.  \n\n\nI will not be fixed. These were bandaids. There will be more.  \n\n\nMy eyes went nuts a month ago, I lost a ton of vision literally over night to vitreous frosting, this is where I will stay unless it decides to get even worse. With that, I lost my ability to drive forever. My independence is gone forever. And nobody cares. At all. Not one person has even expressed curiosity about the condition that sent me flying to the eye doctor at the last minute. I told them and they made a note, but then I hear 'why cannot you drive, again?' Like I am shamming for rides.  \n\n\nNot one of them believes that I am broken and cannot be fixed. It is not like I am sitting here all passive-aggressive, waiting for somebody to say something. I reach out and they act like I am talking about the weather or an uninteresting piece of the news. It is insane to me, but not one of them believes that I am seriously ill. \"Invisible illness?\" Yeah, no. My illness if plastered all over my freaking face.  \n\n\nDear lord. I am so alone.  \n\n\nDoes anyone know where a terminally ill person can go to discuss their terminal illness? To work through that shitty reality? Obviously I do not have a support system in that regard.  Are you attending a scleroderma support group? If so, could you bring your husband to one?   Or to an educational event?\n\nI think it is hard for family sometimes, because they do not want to admit that you are sick.  \u201cIgnore it and it will go away\u201d is what they are hoping.   If they take an interest, they have to come to terms with the fact that you are not well, and that is hard for them. \n\nAnother idea would be a session or two with a couples counselor.  I did this with my husband, and it was one of the best things we ever did for ourselves.  We live in such a remote small town that I do not know if there is even one other person with scleroderma in my area - let alone a whole group.\n\nI am going to use an online counseling service for myself (I am housebound, so that is the best I can do) and hopefully hubs and I can get into counseling sooner rather than later.\n\nI am just hurt by such a bizarre reaction. Tonight I had a fall-out with my best friend over it. Tried to call her on her BS, but she just scrambled and there was more bs. Realizing that it was not doing any good, I backed off to save the relationship.\n\nMy daughter's dealing with her own crap, so I cannot talk to her. Same for my mother. \n\nAnd there is this weird thing that happens when you can no longer drive. People look at you weird. I cannot tell you how many times people have asked me over and over again, \"Why cannot you drive?\" They think it is such a simple task but cannot comprehend that, when your brain and eyes do not work right, it is not a particularly safe activity.\n\nMy husband keeps talking about buying me a car that is comfortable and easy to drive so I can 'practice.' \n\n*sigh* I know how to drive a stick shift pickup truck! Hell, I can change that truck's tire, check the fluids, and rebuild a carburetor. (There. Now you know I am old.) That is not the the problem! I CANNOT SEE THE FREAKING DETAILS OF THE SITUATION. We lost our kid in a traffic accident two years ago. I am not about to murder somebody else's kid because I am being pressured into 'just trying.' (I gave up on driving four years before my son died because I could not see a stop sign and nearly caused a serious accident. The funeral just cemented that I made the right decision.) \n\nTrust me. I would rather be able to drive! I want my damn life back, too!\n\nToday, in addition to the pulmonary function test, I had an MRI. My doctor thinks that I had a stroke a month ago - and that might not have been my first one.\n\nSo yeah. Cannot drive! Not making it up. Not 'intimidated' or unwilling.\n\nBut people cannot comprehend it.\n\nI was diagnosed nine months ago. Today, not ONE of my loved ones know what my disease is or understands the implications. Not one person who claims to love me has bothered to look into it at all.\n\nI sent out a video that explained my situation. Not one of them would watch it.\n\nI am on the verge of giving up on the planet right now. I completely understand where you are coming from.  My husband is mostly supportive now, but neither one of my parents are. (Or were, as my dad passed away this year.)  My mother told me that she just figures that my scleroderma will go away eventually.  And my father never acknowledged that I have it at all.  It is super frustrating. \n\nI lost a friend over it as well.  There were other problems with our relationship, but I do not think she ever understood how much pain and anxiety I was experiencing at the time.  She was upset that I was grouchy when we went out, but the fact that I was even ABLE to go out was nearly a miracle. \n\nI say if they will not watch the video (especially your husband) make them watch it!  Find a good Scleroderma 101 video on YouTube and say \u201cthis is what we are watching right now!\u201d\n\nI really would urge you to see if you can find a support group that is close enough for you to attend even just once, so that you can at least talk to some scleroderma patients that live in your general area.  They are frequently the best support because they know exactly what you are going through. And they may be able to help point you in the direction of the best doctors in your region too.  \n\nIf you are in the US, the Scleroderma Foundation has a list of support groups on their website - (  ). Even if you cannot get to a support group meeting, if there is a chapter for your state/area, you could contact them for local advice and connections.  You are definitely not alone/ I feel exactly the same way...even noticing how they roll their eyes when I talk about it.   At first I was sad about it, then once I started expecting them to not care about this condition I am going through, it became easier for me.   I guess just accepting the fact that they do not understand the magnitude of this disease, is comforting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it seems like they do not care, and not to excuse their behavior I kind of understand in a way, why they act this way.  Having never heard of scleroderma before in my life or any type of autoimmune disease like this I wonder how \"healthy me\" would have reacted if my sister, daughter, mom, friend came down with this. I would probably be confused about it, when I am being completely honest with myself I know that I would probably think the person is somewhat hypochondriac/hysterical.  I would think it was in their head maybe. Maybe a mental illness more than anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter thinking about it like this, I stopped taking it personal when they do not show concern considering the magnitude of the disease. It became a lot easier to accept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt still sucks. It should not be like this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that you find comfort in knowing that you are not alone, I know it sometimes feel like we are so alone in handling this disease. You are not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B; I feel like this is extremely similar to my situation, except I do not have a significant other. What is even worse is that my sister has/had Celiac disease, and the family would be EXTREMELY conscientious of it and every family dinner, she would get special considerations, sometimes getting food from a completely different restaurant. in my case though, with a much more serious condition, no one in my family bats an eye. I honestly think they forget there is anything wrong with me, and that makes it worse on multiple levels, one being, I feel like they look down on me for not being 'productive' enough.  \n\n\nThere are support groups online for Scleroderma. I have joined one or two, but I am not really active in them, and it is really not the same thing as having those people in a room with you, so it does feel a bit.. 'detached.' There is often some good information, but since you get all types of people chiming in, you can also have people throw a lot of 'Woo Woo' and bullshit at you, so then you have to kind of sift through internet replies.. Not really the best support system, if you ask me. Thank you for the comment. It is actually comforting to hear that I am not the only one.\n\nIt is a weird disease. People do not understand it or know how to react to it. Because there is really not a lot that can be done to fight it, it is easier to ignore.\n\nI feel like the people who love me the most do not want to acknowledge how bad this really is. \n\nFunny thing is that they would not act this way with cancer. But in a way, people are prepared for cancer. They have some understanding of the disease.  I am really sorry to all of you. My dad almost died of scleroderma and I cannot even begin to explain how much I cared for him during that time. I am just so sorry you guys.... I am really sorry. Scleroderma SUCKS. I am so sorry &gt;((hugs)) to you!   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for caring. It does matter that SOMEONE gives a crap. I promise you are not alone though  I do not think anyone can really say why your relations are reacting this way to your diagnosis, however sometimes when I get news of someone being terminally ill I freeze up and do not know what to do or say. Also I react like this to news of someone who has died. I just cannot think of anything to say. Perhaps the \u2018fight or flight\u2019 response kicks in and I go into \u2018flight\u2019 mentality and run away. \nIf your relations are in \u2018flight\u2019 they may be very scared for you and themselves. Scared of losing you and scared of also being unwell. Scared of being responsible somehow. Fear makes people react irrationally. \nPerhaps ask your husband to go and see your specialist with you and get them to talk to him. If he hears it from the doctor it may sink in more and he can cope. \nHope this helps, take care. ", "Help Hi there!\n\nI have been trying to get help for 5 months for what is clearly a debilitating disease of some sort.\n\nHowever, I am transgender (interestingly enough, this started when I started estrogen, ( just Super Saying), I have a history of drug use and mental illness. Thus, it has been impossible to get looked at fairly.\n\nI would have my temperature, blood pressure and heart rate taken, and with that thorough and extensive examination, told to go home. One time, quite literally with the words \"fuck off back home\". Thanks!\n\nI have had discharge notices incorrectly filed (this is illegal and dangerous), I have been misquoted, and during all of this, nobody looked at my hands, my skin, or any of the concerns I had.\n\nI tried explaining my symptoms the way a normal, non medical professional would. But by not knowing the name of symptoms and attempting to describe them, they assumed I was crazy and referred me to mental health services (hypochondriasis, besides requiring 6 months of presenting history, is a diagnosis of exclusion. Not the first fucking thing you think of).\n\nSo I studied up. I learned. And I came to the conclusion I likely have Diffuse Systemic Sclerosis. Now I know everyone says that, and I will get back to it in a second. But back then, I thought \"Oh yay, finally I can get someone to see what is up\"\n\nSo when trying to run through CREST with people who should like, already fucking know what it is, they assumed I was a \"cyberchondriac\" and without looking at my hands, skin or face, referred me to mental health services. \n\nTell me then. How does one get examined physically?\n\nThen the lesions started. By lesions, I mean what is most definitely and quite obviously calcinosis. Again, somehow the ex methhead trans scum is the only one who recognizes this shit.\n\nThey were, and still are everywhere and spreading (to the point where some *kiiiiinda* look like calciphylaxis and I am choosing to not think about that). The problem is, some are on my genitalia.\n\nGenitalia. Trans. Ulcers. \n\nMust be syphilis, right? What else could it be? So lets chuck you on antibiotics and antivirals.\n\nNegative of all STI's and all Viruses. Bacterial cultures negative. I already knew this. I would had it done twice before...\n\n\"Hmmm. That is unusual. Still, you ARE trans. Therefore it must be a dirty sex thing. After all. Genitals! They have not healed, so let us put you on even stronger antibiotics and antivirals despite the fact they kind of triggered a week long flare up and none of our testing shows any evidence you have ever had any sort of infection\"\n\nIt did not matter how much I pointed out they were now everywhere. It did not matter how much I pointed out this goes against everything in medicine. But anyway...\n\nNegative of all STI's and all Viruses. Bacterial cultures negative.\n\n\"That is utterly bizarre. For some reason, we cannot make the tests line up with our assumptions, which is particularly ironic, because that is what we keep accusing you of doing without acknowledging your concerns. Still, we best keep you on the meds that are really fucking you up, obviously, BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE CONTRACTED ONE IN BETWEEN\"\n\nSeriously, I may be dramatizing the quotes for pithy effect, but the caps? That was said verbatim.\n\nFolks, it is hard enough dating as a trans person. With calcific ulcers all over your body, especially down there, gnarled hands and tightened skin (not to mention the linear lesions deforming my face and limbs...) I do not even go outside for non medical reasons because I look like trash. How could I have sex? I do not even want to be looked at. But anyway, I am sure you know what is coming next.\n\nNegative of all STI's and all Viruses. Bacterial cultures negative.\n\nBecause of course. Doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results, what is that the definition of again? Good healthcare? No that was not it...\n\nBut I got a concession. I got my doctor to order an ANA.\n\nPositive. Because it is almost as if I know what I am talking about. To date, this has been the ONLY thing anybody has tried that has even remotely suggested a diagnostic direction, and again, it came from the ex methhead trans scum, not the qualified doctors.\n\nBut it was dismissed at 1:80 titer despite...\n\na) 1:80 may typically not be associated with autoimmune disease, but has been seen in early systemic disease, younger patients (which I am) and especially both.\n\nb) It has a speckled distribution, one of the rarer nuclear distributions and out of the nuclear patterns, the one most strongly associated with CTD's diagnostically. SSc in particular has slightly higher rates within speckled.\n\nc) I have mitotic spindle targetting in my ANA test. Now if you do not know what this means, that is OK. They are incredibly rare, and as such, medicine in general is pretty in the dark about them. However, ( which, to date, appears to be the largest collective study of Mitotic spindle targeting, concluded that they appear to be a \"unique serological marker\" of connective tissue diseases, especially when rheumatoid factor is low. Mine is, because my doctor ordered it, not realizing that was not what I was asking for. This is what happens when most doctors know nothing about autoimmune diseases beyond the PowerPoint in 101. Not everything is Rheumatoid Arthritis or Lupus, y'know.\n\nd) ( is overwhelming people at \"low positives\" of 1:80, and despite the typical sex spread, seems to be vastly more common in XY's than XX's.\n\nHowever, a phone conversation between my doctor and a rheumatologist came to the conclusion, without me obviously, that it was \"unlikely\" I had a CTD. My doctor had always deferred knowledge to other people on this issue, and this rheumatologist...\n\na) Has NEVER seen me, so how can they judge my symptoms?\n\nb) Obviously forgets that an ANA can only support a diagnosis, not rule one out.\n\nc) Does not have any other suggestion for diagnostic direction, and this is literally all anyone has to go on so far.\n\nAny Rheumatologist making a decision solely on an ANA for a patient they have never met deserves to be delicensed in disgrace.\n\nSo, despite my doctor saying it was \"impossible\" to send pictures to specialists (because that is what I wanted to do if he would not see me and she would not refer me), she wanted to take a photo of my ulcerative lesions to show to a dermatologist.\n\nPsych.\n\nShe just took a photo of my dick.\n\nLets ignore the giant fucking necrotic ulcer on my thigh because lolgenitalz.\n\nAnd.... That was about a month and a half ago. I quite simply do not know what to do. Nobody has heard from the dermatologist. My doctor wishes to wait for that, but I bet she would feel differently were it her body.\n\nHow do I know I have Systemic Sclerosis?\n\nWell, beyond the quite obviously calcific ulcers everywhere, I have sclerodactyly so bad that I went from being a 15 year veteran guitarist to not being able to play. I have multiple digital ulcers, on top of all the other ones. I have Raynauds, which has gotten so ridiculously bad this month, as it cools down down under. My mouth is shrinking, my teeth are being pushed around the place by suspicious lumps of calcium in my gums, and my gums are receding more than when I lived on meth and sugar. My throat is closing up from one side. I have telangiactasia, not as much as many people I have seen, but they appear to be less common in younger patients. Still they are brutally obvious. I have \"Barretts sign\" of the neck. I have, as alluded to, linear sclerotic lesions on all limbs, and on my face in Blaschkoid distribution. I have the pinched nose with the \"classic\" tip. I have the furrowed mouth. I have telangiactasia on my tongue for fucks sake. I have taut, shiny, thick skin everywhere and I mean everywhere. I have ragged \"Terrys Nails\" with splinter haemorrages and horizontal lines. I have abdominal bloating whenever I eat. I have hair loss, in precisely the same locations as the linear lesions. I have gone from being athletic (gymnast) to getting winded if I stand up too fast. I have lost 30 fucking kg over this time period (That is about 66 pounds, America). I have what definitely appears to be Sjogrens Syndrome. And most importantly, I have many photos detailing these changes over time to show that no, I did not always have linear dents in my face, my nose did not look like that, and check how bad my hands have gotten. To be honest, I literally do not know what I am missing.\n\nI am also having seizures. Yes. Seizures. Going untreated and unmedicated. I know they are not traditionally a symptom of SSc, but ( and in fact ( particularly in those with \"en sabre de coup\" lesions. Which I do have, ( particularly in speckled patterns and younger patients...just super saying...\n\nGranted, it is not particularly common (above study cites 3.2-6.7 percent of SSc patients as having LS), but it sure as hell happens at higher rates than syphilis that does not show up in tests.\n\nThis is the problem with modern medicine. Despite having access to the exact same medical journals they do, people treat it like an unknowable, mysterious entity that only The Sacred Doctors can understand. Yet due to the not even disguised contempt I have faced combined with complete inability to recognize someone withering away in front of them, compounded with a lack of critical thinking and some incredibly inefficient and illogical testing around infections despite never showing signs of one, most healthcare professionals I have met have shown their degree only proves they know how to take on debt and be at a place on a regular schedule. Bravo.\n\nSo I guess I have two questions.\n\na) In your opinion, what do you think it is? Is there anything else it could be?\n\nb) WHAT THE FUCK DO I DO? First of all, I am very sorry that nobody is taking you seriously. I am new at this disease myself... From what I have read, a lot of your symptoms fit. The calcinosis sounds unusual in that from what I have read, it is much more likely to happen at extremities like the fingers, sometimes elbows, but I think the groin is probably rare... The closer to the heart, the less likely. But scleroderma can overlap with other conditions like lupus and sjogren's, so that in no way says it is not scleroderma. I would suspect some kind of overlapping connective tissue disorder.\n\n\nIf at all possible, see a rheumatologist who specializes in scleroderma. It is primarily a clinical diagnosis, there are many people who are negative for antibodies. I do not know how to convince closed-minded doctors, but maybe you can find one who will listen.\n\nKeep pushing until you find someone who can listen and diagnose you :-( I am sure that is not easy but try. You know, you could try finding a scleroderma patient support group to meet up with in your area? Maybe they could help connect you with a knowledgeable doctor. Cross post this to r/askdocs. Groin is definitely very very unusual, Sclero or not, but if it is not idiopathic (Absence of other symptoms, syndromes or diseases that could cause it), it seems to be most commonly associated with Lupus, Dermatomyositis and most common of all, SSc.\n\nI do have little pitted scars on my fingertips, but luckily years of guitar have left them thick, hardened and resistant to the worst of it. My knuckles and knees are a little less lucky however.\n\nYour idea to contact a Scleroderma support group was fantastic; they got back incredibly fast and are trying to set me up with one of the Rheumatologists' they know. Thanks so much! I am so glad! Keep us posted. Best of luck, I hope you can find answers and treatment. By the way, the Scleroderma group on Facebook is another great place for asking questions: \n\n Calcinous on the groin isnt that rare, I have CREST and I too have calcinous on my testicles. Reynaouds phenomenon is causing the pits on your fingers from collagen buildup, watch that cause it can turn to cellulitis. I lost the tip of an index finger from it. There is a specific blood test for CREST and one for Diffuse sclerodoma,  diffuse is the worse one so I hope you test negative for that. I cant remember the protein that comes up in the test. A great website for docs and info is   (\n\nIncidentally, when I got cellulitis, my symptoms rapidly increased in severity, which ties into the eosinophilic fasciitis link.\n\nCalcinosis of the groin *is* that rare when we compare it to the number of people within Systemic Scleroderma that do not get it. Especially considering this spectrum of diseases is rare in of itself.\n\n*Idiopathic* Scrotal Calcinosis is certainly not the rarest thing in the world, but *dystrophic* Scrotal Calcinosis? While it is far from unheard of, it is pretty weird.\n\nEspecially as calcinosis, particularly severe calcinosis, is associated more with CREST/Limited Systemic, rather than Diffuse.\n\nWhich I have.

The music director at my church swears by it as well and she is got lupus. Joining in late, but just wanted to add Low FODMAP diet. I am currently implementing and am feeling better\nBut I also suffer from endometriosis, so that might disturb thing, although it might all be connected, who knows.... Seconding gluten free. I tried it for my morphea but I had a lot of other problems at the time that cleared up in days. The morphea patch took a while to heal from the cream that I had been putting on it though, so I cannot be 100% sure that gluten free put it in remission. But it did go into remission, and it had been getting steadily worse up to that point. Just found this sub, but when I was in an active phase like 7 years ago I tried mostly gluten free and Paleo. It seemed to help a lot with reflux and anxiety also. I just had a baby 4 months ago and it seems that it might have triggered some patches so I am thinking of trying the Paleo again for a while What is that?  Thanks. This helps my wife. She has limited systemic sclerdoma.\n\n", "Hyperpigmentation Hello everyone! I think I have hyperpigmentation because of plaquenil ( I use one pill a day). Especially on my hands and wrists.

I have heard that pineal gland calcification happens normally around adulthood (in all populations, not just sclero peeps).  I am pretty sure I have LCSS (I have all the symptoms, but have not done bloodwork yet because Coronavirus).  I definitely have symptoms that align with basal ganglia calcification - god knows almost every other part of my body is calcified on some level (usually not very extensively).  Obviously the symptoms of basal ganglia calcification also line up with a great many conditions, so I know it could be something else.\n\ntl;dr just trying to get a sense of how common calcification in the brain is so that I will not get laughed at in the dr's office when i ask about it", "Ridges in muscles Does anyone experience hard ridges growing your muscles that are tender?

We are still all I am a state of shock and disbelief ", "Diffuse Scleroderma with lung involvement - thoughts? Hi everyone. My mother in law was diagnosed last year with Diffuse systemic scleroderma. She has not had a ton of skin involvement but has had issues with her throat, lungs, and inflammation in the hands.  The lung involvement is obviously most concerning.\n\nShe recently found out that her lung involvement has worsened by 10% over about a 6 month period. Obviously not good. I do not have much more info at this point (and I need to find out what her lung function is at) but I am wondering if anyone else has had this and what the prognosis looks like?\n\nShe is in her mid 50s and otherwise healthy. I am sad for my partner and for her and want to be supportive as we are her main support system. But she can be rather vague about it. Can anyone provide me with more info on what this means and how it could progress? I was diagnosed with similar conditions about 10 years ago. I went on a six-month treatment of cyclophosphamide (a form of chemotherapy).  My lungs eventually cleared up, and my disease went from internal organs to the external skin issues.  I still have problems with my lungs every so often, but nothing severe at this point. However I do not think I am the norm. I have been on a cocktail of medicines for the past 10 years.  My biggest issues now are calcium deposits forming all over my body, and causing ulcers in my hands. One medicine that has been very helpful is Actemra.  It has not healed the issues with my hands, but it has made the pain and struggles a bit easier to deal with. I hope this helps. Thanks so much. I will look into those treatments. Do you know if that is a fairly rare treatment to undergo? I cannot remember if it is fluid that is in her lungs, or if it is scar tissue. I will find that out tomorrow. Depending on that, I suppose that sort of treatment may not be suitable. And can I ask how old you were at diagnosis?\n\nReally glad to hear your internal organ issues have gotten better. Best of luck to you, keep on fighting!  The issues usually scar tissue growing on the lungs and causing the lungs to hearted so it is difficult to take breath. This disease causes an over abundance of collagen to form throughout the body.   I was diagnosed at 38, although I had symptoms appear at around 35.  The problem with this disease, is that it hits people differently so what might work for one person may not work for another.  So as you read about the disease and see the various issues, know that it may not be the situation for your mom.  There are helpful resources so I hope that will help.\n\nHere is the website that I went to that has a lot more information and help.  \n(  She was just put on prednisone for a month trial. At this point I am not sure the dosage. I also do not know what her lung function is at. I keep asking my partner to get that info from her but she has not said anything about it yet despite providing regular updates. Does this sound normal from a specialist? To put you on a drug like that and not even give you info on what your lung capacity is already at? They say it is progressively gotten 10% worse in a year but 10% from what - 100% function or 50% etc? Actually, if there is any information going on at all in the body, prednisone is definitely one of the first steps!  Especially if there are other indications and bloodwork saying that there is inflammation in the body. It is interesting that they have not given you more specifics on the lung functions, but they maybe waiting for more information to make a determination as to what other medicines need to be taken.\n\nAnother suggestion, is to make a list of questions to be asked for the next doctor visit. That way you can keep track of things as they pop into your mind, and hopefully get some clear-cut results. Just saw this. I will try and keep short. I am a 50 yr old male w/ diffuse scleroderma with lung involvement (about 40% lost to fibrosis). The game changer for me was Mycophenolate (CellCept) which is an immunosuppressive. This drug has prolonged my life. I take 1500 mg twice daily. My hope is it will continue to work for many years. I also take omeprazole twice daily and Nifedipine once daily for CREST symptoms. Hope this helps and feel free to ask me any questions. Here is hoping! My mother in law is doing a lot of googling about the side affects which is not a good habit (I can say that from experience!) so I hope that does not fog her outlook.\n\nDefinitely will tell my husband to make a list to share with her.", "Asking for my grandma again, she feels better but her face is still very swollen and she is asking for dietary advice? I posted here not too long ago and got great advice about eating tumeric and avoiding added sugar which seems to have helped. And avoiding nightshade veggies which might be helping too we are not sure. Basically now she has some energy back, and the face swelling went down a bit then randomly came back. We read that diet is very important for managing this condition but now she says she does not know what is safe to eat. And it is so difficult to find dietary advice for this condition online, especially when the main issue is inflammation.\n\nShe is still waiting to see a rheumatologist and we are hoping he can provide more insight when she gets in to see him. Any advice would be greatly appreciated :) There is some individuality when it comes to diet. I just started the low FODMAP diet in conjunction with the AIP diet which is working really well for me. Others may recommend the Wahls protocol, which is a version of paleo. You might also look into having her take a food sensitivity test. I am waiting on my results from everlywell, but I have also had viome recommended to me as well. So I may do that one next because it is a bit more in depth than the other. Thank you! I will look into them. Low FODMAP is very helpful! She could also try an elimination diet to see which foods/ingredients she tolerates and which she does not before she can get back to a rheumatologist. After trying it, I found that raw onions, garlic, asparagus, and spicy foods tend to set me off the most (which bites because onions/garlic are an essential ingredient in most foods). So, now I try to have those things in moderation. I hope she continues to feel better while she gets these things ironed out! For me gluten in particular is a trigger food along with sugar. Just a word of warning with diets like AIP though, especially for an older person and if she has anxiety about food already they might be too extreme. Just bear in mind that stress is one of the worst things for it so if sticking to the diet is overwhelming it might actually do more harm than good. Focusing on reducing processed foods and prioritising whole foods and leafy greens and getting a sensitivity test for some specifics to avoid might be a more manageable option.", "Hello everyone! I hope you enjoy my first video where I am journaling about being diagnosed and living with a scleroderma since I was 13 years old.  This is beautiful. Thanks for sharing! good for you! This is great, a truly beautiful way to document your experiences. You had some lovely insights :) Hi. I recently just posted on this app regarding my scleroderma. Mine is localized but growing/spreading fast. I was wondering what the name of the antibiotic is? Is it still in testing phase or is this an approved treatment? Thank you. \ud83d\ude42 There is a doctor in Iowa who was trained by Dr. Sinnott. Dr. Sinnott treated people for decades with rheumatoid arthritis and sclera derma. Before retiring he trained another doctor. Her name is Susanna. When you go to Iowa for your treatment you receive Clinda myosin through an IV twice a day for five days and it puts you into remission. When you leave Iowa you have a prescription for minocycline. It is two 100 mg pills a day. I learned about this place from a woman who posted some thing online. I called her and made an appointment as soon as we hung up back in 2014. People from all over the world go to this hospital for the treatment. Treatment is at Horn Memorial hospital in Ida Grove Iowa.It sounds confusing but it is just simple process and the people there are so nice. Basically it is a week out of your life to feel a heck of a lot better. I would be happy to talk to you about my experience. I would love to hear more. I would be happy to talk to you about it. Please call me any time. My name is Denise and my phone number is 401-339-2323 Who was the Iowa doctor? How did you reach remission? Hi, I went to Iowa for the five days of treatments and then I took the prescribed antibiotics (once home).By the third morning of treatments in Iowa, I could dress myself. I got back a considerable amount of range of motion. And it slowly improved from there. I was really lucky. I would be happy to talk to anyone who is interested or has questions \ud83d\ude01 The dr is Susanne Landgrebe. She was trained by Dr. Sinnott. He did it for decades, saving people from all over the planet but he has retired Is she still there? I would love to hear more about it. Was your skin effected? Yes she is still helping people. I would be happy to talk to you it is just a lot to type. And yes my skin was affected. Everything was affected. I was a mess. The antibiotics are the only thing that helped me. Now I am back to taking care of my ponies, mowing my lawn, having a normal energy level\u2026 I can function and take care of things the way I did before this nightmare. My number is 401-339-2323. Call anytime. I am happy to speak with anyone who is interested in learning about this antibiotic protocol \ud83d\ude01", "Meds Recently started Methotrexate. I am wondering if anyone has ever had any experience with it ? \n\nI see it is a relatively low dose, everything I am reading online looks kind of intense. It is been chill for me so far. Almost but not quite a year on it. I have been on 10mg once a week, and I have not had any strong side effects. I did specifically ask to have an increased dose of folic acid during the week, it helps alot. I take 1mg folic acid in the morning, and 5mg 3 times a week, specifically exluding the day before and the day after I take methotrexate. \n\nThe day before and the day after I take the methotrexate can kind of suck. It can cause anemia when you do not take the folic acid, and since you cannot take it a day before and a day after you take methotrexate it kind of sucks, but it was not that bad for me. What is the likelihood of getting off the medication? I do not know. For me personally probably pretty slim. It alone did not reduce my inflammation to acceptable levels, so I was put on a combination therapy of Leuflonomide and Methotrexate (which technically still has not done the job). I think my rheumatologists goal is to get my inflammation down and then figure things out, but due to how I have responded to other meds I think it will be a forever kind of situation.\n\nWhen I was doing my own research on Methotrexate I found a mix of responses from people. Some folks would talk about how they had been on it for 10 years and it had started to lose effectivness. Other folks described it being a really brief experience, either because of bad side effects or how quickly it improved their symptoms.\n\nI think it is broadly prescribed for alot of conditions, so experiences vary quite wildly. Methotrexate has been around for quite awhile compared to other DMARDs. I think doctors tend to be more comfortable prescribing it because there is so much research about it. Ughhh the inflammation in my hands is the worst. Plaquenil has not worked to reduce it and I hate that you stated the same for you with methotrexate. Has anything helped reduce inflammation? My daughter has had a massive improvement in her hands while taking it. She can now fully open them with no pain.  It also makes her stomach hurt, so she is wearing off it at least for a while. Do you know why your doctor chose methotrexate over mycophenolate? It seems like mycophenolate has worked really well for a lot of people with scleroderma, usually with less side effects. Might be something to research and bring up with your rheumatologist. Planquenil took 6 months for it to even touch the inflammation I was experiencing, but it did okay after the long looooooong wait. It was even better in combo with methotrexate.\n\nI am currently on Leflunomide + Methotrexate, which has been pretty great but simultaneously pretty terrible. It absolutely nukes my liver if I have even the tiniest amount of alcohol in anything. I am basically extremely allergic to alcohol now, but the reaction is delayed by about a week.\n\nI am planning to ask my primary care doc about CBD oil for my hands since I have heard a lot of good things about it for scleroderma specifically. I also knit ALOT so that probably also helped my hands.\n\nI regularily go to physiotherapy and the gym. My knees were always much worse than my hands, so learning how to optimally move helped a lot (like more than I can describe). You are not supposed to take folic acid before and after the other one?? Taking Folic acid 24 hrs before or 24hrs after taking Methotrexate can weaken it is effect.\n\nYou need to supplement with folic acid during the week, but have to stop around the day you choose to take Methotrexate.", "Full body Raynauds  I have had full body Raynauds all my life. What kind of symptoms do you have for it? What have tests and doctors said? I guess I do not understand why your doctors are saying that widespread Raynaud's is not possible.

I have never read of it happening anywhere else unless it is vasculitis which I did not test positive for.

", "Tough finding diagnosis Hi,. \n\nWas complaining to my doctor 4 year's ago about heartburn that never goes away and dry eyes that come and go. His PA was great and kept thinking I had Sjogren's brewing in my system but kept testing negative on an ANA. A year later after bone dry eyes that came and went I finally tested positive for ANA.\n\nEnded up at the rheumatologist with a positive centimeter antibody and was perplexed since I had no Crest symptoms. The symptoms were dry eyes,mouth, dry skin, I had swollen lymph nodes and lips. My primary said I had Sjogren's and the Reumy was not sure.\n\nMy symptoms rapidly improved and I think went into total remission and stayed that way until a flare up I am having now. Again mild dry eyes and what I think is inflammation in the elbows. My CRP went from 0.8 to 2.7 so I think it picked up the flare up. \n\nI am confused. Do I have Crest? Sjogren's? Do I get on Plaqnil to stop everything in it is track's? Or do I wait it out? I have had minor flares and when they do subside I almost forget I even have an autoimmunemmune condition.\n\nAlso my primary said Crest needs a higher titer than 1:80? And that I have Sjogren's...... I have had CREST for over 20 years. Those symptoms do not match what I have encountered. CREST usually but not always the acronym. C = calcinosis R= Raynaud\u2019s E=esophagus S= sclerodactyly T=telangiectasia. I have full signs for all but one. Hope that helps.", "Skin colour change Hi, I am on plaquenil for 9 months. I noticed my body colour is like tanned after I started to used it. Especially my hands seem to me darker. Can it be related with medicine or scleroderma? Plaquenil or hydroxychloroquine has been known to\u00a0cause a darkened discoloration of skin\u00a0and/or mucous membranes. This is considered an adverse reaction so breing it up to your doctor. However scleroderma can cause hyperpigmentation all on its own. I am dealing with the same, especially on my lower lip. I have been on plaquenil for 4 months. When I was on Plaquenil, my skin got super tan all over. I have been off of it for years now and my body pigmentation is all over the place (varies a lot from no pigment to darker where my skin rubs), but I am not as dark as I was on that medicine. Thank you for sharing this, I feel a bit relax now\u263a\ufe0f Thank you for this info\ud83d\ude0a", "Wearing gloves? - Raynaud's and Scleroderma I have made fingerless gloves for typing and working indoors that have gotten great feedback from the the Raynaud's community and I was wondering whether there are additional pain points with gloves with Scleroderma since I understand that it can be common to also have Raynaud's.  Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback.  You can check out my website at ( too if you would like. I had a long post and lost it. So here is a quick summary. \n\nTaking them on and off sucks every time I wash my hands. I currently use IMAK gloves which are a bitch cause they are so snug and it frustrates me. \n\nIf there is no grip, it limits what I can do with the gloves on. \n\nSometimes I would like to wear the gloves while doing something that might get them dirty, but that is not feasible either. Perhaps a more \u201coutdoors\u201d or durable version for those situations?\n\nAlso design wise, it is usually my fingers which get the worst, not my hands themselves. If my palms are cold, the fingers are already unbearable. Uncertain if the design in the picture would help with that at all. Thanks so much for your feedback shadowredcap!  I can definitely relate to some of your pain points.\n\nThe gloves I have designed so far are trying to strike a balance between coverage/warmth with keeping the fingers free for everyday activities without any restriction.  My gloves do not have compression and fit just a bit more loosely than IMAK style gloves --is there a reason you like the compression aspect?\n\nAlso, I have made all my products easy to throw in the washing machine if they get dirty, but I think a more durable \"outdoors\" version could make sense to add.\n\nThanks again for your thoughts! This is my first thought, my fingers are the problem. My Raynauds has been getting really bad in the past 6 months and I work with my hands. I had hoped the warmer weather would make a big difference but it has not.\n\nI have been hunting down electric gloves and will likely end up with a pair of the milwaukee's but I do not really want a big bulky work glove. The thought occurred to me this morning to look for a heated steering wheel cover as driving is the worst for me even with the heater on.\n\nG'luck! The slight compression feels nice on my joints, but really the only reason is fit. The IMAK gloves allow for maximum dexterity as they fit like a second skin, so I do not have a floppy glove hindering movement. But, the downfall is that taking them off every time I need to wash my hands is annoying. Also, the super thin material is great, until they rip or wear out. \n\nAs for your product, if the glove is too thick at the palms, using a mouse for precision work, or a keyboard may be more difficult. Alas, warmer weather often comes with AC which is arguably worse lol. \n\nDriving is definitely a pain. I wish my car had a heated steering wheel. Also does not help that my shifter knob is stainless steel, so it gets ridiculously cold in the winter. Pretty much have to wear gloves all the time. But as you know, gloves do not solve the problem so much as they just delay it slightly. Thank you both for your thoughts.  Warm wishes!", "positive SCL 70 but no symptoms Hi all,\n\nFor reference, I am Caucasian, 30 yo female. For the past year I have had weird health issues. I started getting high blood pressure (like 140/90) and fast resting heart rate (80-90), even though I run a lot. I had some bladder problems and was diagnosed with overactive bladder..after taking medicine for a few months, it went away. in June, I developed this weird rash on my breast. was not reactive to any topical creams. it spread around my body, mostly on both breasts and on my belt area. the rash was SO itchy, and kept changing appearance. sometimes it was hives. mostly it looked like atopic dermatitis of some sort. It does not look like scleroderma rash (no tightness of skin, no oval shape, etc.). Anyways, the rash prompted an allergist to run ANA panel, and it came back with ANA positive, and SCL-70 pos at 1.6.  I have no symptoms on that 2013 checklist. Never have had Raynauds. I just am unsure what to think. I have to wait months to see a rheumy. \n\nI guess any insight anyone could offer would be great. Do you think I actually have scleroderma? Or will I develop it later? Scleroderma is a tricky one. Technically you need to present atleast 3 of the 5 crest symptoms for diffuse scleroderma if not you may have limited scleroderma with only 1 or 2 symptoms. Also you could be a carrier that never presents symptoms that tests positive for scl70. Its diffrent for everyone, the disease kind of rolls the dice on what combo of symptoms you get. Luckily if you dont have reynauds there is a huge chance you may just be a carrier I also have positive ANA tests and Scl70 is positive since 2019. I was sent to a hematologist back in 2019 to try to figure out what was causing giant platelets in my lab results, they ran a bunch of different tests and that is how we found out the Ana and scl was positive. Currently no symptoms of scleroderma, I have been seeing a rheumatologist who is doing yearly lung function tests and blood work.", "What is the prognosis for someone diagnosed with scleroderma that is effecting the Esophagus ? What is the typical prognosis when it effects your Esophagus motility? The vast majority of systemic scleroderma patients have esophageal dysmotility so there is really no way to answer that. \ud83d\ude0a Do you know the average prognosis in general than? Unfortunately there is no way to know that. Every patient is affected differently. Scleroderma attacks internal organs, so for some it can be debilitating or even fatal, and others live long and relatively normal lives.  I know several people who have lived with scleroderma for 40+ years, but I also knew several who have lost their lives to it. \n\nThere are some symptoms that are more common with the different types of scleroderma, but there is no way to know for sure what is coming.  That is why those annual tests are so important. \n\nIf you have been diagnosed with scleroderma I highly recommend finding a support group.  Many are online now.

Thank You!", "economist january 2015 ##\n", "Elevated platelets Hello everyone, I just wanted to ask does anyone experience elevated platelets?\n\nIn looking back at my labs over the last 10 years I have had slightly elevated platelets--somewhere around 25 to 50 points higher than the max normal range. I also show hi-normal neutrophils in many of my labs, or there is a higher number of neutrophils but no lab range. The rest of my labs look great. When I researched this oddity online I found an in-depth paper on the different skin related autoimmune disorders with high and low platelets. Scleroderma was listed,  with an in-depth discussion involving the mechanisms driving elevated platelets and their role with immune and vascular function,  and fibrosis. \n\nI do have the anti-centromere and anti-RNA antibodies. \n\nSo, if you do have elevated platelets, has your doctor ever discuss your elevated platelet count with you? Mine has been the same\u2014elevated platelets and neutrophils Thanks for responding! Did your doc ever discuss the reason? No not at all. They just say it is indicative of inflammation \ud83d\ude44 I am not sure I buy it I recently (last 6 weeks) have started experiencing itching, then bier spots show, then in comes the painful burning in my toes, and sometimes my hands. From trying to figure it out on my own, it appears to be Erythromelalgia and that has a relationship to thrombocythemia. I know my platelets are not to the level of that illness but the Erythromelalgia pain has me wondering about this platelet issue. If indeed I have had ongoing inflammation in my body, the lab tests I have had do not pick it up; but, my body is telling me it is having problems. Omg this sounds like me. My itching and red burning skin has been going on almost daily since December 2020. It is awful. Oh also my labs did not show the normal inflammatory markers either however my doctors both said high white blood cells are absolutely indicative of inflammation. Not everyone presents in the same way. Well, that is good to know.\n\nRe: inflammation, my cardiologist mentioned that a low oxygen state could elevated pulmonary arterial pressure--(mine's climbing from 27-36 in 2 years). In looking into sleep apnea (I score a 6 with 5-15 being mild), there is some research suggesting hypoxemia causes inflammation.

Sorry to hear about your mom\u2019s health. I have had Limited Scleroderma(CREST) for over 20 years. I can be really scary. I have started a podcast for Scleroderma patients, friends and family. It is called Mogils Mobcast. The first 2 episodes are out. Some of the suggestions in them might help. I have guests lined up thru the end of the year. If a doctor has a hard time, they might lack experience. Ask for a second opinion. Since Scleroderma is such a rare thing, I strongly suggest people to take this step. Especially if it is not under control after a certain time. \n\nFor food and weight loss. Small meals 5 to 6 per day. Or a lot of snacks. Nuts, pasta, anything that gives a lot of energy. Even when doing nothing your body is fighting, so feed it. Meal replacements are good too. Avoid diets. Vegan, keto, or all those commercial driven ones. They kill ya. Do you have a rheumatologist that you really like? I am in Minneapolis and part of me is wondering if I need a second opinion. I am also in Minneapolis. My Rheumatologist is Dr. Molitor. He is Excellent. Who do you see now?  Scleroderma is not genetic. Not to worry for you, so let us work on your mum! gastroparesis, a slowing of digestion is part of scleroderma.  she should talk to her dr and explain what she is experiencing. there is a test they can do to see if this is the problem. in the meantime as another poster has suggested- small meals with easily digested foods may help until she finds out the cause.  i used a meal replacement drink and nearly quit eating until my stomach calmed down, i am doing better now- most symptoms that scleroderma causes can be controlled. i am glad your mom has you looking out for her, having support means so much! Hey! My mum also had scleroderma who has now passed away. I had also been worried about this and had to go to a therapist to get myself under control. \n\nBelieve me, I have read study after study and it is extremely rare for scleroderma to be passed down, if anything (unlikely) , it will be a different autoimmune disease.

It is good to know I can focus on my mum rather than think of me too. I already am a hypochondriac so good to not have this on my mind. This is really great, thank you so much.

At the dermatologist I truly thought they would give me some cream and I would go about my way but that did not happen. She looked at them under a little scope and said it was definitely vascular and had I ever had ana panel done. I said no and she ran one and it came back with a positive sl 70 I think it is called and I was referred to a rheumatologist. They come and go and a steroid cream I was prescribed helped. Are they painful if you bump into them? Burn or itch? Oh before I forget every single one that has gone away has flattened but never truly went away and the areas are sore still if I bump into them. Hello not to alarm you however i would highly advise you to see a dermatologist and rheumatologist. It could be scleroderma. Key word could be. Have you ever had your ANA tested? Do you have any other symptoms other then the hemorrhages on your fingernails? Fatigue? Any other skin issues? Ana was negative, but fatigue, gi issues, non specific aches and pains, raynauds and constant occipital/trigeminal neuralgia type headaches are issues.

This has never been an issue for my father and never was for my sister (passed away a year ago). I have much less pronounced versions of this on a few fingers. I have Raynaud's, of course. But no autoimmune diagnosis as of yet. Going To talk to a doc this week about doing an ANA. I hope everything works out for you!\n\nSide note: Googling this particular symptom is fucking terrifying. I am a bit of a hypochondriac, and I quite literally cannot stop myself from researching about my body and trying to fit the pieces together. But with this particular symptom, there is no pieces to fit together. Google basically says it HAS TO BE autoimmune. Which is terrifying. Agreed about HAS to be.Personally I would not say I was worried, more p***ed off with all these seemingly minor (to others) symptoms and being so tired all the time. Last january i had most of my sigmoid colon removed and two years prior to that a nissen fundoplication to treat volume reflux and gerd, which I am now discivering is attributable to an autoimmune condition.

As well as the scleroderma education project is the best places to get an educatino about the disease that is up to date.d consider seeing a scleroderma specialist to go over symptoms you may have overlooked like: raynauds, acid reflex/GERD, GI issues, shortness of breath, and more. Generally you need several of these symptoms to get a diagnosis from a scleroderma specialist. Plenty of doctors who are not educated on scleroderma will give a diagnosis based on antibodies but it is truly not how it is done. Antibodies at most can give a guess on a possible prognosis. Since those with the same antibody tend to have a similar progression and timeline of how fast the disease can move. Meds have also come a long way and if you arent on proper sites google can be terrifying. I personally stumbled upon some scary sites at first as well. However, the more I learnt that was accurate the better I felt. To me knowledge was power. I knew how all the forms could progress how to diagnosis between them and all of my treatment options. Hydroxychloriquine works wonders for my joint pain and fatigue just remember to get your eyes checked soon because it rare cases it can affect the eyes and usually it is after many years of being on it and it is rare but its a precaution to get baseline testing done.  \n\n\nNow where to get educated: ( which will also list scleroderma speicalist and centers in the states. As well as the scleroderma education project are the best places to get an education about the disease that is up to date. Hey - it is been a few days since your post. How are you holding up?\n\nOnline searches for Scleroderma can be a panic inducing rabbit hole. While some information is good, it does not reflect on your specific manifestation.

They can provide useful, vetted information that you can feel confident in.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed in '19, the first thing I did was Wikipedia it and read random pages on it. Made me feel awful and like my time was running out. I was trying to be an expert on the disease from my armchair.

I have always felt disgusting, but until recently, that was put down to my other medical conditions. I have always had severe Reynauds, gastric reflux, and what I thought was eczema.\n\nHowever, I have started seeing a rheumatologist, and over the past few months, my ANA panel has remained positive (in several substrates as well), but my anti-centromere antibody incidence has increased. My rheumatologist has been mentioning CREST. I cannot find much information on anti-centromere antibodies other than that they occur often in people with CREST and scleroderma. Are they exclusive to people with sclero/CREST or is there a chance it could be a different autoimmune disease? My only autoantibodies are anti-centromere, if that matters.\n\nDoes anybody here have anti-centromere antibodies? Any advice in general? I am a little nervous now that this disease is being introduced to my life. I have it but it is no longer called crest it is called limited scleroderma. It is the \u201cbetter\u201d of the two systemic sclerodermas. The Facebook groups are very active and very helpful. I was not diagnosed until I was 35 because the only skin involvement I have is the horrific raynauds/chilblains I have in only one toe lol. And that is not really skin but vascular. Found a new rheumatologist who was not an idiot and she diagnosed me right away after having the same bloodwork results you have. \n\nDid she start you on any meds? Most of us are on an immunosuppressant and acid reflux meds. My rheumatologist also put me on vitamin d (I was really low as are most scleroderma patients), vitamin c with rose hips, a daily vitamin and co-q10 because we get heart issues as well. And also had me make an appointment with all the specialists where I was having issues.... chest dr, gastro, etc and had me start physical therapy. I have not been prescribed anything yet (but I will be at my appointment next week). Are there any particularly nasty side effects of immunosuppressants? I am super sensitive, so I am worried.\n\nAnd thank you for letting me know about the Facebook group. I will make sure to check it out. There are side effects to lots of meds unfortunately and you have to weigh the pros and cons and most doctors will tell you that the pros of taking the immunosuppressants esp early on in the disease help to greatly slow down the progression of it and cause less damage to your body. There is like a 5% chance that the meds will mess up your vision so they make anyone taking them go to the eye dr before starting them to get an exam and get pictures taken of your eyes and what not so there is a baseline and then once a year you go and get it done again so they can make sure there are no changes to your eyes but it is a rare side effect. A lot of people on the Facebook groups say that it has also helped them with the horrific joint pain we get but I have not noticed a difference with that . I am also on adderall for the fatigue and brain fog we get. It is very helpful. I am on a vasodilator for raynauds as well because you have to be really careful with the restricted blood flow to your toes and fingers. A lot people get bad sores and gangrene and infections where they have to get their fingers or tips amputated. The meds help to keep blood flowing to them. Yeah, it is annoying but manageable. I am a 41M so a lot of my concerns are going to be a bit different from yours, but for what it is worth:\n\nThe acid reflux and Raynaud's are my worst day to day symptoms. \n\nI am on a silly amount of Nexium to keep the reflux under control. I have some knee issues so the reflux has forced me to stop doing everything I did for exercise so I have gotten fat, which makes the acid reflux and the knee issues worse. Woo hoo. So try to pick up something early for that can be done upright or it will cause more problems. Keep in mind, though, that the acid reflux is secondary to Esophageal Dismotility. Basically, the smooth muscles in your throat stop woking. In my case nearly entirely. This often causes swallowing issues - after the consciously controlled bit at the top I am gravity fed. If you do not have a recliner, try to get one. You may need it to sleep in sometimes. Other solutions include wedge pillows to prop up you upper body or putting your entire bed/mattress on an incline. It does not take much to make a big difference on that.\n\nWith Raynaud's you are likely going to have to limit your time outside in cold weather. Snowball fights, skiing and sledding are very likely out. Gloves are good, mittens are better if you do not mind the loss of dexterity. If you ride a motorcycle heated grips or gloves are a must-have. On that note, vibration can also trigger Raynaud's in some cases. I had to get a motorcycle with cruise control so I could take my right hand off the throttle. These things are life-savers. I tried battery operated heaters a few years back but they did not cut the mustard, they might be better now.  Thank you so much for the advice. That should be helpful for diagnosis tho. I have the opposite. I have CREST symptoms and no skin involvement, and positive ana and scl 70, but no centromere, so it is really difficult for me to get treatment. No centromere means no CREST, but no skin involvement means no scleroderma to most rheums so then they are like you have nothing then. Lol. Hey Im 24, I got diagnosed with scleroderma at 21. Do try to read updated information there is alot of older scary information online. You need to be diagnosed by a scleroderma specialist as well as treated by one for th ebest care. If youre in the states you can google scleroderma specialist in your area or check ( There is also the scleroderma education project ran by a researcher in  scleroderma and personally has it themselves. You really want to check to see if you have all the symptoms of systemic. Also dont elt someone diagnosis you  with morphea by biopsy this happens alot. Since the biopsy test gets returned weird so those with systemic get a localized diagnoses. Feel free to PM if you want to talk about it. So some scleroderma symptoms: we of course have the skin thickening and discoloration and tightening, GERD/acid reflex, raynauds, GI issues, swallowing issues, etc. To be dianosied you need symptoms to get diagnosised biopsy can help get the scleroderma umbrella label, there are antibodies you can be tested for but not all of us who have it have those. Also the facebook groups are way more active. As mentioned CREST is an older naming its now labeled Limited Systemic Scleroderma. You  could have somethinf besides sclerderma as mentioned you dont need antibodies or specific ANA readings they just help get closer to a specific diagnosis at times. Keep in mind as much as systemic scleroderma can effect life expectancy that is usually without treatment lots of treatments mnage or put the disease into remission now. So you can still live a very long normal life span just with a few more issues and doctors appointments then the normal person I hope you find a scleroderma specialist who recognizes that you dont need skin symptoms to be diagnosied that version is usually called sine scleroderma. Getting a diagnosis is helpful. Do not rely on drugs though, keep digging to find out what triggers you. Someone once told me to thank my body for being so sensitive because then I will know what is toxic, long before everyone else finds out. Over the years, this has proven true. Just a thought.\n\nI was diagnosed with benign CREST about 20 years ago. Have had esophageal problems for 30 years--ulcers, hiatal hernia, etc -- plus Raynauds. Also IBS. The silver lining to CREST is that doctors take you seriously and run lots of tests. While I occasionally have an esophageal flare up to some new additive in food (vitamins and fortified foods really trigger me), I am healthy, extremely active, and much older than you. It is really frustrating when things go awry and I have to figure out why, but then everything gets back to normal. You will get there, too! \n\nThe low FODMAP diet helped me immensely. I have eosophilic esophagitis, new gastro just told me that is a true allergy, so I am finally going to get tested for food allergies. 20-30 years ago, they only tested for a few things, so I never bothered. You might consider that as well. I am so glad that somebody older than me is doing well! It gives me hope. Thank you for your advice. I have CREST and pretty bad Raynauds, but never let that slow me down. When living in Kansas City, I had a horse. Interestingly, nearly all the women riding horses in my barn had Raynauds. It got down to -10F in KC, but we did not really ride if it was below +25F. Still, it was freaking cold and I often had to run my hands under warm water. Ski gloves, ski coats and ginormous moon boots were the answer. Just overdress and stay active. \n\nI am also a snow skier. I learned to ski moguls because it was so much work that it kept me warm. Fast downhill skiing is a bit chilly, I could do it but it could leave me a bit chilled. Problem with skiing is that once your feet get cold, it is really hard to warm them up ALTHOUGH a double diamond mogul run will warm you up no problem (and kick my ass). Good boots are a must. Old now so not skiing lately but I have got to get back to it! \n\nThe Raynauds gets much better when you go through menopause. It stayed better for me, but some women at the barn said it was only better temporarily for them. \n\nAlso, do not live in Kansas City. I did not even know I had Raynauds until I moved there. I did love the place, though.", "Can anyone help talk me off the ledge? So I just found this disease exists, and I have a dr appointment with the derm scheduled already, but I will not be seen for almost 3 weeks, and I am freaking out.

Still the more info I read the more it seems to fit.. \n\nIf anyone has any advice / alternatives that it could be, anything to give me some hope, but right now I am just really scared.

Any info / thoughts just in general would be much appreciated and thank you so much for reading if you actually made it this far! Thanks for responding to me! It does help at least to know I am not alone. \n\nI could not sleep last night so I called dr back and told them about the other stuff I did not know could be related to my skin issues at all, and when she heard that she told me to come in for lab work today. (When I first brought up the name of the disease she like laughed and said it is not likely you have that, then o listed symptoms and she told me to come in..lol)\n\nSo I did that and bumped up my derm appt for tomorrow. This is not helping me being scared, but I am thankful I do not have to wait 3+ more weeks at least. \n\nIt is a weird space in, to have like so many things add up for the first time, but I keep telling myself to think positively until I know anything for sure. But it is just weird to like have life potentially altered like that but not yet so just in limbo. \n\nAnyway I hope you are doing well \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c feel free to ever dm me if you are going through anything! I had a lot of systemic symptoms but after I got the blood work and c relative protein showing no internal inflammation, it was just a coincidence. Like heartburn all the time, coughing everytime after I ate for an hour. Could really just be a coincidence. Are all of your symptoms listed here?  The skin issues you are describing (ingrown hairs and flaky spots) do not really sound exactly like scleroderma, to be totally honest.  Scleroderma tends to affect the skin on the limbs and face in large, hard sections and not small flaky spots. \n\nHow about severe acid reflux?  Trouble breathing?  Curling fingers?\n\nKeep in mind that somewhere around 10% of ALL females have Raynaud\u2019s so it is super common in the general population.   For reference there are an estimated 100,000 systemic scleroderma patients in the U.S. so that is 0.03%, including men. \n\nFYI, Scleroderma is a very rare disease and thus can only be diagnosed by a knowledgeable rheumatologist (not a dermatologist, and really not most rheumatologists) and there is a symptom-based criteria - meaning it is diagnosed based on specific symptoms. \n\nMany doctors, even rheumatologists and dermatologists have never seen a patient with it. Lots of us travel to other states just to see a doctor. No I did not list everything there (do have acid reflux and my joint pain just flared up again and no I cannot straighten out all of my fingers and bronchitis flare ups all the time), but you are right the skin was not quite the same. \n\nMine was like for sure hardening over but more pike a scab. When it started to turn into white flakes it started shedding out of me like crazy balls of lint and hair looking things. \n\nSo after more digging apparently I have Morgellons! Which is even more rare and some people think it is not real, but I can tell you the weirdest things have been coming out of me since I posted that and I have been having bouts of like anaphylactic responses. But I think that is the closest I can get to figuring it out for now....", "An update from me. ", "22F, could this be scleroderma? Due to ongoing pain in my hands/wrist/fingers my orthopedist decided to get my blood tested for any signs of rheumatic diseases and then referred me to a rheumatologist as the results are indicative of rheumathism. Turn out I have positive ANA test with a titer of 1:800, nucleolar pattern, and a titer of 1:100, fine speckled pattern. Other than that my ENA is negative and everything else is is within the normal range as well (CRP, RF etc.). Through googling, I found out that a nucleolar pattern is most often associated with scleroderma. Does my blood sample suggest a high likelihood for scleroderma or could this be just as well something else? I have read through the list of symptoms for all kinds of collagenosis but cannot really identify with any of them. My chronic and thus far unexplainable health concerns are pain in finger joints, hand, wrist and sometimes forearm, issues with my urinary tract (despite normal urine sample), mucogingival issues (I regularly get very painful gingivitis and mouth sores, the mouth sores however are usually rather small and more annoying than they are painful), very intense intestinal cramps followed by stool urgency (I only have this in phases though), orthostatic intolerance (I constantly get dizzy and my vision goes black upon standing up and I also cannot stand for long periods of time, feet are constantly cold). I also struggle with fatigue, brain fog and concentration issues but I have always placed these issues on my depression, anxiety and adhd.  I know that this is a question best answered by a doctor but I thought maybe you guys could help me out a little, as I have been very anxious ever since I got the news. I will of course be seeing a rheumathologist as soon as possible but unfortunately, rheumathologists in my area have very long waiting lists so until then I will have to sit with my anxiety of not knowing. So first off jsut cuase it is associated does not mean you have it. Scleroderma can be most easily diagnosied by biopsy and thr subtype found by looking at your symptoms. Yes there are scleroderma antibodies ans you can look into them but some have scleroderma without them and most of the time they are best used to predict your progression. Bases on the symptoms you listed you do have some of them symptoms and it may be worth following up with a scleroderma specialist to be safe most doctors are not knowledgeable enough to diagnosis or treat scleroderma. You can find scleroderma doctors at scleroderma.org you can also find scleroderma centers on there as well but this is state focused. Some other symptoms you may of not considered related to scleroderma  include: thickening of the skin, hyperpigmentation,  hypopigmentation, difficulty swallowing,  shortness of breath, raynauds,  GERD/acid reflux, and GI issues. Keep in mind the systemic form of scleroderma can effect you anywhere so your urinary track is very possible even if it is not super common. My advice here is jsut to be safe try to see a scleroderma specialist to diagbisis you can it still can be alot of other things but you will feel better guareteeing an expert ruled it out.\n\n\nAlso if a waiting list is long call to he out ona  list for if anyone cancels or call daily asking for cancelations to get in sooner. Totally an option  you can work with Thanks for the advice!", "Looking for some general help Hi everyone, my wife recently had some bloodwork come back that said she has diffuse systemic sclerosis, and I have to be honest when I say I have no idea what that means, all I know for sure is what I see. I have seen her so dizzy and short of breath that she has had to rest in the middle of a meal, she has almost constant daily aches and pains (our doctor believes that some of her nerves may be inflammed), and today she lost her job because she has missed 7 days since the start of July. I''m just too terrified to read any more on google about what is next to come and am honestly scared that I may lose my wife way too early in life. She is 28 and we have only been married a little over a year. If someone can help me out with some burning questions maybe I could sleep a little better (I try to stay as positive as I can because she needs it right now). I know she will not get better, I know it is a progressive illness and that it is autoimmune, but will treatment help with her pain and fatigue? And I am sorry if it sounds like an overreaction but am I going to lose my wife before we are old? Can we keep all of our same plans like starting a family? There is so much I do not know and articles will only tell me so much. I am a male(47) with diffuse systemic sclerosis and a host of other conditions as a result(Pulmonary fibrosis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Raynaud's, esophageal and stomach dismotility and host of other conditions) I was given 18mo to live in 2007. I did not eat for 8 years (was not supposed to ever be able to eat again) fed via IV for 12hrs/day(TPN).  I am open to conversation about my experience if you would like to do so privately. PM(DM?) me as you see fit. Definitely, I am not sure how to work reddit though as I do not post much, are you able to message me directly? Was her work aware of her medical condition? If so that could be a huge Ada violation. She made work aware of it once she became aware of it herself, they were working with her to adjust her hours worked but she was still missing time. They used that as the reason to let her go. I looked into it and I am reasonably sure that this is a violation of the labour code in my province as well as the human rights charter of Canada. Right now our focus is just on her mental health and managing her symptoms as best we can until she can get a specialist appointment and line up a treatment. After that, if she wants to fight it then I will fight like a caged animal in any way I can. Diffuse systemic male here.  My advice would be to find a specialist and get on a course of treatment.  I will be happy to speak with you or her as well DM me and I will answer any questions that I can. Sorry for formatting issues, on mobile. \n\nI am so sorry you are going through this, 28 is pretty young to be diagnosed. My dad also has dSSc (diffuse systemic scleroderma) and he was diagnosed 9 years ago at 58. I really empathize with the pain and fear you are feeling- I know how terrifying it is to hear that your loved one has a terminal diagnosis. \n\nIf your wife is struggling with being short of breath, please emphasize this to her rheumatologist and ask to consult with a pulmonologist. Lung involvement is something to catch as early as possible. \n\nThe aches, tiredness, and pains are normal. Treatment will help control her symptoms, but it will eventually progress. But the available treatments can give you more time, and more quality time. \n\nWhen you are ready, ( one study on prognosis and survival rates.

Hugs from an internet stranger. Thank you for the hugs and the advice, we are still waiting for specialist appointments now, we are hoping to get them soon. Our hope is that if she can start treatment soon enough then she can avoid the organ damage that comes with the progression. Hi, do not stress. She will be ok. Her immune system is attacking her. She probably needs Methotrexate or Cellcept to weaken it. She will have to see a specialist,  but go to one affiliated with a college. They are more advanced with their knowledge.  A regular Rheumatologist is not good. It is a rare disease. Idk where you are but there is some good ones. I would start with the Scleroderma Foundation website for more info. Or can go to Inspire message board &amp; post/search there. If you have questions,  you can DM. I am in San Diego.  Reduce stress as much as possible.... that is key. Drink water &amp; clean up diet. No sugar or alcohol. 30 min exercise daily. Stay strong. Thanks for the reply, she has an appointment with an internal medicine specialist on the 1st (its was the earliest one we could get) rheumatology is a much longer wait list. Ive got school coming up in September but they have been very supportive and have offered me the ability to reduce my course load or take a leave of absence, I wish that I could say that I have faith in my province's medical system but I really do not, if finances allow it then we may have to move to a place with a better system. She is does not drink so that is not an issue, but is natural sugar something she should cut down on? She does like to eat a lot of fruit. Yes, I would say so, but again, everyone is a little different.  In America,  we have crappy food so it is important to stay away from it. The internal medicine specialist will most likely have no idea about Scleroderma &amp; will tell you to go to a Rheumatologist or Dermatologist.  Her symptoms of fatigue are serious so they may start her on Methotrexate which is common to help both the skin issues &amp; internal inflammation,  but they may wait for a Rheumatologist to do that.  There are some interesting lectures/videos from John's Hopkins Medical Center on YouTube.  Their website is super informative. \n\nI hope she can get some relief.

Any info is greatly appreciated!  Thanks! I ate one to two bananas a day. That and keeping them warm seemed to help Thank you! drink lots of water too!  If the warm does not help and the cramps are bad enough to have you seeking other relief; wrap an icepack or in lieu of that, a bag of frozen peas, or some other flexible bag of veggies around the cramping area ; ice can relieve an intense cramp.

It is only on one thumb, and not a callus, I will sometimes cut off the excess thick skin layer with nail clippers or I will peel it but sometimes it pulls too thick of a layer and becomes tender in certain spots (hard time getting it evened out to one smooth layer). If I peel some of the skin off and then moisturize it and cover it, this might help temporarily but it will heal to the same as before, thick skin that eventually peels, or it resolves itself only to happen again in a few weeks.

You should see a dr bc if this is Scleroderma it progresses very fast if not on meds to slow the progression. Yikes, okay thank you (: I have a dermatology appointment scheduled in April. Do I mention the possibility of scleroderma? This is my first time seeing a dermatologist and I hate being one of those \"web md\" type patients who come in with a list of things they already think it is. I guess my question is, is this a well known/common condition to test for or do I need to ask for a test myself? Scleroderma is not easy to diagnose bc of the many different ways it effects ppl. It took me 4 yrs and 5 different drs to finally hear the word Scleroderma. Then I was sent to a rheumatologist who did bloodwork for ANA. The antibody does not always show up in the bloodwork and it is mainly diagnosed by the symptoms that you have. I do not have the antibody yet I have all the symptoms. Fingers that are swollen, painful and peeling. Little red spots on my face. My fingers are curling and getting harder to use. It progresses so fast if not on medication to suppress the immune system. Being it took so long to get a diagnosis mine had already progressed quite a bit so yes I would throw it out there if your dr seems clueless. Not a lot of drs are familiar with this auto immune disorder and specialists are not in every state. Many travel to another state to find a specialist which I am told if you are diagnosed you need a specialist. I am in VA but will have to travel to Maryland if the medication does not work.

From her symptoms I can tell that she already has pulmonary fibrosis, Raynaud syndrome and esophageal symptoms. Could you guys tell me what treatment did you receive at the beginning and how has the disease affected you life ? I am almost 3 years post stem cell transplant. \nI am alive and symptoms have decreased and stabilized. My heart and pulmonary fibrosis are gone. Yes that is right. Gone. I am 36 M. It plays a lot in the equation. In which country did you have the stem cell transplant? Canada Where in Canada did you do your transplant? Which clinic? Ottawa General Hospital. In their Hematology. By far the best equipped and experienced in Canada for Stem Cells. I live over 4 hrs away and moved for treatment. I was on methotrexate from age 13-14. It was shots twice a week at first and then they transitioned me to pills. \n\nIt did not really do much because the damage was already so severe that it could not be fixed - however, the hope was that it would slow its progression and prevent further damage. I was so young that I am not really sure if it made a difference long-term. \n\nThat said, in my adult years (25 now) I am dealing with significantly more flare ups that are causing joint, ligament, and muscular pain as well as extreme fatigue. I am also way more sensitive to cold now than I was 10 years ago.\n\nSome days I feel great and I can get a lot done, but others I feel like a sack of potato\u2019s that was run over by a truck and set on fire.\n\nGranted, I could have always been this way but did not notice it due to being younger and less in tune with my body.\n\nSometimes I consider going back on methotrexate to see if it would help now, but the side-effects were too much. \n\nMy sense of smell was off, my arms were sore and tender from the shots, I got nauseous often, and did not eat as a result leading to weight loss.\n\nMaybe nowadays they have better treatment options. Thank you so much for sharing this. I am sure it is very helpful to me and others. Hope you are feeling better know and you manage to keep the disease under control. No problem! And thank you. I am managing okay, but I also need to get back to a rheumatologist soon. It is hard finding a good one who also specializes in Scleroderma. For treatments, I have been on mycophenolate mofetil and a low dose of prednisone. The fibrosis in my lungs has cleared up and I feel much better.\n\nI was diagnosed in 2019 after a sudden onset of reynauds and severe myositis/joint pain. Though I believe more subtle symptoms started in 2016.\n\nWith the diagnosis comes treatments, appointments and lifestyle adjustments that I could go on about. Also the mental health changed as I went from a mindset of not having to think of illnesses to managing one everyday.  It made my depression worse but, I have worked to deal with that. What were subtle symptoms that started in 2016, if I may ask. I thought I was horribly out of shape. My muscles and hands ached every time I did any kind of physical work. Always out of breath and always tired no matter how much I slept or how well I ate. This all started faintly and then built. \n\nA few years later, it was bad enough that getting up made me look geriatric. I also experienced a crash in my weight as my body broke down muscle and fat due to bad myositis. My creatine kinase levels were 1:3000 then. My mom complains of feeling tired all the time as well but she also has depression and tiredness is a symptom of that too. She is 50 years old so I do not expect her to feel like she is 25 either. How old were you when you got diagnosed with scleroderma ? I was 32 when diagnosed. Unfortunately I have depression as well so I blamed alot of it on that. Though what was not common with the depression was the blood work. The majority of the diagnosis came on from that coupled with analysis of my symptoms.\n\nI hope your mom is getting the help she needs and will feel better too. Thank you so much for the kind words, it means a lot. Any time! Please reach out if I can be of help. The diagnosis can be scary. While the internet can provide information, alot of it can create unnecessary anxiety, painting a grim picture when this disease manifests on a spectrum, so it seems. Thank you! :) My gf and are not at transplant point yet but we are in Ottawa and this information was really nice to find on reddit.. Just had an appointment at the general yesterday. I am looking for all the support I can to help her with it.", "Tests? Hi. I was diagnosed with GERD a few years ago. Had a normal endoscopy, but by process of elimination, was told I must have GERD. My grandma had scleroderma and struggled with GERD like symptoms. She was diagnosed with arthritis, but this was most likely scleroderma. She lived much longer than the doctors said she would. Made it to her mid 70s. She had the visible stuff - hard skin, shiny skin, swollen hands. \n\nI have joint pain, stiff fingers, and creaky big toes. I have had all this, including the reflux, since childhood and everything has gotten worse over time. I am 28 now and getting worried my GERD may actually be a result of scleroderma. I want to get tested to be sure and see what I can do. Recently, I have developed pain when talking and swallowing at the bottom of my neck between the collar bones. I am not sure if this is the larynx or the trachea. It is quite painful. I do get shortness of breath, so bad that exercise is not really good for me. I thought maybe it was just a result of the reflux. \n\nWhat tests would anyone recommend for getting diagnosed? If the Doctor lays out testing options, I am not sure which way to go, though I do not want to get another endoscopy since it showed nothing last time. Any home remedies to consider? I have not found too much online. Experience is usually far more helpful. My primary doctor ran a \u201cnuclear antibody test w/reflux if positive\u201d just to test if any autoimmune antibodies were present and go from there, that came back with anticenromere antibodies that is related to CREST and I had a positive ANA which can mean you may have an autoimmune disease, sometimes ana is positive in healthy people or due to medications but if it was positive they run it further to see if you have any other antibodies and I got referred to a Rheumatologist after that. I have bad reflux, I choke on almost anything I eat and sometimes drink, and have 5 minute coughing and gagging fits, and mild Raynauds all have developed within the past year for me. And just found out I have RA that has come on strong in the past 2 months after I got the stomach flu. I wish you luck. My doctors thought I was crazy. I switched primary doctors 3 times in a year, 2 neurologists, they sent me to physiologists because they never even tested for anything autoimmune. \ud83d\ude12 Go see a rheumatologist say you want to get tested for scleroderma.", "Watch now: Niantic woman battles rare disease ", "scared that I might have scleroderma age: 16\ngender: M\n\nSo for as long as I can remember my fingers and toes have always gotten easily cold. And sometimes they turn red/white if it is very cold or snowing outside. Now I never thought a whole lot of it but over the past couple years or so I have been experiencing some finger stiffness especially in my right thumb and pointer fingers, mainly at night and in the morning. I did a little bit of research and this is a symptom of many connective tissue diseases. The main one I am worried about is scleroderma. Now it is supposed to mainly affect adult women so this is a little weird for a teen guy to get it, but there is another thing. I found out one of the distinctive features of it are dilated nail capillaries and I put my phone flashlight up to them and I have just that, especially on my pointer fingers. I am really scared especially since from what I have heard the disease can be serious in a lot of people.\n\nI also get heartburn which is apparently one of the main signs of Crest syndrome. Im just now learning about a lot about it and there are ways to put it into remission. But of course,  please go see a Dr.! Obligatory not a doctor, but the stiffness/coldness asscociated with Scleroderma is usually Secondary Reynauds Phenomion. Reynauds can be present on its own without the rest of the common Scleroderma issues such as thickening of the skin and excess collegen production. Reynauds is the most common indicator of Scleroderma, but just having Reynauds doesnt nessisarily mean you have anything more complex.\n\nIf you are curious have your doc test for antinuclear antibodies. This will show if you have Scleroderma or a related auto immune disease like lupus. \n\nBest of luck!

I just searched the sub for \"body wash\" and \"lotion\" and saw no results! I am surprised this has not been asked before. I am still trying to find the right combo.\n\nWhat soap / body wash / shower oil do you use that hydrates your skin and leaves it feeling moisturized?\n\nWhat lotion or oil do you use after the shower? \n\nMaybe put what country you are in. I am sure products will be easier/harder to find based on your location. This is separate from face wash. I am interested in body products. For soap I use Zummbar goats milk soap, the Dragons blood type. So far it works better than anything else. Once while in the hospital they gave me a different type of goats milk soap that was awesome but I havent been able to find it outside the hospital yet. I also use Vaseline intensive care advanced lotion and Aveeno eczema care lotion, which works good but is heavy and greasy feeling. North Eastern Pennsylvania, United States. I have found that showering less helps, and when I do shower I pretty much just soap up the important bits (armpits, crotch). For body wash I like ( and I really like ( for lotion. The lotion is meant mainly for hands, feet, knees, and elbows but I like to use it all over sometimes too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have used body oil similar to ( in the past and it works well but you have to apply it while you are still wet from the shower for best results. I have to dry off immediately or I get cold and the raynauds kicks in, so I do not use oils anymore. I have found that I have developed a ton of sensitivities to... everything. I tried to buy natural cosmetics, but they like to use essential oils and I react to most of those, too. So I have to make my own as much as I can.  \n\n\nBody: I use Irish Spring for the wings and tail. I use a coffee/brown sugar/lard body scrub every 3 days. The lard acts as my moisturizer. I shave my legs (carefully and gently!) with conditioner. If I am having an active flare I cannot shave at all until it lets up. I make a lard/coconut oil/bees wax whipped lotion for when I need moisture on my body between lard treatments. (I like to play with that recipe a bit and sometimes use emu oil or tallow) If it is bad I will just rub lard over the dry areas while I am in the shower and buff it off with a towel when I dry off. Leaves everything silky and I use my homemade lotion after that.  \n\n\nHair: Whatever shampoo/conditioner works. I do not seem to have a problem with that as long as I rinse the conditioner off my body and face after.  \n\n\nFace: A clay/water mask every 3 days. Emu oil as moisturizer 2x a day. I mix emu oil and Polysorbate 20 (food grade) and use that as my face wash twice a day. I do a 90 second face massage when I use that and it really helps to keep my skin smooth and get rid of the dead, dry stuff without irritating.  \n\n\nLips: I make my own lip balm with tallow and bees wax. No additives, essential oils, flavoring, or scents. I do not react to that the way I do store-bought lip balm.  \n\n\nTeeth: Tom's toothpaste. But I am having a hell of a time with my teeth lately so do not listen to anything I have to say there. I just cannot handle any regular toothpaste or mouthwash or it will trigger a flare of my mouth and esophagus.   \n\n\nEmu oil is the safest thing for me. I react to jojoba oil, rosehip oil, oregano oil, and many of the flowery essential oils. Coconut oil does not hurt me, but it does not seem to do any good either. Lard and tallow are actually healing for me.  \n\n\nDiet is essential. I eat a piece of wild salmon almost every day and 150g raw liver 2-3 times a week. Everybody says to avoid the sun, but after doing just that for 15 years, I have found that I do need SOME sun to be healthy. I get 10-15 minutes sun per side as the weather permits.

I have brain fog, neuropathy all over, dry eyes, dry mouth, losing hair, dry skin, unbearable fatigue, headaches, allodynia, irregular heartbeat, hypo and hyper hidrosis (depends on the day). I got tested for ANA back then and was negative. After 3 years I accidentally got diagnosed with Raynauds while I was doing some peripheral circulation test (i dont know the name). I never had color changes or problems do I went to repeat the test to another doctor which also said I have it. I do notice my hands get puffier and red when its hot and skinny when its cold. But not white / blue. Then a month later I started having GERD. It happens 2 or 3 times a month and then it goes away. Since 3 years have passed I went and did the ANA again, and it is negative again. Now, couple of days back i noticed a small pink dot on my palm and I am freaking out about scleroderma.

Raynauds is in 10ish percent of healthy people so while it is good to note I would not consider that I defining symptom yet!", "What is going on here? ", "diet Has anyone noticed if diet can help prevent worsening symptoms of the disease? I read things like giving up citrus and tomatoes. Does this really help? I feel some tightening around my mouth and some joint pain in fingers. Some other random pain here and there. I will do an anti inflammatory diet if it will really help. Giving up alcohol 100% seems hard. Has anyone had positive results with using CBD? Also I wonder if I should go 4 hours away to a specialist at Duke and not just a rheumatologist here in my small area. Could that make a difference? I have GI involvement in my scleroderma so, giving up things like caffeine, carbonated drinks and other foods that are slow to digest has made a big difference.\n\nAbout anti inflammatory diets/supplements,  that is a good question for your doctor.  I am allergic to many anti inflammatory medicines. So foods or supplements with similar compounds have an opposite affect - I feel worse. I do not know if this is related to my scleroderma or not though.\n\nRegarding CBD, I am curious as well what others here think. My doctors will not really respond about it when I have asked but, I have not pushed hard enough on it. So I started typing and realized how long it was, so I sectioned it off by question. Sorry D: I hope this is helpful!\n\nDiet\n\nHonestly, I do not think anyone here can say what will work for you regarding prevention. There is so much individual variation with the disease.\n\nChanging my diet absolutely helped with my symptoms. I do not know if that will prevent skin tightening long term, but it has helped with my joint pain and GI symptoms tremendously already. It has definitely slowed down the process of symptom development.\n\nIf we think about total body health and what is happening with an autoimmune disease, it makes sense to decrease foods that may be linked to inflammation (e.g., tomato, potatoes) and increase intake of foods that lower inflammation (e.g., turmeric) in the body. Eating large quantities of foods that increase inflammation will increase immune system response, thus potentially worsening symptoms. Highly acidic foods like citrus, alcohol, and coffee increase acid reflux, which can lead to scarring and tightening of your esophagus, creating long-term GI problems.\n\nI do not know that you need to cut anything out 100%-- moderation is key. If you have a day where you eat more foods that cause inflammation, then be more mindful for the next few days to avoid those foods and see how your body responds.\n\nMy body is very sensitive to tomatoes and potatoes-- I can see a direct increase in my joint pain and acid reflux when I eat them, so I avoid them completely. I do not have as strong of a response to other foods, so I can eat those more often.\n\nLike I said, there are individual bodily responses that no one can fully account for in telling you what is best for your body. That is why the autoimmune protocol diet starts with total elimination of those foods and then systematically adding them in one at a time to see what may be linked to your body's response. If you introduce a food for a few days and notice yourself starting to feel worse in the following days, you probably want to avoid that food.\n\n\\-----------------------------------\n\nSpecialist\n\nI would recommend at least doing a one-time consult with the specialist. They can review your test results, check on your skin thickening progression with more accuracy, review your lifestyle habits and make recommendations for changes, and review your medication protocol for adjustments.\n\nI have a specialist 2 hours away, and he knew so much more about the diagnosis, what to look for, and how to handle it than my local rheumatologist. I am registered as his patient now, but I only see him 1x per year and see my local rheumatologist quarterly for my ongoing testing and care. I am pretty early in my experience with the disease, so this may change, but this has worked really well so far because my local doc coordinates with the specialist so I know everyone is communicating and I am getting the best care with input from an expert.\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nCBD\n\nI have not done much with CBD, but I have been trying it. I do not see much of a difference yet-- not sure if I will. I will say that I like to take hot baths when my joint pain is awful to help, and I use bath bombs for that. I tried this one high concentration CBD bath bomb, and my pain literally melted away-- much faster and more completely than non-CBD or lower-CBD options. I do not know if that was a placebo effect, but I do continue to get the same bath bomb for days when the pain is severe (not as often as it used to be, fortunately). Wow thank you for such a comprehensive share. This is the first time I have seen citrus mentioned alongside nightshades. Tough one for me but I am on some good stomach protecting meds still. Best of luck with your symptoms! Thanks! Side note: I do not believe citrus is listed as linked to inflammation-- just that it is highly acidic to it increases acid reflux. I think the biggest offender is grapefruit. I can eat oranges ok, but limes and lemons give me reflux D: YMMV Yah i had to cut out grapefruits 15 years ago well before I had any recognizable symptoms. I ate them everyday though. Thanks! This disease is difficult. I certainly would reach out to a office or university dr familiar with scleroderma. That is most important. I have not had ANY luck with CBD at all, personally.\n\nI actually go to Duke and it is also about a 4 hour drive for me... In fact, I am here now for some tests.\n\nI cannot recommend it enough and I feel ***it is worth every minute spent driving.***\n\nThe number of specialists they have that can consult with you on any complications you have and their interconnectedness to all work with each other is fantastic. Additionally, the cutting edge knowledge and the resources they have at their disposal is amazing. Also, most every single doctor, tech, nurse, student, and receptionist I have interacted with has done everything in their power to make me as comfortable as possible and gone out of their way to get me information, ice packs, insurance claims/approvals - whatever I needed. It has been so easy and comforting to be a patient here\n\nAnd when you are nervous about procedures or test results or whatever, that environment really makes a difference.\n\nThe only negatives I can think of is one of the phlebotomists that took my blood once seemed really grumpy when I said I can pass out with needles and got a bit angry with me when I almost passed out. Also, some of the younger doctors do not know how to build that instant rapport with patients as well as the older doctors. But that is me really  nit-picking HARD.\n\nIf your insurance covers Duke and you have the time to go, I would go. But that is my two cents... I have not eliminated much from my diet except for alcohol, and I have cut down on my coffee consumption. Truly I have not noticed a difference of my symptoms from that... but I will say I want to try the AIP diet once I gain more weight. I am currently being treated for malnourishment and am waiting until I get to a healthier point to begin an elimination process. \n\nCBD lotion greatly helps with my neck and back pain. I may have to reapply, but I do notice a difference! Thank you so much. How do I find a doctor there? Do I need a referral? Do you choose or just go to a department? I have Blue Cross of NC. It is a crappy plan but...\n\nI am so scared I know I need to get a handle on my anxiety about it. I have hardly ever gone to the doctor so this world is a little new. I am just getting some thickening on my fingers and face. Itchiness at night around my mouth. If I act fast now my hope is that it will not get worse. How do you keep from freaking out? The AIP diet all the way helps! And then supplements to make up for the foods you cannot eat. Also buy digestive enzymes (they are on Amazon) they will help a ton in GI issues. I will see you do not have to give up alcohol 100% just give your body time to recover with an AIP clean diet. Then re-introduce clear liquor or non gluten drinks. Also cut back on coffee for a little bit but these things can all be re-introduced once you feel a little better Also do give up nightshades and tomatoes too I am so so so sorry it took me this long to get back to you... I have been having a lot of stuff come up with my illness that is really interfered with... well, me. Long post ahead too, so very sorry.\n\nI am unsure about needing a referral. I got one from my rheumatologist when I moved. But I have been able to get in with most any doctor at Duke because they are all in network for me.. Also, here is a list of the ( It shows Blue Cross on there, but I am do not know if the subcategories apply to you, so I will let you take a look at that. Also, there is a number to call on their ( so you can give that a try. I would also look through their physicians because it is neat to see what they specialize in. Dr. Shah is the headliner scleroderma guy but I think it is kind of hard to get him as a provider, but they all talk together about patients all the time (in a good way) for advice and differentials so it is almost like you have access to all of them at the same time.\n\nThis world is new for me too... There were many years where I could not afford to go to the doctor, so I would do my best to muscle through being sick all on my own. I find it especially difficult to come to grips with my desire to be \"unproblematic\" and my need to ask my doctors for help and advice on symptoms and what is \"normal\"... It is hard and I hate it.\n\nAs for freaking out... I do not keep from freaking out... I am lucky enough to have a primary care that was more than happy to prescribe anti-anxiety meds for me and then added on a Xanax prescription to help me sleep. I also have a therapist that specializes in chronic illness which is a godsend. Other than that, it is just taken time to settle into this new normal, to figure out what my new \"baseline\" is. In my personal experience, I have found there is no getting ahead of this disease to really stop it... It can be slowed down, and as depressing as that sounds, I think it is a disservice to not also say ***please equally take into account how fast doctors say yours is progressing*** and what is being affected. For me, it has been more of a \"hold on tight, here we go\" kind of process. From reading what others have had to say about their disease, I can only assume mine has hit me way harder and faster than most... For example, my rheumatologist was working on referrals to ***hand surgeons*** to, as he put it, \"save my fingers\" after my very first visit due to the severity and quantity of my digital ulcers. I was even told on another support group that being scared and depressed was probably due to \"all the googling I did to get me so low\" and that I was overreacting to my doctors wanting me to do a heart cath to rule out pulmonary hypertension because \"most people have an easier time with the disease if there is overlap\"... And blah, blah, blah.\n\nIt all hits us differently, so please take that into account with your level of anxiety and save yourself some heartache if you can. But if you need to freak out, do it. Honor those feelings so that they will have an easier time leaving you alone in the future. It is way too hard to pretend everything is fine if you do not feel that way... So let it out the best way you can (save for hurting others and yourself) and allow yourself to feel what you are feeling.\n\nAlso, I am so sorry to say this, but while having a support system and relating with other experiences is nice, it is going to be your own experiences that will eventually mellow you out about it. Carrying heavy things makes you stronger for the next time you need to pick them up...\n\nIn my hindsight, the best advice I can give is try to trust that your doctors are paying attention to you and your labs. They are not going to drop you as a patient if you \"get better\" on your meds. Also, do not feel bad making a list of questions to ask them and any weird symptoms. \n\nFeel free to drop me a PM anytime you need a venting buddy. If you decide to go, maybe we will be at Duke at the same time some day and could grab lunch. I will be hoping for the best for you. thank you! Very encouraging Wow, Thank you for such a heart felt reply. My husband has been telling me I should go to a therapist. I know it is a good idea. I just feel like it is just one more thing to spend money on. I will probably do it. I do not love my rheumatologist. Hopefully  I will get off my ass and work it out to go to Duke. \n\nI am so sorry it is hitting you hard. It sounds like you are doing all the right things and that you are a strong person.\n\nDo you ever think...what the fuck turned this thing on? It is auto immune and I feel like it can be switched off too. But western medicine does not really explore that. I do not know where to find the answer for the off switch but I feel like it is out there. I am not even sure what kind of healer to go to. Anyway these are thoughts going through my head.\n\nSending you so much love and wishing you all the best in days to come. Yeah, a therapist has helped me process the grief and panic I have had with all this, for sure. I hate that you do not like your rheumatologist. The first one I had was good, but I moved away. The second one I got in with in my area treated me like a lab rat from day one. The things she would say would leave me crying and trying to calm down in the parking lot afterwards. That is when I decided to go to Duke.\n\nYes... I wonder what turned it on all the time and I probably annoy the shit out of my doctors for it too. At first I thought it was stress, then damage to vasovagal nerve, then payback for all the damaging things I had intentionally done to my body, potential cancer... \n\nI would suggest trying reiki massage. To put it kindly, I am a cynical person and reiki is one of the things that has had an effect on me that I cannot \"explain\" away. The two sessions I have had kind of freaked me out in what the practitioner and I both felt and I am a little scared to go back, honestly.\n\nBut yes, hoping for the best for you as well! CBD helps me to deal with Sjogren and pain. Citrus and tomatoes definitely worsen my problems, though highly recommend in the internet I have Systemic Scleroderma. The best diet is a stable one. Avoid restaurants. Home cooked meals that are simple. Eat regularly and small meals. Eat 4 to 5 meals a day if that is what is needed to keep the portions small. Do not eat 4 hours before sleeping to avoid GURD. Avoid vegan advice or any other special dietary changes that are extreme. Those can cause a lot of stress on the body even when healthy. lmao \"vegan\" can cause lots of stress. so the body requires meat, dairy and eggs to aviod stress? lol   so if someones eating oatmeal, berries, sweet potato, salad, legumes i guess that is just all too stressful unless you add some MEAT!!! Your missing the point. And honestly this is not the place to ridicule people and troll. Scleroderma is a serious illness and at it is worst doing extreme changes can cause a lot more damage than good. A lot of people give 'advice' on major changes you should do when you get diagnosed. The best thing is to avoid drastic change, because yes it can cause stress to the body, vegan , keto, whatever. The best is to just stick to a simplified version of your regular diet and make small changes and take note if they have a positive effect or not, imo.  I would also suggest to seek the professional opinion of a licensed DIETITIAN for diet information as regards to Scleroderma, not a nutritionist or self proclaimed nutrition 'expert' of any kind.\n\nSome veg and fruit will cause you to choke on the peel and fibers if your have GURD and digestive tract involvment. I have to be careful of some of my favorite food because of it. A blueberry can make me throw up on the stop if I am not careful. Some grilled meats are included in this.\n\nSome food can absolutely make Scleroderma worse! Food known to improve your immune system, like ginger, certain mushrooms, can worsen your symptoms even severally and work against your medication.\n\nThere is not place to ridicule people who post here. Even if you think they are wrong or foolish. I have seen people ask if a hang nail was Scleroderma, never did I think to ridicule them.\n\nI am sure there are subreddits for people who would like to talk about the vegan diet. I believe that is  where you should post in the future.", "Two Decades with Scleroderma. How I find answers to hard to solve questions. ", "Diagnosed with Morphea at 14 Hi all! I am a 24yo female and I have been dealing with morphea for ten years now. I have lesions all over my body (legs, arms, back, neck, face) including one on my chin that causes a deep depression in my skin. I use clobetasol topically and I take methotrexate weekly. I started getting this rash that would only attack my knees and elbows and I had a biopsy done and it turns out that it is also morphea - just manifesting in a different way. My doctor now wants to start me on plaquenil and I have to do more additional labs and I have to get my eyes checked before I can start that. Has anyone been in remission and still on methotrexate, then all of a sudden it just stopped working for them? Also anyone have a good experience with plaquenil? I am just at a loss of how to feel. I am so over dealing with this. And I do not know anyone else who has ever dealt with this and I have always felt pretty alone in this. Any support would be appreciated \ud83e\udd7a Thank you for reading! Hi there. I was diagnosed when I was 12 (F), I am now 38.  I began methotrexate about 6 weeks ago so I have not really seen any improvement yet. I am not here to offer any advice really, just to say that you are not alone and I, for one, can relate to what you are going through My morphea's been in remission without medication for a while now, but I recently got a rash on my elbows, knees, and ankles. You have me wondering if I need to see the dermatologist now. I was diagnosed at age 10 with linear scleroderma and morphea. My chin is also two different levels and my lips. I am almost 68. It is the oddest disease. I have had ulcers on and off on my leg and foot from this disease. Take care-hang in there. That is where mine is :( it is reoccurring. It will come and go fairly often. It is on the outside of my ankle, and my knees. Sometime my elbows as well. For me, plaquenil has been the game changing wonder-drug. Eight years on it and I have not had a single full-on flare up in that time. \n\nGood luck! Diagnosed at 7 (F) with linear, localized scleroderma and morphea. I am 27 now. I have been on Methotrexate on and off since then, with the belief that I was possibly in remission, but that always proved wrong. I have never been on methotrexate and had my symptoms simultaneously get worse. So, like the other comments here, just throwing in my support for you! It sounds like your doc is taking a pretty proactive approach so thumbs up to that. Did it help get rid of the existing morphea?", "Scl/pm 75 and RP11 antibodies positive w negative ANA This came up when I requested an immunologist to run an immune panel . I have been feeling unwell for several years because of worsening sinusitis. Recently my fingers have been very intolerant to cold and whitish plus weird marks have appeared on my hands and face (plus skin tightening on my face like a mask). All this scared me and now I see that it might be scleroderma:/.\n\nI am stressed and scared, will see a rheumatologist in two weeks.\n\nI started a healthy vegan diet a week ago, but the symptoms still seem to progress.\n\nDoes anyone know what kind of scleroderma I might have? Systemic or limited? My lung X-ray was clear but sometimes I feel a bit of pain in my left lung.\nIm 50 btw and female. Do you have any skin symptoms? If so where? There are 2 kinds of systemic: limited and diffuse. Both can affect organs. I am not familiar with those antibodies. Scleroderma is associated with SCL70, anticentromere (aca), and RNA polymerase III primarily. Thanks for responding. Yes, there are weird red bumps on my face and the skin has changed on my cheeks and eyelids. It is like a bit yellowish and tight. My eye shape has changed too (they are smaller) and the whole face feels tight. \nThere are similar reddish-lilac bumps on my fingers and the skin on hands and arms feels v dry. So, obligatory I am not a doctor: some of those symptoms do not match, some may. The antibodies you put may be associated with a different autoimmune disorder instead of scleroderma because those are not associated with it. Hard to say. I would recommend getting a second test done because there are high false positive rates on the antibody test. If you have similar results, then your rheumatologist can work off that.\n\nWhat was your diet before vegan? And why did you switch to vegan? Doing a rapid dietary shift can put more stress on the body, which can increase symptoms. Thanks, definitely the rheumatologist will need to run new tests. I have debilitating sinusitis for 4th year now, the whole head full of mucus with balance problem, plus now a neck problem too. I have polyps and cysts in my sinuses, dairy and gluten  is not good, so I decided to try being vegan for a while. \nI would love not to have scleroderma :). I had the face changes and the rash also before the diet unfortunately. You might want to get a food sensitivity test to see if there are other foods to avoid. I had some weird ones that came up that were still pretty common in my vegan diet shift, so I cut those out too. Honestly, changing my diet was the best thing I ever did for my scleroderma. My GI symptoms and joint pain has decreased significantly after a few weeks.\n\nThere is also an autoimmune protocol that recommends cutting out nightshade vegetables, as they are known to cause increase inflammation in the body. Also, start taking daily turmeric if you do not already. Thanks a lot, will cut out nightshades and do the food sensitivities test. Wow it is great that you feel better after cutting out your problematic foods. I suspect that I might be intolerant to something I eat daily. Thank you all so much for the replies, I think that I might have dermatomyositis. \n\nThe lilac things on my knuckles are very similar, and I might have some mild lung involvement. I hope it is not scleroderma. Started with xi xi hu breathing exercise yesterday (two rapid inhalations by nose followed by a deeper exhalation by mouth) to oxygenate my blood and boost my lungs and I am feeling slightly better.

While in the process of going through MRIs and what not for what was suspected to be MS (ended up being ruled out because only 1 lesion was found between 4 MRIs), my primary doctor ordered a ton of blood work to rule out other conditions. Besides some electrolyte imbalances, the only thing that came back flagged so far is Anti-SCL-70. I had to look it up online because I was not familiar with this. I had never heard of scleroderma prior to this. After doing a ton of reading, I am learning that the ELISA testing method often has false positives. Also, it only showed that it is positive without a value. ANA was negative. The only symptom that I have had before is GERD over 10 years ago and then heartburn during two pregnancies and what I am currently experiencing and suspect is silent reflux?

Any insight would be so appreciated. first I am just so sorry that you are dealing with trying to get a diagnosis while you have a toddler, that must be so overwhelming. the only advice I have is to try to get your PCP to refer you for a lung function test. this would be a typical frontline thing that the scleroderma rheum would probably refer you for anyway but this that way they will already have the information out of the gate. hopefully it will also put your mind at ease because you will get an objective measure of where your lungs are at rather than anyone\u2019s interpretation of a scan. my only other advice is that scleroderma (if you do have it) encompasses a very wide spectrum of severity, if you have it that does not inherently mean your life is at risk. you are doing the right thing by being your own advocate and pushing to get to specialists, in the waiting periods between just try to take care of yourself mentally. if it is not necessary to think about it then focus on being in the moment because there is no point worrying about something you might not even have. i hope you get answers soon! x Thank you so much for your response and encouragement- it means a lot.

Thanks in advance Scleroderma is diagnosed by symptoms. Blood tests do not diagnose scleroderma. CREST is also an old naming you should find a scleroderma specialist on ( Sadly unless they specialize in the disease they do not know enough to be diagnosing or treating. Since scleroderma is based on symptom diagnosis. They look at your symptoms to see the type of scleroderma. So scleroderma breaks down into two branches localized scleroderma affecting the skin and underlying tissues and systemic scleroderma which affects the organs as well. With systemic scleroderma, there are branches off for sine scleroderma (only internal), limited scleroderma (Use to be CREST), and diffuse systemic scleroderma. The localized branch breaks into morphea and linear scleroderma. Morphea can break down even more into subtypes. ANA is not a definite way to diagnose you get diagnosed based on symptoms. The antibody tests can give an idea of potential progression only but it does not mean you even have it if you have the antibodies. Plus you are missing antibodies for scleroderma again since your doctor is not a specialist they do not know all the ones to look for. Another test to be done to get you under the scleroderma umbrella is a biopsy of affected skin however these tests are old so they may say positive for morphea or positive for excess collagen if it is positive this just means any form of scleroderma it does not mean you have morphea it is just how they use to label the skin. You can also look for abnormally nailbed capillaries. So my advice with you being young like myself is to get yourself to a specialist for diagnosis and treatment. Rituximab infusion is a normal treatment but it is more on the extreme end and not usually ever the starting point of treatment especially based on the symptoms you listed. Feel free to ask me questions or even DM it sucks this is such a rare disease with a lot of information lacking id recommend looking at ( where you can also find a doctor close to you and the scleroderma education project. The scleroderma foundation also has a youtube channel. Good Luck! Thank you so much for your experience on this subject, ive been looking for information of systemic sclerosis since my rheumatologist popped up systemic sclerosis for me\u2026 he saw me and he told me he would start off aggressively on my treatments to try stop all the symptoms, maybe that is why he recommended Rituximab as first option, along with prednisone. Now im actually waiting for my 2nd infusion. And will re do some blood tests again to see how im doing, he will see me again in approximately 10 days from now. Ill keep this post updated. Also adding to these, waiting for that ANA HEP 2 result, i came out as a systemic sclerosis with some kind of miopathy. Yeah systemic sclerosis ans systemic scleroderma are the same thing just different naming again.as long ad the treatments are working for you and your happy with them jsut know you should be being seen by a scleroderma specialist for the best treatment. Blood tests are a good way to make sure the meds are not hurting you and inflammation markers are going down. I get them every 8 weeks. May i ask? I suppose you have systemic sclerosis too? How long has it been and how have you managed to keep everything together in place, its just hard. It sucks to think id not be able to do certain stuff like go to the gym to get back in shape, instead id have to go for the \u201ctry not to lose muscle,along with fisioteraphy\u201d way I do not have the systemic form but the doctors thought I did in the start I have a severely aggressive form of morphea. Effects my whole right leg. I could not even dress myself at 22 from fully functional to not in a matter of 4 mths. It took 8 mths to get mine under control and in an inactive/remission stage. Currently coming off the meds after 3 years of methotrexate.\n\n\nI would recommend joining the Facebook scleroderma groups they are way more active and has a good handful of knowledge Healthcare workers and researchers in the group. \n\n\nMedicine has come a long way and now most people manage their systemic scleroderma very well with medication. As long as you keep on it you can limit or even stop the progression. More extreme cases do stem cell transplant but that is the last line. The infusions are also up there towards extreme solutions. Most usually start on an immunosuppresents like methotrexate or cellcept. Also with certain versions if systemic scleroderma like polymerase III presidone is extremely dangerous to your kidneys and can kill you. Which is why treatment from a scleroderma specialist is important. Since those antibodies can change the treatment. \n\n\nAlso going to the gym and exercising is very important I would recommend keeping thaybuo if you join the Facebook group you will see alot of very fit men and women. Thankyou very much for the info, i will join! Hey Buddy 36M here. Been diagnosed for about 5 years. \n\nThis is your journey. You cannot compare with me or others. The intensity and development will be completly different. \n\nThat being said, avoid stress, give yourself time to evaluate your condition. \n\nMy personal final evaluation was that I could not handle the changes because they were to great and had to abandon everything.\n\nI hope you will not face the same, but I urge you to take your time, and also have your parents and friends on board for support.

Hello. I am Russian. I have schizophrenia, I studied English with a tutor in high school and I have always wanted to work from home only.  \nWhen I turned 17, I was diagnosed with limited scleroderma in the town where I live.\n\nI was referred to a regional public pediatric hospital to be screened for systemic scleroderma. One of the doctors, a lady about 45 to 50 years old examined the capillaries of my hands with a medical device. After examining my hands, she told me I had systemic scleroderma and that using electronics was dangerous and could lead to aggravation of the disease. I was surprised, and the following dialog happened:  \n\u2014 But may I use an electronic book reader? The page switching buttons of my e-book reader are very easy to press  \n\u2014 You may not.  \n\u2014 And may I read paper books?  \n\u2014 You may.  \n\u2014  But why I may not read e-books, if I need to apply physical effort to switch pages, both in case of paper books and e-books?  \n\u2014 Because (in an annoyed voice)  \n\u2014 I have a mental disorder, I am planning to get higher education. How will I be able to work, if they will not hire me in an office because of my mental disorder, and work from home requires using electronics?  \n\u2014 I do not know.  \nSeveral days later, I was assessed in a well-known Moscow public pediatric hospital. The doctors there were better than in the regional hospital, they said they were absolutely sure I had limited scleroderma and not systemic scleroderma.  \nAfter the medical assessment in Moscow, I had an appointment with a private doctor who was recommended by a family member. To this day, he manages the supportive therapy of my limited scleroderma, and, so far, it has not worsened and no signs of systemic scleroderma have ever appeared since.  \nI graduated from university several years ago and have been working from home as a translator.  \n\n\nNow, the question: is using electronics with keyboards and/or buttons (even with keys/buttons which are easy to press) really dangerous in case of systemic scleroderma? Or perhaps the doctor was toxic and unprofessional, and made this up because she hated young people, the Internet, and electronics? Systemic would indicate involvement of something other than your skin. The capillary check\u2026 not sure if that qualifies. \nThey would need to check your organs etc for that diagnosis. \n\n\nAdditionally, electronic devices do not make anything worse. The only thing close to that would be if you have finger ulcers, typing or otherwise using your fingertips can hurt. \n\nIn summary, that doctor sucked. I have systemic sclerosis and I use a keyboard daily. The Doctor  specifically noted I have loop dilations and broken capillaries in my nail bed. I do have stiffness and pain in my hands but I manage through it as I have no choice but to work. I do try to exercise my hands often to keep them active. You should be fine using electronics. Good Luck. I think the concern about electronic things specifically was superstition, however repetitive strain injuries are something to be aware of and are common in people who do most of their work at a desk. I do not think scleroderma directly causes repetitive strain injuries, but tightness in hands, muscles, and connective tissues can definitely make them worse. \n\nBe aware of the ergonomics of desk work and keep in mind your posture and you should be fine.", "CDC Recommends Those With Weakened Immune Systems Continue COVID-19 Precautions  \ud83d\ude22\ni know this breaks reddit protocol but i truly have no words.

Does anyone else do this light treatment? I am trying to get in with Mayo but was told I have to have a diagnosis in order to get referred there. My bloodwork shows the scleroderma antibodies and positive ANA. Went to rheumatologist and he put me on high dose of vitamin D to see if anything changes and have a follow up in a couple weeks. What was your experience with getting in with Mayo? And they did the diagnosing? It all started when my medical doctor noticed how tight my skin was. It was really bugging him because he could not figure it out.. he had sent me to Mayo because of issues with my stomach and I am also a Type 1 Diabetic and was having trouble with high blood sugar. So initially he referred me for my diabetes then the doctor I saw for that referred me to a stomach specialist at Mayo. Then the same Mayo doctor I saw for diabetes referred me to a Dermatologist at Mayo and she is the one who diagnosed me with Scleroderma and sent me to have the Derm light treatments which I have been doing for 6 months. My Dermatologist is now trying to get me a home unit so I do not have to constantly run to appointments.  Have you used the Derm light treatment?

She was found to have a resting heart rate of ~130 and an arrhythmia. They gave her drugs but nothing kept her heart rate down, until about 2 days later she just...got better. They did tons of tests, until eventually she got discharged. She saw a cardiologist, and that person basically said that she was fine.\n\nA couple of months ago it happened again, high heart rate, hospital trip, two days in, no medications worked, eventually it just resolved itself. So they have been testing and testing trying to figure out what the issue is. They checked for sleep apnea, etc. etc.\n\nWell the autoimmune test came back speckled with CREST, and the closest rheumatologist appointments we can get seem to be well into the future.\n\nHow worried should I be right now?

He had just gotten to checking his messages. He informed me I needed to get some extra labs done as soon as possible in the morning and have the results sent to the on-call rheumatology nurse that would page him the results. He said he would keep his pager with him all day tomorrow. He also said to text him personally if I cannot get ahold of anyone. \n\nTo me, having also worked in the healthcare field, I knew that giving out your personal number is only something reserved for patients you trust and have known a very long time, or because serious sh*t is going down.

And I read dialysis can take anywhere for 3-24 months. Even then, if your kidneys do not get back normal function, you will probably need a transplant.

But since the diagnosis I have been thinking about death obsessively (not healthy I know watch said video for more information). But I have also been wondering. How has this diagnosis effected the way you think about your own mortality?", "needing some support Hi there, \n\nThis is my very first post so please excuse any mishaps I might have lol. I am not sure if I am in the right place, but any type of support or personal stories could very much help me right now, if anyone would be comfortable sharing. I am a 22f who is going through this extremely scary phase of having no idea what is wrong with my body. About a month and a half ago, I went through a very stressful, life changing event and out of nowhere, both my wrists and fingers started to feel very achy and stiff. The pain was mirrored in both hands and wrists. It was hard to brush out my hair or open a bottle. My hands started having a burning sensation as well and I had a knuckle become swollen one time. Basically, signs of inflammation. The symptoms eased as my stress levels went down. My ankle and knee eventually started hurting on and off as well. I will say, I do have a very high level of stress right now which I am sure is effecting all of this. My hands are the major thing being effected. My guess is I had an underlying condition and my stress finally brought it out. I tested positive twice for ANA and centromere b. Negative for SCL-70. My internist said all my other lab work looked great. My levels for inflammation were normal and my rheumatoid factors came back normal at a 5, anything past a 6 is abnormal. I was put on prednisone (way before the lab work so the results were not effected by the medicine) which did not really help, but I am now on meloxicam which has helped a lot. My interenest had suggested CREST after looking at my previous blood work and examining my hands, which were very cold at the time. He said that could be a symptom of crest. I think my hands only get cold when I feel stress or anxiety, I do not get any discoloration and it does not happen often. I was very nervous for my appointment, so lots of stress there. I live in Texas so it is hard to remember how I feel during cold weather lol but I cannot remember having any issues because I am sure I would have noticed. I do not believe I have symptoms that do fall under crest, no stomach issues or skin issues. I am not sure about any of this, I have an appointment with a rheumatologist in two weeks. I am just wondering if it could be something else, despite having the centromere antibody. \n\nI guess my questions are, has anyone experienced a lot of joint pain with this disorder? And has anyone been diagnosed solely off of blood work? I know a physical examination will be done and a lot of questions will be asked by the doctor, but I feel absolutely terrified of the outcome in the end. Google is the absolute worst lol and I fell into a cycle of constantly looking up symptoms and outcomes. Google will say \u201cyou can have a long healthy life\u201d or it will say the complete opposite. I have seen a lot of posts of people saying similar things about being scared and then people have reassured them that this disease can be managed. I am in therapy and working through the anxiety, but I am looking for any advice during this scary time of trying to figure out what is happening to my body. I feel like connecting with people could help me right now and I really hope it could help them as well :) Thank you so much if you read to the end, I tried to sum all this up the best I can. Sending lots of love to everyone on this sub \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95 I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years. I started with hands swelling like baseball gloves. The rest came in all different ways after that. I know is easier said then done but wait until the Rheumatologist visit. To know what too do next. I started a podcast called Mogils Mobcast to help people dealing with this disease. Episode 1 is my journey. Episodes 5 and 6 are other peoples journey. Check it out. Let me know if you have any other questions. tl:dr there is going to be some drama and chaos, but there are great times at the end of an AI journey.\n\nI (31f) was diagnosed with CREST solely off my blood work and a lifetime of Raynauds. It is important to note that Raynauds triggered by strong emotion or stress is perfectly valid Raynauds. I live in Canada so the cold reaction was much more obvious for me.\n\nI have likely had mild scleroderma symptoms my whole life, but it got very severe Summer of 2019 and I was formally diagnosed November of 2019. It was finally identified and taken seriously because my arthritis symptoms got bad enough they could not be ignored. I could not stand on busses, and climbing stairs was extremely difficult. I only had mild pain, but my knees were hotter than hand warmers and all my joints were extremely unstable.\n\nMy symptoms had been very slowly getting worse since I was 22, but it was manageable. I am pretty sure my symptoms escalated in the summer of 2019 because I started going to the gym regularly in the spring of 2019. I was very very sedentary before that and I think the shock to my system triggered something.\n\nI was put on Plaquanil and Prednisone at my first appointment in July 2019. While I was not technically diagnosed at this point my Rheumatologist was pretty damn certain. The Plaquanil took FOREVER (6months) to kick in and my Prednisone prescription only covered 2 months. While I was on prednisone I felt like a million bucks because prednisone mucks with your emotions like crazy, and it turned off my rampant chronic inflammation. As soon as I was off prednisone I felt like shit again, partly that is what prednisone does and partly because my illness was not so easily tamed. Other people I know had their inflammation go into remission with just prednisone. I was very jelly. :)\n\nThe next thing I was put on around April 2020 was celebrex. Plaquanil is a DMARD and celebrex is an NSAID. These are the classes of drugs usually used to treat AI conditions know them well. I felt better, but still just barely functional.\n\nAround October/November 2020 I was moved to Methotrexate+Plaquanil. I am not going to lie that appointment scared the shit out of me. Methotrexate is a chemo drug, and it is used in micro doses for AI conditions. It kind of scared me straight though. I started tracking my diet and symptoms, I signed up and paid to see my blood test results, and I started being proactive in my own health. I also felt great! Methotrexate, while scary, was not actually that bad and it worked really well.\n\nMethotrexate still was not getting my inflamation all the way back to normal, so I got moved up to the next level of \"Oh No\" In Feb 2021. My prescription was moved to Methotrexate+Leflunomide, and let me tell you that was rough. M+L hits your liver so hard you have to cut your alcohol consuption basically to zero. I had to have monthly blood tests to make sure it was not nuking my liver just cause. Most people were telling me I could have one drink a month, AT MOST. So my birthday rolls around and I have ONE DRINK, I had been completely dry up to that point. On my next blood test my liver damage results had skyrocketed from comfortably normal to 4.5x normal. But here is the thing, just before I got those blood test results I was feeling the best I had in ages.\n\nSo I had to emergency stop Leflunomide, and that sucked absolute butts. The worst part was I still had a month and a half till my next appointment and I was not told what to take in the interim. \n\nI 'survived' till my next appointment and I successfully made the pitch to my Rheumatologist that I caused that spike by accident, and I should try Leflunomide again. She agreed, but put me on a half dose for twice as long as the first time around. Now here I am feeling great, for the most part, on a much lower dose of the mega scary meds and generally feeling amazing. I still do not know if my inflammation is in the normal range yet, but I am hopeful.\n\nRight now I am in the middle of a genuine freak out because some symptoms I have had my WHOLE DAMN LIFE just disappeared, and I cannot even comprehend it. Recently diagnosed with diffuse scleroderma, but have been suffering for quite a while. \nMine started out totally with joint pain and swelling. I was diagnosed with RA even though my labs were inconclusive. Took many more months for the skin issues to truly manifest.\nI had to see several doctors\u2014multiple dermatologists and rheumatologists\u2014to get a true diagnosis of sclero. \nIf you have raynaud\u2019s and finger swelling plus joint pain that could definitely be indicative of sclero, especially if your anti centromere was positive.\nBest of luck and do not give up until you get a definitive diagnosis! 21f, diagnosed with scleroderma when I was 11. I really feel for you, it is a very difficult time. Stress is a huge trigger for me, personally, and my chronic pain is the worst during times of stress. If what you have is really CREST, the beginning of treatment is a lot of variables, from my experience. I was treated for most of my childhood with different medications, infusions, etc but I finally reached a point of stability when I was 16. Ever since then, I still have chronic pain but I can function as normal. Overall, the disease does take a toll, but it is definitely manageable. I think the beginning is a very crazy time. I think I had like 6 diagnoses before doctors realized it was scleroderma haha but stability will come your way. If you need any help or are overwhelmed with anything, I can help you navigate your journey the best I can. Please stay safe and healthy, everything will be okay :) Thank you for your reply, I will definitely try to chill out until my appointment. I will check out the podcast, thank you for the help and advice! Chaos is definitely the best word to describe this time lol. Absolute chaos. I do believe there has to be light at the end of this tunnel, I just have to hang in there and manage my anxiety somehow until then. If you do not mind me asking, with Raynauds, your fingers change colors, correct? My hands just get cold sometimes, but I have never had any color changes. \n\nIt definitely sounds like the medicine changes were really rough, I am sorry that was so hard on you :// it was so great to hear that you have finally found something that has helped and your symptoms are almost gone! That is amazing. It is very encouraging to hear that even though things were really up and down for a while, you ended up finding something that works and you have improved a lot. That takes a lot of strength to go through all of that! During this waiting period, I have off and on again pain and I will get pretty depressed bc I am like oh the meloxicam (anti inflammatory) is not working, but I have to remember that whatever it is I have, I am not actually being treated for it yet. The pain is mild right now, but I am afraid of it getting worse. I am just so scared right now, it is hard. It is a cycle bc the stress makes it worse lol. I really appreciate your reply and I hope you continue to do well on your medicine and your inflammation gets into normal range :) My symptoms have so far just been just joint pain with no skin issues. I am not sure about the Raynaud\u2019s, my fingers do not change colors or anything. Ive been told by others their hands get cold when anxious with no color changes as well so I am not sure if that is just an anxiety issue. I will definitely mention it to the dr. I will just have to see at this point, just wish the appointment was here sooner lol. I am glad to hear you were able to get your diagnosis. I hope treatment is working out for you as well. i will definitely not give up until I figure out what is going on with me. Thank you for the reply and advice! Stress has seemed to set whatever this is off and has made come it come and go. I notice the worse the stress gets, the more my hands hurt. I have read that stress can set off a lot of autoimmune issues :/ and it helps a lot to hear that even tho there might be different medications (might be with whatever I have even if it is not scleroderma) there is treatment and it is manageable. I completely psyched myself out with Google lol. The beginning of this whole process has been chaotic and scary, which fuels the stress. It is a vicious cycle I am stuck in at the moment. Thank you so much for offering advice and help. I will definitely reach out if I need some more support, I really appreciate you offering that :) Do not forget you are strong too, and eventually you will be able to look back and tell your own crazy stories! I see a therapist regularly to help manage my anxiety, she has helped a lot. I strongly recommend it!\n\nThe colour changes in my skin are hard to see until they go bone white, though I have white skin so my advice is probably completely useless for different skin tones. As soon as the vasospasm is triggered my joints get a little bit darker and a bit purpley. I think people call this stage \"red\" but I am not sure. Then my skin will get paler and paler, but if I pinch my skin I can still see my skin flush in response. For me reaching into a freezer can trigger a vasospasm, but since I go in and out as fast as possible it has never gotten worse than this stage. A cold breeze in summer can also trigger a very mild response, which makes my knees go purpley.\n\nThe next stage is bone white. Regions of my hands or feet usually starting at my finger/toe tips go bone white. This is a really distinct shift. It cannot be missed, but the way to double check is pinching or poking a white region if it is bone white it will not cause the skin to flush as there is no blood. You should immediately seek warmth. Contrary to pop culture you can absolutely run your skin under hot water to bring back circulation. Bone white regions also have no warmth because there is no blood in them. Once blood starts returning to white regions it can hurt like the fires of heck, this is unfortunately a good sign.\n\nThe third stage is the \"oh fuck no stage\". This is the blue that most people describe in Raynauds. If your skin stays white too long it can start going blue. I have only seen faint blue on my hands once as an adult, but I am pretty sure it happened to my feet and hands quite a lot as a kid. It does not look like distinct regions, instead in my hands it looks like a faint blue tinge where there use to be a bone white or yellowey tint. If you see blue that means your skin cells have started dying from lack of oxygen, and you need to take care of it asap. This is the stage where you need to be careful how fast you heat up the skin. So use warm water only if you have a faint blue, rather than a strong blue. If it is very distinctly blue go to a hospital or a clinic asap.\n\nMy Raynaud's is one of my lifelong symptoms that recently disappeared. Feeling warm outdoors in Canada in October without a thousand layers has been disorienting. I have had it since I was 7, and it is just gone. Thank you so much :) and I have actually been in therapy for years, still trying to figure out how to manage anxiety though :/ I have an anxiety disorder and adding this amount of stress is a recipe for disaster lol. I have tried to keep myself busy, that is the best thing I have found that helps. There is no answers right now, so sadly all I can do is distract myself. Thank you for that suggestion, mental health is so important, especially through something like this. \n\nAnd oh ok, I do not think I have any of those symptoms. I think my hands get cold as a response to anxiety? I have been told by others (who do not have any autoimmune issues) their hands get cold when anxious, so I am not sure. I will keep an eye out though for color changes. I am going to start paying attention to it more, like if it happens whenI\u2019m anxious or not. Thank you so much for sharing your experience with that though, I was very curious of what it is and what happens exactly. Do you think it went away due to your treatment somehow? I do not know for sure why it went away. I am hoping and kind of assuming that it did go away because of my treatment. My last blood test had nonsense results, so I do not know anything concrete right now.\n\nMy Raynaud's is more likely to trigger when I am anxious. I may have had vasoconstriction trigger solely because of anxiety, but it would be rare enough that I do not remember for sure.\n\nVibration like in a bad vacuume can definitely trigger vasoconstriction in me, but I do not keep my hand in/on the vibration long enough to really see any change.\n\nDo not forget there are 5 things in CREST and you only need three, or one + blood test to qualify (rules based on where I live). That is interesting. I hope it stays away! And I had to Google vasoconstriction, but I am seeing some things saying it can cause cold hands and feet when anxious. so when you put your hand on the vacuum, does it become cold? I am seeing a lot of articles (again it is Google so who knows) saying cold hands can be from your body moving blood to your major organs bc of fight or flight. My thing is, I have a lot of issues with anxiety lol. I went to the ER twice last year (for other issues, I was fine lol) and a walk in clinic to get tested for covid and all 3 times they did an ekg on me and I did not understand why. Then one time, someone mentioned my heart rate was through the roof, so I realized my heart was beating so fast from anxiety that they were doing an ekg. I have had someone look at my heart rate and ask \u201chow old are you again?\u201d bc my heart rate and blood pressure were raised from nerves. The last time I went to the dr, (the one that is sending me to the rheumatologist) the nurse said my heart rate was super high and she would take it again later on. After that is when the dr felt my hands and mentioned them being super cold. This is a very common occurrence for me in any medical setting. I have \u201cwhite coat syndrome\u201d to the ultimate max. I also get hot flashes, heavy breathing and the rapid heart rate. So lots of physical anxiety issues happening. As soon as they put that cuff around my arm, even if I was calm before then my heart starts beating out of my chest lol. I will definitely tell that to the rheumatologist. I am trying to pay attention to it now and write it down when it happens. I got offline and have only been talking to people on here, which has helped a lot. I really do appreciate all of the help, I know I am just worrying myself sick. Everyone has told me CREST is treatable and manageable, I guess I am afraid of the prognosis? Idk. Thank you so much again though, it is so so so nice to talk to someone about all of this!! Raynaud's is the disease (kind of) and vasoconstriction is the technical term for the symptom of that disease.\n\nHoly Beans your hr is high. I have scared a nurse or two about my hr in my day, but never that much. Sending love and hugs!\n\nGood call in going offline. I completely disconnected from googling symptoms for my first year post diagnosis, it was just too much. Sorry if the terms I have said have tempted you back onto that hamster wheel!\n\nCREST has seemed pretty easy so far, and my instance has put up a bit of a fight! I have/had bad Raynaud's, and entry level versions of the rest of the acronym. Exercise and keeping everything flexible and moving is extremely helpful in managing the S and the C. Getting into Yoga for strength and flexibility may be a great preventative measure. I think CREST is at it is worst obnoxious. Without modern medicine it might have been more dangerous but now it is just a pain in the butt Ohhh okay. Makes sense! I will definitely be talk about it with my rheumatologist. \n\nAnd it does get so high, it is ridiculous lol. I am on medication for it and also in therapy, which has not ever really helped much tbh. I have been trying other things like Buddhism, I am keeping my fingers crossed it helps lol. Is there something that helps you the most with stress? I know exercise and diet are a big thing I have read that can help. And thank you!! Love and hugs to you as well! \n\nAnd oh I have avoided Google, no worries! Thank you for being concerned though!\n\nI will definitely start exercising soon! I would like to as soon as I hopefully get on some type of meds for this problem. A part of me is almost scared bc I am afraid it will make my joints hurt more? I know it is good for them but at the same time, it freaks me out I guess lol. And oh that is good to hear, I think the prognosis was the thing I was most scared of. Google scared the crap out of me with that :// I think I mixed up terms earlier, \"vasospasm\" is the Raynauds technical term. Vasoconstriction is related but not exactly the same.\n\nOne of the things that was really helpful with exercise was I learned how to move without putting pressure on my joints. There are tricks to minimize arthritis pain when doing stuff like climbing stairs or bending down. My pain is pretty much non-existent now, but learning how to walk 'properly' was extremely helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the stress you might want to consider trying out a new therapist. There are many different ways of providing psychotherapy and shopping around till you find a therapist uses a method that helps you is really the secret. People always recommend switching therapists if seeing them makes you feel bad, but I like to also recommend switching when seeing them makes you feel 'meh'.\n\nOne of my friends also went to therapy and when he describes the advice and methods that really helped him, I practically get second hand stress. Everyone responds differently to therapy and therapists are specialized to help a specific type of person.\n\nAlso maybe try meditating or something you find relaxing before sleeping. I know if I am particularily anxious before bed I will not sleep and if by luck I do it is not restful sleep. Ohh okay. Yeah I am really not sure about the Raynauds at this point, I have gone so back and forth thinking \u201coh I do have it\u201d or \u201cno I do not think so.\u201d Which I know by doing that, I am just making this worse for me lol. I know that I will not know anything until the dr appt, but my mind is trying to get one step ahead and act like the dr for me\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nWhere were you able to learn these tricks for it? Or did you find out for yourself? \n\nI did look around for a different therapist a while back, I ended up going back to my very first one because I realized switching back and forth was ok but I liked her style the best and felt like she listened to me the best. We are trying to figure out my diagnosis bc I am rather undiagnosed, misdiagnosed or the specific treatment I was doing before was not working. I am also one of those people who does not respond very well to antidepressants and such. If I do respond to it, it is only with side effects lol. I do believe too that one type of therapy and medication can work great for someone and be completely wrong for the next person. I really appreciate that advice bc it can be hard to remember it could be time to try something new if something is at a standstill. And it is funny (ironically) bc I have not slept well in forever but with beginning to learn about Buddhism, I was actually sleeping well for the first time in years. But ever since this shit happened, I have barely slept or have been able to eat. I have paranoia type issues, especially with medical type stuff so with this, it makes total sense to me of why I am reacting so poorly to this. I think it was an underlying anxiety issue that needed addressing but i think it is also very situational too. Just sucks a lot yk. It is just insane to me how one side of Google is like oh you will be totally okay or you do not have that long left. Mix that info with someone who has major anxieties issues and you get someone who is been nothing but a ball of nerves :/// I have only been talking to people on here and it is helped tremendously, still going strong with no Google tho! lol. Thank you for still talking with me, it is helped me so so much :) No problem! Honestly Raynaud's is not significant in a warm country/state/city. I learned the tricks by googling (many years ago) and asking people on forums like this.\n\nI think one thing that has helped me a lot that might also help you is until something impacts your quality of life it does not matter. My understanding is that any potential Raynaud's is not affecting your life, but other things are. \n\nI think you said you were experiencing pain and definitely some serious anxiety those are what matter, not the 'maybe Raynaud's'. Sure maybe in the future the R in crest might affect you, but you are strong and IF that time ever comes you can handle it without breaking a sweat. It does not matter right now, so do not waste time on it.\n\nI know the feeling, when stuff is affecting you and there is nothing you can do but wait. I started imagining new problems that I thought I could solve easily. I started chasing problems that were not immediate concerns, I think because that felt easy. The truth was, there was still more I could do about my immediate problems, but those options were hard. Not just hard in the physically difficult sense, but also hard mentally and emotionally.\n\nWhen I was put on Methotrexate and \"scared straight\", that is what happened. I realized there were other things I could do to help with my immediate problems that I had been avoiding. I was scared that they would be too hard, but I was more scared of methotrexate. So I did them, and they were not actually that hard and methotrexate was not actually that scary.\n\nYou have found stuff that helps you immediately in the present, that should be the stuff you focus on doing/learning about. Learning about Raynaud's will not help you right now sitting at your computer/phone, but all the other things you have talked about will! \n\nTell me about Buddhism. :). (probably in DMs I think mods get mad if you go too many comments deep)", "Has anyone had a positive ACA but no symptoms for years before developing CREST? I was given an ANA test as a mistake when I was 19. It came back as  1:80 which I understand is borderline. I was referred to a rheumatologist as a precaution and I was given a ACA test because I had raynaud's while taking Vyvanse. Drug induced Raynaud's is a very common side effect of Vyvanse. It was fairly mild and I no longer experience Raynaud's, even though I still take the medication. My ACA came back as 1.8.  I took the test exactly one month after having a baby. \n\nI am now 25, and I still have no symptoms. I know that CREST can be very mild in some cases, but I was expecting to have some sort of indication that I had it after 6 years. I would have never known if I had not been mistakenly tested. I was originally told I would start to develop symptoms within 5 years max, since I was already producing antibodies. I do not know if this is true, I cannot seem to find any evidence to confirm that statement. \n\nI am wondering if anyone else has had a positive test, but did not develop symptoms for several years? Unfortunately, I do not have health insurance, so I can not go to a rheumatologist. \n\nThank you! Somewhat. I was diagnosed with lupus when I was 10.  I would say that my entire 20s I had no symptoms other than maybe more fatigue and slight arthritis.  If I did not have the diagnosis I would have thought that they were normal.  It was not until my 30s I started developing specific CREST symptoms, starting with difficulty swallowing. \n\nSo basically 10-20 slight symptoms with two flare ups. 20-30 no symptoms. 30-35, swallowing issues that did not worsen. 35-38 symptoms increase including gastric issues, arthritis, raynaud's, Telangiectasia, issues with temperature regulation.  \n\nI just got tested for ACA for first time.  It was probably positive the whole time and I do not have lupus.  It took 25 years for the symptoms to get bad enough that I was willing to be more aggressive in finding out what is going on.", "Those with digital ulcers... what meds have been successful for you? As the title says.  My SO has Sclero... and shes been having quite the time the last  year or so with digital ulcer flare ups.\n\nAnyone here had success with any certain meds or treatments outside of the norm?\n\nThanks in advance all!  Granted I have not had to deal with ulcers for over ten years but when I did have them I was prescribed nitroglycerin cream and took Norvasc daily.  Nitroglycerin cream helps restore blood flow to the affected area.  Norvasc gave me headaches so I took 1 larger dose right before bed and that seemed to help keep symptoms at bay during the daytime.\n\nWith that said, I was still hospitalized twice for my ulcers and received Flolan via a PICC line and that cleared them up within a week of being hospitalized.  It was not fun or cheap so I hope you can work with your doctor on a medical intervention and avoid hospitalization! thank you for this info! Sildenafil (Viagra) is what helped heal mine pretty well... but insurance would not pay for it at first, as I am female. If I stop taking it for long periods of time I tend to get more ulcers.\nIf it is at all possible, invest in some arthritic hand helpers. I was told by wound care that the less you use your fingers the less ulcers you get. Anything to cushion or protect her fingers from inadvertently hurting them. I really like ( thank you!  I want to say shes on Sildenafil but shes running into that insurance issue Yep, definitely use GoodRx and have it sent where it is cheaper while her doc writes the letters needed to get it taken care of. \nAlso, if they are really painful, keep them wrapped up and wet with a lidocaine hydrogel or medihoney. noted, thank you!", "What were your first signs? I have been diagnosed with Sjogrens, and have positive anti centromere antibodies which is usually more consistent with system sclerosis. I do not have the skin symptoms present for a scleroderma diagnosis, but am worried that it might eventually develop since I have the antibodies. \n\nI know some symptoms will overlap with what I struggle with now with sjogrens, but what were your first signs/symptoms of scleroderma? You do not need the skin symptoms for a diagnosis and if your rheumatologist says you do find another one that knows more about scleroderma. I have systemic scleroderma and do not have any issues with my skin whatsoever. I have about every other issue though, the red dots on my skin, acid reflux, tightening of my esophagus, joint pain, scar tissue on internal organs after surgery, periodontal disease, raynauds, etc etc. Hmm good to know. He specializes in scleroderma and sjogrens and said I did not meet enough criteria for a scleroderma diagnosis but we would keep an eye on things. The symptoms you listed are all also symptoms of sjogrens, except hardening of organs and I do not know about the red spots. Can I ask how they discover hardening of organs? My first symptom was Raynaud\u2019s in my hands and feet. That made my doctor run tests on me that confirmed I have CREST Ditto, except that I have systemic sclerosis. At first the doctor thought it was stand alone raynaud's but then my entire gastrointestinal system got involved. I had some tightening of the skin, including microstomia, but that subsided after a few years and now I have no skin involvement. Same exact symptoms I have.\nI have systemic diffuse scleroderma. I started off with dry eyes, dry mouth, periodontal disease no matter how much I brushed and flossed. Nosebleeds (from having dry nasal passages), and lotion that would stay on my skin hours after I put it on. My skin just is not good at absorbing anything.\n\nI got diagnosed 6 years ago. What I have noticed more as my disease has progressed is that it takes me FOREVER to swallow anything \u2014 ice cream, soup, even water. I also have problems with my lung capacity, I find it more and more difficult to breathe or take full breaths. Body aches all the time too. \n\nFWIW, I bought a Theragun percussive massager and use it every single day. It helps keep my muscles from getting too stiff. I highly recommend it I have all those symptoms except my skin absorbs stuff very quickly, and swallowing is not that bothersome...usually depends on the food. \n\nDid they ever do any testing for your shortness of breath? They did pulmonary functioning tests for me but said everything looked fine. I still have shortness of breath though. Can I ask what gastro issues you had? I had a colonoscopy and upper endoscopy but they found nothing and then gave up. What other test were ran? I just had the antibodies tested but did not know if there was more. Your experience sounds just like mine. I have had 2 pulmonary tests; always with the same complaint (\u201cI feel like I cannot take a full breath / Elephant sitting on my chest / my lungs feel heavy / like somebody is choking me / like I am buried in concrete up to my neck\u201d) etc.\n\nI always performed near the very bottom of what is considered to be \u201cnormal\u201d range. As it is still within an acceptable range, I get told \u201ceverything is fine\u201d, even though I have major shortness of breath. So annoying. WRT gastric issues I began throwing up meals for no reason. I was losing appetite and I was feeling nauseated most of the time. My stomach declined to have food in it and for years I had to eat the final meal of my day around 4 - 5 pm. I would had the kind of tummy troubles long reliant on antacids but out of the blue one night I was hit with an intense experience of acid reflux. Man was that awful. UGH and BLECH!   It started coming almost nightly. The acid reflux exacerbated my throwing up issues, and made things close to unbearable. The reflux (so vile tasting) would climb up into my throat and cause such intense and uncontrollable coughing spasms which made it scary difficult to breathe. And then I would toss my cookies. My endoscopy found that I have no functional muscles in my esophagus which results in esophageal dysphasia.  Gravity enables me to have food in my stomach and I have to sleep sitting up.  The tests ran the gamut. Every antibody blood test (ana, anti-SCL70 etc.). Endoscopy, colonoscopy, motility studies (tube down your nose to your stomach and attached to a small device at your waist which records intestinal \u201cevents\u201d - 24 hour study while you go about your daily life). I saw a rheumatologist who became my main doctor until she retired, as well as a pulmonologist, dermatologist, cardiologist and  gastroenterologist. The past couple of years I have had an overgrowth of bacteria in my lower intestines which caused debilitating flare-ups, involving loss of appetite, intense fatigue, mind-numbing nausea, and constant dry heaving that would go on from 4-7 days. I had five flares over the course of 2 years before anyone figured it out.  Sorry I have gone and on about this. I normally have no one to talk to about this illness that I have  lived with for 17 long years. \nThere is a little bit of good news in all this though. \nIn 2004 I was given a prognosis of perhaps 2 years to live. Doctors were pretty darn sure I would not see the end of 2006. Well goddammit. Here. I. Am. Still. Alive. And. Kicking. But I must admit there are some days when I am no longer sure it is a good thing. \ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nIf you are new to this illness read everything you can get your hands on, preferably peer reviewed articles by reputable researchers. \nGood luck to you as you navigate this journey.\n\nEdited to correct spelling. Hey, how are you doing now? Very kind of you to ask. I am not doing particularly well right now. Skin tightening came back in the summer in my feet and ankles. Other symptoms, mostly gastrointestinal, which have been controlled by medication have returned with a vengeance. Muscle pain has emerged and joint pain has increased. I also have associated anemia which leaves me weak and exhausted so I am really unable to do those things that used to give me joy. That is it in a nutshell. Wish I had a more positive report.

I am being monitored for the next 2 years, due to finding anti-centromeme antibodies in my ANA test. I had an episode of syncope and my doctor ran some blood tests. All my tests besides my iron came back normal; my inflammation marker was nonexistent, heart is doing good etc. A day later I am being referred to a rheumatologist because of the antibodies. This was about 7 months ago.\n\nHad my rheumatologist appointment and she asked if I ever had any skin issues. Of course at that point I blanked and could only think of my eczema. Fast forward to recently and I had remembered an episode that lasted about 2-3 years that started in 2010 when I was pregnant with my second child. I had patches all over my back that were hard and darker than my normal color, I dont remember them being itchy or giving me any problems. The doctor diagnosed it as a fungal infection and prescribed creams and antifungal medications. Nothing worked and then I developed these same issues in my inner arm. I was so embarrassed and nothing cured them. My skin on my arms have never returned to being the same. The color is normal but i can see where the skin is different now. I dont know how to explain it. These patches dissapeared on their own after about 3 years. In that time being young and thinking I was invincible never got them checked out. \n\nMy question is: Has anyone gone through similar? Does this sound like Morphea? I know no one is a doctor here and I see my rheumatologist again on Jan 14th and she is aware of what I I recollected.. I am just looking to connect with people who are living with this. I have a small morphea patch on my back, and I would say that I can definitely feel the difference between it and normal skin - if I touch it, I can feel where the skin changes textures.  Does your skin change textures between the spots and not?  That said, mine has never disappeared (it is been around 15 years) - I do not know if it does that. The skin texture is different. It is still patches of different skin but is not hard the way that it was before. It didnt clear up but became different in texture, and not dark.  I wish I could post a photo. I sent it to my rheumatologist and she wants to do a biopsy . Yes.  My older \"burned out\" spots are different than the ones that were fresher or just beginning to be active. This helps me to feel like I am not alone and not crazy! I get that - I have never met anyone with morphea in person.

TLDR - I have extremely low vitamin D (13.2), positive ANA (1:160) and positive Scleroderma AB SCL 70 (1.0 Al) but rheumatologist is not convinced it is scleroderma (no skin hardening). Aside from the possibility of a false positive test - what else could cause these results? \n\nLong story:\n\nIn November, I got results back from a 23 and me DNA test and it stated I had the genetic markers for Celiac. I have suspected for some time that I may have an autoimmune disorder but celiac surprised me because I do not have the classic digestive symptoms that go along with celiac. However, I do know that not everyone with celiac has classic digestive symptoms. I went to a primary care doctor and went through all my symptoms - she agreed that there is something going on my could not say for sure. She ran a CBC, CRP, Sed Rate, Vitamin D, ANA and Celiac Panel. The Vitamin D came back extremely low and positive ANA (1:160) and she referred me to a rheumatologist.\n\nAt the end of December, I met with the rheumatologist, she felt the results/exam ruled out Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis but did still feel there could be something going on, her initial thinking is Fibromyalgia. She ordered additional tests to check kidney function (normal), Sjogren's Antibodies (negative) and  Scleroderma AB SCL which came back at a 1.0 (they consider under 0.9 to be normal). The office called with results and said while it came back positive, they are not convinced that is the cause. \n\nMain symptoms I have are severe joint pain (which flares during weather changes, stress), a lot of cognitive problems (brain fog, anxiety), some digestive issues, general fatigue, overall feeling of just not being right. Along with a whole list of things that could or could not be related to autoimmune (sun sensitivity, red rash on face, tingling sensation in hands, always being cold especially hands and feet). \n\nWhile I have a long list of general symptoms - I do not have any symptom that I would say is a definitive/classic symptom of the common AI disorders (face redness but not a distinct malar rash seen with lupus, some digestive problems but not the classic symptoms of celiac, joint pain but not the swelling seen with rheumatoid arthritis) which is why she was leaning more towards fibro or more of just a generalized yes, somethings wrong but at least right  now there is not anything definitive. \n\nI do know that many autoimmune disorders can be progressive as well as a lot of autoimmune disorders have different subsets of them (different types of lupus or scleroderma) and in general the same disorder can present in different ways in different people.\n\nBut I also know that healthy people without AI can have a positive ANA, I know there is the possibility of false positives in a lot of tests (I believe I heard depending on the method of testing the Scleroderma AB SCL 70 can have up to a 50% rate of false positive). \n\nI am currently taking high dose vitamin D (I believe for the past 6 weeks) and 15 mg daily meloxicam for the past week. I am noticing minimal improvement with both (though I have heard vitamin D can take months to really notice a difference and meloxicam can take 2-3+ weeks to notice a change). The best I can describe it is I feel the vitamin D and meloxicam are helping slightly with the aches but not taking away the pain. \n\nIf anyone has seen anything or had their own experiences similar to what I have described, I would love for some input or guidance on what might be going on.

A knowledgeable internist or family doc can manage Raynaud's and any other specific illness, but you will need to look around to find the right person... for example, try someone who is recommended in a local forums for the condition needing treated. I will not lie, it can be frustrating and often hopes are dashed upon meeting the doctor you thought would finally have answers. This is especially true for those with non-specific connective tissue and/or fatigue complaints. If you continue to be an advocate for yourself, however, and do not give up, you will eventually find a decent, non-judgmental provider. We are out there, I promise. \n\nI am originally family med trained, but I actually went through an internal medicine rotation and used to do ICU before it burnt out my body and mind. I am also certain there is an EBV outbreak at my former hospital, because I care for too many former coworkers suffering from CFS/ME to think otherwise. I sometimes wonder if I am infected with EBV too, but I do not bother checking because, as we used to say when a code blue was announced during my residency, \"What is one more coal on the fire when you are already in hell?\" Snort. \n\nA bit of a personal aside: I was diagnosed with CREST Syndrome, of which Raynaud's is a part, while in medical school (the disease has all but killed my mother), but a ton of new symptoms slowly developed after taking an ICU/hospitalist job straight out of residency. After doing my own rectal blood test and ordering my own labs through the hospital (doctors are truly the worst patients), I discovered I was trying to maintain a difficult career, be a loving wife, and remain an involved mom with a hemoglobin level of only 6.8 (*under half* my expected blood volume)!! No wonder I was failing!\n\nI was eventually diagnosed with celiac disease, multifactorial anemia (anemia of chronic disease, iron deficiency from chronic GI losses, and a B12 deficiency from pernicious anemia!), Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, and some kind of atrophic gastritis no one can yet explain. Though I am certain I was sick with those problems for many years, they were confirmed only after working myself to the point of no return. I found myself progressively unable to keep up physically and cognitively, and not even the blood transfusions I required every nine months provided relief. When I kept pushing it, I developed autoantibodies to an uncommon nerve receptor (probably not uncommon... more likely under-diiagnosed), giving me symptoms mildly similar to those described in \"Brain on Fire,\" a book about a journalist's experience with autoimmune cerebritis (I was not psychotic like she was, but I had seizures, memory loss, and total atrophy of my left hip girdle). \n\nAfter all that, the career I worked so hard for was nearly ruined. It all but killed me to work like that, especially after so many stressful years getting my education. Additionally, I was accused of being lazy, an alcoholic, a drug addict, an attention seeking narcissist... despite 35 years of having a spotless reputation, you name it and I was suddenly being called it or accused of it by someone (extended family being the most vicious). So, yeah, I 100% do not recommend being chronically stressed when you are saddled with inflammatory genetics. But boy, having to resign because my fatigue was too severe and my body too weak to maintain a formerly top-game position within the medical world... well, it taught me hard but valuable truths about human nature, our patient care system, and the cruel biases against women, pain, and disease outside common checkboxes. \n\nI now do outpatient general medicine, CFS/ME management, and chronic pain care through my own concierge clinic, allowing me to work at my own pace.

A blood test is the best place to start: \"Elevated levels of immune factors, known as antinuclear antibodies, are found in 95% of patients with scleroderma. Although these antibodies are also present in other autoimmune diseases such as lupus, testing for them in potential scleroderma patients is helpful in assisting with an accurate diagnosis.\" from (\n2. Your GP should do a urinalysis for your other systems.\n3. If your GP does not know about auto-immune diseases, then ask your GP for a very good rheumatologist in your area.  Rheumatologist is the primary diagnostician for scleroderma.\n4. Several of your symptoms do not map to common scleroderma symptoms. Definitely go see a doctor if you are concerned about your body\u2019s health. I would have to agree with statement #4 though that what you are describing does not sound like scleroderma symptoms.

I am a 24F so it seems unlikely to have the diagnoses in the first place, but I have no idea what any of this means really. \n\nApologies if this should not be posted here, I have been waiting to hear from my doctor about follow ups and am getting restless after seeing the results. The blood and antibody tests really cannot prove anything. Sadly it is skin biopsies and clinical repsentation of signs and symptom that will get you the diagnosis of Limited systemic scleroderma which used to be called CREST. It is best to get yourself treated by a scleroderma specialist they can be pretty far away from your location some individuals travel 6 hours but to get the proper diagnosis and to have one on your team of doctors is important I would you have the systemic form of the disease Thanks for the reply, it was helpful! Guess I will just need to be patient and get ready for a skin biopsy. Luckily, I live about 40 mins from Mayo Clinic\u2019s headquarters, so I am assuming I will get referred there if need be. I tested positive for centromere antibodies as well. They are monitoring me for any clinical symptoms. Are you having any symptoms? Strangely enough, I had not noticed any skin issues (aside from cold hands and feet). The main issues that brought me in were a persistent dry cough that has lasted months, chronic fatigue, shortness of breath, bowel issues, muscle weakness/pain, and dizziness. I have also had hypertension issues over the last year even though I am a healthy in shape 24 year old. I have had to stop working out actually because I kept feeling faint and have to sit down or would feel worse after workouts. I am slowly finding my limits. \n\nNow that I have learned the symptoms of autoimmune disorders, I have acknowledged some other symptoms I had put on the back burner such as acid reflux and swallowing trouble, migraines, weight loss, joint pain, heart palpitations, etc. \n\nWhat symptoms are you having or being monitored for? Ironically, mine started at a crossfit class. I pushed myself a little harder that day and ended up in the ER after passing out. My physician asked all the right questions due to bad IBS issues, digestive issues, joint pain and fatigue, ordered a myriad of tests and my ANA came up positive for centromere pattern. My rheumatologist wanted to test again with another method and came back with a high titer for centromere. \n\nNow shes mainly waiting for me to have active skin issues or reynauds. In 2011 I had skin issues where I developed hard patches on skin on my back and inner arms. Doctors said it was a fungal infection, gave me cream and that was that, it lasted 3 years before it softened and went away. \n\nSwallowing issues I am starting to get concerned about. Sometimes I feel like water gets stuck in my throat and upper stomach if that makes sense. Is this what you feel. If you see a really good Gastroenterologist, they can do expansion upper endoscopy and they stretch your esophagus out. I get them twice a year. No pain, no side effects. Tremendous help and peace of mind. I have not had any skin issues like patches yet, but definitely swallowing issues. Sometimes taking medication is terrible because it feels like it gets stuck in my esophagus. I will ask to get referred. I am 23F and was diagnosed with CREST a year ago. I first got tested with my ANA levels at 15 and then at 19 with centromere but it took until 22 for my doctors to give me a diagnosis. \nI suffer with the cold/numbness of hands and feet, awful acid reflux, facial redness, fatigue, and had a period of a few months where my liver stopped working altogether.

You should check out the industry, I am US based but I see a lot of positions in Canada. Interesting! What kind of education did you get/is required for clinical research? I am also interested, thanks. I have a non-science Bachelors degree and got into clinical research. You should be fine with your degree. Good Luck! Get an advanced degree and teach online.

They mainly looked at the extent of my lung function and skin involvement because they said that is all it is been really proven to help. Are you qualified then? Yes and no. While my lung damage qualified me on its own, the doctors recommended against it. They thought my symptoms were controlled well enough with mycophenolate that the risks and physical/emotional/monetary cost would not be worth it. The mortality is 1% right?? I cannot remember the article I read, but I thought it was reported to be around 10%. \n\nGoing off (\n\n33 people got the transplant, 7 died with 2 being from disease progression - so 21% and 6%\nPlus, 9% still needed to take antirheumatic drugs after.\n\n34 got at least 9 doses of chemo only, 14 died with 11 being from progression - so 41% and 32%\nPlus, 44% still needed to take antirheumatic drugs after.\n\nFeel free to check my math on that, I probably did it wrong... So yeah, it is better but still some risks that they have to weigh against other factors.\n\nIn addition to the physical toll the huge doses of chemo and radiation have on you, you live in their \"cancer campus\" where they have control over the cleanliness of the environment you are exposed to. Once your white counts are high enough and you are discharged, they require that you live within 30 minutes of the clinic/hospital in case something goes wrong or you get an infection for a certain amount of time after the transplant. After being discharged, you also need to come every day for blood count tests... So if you do not live near the hospital, you essentially have to move for 3-4 months. Plus, there is maintaining a central line until your treatment is done, getting vaccinated all over again, and I think you have to have check ups because of the radiation you went through - not sure on that.\n\nMy lungs and skin \"stabilized\" with mycophenolate so they wanted to stick with that, because pills and stability are easier than the risk with a chance at remission for me.

Ineffective esophageal motility, GERD, intestinal dysmotility (I have had chronic constipation since I was a child and I can really only have bowel movements on linzess) and the like. In the last 6 months its been as though my GI system is shutting down.\n\nMy GI referred me to a rheumatologist and a neurologist. I have yet to see the neurologist but I have now seen my rheumatologist. He reviewed past blood tests from a little over 5 years ago. He found a raised ANA (speckled), elevated SS-A/Ro Ab, lgG, and a slightly elevated but technically still within range SCL 70 AB, lgG. He ordered more blood test which I am still waiting on results for.\n\nHowever at this point he raised the possibility of scleroderma and we discussed what it could mean and so on. **My question is, how fast does this progress typically?**\n\nI remembered I had a complete pulmonary function test about 10 months ago as well as cardiac stress test with 7 day holter monitor about 3 months ago. The results of the pulmonary function test were noted with **\"better than expected spirometry, FEV1 of 117%, FVC 120%, FEV1/FVC of 79%. No evidence of bronchodilator response and normal diffusion capacity. Evidence for possible vocal cord dysfunction\"** As for my cardiac stress test, **\"normal stress test, no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmia. Functional capacity excellent for age. Holter monitor results normal.\"**\n\n**The reason I ask** how fast this progresses is because I read that the terminal part of scleroderma is due to the lungs/heart being impacted. My GI issues have taken a hard hit in the last 6 months, progressively getting worse at fairly fast pace. However As of a little under year ago my lungs were \"better than expected,\" and my heart appears excellent for my age.\n\nAll of this is of course technically hypothetical until the rheumatologist confirms scleroderma, right now though its only a possibility that I am inquiring about. I have had a wild ride of problems and my doctors are very confused. The doctors see my problems, they have visually verified my problems, but no one can seem to figure out what is causing them. So far I have seen an allergist, pulmonologist, gastroenterologist, cardiologist, orthopedic surgeon, ENT, and soon to see a neurologist. In the last 2 1/2 years I have had dozens of blood tests, endoscopies, colonoscopies, allergy test, pulmonary function test, holter monitor, cardiac stress tests, abdominal/pelvic CTA scan, esophageal manometry, 24 hour pH/impedance test, ultrasound of various places, barium swallow(fluoroscopy), EKG, x-rays of my lungs/spine/neck, and probably more that I am forgetting about. The only doctor who has raised any possible problems is the rheumatologist and it happens to be scleroderma. Hi! I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years. Each person\u2019s progression is just that. My rheumatologist said the 1st year is what you watch for the direction the disease will go, either systemic and limited (CREST). I have CREST. But during that first year I was repeating tests often to watch for the direction of the disease. My lungs started to decline but then leveled off, luckily. It is a wait and see game. I continue to work out(even when I feel like crap) to keep ahead for my heart and lungs. Does that help? i have scleroderma and have had GI issues for years. are you taking any anti inflammatories?  i stopped all oral nsaids and am using only ice and voltaren gel and my GI issues are resolved. i also use fiber supplements everyday.   do not stop looking for answers and do not be afraid to switch doctors if your not getting help. getting diagnosed with autoimmune diseases is a process not a one time thing. my diagnosis has changed multiple times since i was initially diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disorder 20 yrs ago. i hope you find the right combo to get your life back to normal, that can be done- the meds are there, you just have to find what works for you. Thanks I am sorry you have to deal with this problem. Out of curiosity dies it have to affect your skin? I have zero skin issues aside from some thick calluses on my feet.\n\nI assumed that seeing as the blood test results that raised his suspicions were around 5 years old, and the fact that I had a good lung function test as recently as 10 months ago that if I did have it, it is very slow.\n\nThank you though, it did help. I am currently working out too. All of my issues are almost exclusively in my GI tract. I am not take any anti inflammatory medication. This rheumatologist is supposed to be a good one. I think now that I have finally see him it would be wise to give him a chance. Getting an appointment with one can be up to a 3-7 month wait here. I am assuming mine, if I actually have it, is slow because the test results that raised his suspicions are around 5 years old and my more recent lung and cardiac tests were positive.\n\nDo you have skin issues? I have almost no skin related problems other than thick calluses on my feet.\n\nEdit: Just realized I replied with the same questions in the same thread. Sorry, I am not used to using the Reddit app. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago, mostly digestive issues and I work exclusively with a functional medicine doctor for my gut issues. Most of those issues subsided with supplements addressing issues from results of  stool tests, and other lab panels. I also follow a strict AIP diet. I have no skin issues. My echocardiogram was normal, my spirometry test was normal. I work out everyday but also see a physical therapist for nagging pain in my shoulder which is diagnosed as a loss of muscle mass- we are not 100% sure if it is related. I am not on any meds, my rheumatologist has made suggestions for raynauds and as annoying as it is it is not bad enough for medication in my opinion. However for the past 18 months I have been dealing with Gerd which now seems to be calming down a bit. It is very frustrating to hear doctors uncertainty sometimes and to be told we have to wait and watch out for these symptoms but it is what we have to do. I just try to make the most out of the days I feel good and really take my breaks when I do not feel great. Truly is a journey. it took a long time after my diagnosis before any skin changes occurred.  the first changes i had was swollen puffy hands. then a rash on my knuckles and cacinosis that caused wounds on my finger tips. later the skin on my hands hardened. if i bumped a rack in the oven taking out a pizza, it would not blister, it like charred with no pain.  my rheumatologist moved and the new one put me on methotrexate- my skin is soft now and is getting loose enough to have normal wrinkles again. i would say from onset it took almost 10 years until the sclerosing happened. that is good you have a rheumatologist now if you do develop more serious symptoms you will be able to see someone about it. best of living to ya- cheers. i replied to your comment but did not address it to you- its on the post tho - cheers Progession is different for everyone. There is no baseline. I went from healthy to full diffuse in 6 months! GI, lungs, heart you name it I had it. Take it 1 step at a time and avoid stress. \n\nSteady health to ya.

Not judging I also do not have skin issues but am worried about SSc so curious how that works. I do not mind at all. I see two different rheumatologist (different medical groups) and they both gave the same diagnosis based on labs. I would have to find the paperwork at this point but I think one lab was Avise and one of the doctors said it was pretty accurate. Were your labs ANA tests that were positive? Do you have systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma? I have positive centromere A antibodies and positive centromere B antibodies. ANA was positive and it is in line with systemic sclerosis. I see a cardiologist once a year. They just keep telling me to monitor how I feel with tiring quickly and since I am active it should be noticeable.

Positive ANA, tests for limited and diffuse scleroderma came back negative. Titer came back as most likely CREST. The problem with the feet is the only issue currently going on. Very distressing. Also feeling a bit of tingling from time to time in arms. \n\nSide note: lichen sclerosus was diagnosed on the back 4 years ago. \n\nThanks so much for any feedback you can give! I am a bit confused. \u201cCREST\u201d is just an outdated term for what we now call \u201climited\u201d systemic scleroderma. They are the same disorder, so you cannot be diagnosed with one and not the other. \n\nAlso, scleroderma is diagnosed by using a symptom-based criteria. Blood work is only a small part of the diagnostic process - there is a scoring system based on some specific symptoms. But you are saying that your only symptom is pain and tingling in your feet?  I am confused as to how you have been diagnosed.  \n\n(Unfortunately the majority of rheumatologists are not very familiar with scleroderma. It is a rare disease, so many have never even seen it.  This is why it is so important for patients who have/suspect scleroderma to be seen by a scleroderma specialist. Generally, I see the use of the term \u201cCREST\u201d as evidence that a doctor is not remotely up to date or knowledgeable about scleroderma.)\n\nIf you do indeed have scleroderma, it is possible that you have calcium deposits in your feet, or degradation of the fat pads. Tingling is neurological and could be any number of things, including a back or neck problem. I know CREST is limited but that is how it was stated on the ANA blood work result. In fact, it had both written: \u201cMost commonly found in CREST (limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis). The doctor did not say CREST but the laboratory (Quest) that performed the test did. I simply used limited in place of CREST because I know they are the same thing. There are specific tests which indicate either limited or diffuse. The tests I had went beyond just the ANA, such as the Scl-70 test, RNA, Centromere Antibody) I know there is not one big test to say which one it is but the results point to the likelihood. \n\nThe doctor I found is part of the Scleroderma Center at Jefferson in Philadelphia.\n\nThe only symptoms right now are in the feet. Last winter is when the first attack of Raynaud\u2019s came on. Since it has not been cold where I am, I have not had an attack since. You said at the beginning of your post that the test for limited came back negative, but then said a test for CREST was positive. That is why I am confused - they are the same thing. The antibody test for limited/CREST is the anticentromere antibody.\n\nEither way, scleroderma cannot be diagnosed simply with bloodwork. There are people who test positive and have no symptoms ever.  On the flip side, there are people who obviously have scleroderma but antibody tests come back negative. That is why the diagnostic criteria exists. Unfortunately, there are just so few rheumatologists that have any idea of how to diagnose/treat it, and they do not like to admit that either.  I now live in a state with no specialists and am going to have to travel annually for my care. \ud83d\ude1e\n\nIf you do have calcinosis in your feet, I can tell you first-hand that it sucks. I have had one on the bottom of my heel for about 3 years. With really no treatment options, I have had to find what shoes/slippers are the most comfortable and just wear those all the time. Feels like there is a pebble taped to the bottom of my heel, because there basically is a rock made of calcium in my skin. Forgive me if I am confusing you. It is just a lot yo take in. I totally understand what you are saying and what you statement was what was stated to me.\n\nI have me go back twice a year for testing and to look at my skin and the capillaries in my fingertips.\n\nDo you know anything about Morphea and lichen sclerosis? I am wondering if that is what is actually going on. I read that there is an overlap. \n\nIm about to go to a podiatrist that handles scleroderma (and Raynaud\u2019s and its affect on the feet). I am also going to a neurologist. I do not know much about lichen sclerosis to be completely honest. There is a lotttttt of overlap with all autoimmune disorders, and it is pretty common to have symptoms of more than one. \n\nMorphea or \u201clocalized\u201d scleroderma is entirely different from limited/diffuse in that it only affects the skin. It is not systemic.  There are a few varieties, but really the only symptom is patches of hard skin. \n\nThere is a lot of good information online at\n and ", "Stuff that Works - Scleroderma Community. We are not alone.

I normally sit cross-legged because straightening my legs out feels like a stretch. The pain starts in the upper part of my calf and radiates up my thigh and down my calves. This sometimes causes chronic cases of my leg \"falling asleep\" to the point where I cannot use my limb. It is happened with both legs before and I had to catch a stair railing to not fall over. I have not had that happen as much lately, but the stiffness is definitely way more uncomfortable and difficult to ignore. I also have shoulder pain, but I think that is due mainly to bad posture.

I have had a lot of strange symptoms in the past year. I always brushed it off and figured it was just due to my thyroid issues (I have Hashimoto\u2019s autoimmune disease) however, my endocrinologist sent me to a rheumatologist. He said my symptoms were not related to Hashimoto\u2019s. \nI have been feeling extremely weak, exhausted, and generally unwell. I have been getting rashes all over my body, and I have been experiencing raynaud\u2019s. I have severe GI issues, even after switching my entire diet completely. I am constantly bloated and feel like crap in the stomach department. I also have trouble swallowing some days. \nMy Rheumatologist tested me for a bunch of different autoimmune diseases. My ANA was positive for speckled homogenous, and I was positive for Anti-Centromere B antibodies.  He diagnosed me with Limited Scleroderma.\nI am absolutely terrified. The symptom list really scares the crap out of me, and the possible organ-related issues and severe skin thickening is frightening. I am scared for my future. \nI am going back to my Rheumatologist to discuss possible treatment plans and medications. \nFor those who are diagnosed with this, how did you cope? What medications helped you? Have you been able to live quite normally? I have so many questions and I have no support or anybody to lean on regarding this. I am just a lonely college student with not many friends. Ironically I am in school to be a nurse because I have always wanted to help people feel better.\nI feel very alone and afraid. I know this is an extremely rare autoimmune disease, it is crazy enough to have been diagnosed with it but I do not really know what to do next. I am sitting here like \u201cwow, I really have scleroderma.\u201d :( My rheum had me test antibodies multiple times because there are high false positive rates, so I would encourage you to run a new test just to be sure. If it is confirmed again, please look into getting a specialist at a scleroderma center, as they are best equipped to treat it.\n\nWith that said, you do have some symptoms so it may not be far off to potentially have scleroderma developing. Regardless, the information found online is very outdated. There are really promising treatments available that help to control progression somewhat and allow you to still have a full life. Your personal symptom prognosis is not guaranteed to be severe like cases have been seen in the past, especially with the research available now. It is just hard to say because symptom progression varies quite a lot. You may only have GI symptoms develop, or you may see a few other systems get involved. You may not have skin thickening development at all. It just varies.\n\nThe best thing you can do at this point, in addition to follow up testing and getting a specialist,  is look into autoimmune diet protocols, start taking turmeric to reduce inflammation, and get into an exercise regimen for flexibility and stress control. I have a daily yoga practice, and cutting out nightshade vegetables and a few other problematic foods for my inflammatory response did wonders at helping to reduce my GI upset symptoms. It is not perfect by any means, but it took something that was painful at a 7/8 down most days to a 2/3. Quality of life improvement is key. Get a second opinion. Breathe.  There are treatments. You are young.  Just breathe.  And always pray. \nIf it is a certainty, then you need a good rheumatologist backing you. Hi, thank you for the response. I have been trying my best to stay positive and pray. It is hard. I will definitely be going to get a second opinion for sure. Thanks for the response.  I am going to retest for sure. My rheum told me that based on my symptoms it seems that I am in the early stages of limited scleroderma. It is nice to know that there are some promising treatments out there in case my diagnosis ends up being accurate. Googling things did me no good at all. I will be getting a second opinion to make sure. It is just a really scary time, especially since my symptoms do line up. I am glad you were able to improve your quality of life, I want to get to a point where I do not feel like a walking corpse. It is reassuring to know that it is possible. Thank you Keep pushing and advocating for answers and talk to your doctors.\n\nHaving been diagnosed a couple years ago and being not much older than you, I recently experienced the same anxieties and fears. Reading a ton online about it made these emotions worse for me. There are so many opinions and applying those to my unique situation was panic inducing.\n\nWhat helped was learning from my care team about my manifestation of scleroderma and not the non specific view of it. That helped ground me.\n\nMaybe this could help you as well? Honestly,  those feelings run deep and you might wrestle with them for a long time. I know I have. But, if you need support, I am here too.\n\nEdit: I was placed on an immunosuppressive drug that I have tolerated well. My lifestyle has changed nonetheless but, the medical interventions worked (I have Systemic), allowing me to continue living with some adjustments. I am 30 and got diagnosed earlier this year, too. It is been a rollercoaster of emotions and I can totally relate to what you are dealing with. It is a rare disease as it is but on top of that I am a guy and it is even rarer for us to get it, so I feel like I got dealt a pretty shitty hand. I was angry and scared about it initially but now it is something I try not to think about or dwell on too much.\n\nI am not sure I can say or add much to make you feel better right now. But it is okay to feel angry and scared about it. Let yourself feel that but do not give in to bitterness. Your life is not over, and we humans are more resilient than we think. You will get through this period and find a way to live in spite of your scleroderma. I know you will. To make you feel better, I have limited Scleroderma(I like the old term CREST) for over 20 years. I am doing great! Of course it is been a roller coaster of a ride but I living a really good life. Feel free to reply to me any time for support. I will also be starting a Podcast called Mogil\u2019s Mobcast for people with scleroderma. I have different doctors lined up. My website will be up in a week. Mogilmobcast.com. My podcast will start up in August. \nDo not read to much on the Internet!  Thanks for your response :) I would love to tune into your podcast, it is great to bring awareness about this illness since so many people do not even know it exists. if you do not mind me asking what are your symptoms and are you / have you been on medication? Has it ever gotten extremely bad? It is nice to know that you are doing well! I have good days and bad days but recently it is been a hell of a ride, especially with getting the diagnosis. I am sorry about your recent diagnosis :(  I did read that it was rare for men to have it, I can imagine how frustrated you were when you found out. I feel like I have been dealt a shitty hand as well, I keep thinking why me? Especially when I want to do so many things in life and am so afraid that this disease will progress and ruin my future. I think I am going to try to not dwell on it too, although that is easier said than done. I do not really know how to feel other than scared and frustrated for the time being. But going to try to be positive. Thanks for your kind words :) When I was first diagnosed, my hands swelled like baseball gloves! That was the beginning of it all. My body was very sensitive. I did acupuncture. That was awesome. I am very much into holistic medicine and luckily so was doctor. So for medicine I take medicine for high blood pressure and one for blood circulation. My Raynaud\u2019s is what continues to bother me today. I also get calcium deposits and are bothersome today. They are in pressure points on my hands. I understand the scariness of the disease. Exercise has been my coping mechanism. When I was at my low points, just a simple walk, to hot water swimming. And I continue today with 2 mile hikes. Does that help? If you have more questions let me know!!! 1. Google is not your friend.  If you want more up to date info go to sclerodermainfo.org or scleroderma.org.  Look at research papers, not the google outdated scary stats that often mix up limited and diffuse scleroderma.  \n\n2. Every case is  different.  While it is nice knowing what to look out for, remember that just because someone online has a hard time with one aspect does not mean you will to.  \n\n3. As my Rheumy says, \"there are a lot of old ladies out there with kind of crooked hands and scleroderma living their best life.\"  \n\nOne of the nice things about limited scleroderma is that it does not usually progress quickly.  We thought I had Lupus for 28 years. I did not' take any maintenance drugs for it.  We did not figure out scleroderma until my Raynaud's got worse.  Remember that it is normal and expected to feel down about a new diagnosis.  Also remember that knowing what is going on is actually really great, woohoo modern medicine (do not blame the diagnosis, your body was going to do this anyways).  I highly recommend the sclerodermainfo.org site, it is hosted by a guy named Ed Harris and he is really fantastic.  He is on a Facebook scleroderma group that I have really enjoyed.  In the FB group you see people who are struggling but you also see people who are managing active symptoms with a great attitude. \n\nIt has taken me this long (30 years!) to get to a point where my GI issues are very annoying but basic medicines help it so much.  My hands being cold is also annoying... i want to get a hot tub lol.  My skin changes have all been temporary.  If anything I am getting wrinkles now.  I have no lung issues, I feel like my lungs are stronger than most.  The hardest part for me is the fatigue.  For some Plaquenil helps this a lot!  \n\nIt is a lot to take in.  Look at accredited studies not generic articles from webmd. It will be a slow journey. It is ok if it is bumpy right now, it will get smoother, it is not as bad as you worry it might be. Just an FYI.

Depends what type of scleroderma you have. So I have alot of skin involvement my whole right leg. I also had joint pain and extreme itchiness upon my first appointment. They blanket labelled me with scleroderma but could not pin point my type that day. A week later I was being taught how to do self injections of methotrexate which got rid of my joint pain.

I know that is the absolute lowest threshold for positive, so it is technically possible I have nothing to worry about or have something like scleroderma but not quite. I have been having a strange collection of symptoms since April (and potentially before, kind of hard to tell): tingling, tight/unpleasant muscle sensations (but thus far no weakness), and pain, primarily in my right calf and forearms, noisy/cracking joints and random pains all over, telangiectasia, and a dark/blurry spot in left field of vision. More recently I have felt some chest pain (possibly anxiety related, got to be honest. Have had chest x-ray and EKG and both were normal), and a sort of tight feeling in my throat. \n\nI have not had any of the classic symptoms (Raynaud's, skin thickening, swollen hands, etc.), which confuses me.\n\nNaturally, there is a long wait (still not sure how long) to see a rheumatologist. I have an appointment with an opthalmologist this week to follow up on my vision issue, and should have an MRI/neurology appt soon--I requested that referral before the ANA came back and it was seeming more like MS. I have a good PCP, but this is my first time having a serious medical issue, so I sorta do not know what to do and hate asking for things, but I am working on getting over that feeling. \n\nThe hardest thing for me, mentally speaking, and why it feels impossible to remain calm at the moment is that five years ago, one of my closest friends (a former coworker) was misdiagnosed with lupus (later diagnosed with dermatomyositis w/interstitial lung disease), experienced a steep decline, and was dead within five months of her first symptoms appearing. So even though I am normally a reasonable, calm person, that is the only outcome I know from a situation like this, and it is the one I fear for myself. I am 37. She was 34 when she died. And as a public health person, naturally I find it curious that two people who worked in the same place for several years would end up with rare autoimmune disorders...\n\nWould welcome others' perspectives or just general thoughts about how to adapt to this (potential) new reality I am facing.

My Dad had Scleroderma and passed away because of it. I was 5 years old at the time but I do remember what it did to him. I am 21 years old and I think I might be seeing signs of it? I am not really sure what is going on. I do not know if it could be Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or the raynaud's syndrome which is usually associated with Scleroderma. Is it genetic and should I possibly get tested to see what is going on? Go to Rheumatologist first and ask for ANA pattern blood test. If it comes back as \u201cnucleolar\u201d pattern that is a big indicator for scleroderma. Or you can ask them for the genetics test. Definitely going to look into that. Could not find much online about it. Thanks I think I found this info in some published scientific articles and maybe on the American autoimmune association website too. I had tested for the Ana pattern myself and got nucleolar, and that is how I found the info. I did not have enough symptoms for them to diagnose me with scleroderma but I did learn a lot about it in the process. Hi there. I am sorry to hear that you think you could have this disease and for the loss of your father. This disease is difficult for those that have it and those around them.\n\nTo answer your question, Scleroderma does not have a genetic factor although a family history of autoimmune disorders is seen as a possible factor for why people may get it. I have Scleroderma myself but no one I am related to has it. I did want to ask what specific symptoms you are seeing? If you think you are seeing related Scleroderma symptoms I would second seeing a Rheumatologist that has a background in treating Scleroderma patients. (Some Rheumatologists are specialized in treating Linear Scleroderma and others in Systemic Scleroderma so factor this decision into which doctor you see).

Basically, I got this spot on my skin below my right breast that had a pink outer color but my normal skin color on the inside. However, the skin was thicker than the rest of my skin. I was not sure what it was, but made a mental note to see a doctor. This was not a priority to me though because it did not hurt or itch or anything.\n\n\nThen more popped up. By the time I finally saw a teledoc (free with insurance+COVID, ya know) I had 3-4.

It made the centre plaque thinner but it also made the skin very delicate, and the plaque just kept growing bigger around the outside of the spot where I used the cream.\n\nMy morphea went into remission after I solved another problem that was a source of inflammation for me. Fingers crossed it stays that way. But I have heard good things about the light therapy. I think it is worth considering. What was causing the inflammation? I have both of those, too. It is horrible. The Clobetasol helps a lot but you cannot always use it, like you are doing. Off and on. It does help with darkness &amp; thickening. But, the spots keep coming! Reducing stress is key.

I did not know about the prevalence of false positives and was feeling very defeated about ever getting answeres to me medical issues. The people here were very helpful and pointed me in the right direction. I appreciate that advice and was able to get an appointment at the Hopkins Scleroderma center that one person recommended. \n\nJust my take on why I am here and what I got out of it. Thank you for helping me to see other view points. That makes sense. I just want to start off by saying your feelings are understandable. I can definitely see why it might be a bit frustrating feeling like you have to console people (who are likely okay) when you deal with this debilitating illness every day.\n\nThat said, being a person with Scleroderma, I think this can be a great resource for people to start out with.\n\nI was misdiagnosed for many years which delayed treatment. I had nobody to talk to about these things and I could not see a rheumatologist until age 13 due to financial reasons, so something like this would have been useful - so that I knew I was not alone in searching for answers.\n\nEverybody\u2019s Scleroderma experience is uniquely different, and none of us here can diagnose someone, but if we can provide some insight based on personal experiences that they can take it with them to a rheumatologist later on, I am all for that. Your feelings are valid. Also family members who think the disease is not real?! wtf is right... Thy feelings art valid.  Eke family members who is't bethink the disease is not real?! fie is right\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` I agree with you. There is also a certain amount of risk with accepting medical advice or recommendations off the internet for those looking. Before and after diagnosis, I spent too much time online reading about various diseases and scleroderma. I felt like I was keyed up on worst case scenarios. I feel like if I started asking around in subs like this, I would feel worse or more confused.\n\nThe best thing to do if you think you have this shitty disease is to go talk to a doctor who will listen, as you say. \n\nIf I respond to these requests, I say the doctors know best even if their symptoms parallel mine. I found a doctor in Iowa who treats this with the antibiotic protocol. They have an 80% success rate of full remission. They treat rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma. People from all over the world go there for this treatment. I went in 2014 and it was the best decision I ever made. My body is back to normal. I have to take antibiotics every day. The drugs they wanted me to take did not work for me so this was my best option and I am so glad I did it Where are you being seen at?", "Worried Greetings fellow readers,\n\nWishing you are all well.\n\nOver the past few months I have had several health issues occur that have led me to be very worried and concerned about scleroderma. For the record I am a male, early 30s.\n\nIt started out with a sore on one finger that did not seem to go away. After some time the finger actually got quite swollen. This was during winter. I ended up getting several red sores on different fingers over the course of a few months. I consulted the general practitioner many times and went through the general steps, tried corticosteroids creams and ointments, moisturiser etc. One spot in particular persisted for a long time but has mainly resolved now.\n\nBlood work was arranged and I took multiple tests. ANA on multiple occasions across a few months, ENA panel and rheumatoid factor etc. all tests returned as negative.\n\nI have done quite a lot of googling of scleroderma as that is where my initial symptoms led me (bad idea from the start, to google stuff). After googling, I started to notice reflux lasting a few days at a time, I noticed a couple of small telangiectasias on my hands and on one of my fingers I noticed a haemorrhaged capillary on the nail fold. This has returned a few times now across the last few months. Up until then I would not experienced any true raynauds occurrences with the white blue red color changes however my hands are frequently cold and have been for as long as I recall. I also notice redness around my nails on quite a few fingers.\n\nReferral was made to a rheumatologist whereby I was examined along with the serology reports and was told i do not have scleroderma. The diagnosis was the sores on my fingers were chilblains/perniosis due to being very slender and cold temps. As for the nail fold haemorrhage I was told an occurrence of this on one finger is not enough to warrant a sclero diag as it could be caused by multiple things.\n\nSome time after this whilst using a power tool causing vibration, on a particularly cold day, I noticed one of my fingers go numb and white. This is the only time I have ever noticed that and it is not occurred since. \n\nAdditionally I have noticed since the past few months I have developed what I believe looks to be erythromelalgia which makes my fingers and half my hands go bright red from exercise, walking, standing or anything that involves having my hands hanging down. This sometimes causes a \u201cpressure\u201d sensation in my hands. \n\nI will need to go back to the medical practitioner for further investigation but I am very worried. Google paints a really scary picture and it just seems like I have so many of these symptoms that point to sclero. Is it possible to have a relatively regular life and life expectancy if one was to contract the illness but treats and stays on top of symptoms?\n\nAll the best. The fact that you have a negative ana most doctors will not consider much unless you have more symptoms. It is possible that you could be in the very early stages. Not everyone with scleroderma gets raynauds, but it is very common.\nBut do try not to worry. There are different forms of scleroderma and it presents itself differently in everyone. While some with the systemic forms have very serious organ issues others find their issues manageable. It really is different for everyone. There are medications that can help treat the symptoms and slow your body\u2019s immune system down. When googling scleroderma you tend to find a fair amount of outdated information and worse case scenarios. A great website for information is scleroderma.org \nLet me know if you have any questions. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3 Thanks for the reply and the info. I guess what I am wanting is some reassurance that if I did indeed have it, is it possible I will still be around for a long time.\n\nYou mentioned everyone has different experiences with the illness which I understand that in itself makes it difficult to say how one person will fare compared to another. \n\nI note that on some websites it states that for the majority of people with the limited systemic form, they are able to live mostly normal lives with a similar life expectancy to the general population. Please stay away from Google, it usually points you to much darker places when in reality every situation is different - and yours might be not as bad as what you see online. Good luck cookies! I feel we are in similar boats right now- my blood work all came back normal, but my symptoms are piling up. The Doc mentioned Scleroderma to me and it sent me on a googling rabbithole of bad. I have bad nails, mostly my thumbs though, my hands swell up esp when I am walking but they feel \"tight\" all the time now, raynauds every now and then- my hands and feet are now swelling up in the middle of the night... blood vessel popped on my thumb- pain down my arms and into my hands, pain in my feet, achilles pain a few weeks ago for the first time- chest pains that really worry me but only now and again- fatigue, brain fog, etc. A patch of skin on my back is now rough and brown, but that is the newest thing and could be a bruise/scratch- anyway my point is, guess what my canadian doctor told me to do after all this? Also my mom has Lupus, my aunt has mixed connective tissue, and my brother has lupus... my doc told me to now try for allergy so cut out glutton, then sugar, then dairy for a month to see if it is all a food allergy. Sigh. I know this is not a food allergy. She then said, well the next step for you after you try these diets will be the rheumatologist. I am a little frustrated that I now have to wait 3 months of diets (one of which I might try, glutten, but the others, I know my body is well and truly able to handle dairy by now, and sugar is just the devil so ya I should cut it out ya....) I bet I will not see a Rheumat for at least a year from now, there is one is a small town an hour away from me. My advice to you, keep on your doctor, work on your spiritual self, keep a diary of when things happen, how bad they are and what set you off (cold power drill set off raynauds). It is hard to rem it all when you sit down sometimes. Perhaps it is not scleroderma, but another auto immune... it is hard not knowing and having so many confusing things pop up. The ulcers on your fingers must be painful/annoying. Keep me posted I am interested in your journey! Dr google is bad bad news I have found that the more I read on things the worse I tend to feel. Stress will really do bad things to a person both mentally and physically. Keep a diary of things regarding symptoms and do push to be an advocate for yourself but please do not google too much as I said it will only make things worse. Trust me I know! Wishing you the best in getting the answers along with any treatment you may need. I am sorry to hear you are having those health issues. Do you have any nail fold capillary abnormalities(enlarged capillaries or haemorrhages)? Passing on my best wishes. I am not sure if I have those, can you see them without a microscope? Do they happen on all your fingers? Here was my post with photos of my thumbs recently- Hope things improve for you as well, hang in there!  Thanks for providing the link. What I was referring to is more so tiny little blood dots/haemorrhaged capillaries on the nail fold which can just be seen without a microscope. Yes, I feel it is possible you will still be around for a long time. Especially if it is caught earlier rather than later in the progression of the disease. Having a rheumatologist who specializes in scleroderma is key. They will work together with other doctors and monitor your organ involvement closely. They know what things to be on the lookout for and certain medication to try or to avoid. \nHope this helps give you a little peace of mind. There are a couple really great groups on Facebook. Thousands of people living life with this disease are all there to share support and information. It is worth checking out if you have time. Best of luck! Thanks for the reply and the positivity. May I ask without being too personal, do you have sclero? Yes, I have the limited form. Most people with the limited form go many years in between new symptoms and it progresses very slowly. Unfortunately, that has not been the case for me. I have a lot of issues, pain and shit days. But I work, go to school and live a very happy life. I am sorry to hear you indeed have the condition and many issues. I am however glad to hear that you live a very happy life and are still able to get by, go to work and school etc. May I ask your age and duration of the condition? I am currently 38. I had my first symptoms in 2014. I already had a good idea I had scleroderma by researching my combination of issues. I received an official diagnosis in 2018. I am here two years later still trying to get it all sorted out, but we are mostly there. It seemed for awhile every test they ran they found more problems. I get bummed out anytime I get bad news but I do try to only give myself a day for that. Then I try to embrace the fact that it is out of my hands and I cannot let it drag me down too much. ", "Scleroderma \u2013 Autoimmune Disease ", "Anyone else here have diastolic heart failure? While I am here...how about anemia? (other stuff too -I have a LOT going on and am overwhelmed :( **TL;DR:** basically the title. Anyone here have diagnostic heart failure along with/associated with their SSc? How is it being treated if so? \n\nSo as not to double post - while I am here thought I would also ask if anyone here has anemia related to their SSc, if so what is the \"mechanism\" so to speak?\n\n\\--------------------------\n\nGreetings all.  It is been a rough year, to put it mildly. I am new to this disease and many other things as well. It has all collectively taken me to my knees. I got double (now triple) \"whammied\" and more hits keep coming, I do not know what is related to the SSc or separate basically, I am so confused and lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* I was diagnosed with bulbar myasthenia gravis in July. (I cannot find a connection for it w SSc but I don' t know, will ask neuro at follow up next week, as it was diagnosed 2 months before the SSc)\n* Diagnosed with \"systemic sclerosis\" in Sept (in quotations bc it was the rheumatologists' term, he did not use the word scleroderma for whatever reason). \n* I have anemia. Hemoglobin was down to 8 a few weeks ago, I had iron infusions and it went up to 12 briefly, but last week my CBC showed it is going down again, now 10. They do not know the cause yet, might get hematology referral or it could be GI related, see next bullet point lol). I am a female but have no uterus so it is not bleeding from there).\n* I have had lower GI issues (significant pain) since January and have had nothing but bad experiences with GI docs until last month -  I finally have a good one and hopefully he will figure it out  ASAP, it is killing me (I think it *has* to be small intestine, my colon and upper gastric areas are fine. Pill cam soon. Wonder if this could be related to anemia, no idea yet...).\n* Last week I was diagnosed with diagnostic heart failure after a right heart catheterization - I have NONE of the \"typical\" risk factors for it. (workup was due to worsening symptoms of severe fatigue, shortness of breath, inability to do much of anything and so bad now I cannot drive). I have NONE of the \"usual suspect\" causes. It is typically a disease seen in very elderly women with already existing coronary heart disease. *That is not me.* I am 50, no coronary artery disease, perfect lipids, low BMI, no diabetes, etc. \n\nI meet with the cardiologist next week for a plan going forward. I am wondering if SSc could be the cause of this bc I sure as heck have no idea what else could be causing this - if so what role would my rheumatologist play here? Or would it just be treated by the cardiologist?\n\nAnd if it is related to the SSc how do know if the heart failure is worsening versus the SSc worsening? \n\nSorry for the novella here, I am just *overwhelmed*. :(\n\nThanks in advance for any help/advice/guidance - any little bit would help, I feel so alone. Can you qualify for a Stem Cell Transplant?\n\nI am post transplant almost 3 years now, it basically saved my life.\n\nI had a lot of what you had. Improvement in every aspect. I used to have anemia. Mine was caused by what my rheumatologist called \u201cwatermelon stomach\u201d. It is a slow bleed in the stomach due to inner lining of the stomach bleeding. At one time my hemoglobin was down to 5.6. I have had 27 endoscopies! My first GI doctor totally missed the diagnosis. Grrrr! Have you had an endoscopy? I am back to \u201cnormal\u201d in that area now but it took awhile. I had to have 2 blood transfusions and 2 iron infusions. I still take iron with vitamin C. \nI started a podcast called Mogils Mobcast, for Scleroderma patients. Episode 1 is my journey if you want more details. &gt; I have had 27 endoscopies! \n\nHoly crap! So sorry to hear that. I have had a colonoscopy and endoscopy. Both normal, so a pill cam test has been ordered, insurance is taking their sweet time in approving it, it is maddening. :/\n\nI will check out your podcast, thanks so much for letting me know. I am glad you are back to \"normal\" now (whatever that means for us lol). Thanks again. Honestly I do not know, I will bring it up with my rheumatologist - seeing the cardiologist this week and since my doctors are in the same medical system I messaged my rheum about this latest development and I am hoping they will consult with each other about what to do next.\n\nI appreciate the advice and I am very happy to hear of your improvement! All the best. I know how this cam be overwhelming. 1 day at a time. Thank you so much. Did you develop any heart problems? I just feel like things are escalating very quickly. Apparently the diastolic heart failure in SSc is not reversible (bc it is not like the kind caused by coronary heart disease, or lifestyle factors, etc. - I have none of those problems)\n\nI am trying to take it one day at a time, and for awhile there I was succeeding - but I keep getting the wind knocked out of me, seems like every week now - so it is very hard right now. \n\nAgain, thank you for the information and for the supportive words, it means a lot to me, makes me feel less alone! I did have sclerosis of heart and lungs. My digestive tract was the hardest hit however.\n\nThey are starting to see a reversing of damage of about 10% post transplant on organs. This is great because the hope is just to stall it. \n\nIn my case the heart and lungs have healed to the point that it is just a footnote, and my digestive tract it just a small problem. Reflux is the worst really. At least now food gets fully digested. Before it would just pass through. (Sorry for that)\n\nFYI it takes years for the transplant to work fully. I am still healing because of it and it is been 3 years.\n\nWould I do it again? Yes. But with the team at Ottawa General Hospital only. Would not do ot with anyone else in the country. They pioneered the treatment.\n\nThere was another young man that was 26 when I got diagnosed. Our cases were like yours. Rapid onset. Things progressed quickly for both of us. He feared the transplant, he died within 6 months. I am still alive and doing fairly well.\n\nYour mental health has to be be rock solid though. It is tough and really messes with the mind. 6 months in the hospital is no joke and the meds rip your mind to shreds at times. \n\nIt is like fighting a forest fire with napalm. Highly destructive. I have GI issues too, and massive wt loss - pretty sure you are the one who helped me out in here before when I was talking about that part of this (literal) shit show, so thank you for that, you are awesome :)\n\nGetting pill cam soon bc anemia is worsening and colonoscopy and endoscopy were fine. Insurance has stalled for a good 3 weeks now and I am upset but too tired to even think about it right now since the heart failure thing. It is like whack a mole at this point - obviously you understand that 100 percent! I do not even know what the GI thing IS yet ffs and it is just...I am f-ing tired, you know?\n\nYour journey w this is inspiring and encouraging. Hard truth: I do not know if I have enough mental stamina for what you are describing (but that does not mean I will not discuss it with my doctor or reject it).  I am relatively young, have 3 kids and happily married, do not want to abandon them. IDK, I am rambling now, forgive me lol\n\nAnyway, thank you so much for sharing your experiences with me and what worked for you. It is valuable information and I need all of that I can get right now. What your describing is the worst of it. Even worse than mine.\n\nTime to have a sit down with the family and talk. If they do not step in to help... You will die. You need support!\n\nGod I am so sorry. No one should have to go through this.\n\nI remember the fatigue. It was so bad I had to make a choice. Focus on getting better or fight to get 250,000$ from the sale of my business. I left everything on the table and focused on my health. Absolutely no regrets. I am alive. &gt; Even worse than mine.\n\nNah I would not say that, I think we BOTH hit the medical nightmare equivalent of winning the mega millions lottery. I appreciate your kind words. And while I am sorry you had to endure this (no human should have to), It is wonderful that you are in here, giving your time to helping others. Massive respect to you for that.\n\nI want to be like that. Right now the fatigue, my God it is indescribable. I cannot even drive anymore. But you beat it (I mean as much as this beast *can* be beaten), so...\n\nI am going to see a therapist soon to help me get my head on straight, I simply do not have the mental/emotional reserves to make the best decisions right now. I have this weird combination of misery and apathy going on. I am not \"clinically depressed\" (I have had clinical depression, this is different - I think 10 months of this is just wearing me down.)\n\nKnowing you went through what I am going through and you FOUGHT it, I am going to let that simmer on my back burner a while and process it.

Recently we had gone to a dermatologist as she had white hard bumps on her fingertips and elbow.My mother had them for over 7 years now and they were diagnosed as warts by 2 separate dermatologists. Her elbow is also swollen but the swelling disappers on its own only to come back again. Her elbow started to swell for tge past 6 months. She also has swollen face but its just her face and no part of her body is swollen or has tight hard skin. The swelling on the face could be because of the steroids that she takes because of her arthritis. The dermatologist saw all these symptoms and said it could be scleroderma. My mother has been misdiagnosed before and our family had to go through hell because of it. I have done some research about scleroderma on the internet and it looks really scary and awful. Are there any blood tests that can proof if what the doctor is suspecting is actually true and does anyone else has only these symptoms.Please help i am really worried and scared for her. Hi Turmoilll.  Here is a ( that may be performed when attempting to confirm a diagnosis of scleroderma.  Thank you so much mo_jo My SO was diagnosed with Scleroderma in 2016 . It was a tough year. The first signs were Raynauds and joint pain. It started with our GP, he mentioned it could be Scleroderma then 6+ months of googling and we thought the worst. We finally saw a rheumatologist and he was the one to give the diagnosis (after blood tests) another 6 months we were referred to a rheumatologist specializing in that area he did some tests it took 10 minutes and he re-diagnosed with mixed connective tissue disease MCTD which is not nearly as bad and manageable. That was 1 year ago. Im no expert but Scleroderma is very rare and i dont think you should worry until you get tests and make sure you see a good rheum.. out first was not good and when i think back he only gave the diagnosis when i mentioned the disease.  My dad was misdiagnosed with scleroderma but actually had catastrophic anti phospholipid syndrome.  Thank you Wasfaces, this gives me hope. I am sorry that you had to go through all that. I know what you and your dad must have gone through. Thank you for sharing your story. Hey OP. Before you get too worried, just know that the only personal stories you will find online are going to be stories of the worst possible cases. People whose disease is mild probably will not feel the need to blog about it. \n\nMy wife has diffuse scleroderma. \n\nHer oral surgeon advised her to go get tested for it after not being able to extract her wisdom teeth due to the tightness of the skin around her mouth. We looked into it and we are obviously terrified by what we found online. We found a doctor. She got tested. After a week or two he told us the news. She has the worst kind, diffuse systemic scleroderma. The next week we went to the national scleroderma conference (it just happened to be perfect timing). We learned a lot about the disease and we ended up finding a specialist for her to see. He really knows his stuff. He got her on a clinical trial a year and a half ago and we think it is a success! She has some minor symptoms of the disease like aches and pains, and fatigue. But the trial drug and other drugs have helped to keep the disease from progressing further. \n\nI am sorry for the long post, but I say all that to say this: do not get too worried. Your mother has not been diagnosed with anything yet. If she has scleroderma, there are definitely some treatments that can be effective (stem cell treatment is looking very promising). Scleroderma is a weird disease and affects people differently. Do not think the worst just because that is all you see online!

My mother has been struggling a lot the past 8 months and the rhuemys are suggesting its scleroderma. Obviously i read online and the mortality rates and quick progression of the disease made me freak out and get depressed really quick. As a beginner to this disease. Are there any pointers, tips, remedies, medicines, diets and just words of advice you could give me for my mother ? Thanks. Stay safe and bless u all !! Hi! The Internet can cause a lot stress. But good news is that I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years. So there is hope. I have a lot  of ups and downs but I am doing great. What were her signs? Here are some tips. Is there someone who can go with her to her appointments? That can really help. There is great nutritional strategy called The Autoimmune Protocol or AIP. Medicine is now saying that autoimmune diseases start in the stomach called leaky gut. I try to stay away from as much medicine as possible, but the Rheumatologist will know what direction to go. I also see an Integrative Rheumatologist. I will be starting a Scleroderma podcast in July. I have some great guests lined up who can give insights. When the podcast is up it will be called Mogil\u2019s Mobcast a Scleroderma chat. I can keep you posted in that. Hope that helps a little. Thank you for the response. I was looking into the AIP diet as i know it triggers auto immune conditions. Which form of scleroderma do u have if u dont mind me asking? And did ur symptoms stop once u implemented the AIP diet ? What form was she diagnosed with that makes a huge difference? Thanks for the reply. Theyre thinking its systemic. No physical signs, like skin or reynauds. Just internal I have Limited or what use to be CREST. I have all of it except the E. I can give you more details too. I started different diets when I was first diagnosed. So it is been a slow change. I started by not having processed foods and nothing with high fructose corn syrup. I Later I did the whole 30 elimination and I do more paleo. After taking out all sugar, my high blood pressure is much more under control. I still take medicine for high blood pressure but very low. One is more for for blood circulation. I do feel better eating AIP, but I have GI problems and still working to see what the culprit is! Ohhh yeah im definitley going to try to implement that into her diet. Do u know if this also works well with systemic scleroderma? Its more internal organ symptoms and progressions not external, like skin changes and reynauds I am not sure. Since when I started AIP my Scleroderma was already working in full force. I have had skin changes and I have Raynauds. I take Sildenafil. It helps for blood circulation. I have also done trial studies for Raymauds. No luck! I just think getting your stomach micro biomes  in order will always help. Can I ask how old your mom is? My mom is 50 years old and she started experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms and now more recently shes having trouble swallowing. Hang in there. I know it is scary. What kind of gastrointestinal problems? Yes, the swallowing is the E , in CREST. Like stomach cramping. Burning sensations and\nLoss of appetite. I know im trying to just stay positive and trying to be as proactive as i can Looking forward to the podcast! I am about a week Into my diagnosis and have been looking for resources. My dad had systemic scleroderma with gastrointestinal involvement, his doctor suggested a \u201clow FODMAP\u201d diet- also recommended for people with IBS. It is pretty restrictive, but it seemed to help some. How is he doing now ? Hi, I am so sorry about your mom\u2019s diagnosis. I am a mother with two daughters and I was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of systemic scleroderma in 2014. I found a doctor in Iowa who treats this with antibiotics. He has an 80% success rate of total remission. I would be happy to talk to you and your mom anytime. This treatment saved my life. There is an organization called the road back foundation and they have a list of doctors that prescribe the antibiotic protocol for scleraderma, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Basically you have to take 100 mg of minocycline twice a day and that keeps you in remission. Of course you will probably want to alter your diet to cut out sugar and grains and any alcohol as those are definite negatives. My name is Denise and my phone number is 401-339-2323. I read something online about this doctor and it saved my life so I am happy to pay it forward and grateful to be here and able to do so!  Call anytime\ud83d\ude0a He passed away in September of cardiac complications due to SSc. Do not let that freak you out, every case is different and your mom was just diagnosed. \n\nI have been where you are, always happy to talk if you need a sympathetic ear. I want to thank you for reaching out as any message right now helps extremely. This is great news and has brought light back to our family in this dark time and so i truly thank you. Im glad that this helped you and im excited to see how it helps us as well. I will be reaching out to u in the next week or two after speaking to our rheumatologist and i look forward to hearing from you. My family Would like to send you prayers and blessings. Thank you for this. I really appreciate it -Hammad Limited scleroderma (formally crest) is systemic scleroderma I hope you are doing well with your new diagnosis. If I can ask, what were your signs that lead to the diagnosis? Let me know what information would be helpful on the podcast. I have some guest already lined up but I want this podcast to be geared to the Scleroderma population! Sorry to hear you lost your Dad from this. Mind if I ask how old he was? Diagnosed at 57, passed away at 66. Hand puffiness along with pain, numbness and tenderness was the biggest sign that lead to the diagnosis. I would love to mostly know how people are living with it. What do they do to avoid symptoms? Thank you so much! Thank you, I got my diagnosis at 47. You are very welcome. I am glad it has given you guys a little bit of hope. This treatment literally saved my life as I was supposed to die in 2015. I was 88 pounds and it wilting away more and more every day. It did not take long to go into remission maybe a month or so. This is not a conventional way to treat an auto immune disease however it works. And antibiotics are less damaging than the drugs they typically give to shut off your immune system. I take probiotics to balance the antibiotics. Good luck and like I said call anytime!\ud83d\ude0a That is how mine started with my hands swelling to like baseball gloves!! I hope to have other Scleroderma patients tell their stories on my podcast. Will keep you posted!! Wow thanks incredible. How advanced was your case ? Did i progress to your organs? And yes i will call you in one week Hi, it was pretty advanced I lost all my muscle mass and I could not swallow food very well. I was hospitalized for fluid around my heart for a week, But I believe that was from the prednisone that they gave me initially because I was so full of fluid everywhere. Gallons. My first breathing test was not good but now I passed them in record time. I feel strong again and that is a lot when you are looking at death.\nI look forward to you calling. Thanks! SO here is something I am noticing that could be very important.  There are different varieties of Scleroderma.  You need to figure out if she possibly has Limited or Diffused Scleroderma.  They are both systemic.  They both affect internal organs.  Did they use the phrase Crest at all? Did they test for different antibodies?  I am happy to help you figure out based on what you do know so feel free to shoot me a message anytime.  \n\nWhile I can not comment on your mothers variety I can tell you that I have had it for 30 years and the worse of it has been cold hands and fatigue.  Do not look at the google stats, they are outdated and just wrong.  THey even say that Limited Scleroderma has a 5 year survival rate and the truth is that it probably will not affect life span at all. My podcast is up!!! Just an FYI. It is called Mogils Mobcast.

I have! First I was on Viagra, which helped but my doctor switched me to Cialis, she said it was a slower release and the results would be longer lasting than the Viagra. She was right, it worked really well. My drug  plan only covered it for a month though, which sucked. I will say that I was on it mainly to get a digital ulcer to heal, but it did work really well. Male 49 I have been on Cialis for a few years. Usually October through March works for me as I do not need it during the warmer months. And the occasional date night with my wife. :) lol, did it work for the Raynaud's? Yes, it is been a useful, immediate intervention for me going on 10 years.  Happy to answer any questions you might have. It does.  My flare ups do not seem near as bad or last as long. Yes!! Since June I (34M) was put on 20mg of Sildenafil 3 times a day (insurance will not cover it) and 10mg of Lexapro once a day. My doctors at Stanford thought one or the other would work but both have helped in their own way. \n\nIn general I have always been a cold natured person, the lexapro made that go away! I can wear shorts in 60\u00b0 weather and in general I feel normal with respect to outside temperatures compared to everyone else. \n\nThe viagra has done wonders for the Raynaud\u2019s attacks.

But also came down with what seemed to be a cold but it was a strange cold but seemed to run its course. I still do not know if I had a cold or if it was just sinus issues from acid. I got a negative on covid test. First symptom was a chronically painful sore throat, one of the worst I have ever had that then went away. I felt extremely dry in my nasal passages too I thought I might have had sjogrens. So I got tested. But the sinus issues and acid reflux have gotten a lot better Have you seen a Rheumatologist? Was the blood test an SCL70? Or an antibody test? I have not seen a rheumatologist yet. I had the scl70 done it says high titers. I think I also had an antibody test done too. The labs are hard to interpret I would see a Rheumatologist and discuss it with them first before making a diagnosis. Ok thanks! It is hard to remain calm when my anxiety has been so high but you are probably right! I totally understand! I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years. Try to stay calm especially until you have a total confirmation. Bad bot Which scleroderma do you have?  Diffuse is the super serious one where you are also probably seeing all the worst symptoms of it when you google it. Limited scleroderma, formally known as CREST, still sucks but it is not as \u201cextreme\u201d for lack of a better word as diffuse. It is not so in your face of a disease because a lot of the symptoms mimic those of other minor health issues which on their own are no big deal and some are just apart of getting older so it is way harder to catch. It took 4 years for me to get a diagnosis because I do not have the skin issues that most think of when they here scleroderma. My first rheumatologist even blew me off even though I had the blood results because I did not have the classic skin issues. Second rheumatologist who was not as old said that that is exactly why they no longer call it CREST, because a lot were thinking that those are the only symptoms and if you do not have all of those then it is a false positive on your blood work. \n\n\nThe acid reflux comes and goes in the beginning. I was able to manage it with tums and slight change in diet, nothing too drastic. But now that my esophagus is tightening (another scleroderma symptom), it is getting worse for me. I am on a prescription med for it now and have to get my esophagus stretched out soon to make it easier to eat. You should also sleep on an incline to help with the stomach acid and do not eat too close to bed time. I have the limited crest. Or at least that is what the blood work shows. I have not been formally diagnosed yet and my symptoms are mild, I am having trouble swallowing and coughing a lot after eating certain foods. That is so scary that your symptoms have gotten worse. This is just such a mysterious thing to have happen and it is awful for anxiety levels because there is no cure but it is good to here that it is not the serious kind. \n\nThank you for all the advice. Do you feel your quality of life has gone down since being diagnosed? Blood tests do not determine the type, symptoms do. Go see a Rheumatologist. \nAlso stress and Scleroderma are like gas to fire. If you are positive, change your lifestyle, or Scleroderma will do it for you. Make sure you have proper coverage before the official diagnosis.\n\nFYI. I gave up millions in order to live.

So my doctor has not diagnosed me yet but my results were SCL-75 level 18, it is supposed to be below 11.  I was also being tested for lupus, but I guess in the testing they could tell my platelets were elevated, even though I have no idea the number because I did not have a comp metabolic test.  I have no idea how they can tell if platelets are higher from testing blood for something else.  \n\nMy platelets were tested last October and were within range.  Can scleroderma cause them to be higher?  Just wondering if anyone knows. hello, and welcome to the club\ud83d\ude44. In answer to your question, yes- elevated platelets is associated with scleroderma.   elevated platelets cause inflammation in the blood vessels and connective tissue that end up making the symptoms common to the disease. the scleroderma foundation has a great set of utube videos that cover basics, and also things like diet and pharmacology. I found the videos more helpful than reading because I can usually find a lecture that covers the symptoms I am concerned about.  I hope your disease takes it easy on you and you continue to do all the things you enjoy! Thank you for reaching out.  My platelets being possibly high is scaring me, so I am trying to stay calm, I see my PCP at the beginning of October and was going to ask them to do a comp metabolic panel.

Part of me really hopes that I have this disorder just so I have answers and can start to get some form of treatment. I cannot tell you whether you definitely have Scleroderma as I am not a doctor, but a positive Anti Centromere B antibody (ACA) test is suggestive of CREST or limited Scleroderma. The fact that you have a positive ANA in addition to a positive ACA test, could be because you have another autoimmune disorder w/ a Scleroderma syndrome overlap. For example, I have Lupus SLE with Scleroderma overlap. You have a lot of Scleroderma symptoms, but there are many autoimmune diseases that have similar symptoms. Usually doctors also order chest x-rays, biopsies, CT Scans/MRI, echocardiograms/EKGs, and perform skin thickness/hardening tests to make a diagnosis of Scleroderma. Just fyi, a lot of Rheumatologists do not know much about Scleroderma and are often afraid to take on Scleroderma patients. I had a rheumatologist who told me I do not have Scleroderma because I could \"smile\" even though I was diagnosed with it years ago. As far as suggestions and treatment options go, Prednisone, Methotrexate, Cellcept are some of the common prescription medications. Blood pressure meds/Nitroglycerin are often prescribed for Raynaud's but people with Scleroderma are usually hypersensitive to medications so their doctors need to closely monitor them for toxicity/organ damage. Things that I have found beneficial with Scleroderma symptoms are staying hydrated, keeping skin moisturized, myofascial massages, Magnesium supplements, and medical cannabis edibles. Foods high in copper seem to flare up my Scleroderma symptoms. Lastly, Rituxan infusions are not used to treat Scleroderma, but I had 4 infusions to treat ITP and it put my Lupus SLE and Scleroderma overlap into remission. Something you wrote really jumped out at me! Can you expand on:\n\n\n&gt; but people with Scleroderma are usually hypersensitive to medications \n\nI have had a REALLY hard time with medications in the past 4 years. My doctor blamed it on chronic pain... is this common in Scleroderma? I have been diagnosed for about 3 years. So I would I am understanding correctly, a positive ANA test does not indicate scleroderma but instead another underlying autoimmune condition? Again, I am not a doctor so I cannot confirm whether you have Scleroderma or not. From my understanding, a positive APA test is suggestive of Scleroderma but you will need more tests to confirm or rule out Scleroderma. Some healthy people and people with other medical issues like cirrhosis/liver dysfunction, can have positive ANA tests without having an autoimmune disorders. This is why blood tests alone are not generally used to diagnose or rule out autoimmune disorders. My ANA test results have been positive since the beginning of the onset of my Lupus SLE symptoms. It only took 3 months for me to be diagnosed with Lupus from the onset of my symptoms. I was tested for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome, and Scleroderma (it was called CREST back then) and the only one that came back positive was Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome. But even that had to be further confirmed via a second positive test result within 6 months of the first positive test and symptoms like \"sticky blood\", positive D-Dimer tests, recurrent pregnancy losses. Now, I test positive for and have symptoms of all of the autoimmune disorders that I listed above. Unfortunately, you will have to undergo more testing before a clear diagnosis can be made. Most people with autoimmune disorders will tell you that it can take years to be correctly diagnosed. Doctors are clueless when it comes to Scleroderma smh \ud83e\udd26Oxidative stress plays a big role in Scleroderma and there are tons of medications, foods/drinks, and chemicals that increase oxidative stress throughout the body. NSAIDS, sulfa based drugs, certain antibiotics, silica dust, pesticides, paint thinners, naphthalene, black teas, broad beans, legumes, fake mint, citrus fruit, vitamin k, etc all increase oxidative stress in the body and can therefore be problematic. Some medications that are often prescribed to treat Scleroderma can cause organ damage and toxicity. Other medications and street drugs like cocaine can induce Scleroderma syndromes. I have had personal experience with oxidative stress triggering low platelets due to having Scleroderma overlap. The worst low platelets episode was triggered by a pain med called Nucynta. My platelets dropped down to 3,000 and 150,000 is normal. Had to be hospitalized, had two blood transfusions, and  underwent 4 Rituxan infusions to increase my platelets. My Scleroderma symptoms were at an all time high, especially my Interstitial Lung Disease and skin lesions. Thank you, this is new to me so I will try to learn more about it. I appreciate the time it took for you to reply, and I hope you are in a better place now then when you experienced this. No problem. I wish things had been explained more to me when I was diagnosed with Scleroderma overlap. I am in a better place now thanks to the Rituxan infusions. They put all of my autoimmune disorders into remission.", "I tested positive for Scleroderma This is an update to my previous post. I was right. I tested positive for SCL-70. \n\nThe more I look into testing positive for this particular one it is scaring me. Specifically because I keep seeing the same thing. That if this one is possible that I have a progressive form of pulmonary fibrosis. Which is systemic. \n\nThis is such a shock because overall I feel ok. I am really trying to think positive until I see a rheumatologist and get more tests done. But I am not feeling good about it. \n\nAny advice or experience you have will be much appreciated. If you have been having pulmonary symptoms then I am very sorry to hear that, but testing positive for the SCL-70 antigen is not necessarily indicative of your progression.  I tested positive over a year ago at 31 and I have had the plaques on my hands for over 4 years now (was part of my diagnosis from my Rheum).  To date I still go to the gym, max out my pulmonary function test, and my organs seem to be doing fine (minus my gallbladder and appendix which died last year, but that is not related). I still have more energy than my wife 7 years my junior. The only thing my Rheum noticed was the beginnings of arthritis in my hands, and I am on meds for that. \n\nTesting positive for SCL-70 with no skin involvement and no organ involvement is not even enough to be actually diagnosed by a Rheum - there is a point scale. If you are having organ issues (lung, heart, kidneys), you can still slow the progression with meds. If it gets dire and you can get accepted to a treatment center, treatments similar to how leukemia is treated have had some success with completely reversing the disease. \n\nWhen I first got my diagnosis, I thought I would be dead on five years from what I read, but it seems that if you do not have the rapidly progressing version, and treat your body right, you have probably have fairly normal life expectancy minus 10-15 years - not what anyone wants to hear, but better than nothing. Everyone is different.  Deep breaths.  There is no blood test that can diagnose scleroderma.  The presence of antibodies in your blood is only one small piece of the puzzle.  Many people have these antibodies and do not have scleroderma, and many people who *do* have scleroderma do not test positive for antibodies.\n\nDiagnosis must be done by a rheumatologist who is familiar with scleroderma (most are not) and is mostly based on symptoms. \n\nMost importantly, even if you are diagnosed officially with scleroderma, every single person is different.  Even within the different \u201ctypes\u201c of scleroderma, it is nearly impossible to predict what will happen.  There is no defined path of disease progression.  You cannot look at the internet or other patients and assume these things will happen to you.  Also I just saw your initial post.  Keep in mind that Raynaud\u2019s is extremely common in perfectly healthy people. It is estimated that anywhere from 5% to 20% of ALL women have it.  :) Thank you. Do I have pulmonary symptoms? Currently no. BUT... I used to have major lung issues as a kid. I had bad asthma and horrible allergies. I was on steroids (Prednisone) constantly for 5 years because it was the only way to get me better. After 10 years of allergy shots, getting my lungs under control, now regular exercise, I feel like I am mostly fine now.\n\nIt does raise a red flag that maybe I had this when I was a child and was just treating the symptoms the same way. Either way, my lungs are under control and I hardly ever get sick. I will point it out to the Rheum when I see them.  Thank you. I am hoping that I just have mild symptoms and just treating the inflammation will be enough. I definitely have inflammation but not joint swelling. \n\nGood news is I found out there is a Scleroderma Foundation near me so if I need to see a specialist, it is not that far.  I was diagnosed a year ago after six years of symptoms. They did not look any deeper than the antibody test and my symptoms to give the diagnosis. For the last year I have been in the doctor merry-go-round. Liver is 'beautiful.' Kidneys are perfect. I find out about the lungs on Monday and that one has me scared.  \n\n\nI am doing everything that I can for myself and my skin, GI, and vascular symptoms are much improved now. Have not had a Reynaud's flare in months and that used to be a daily problem. Circulation has improved in my feet enough that the podiatrist is willing to risk a surgery, so that is going forward now.  \n\n\nI did lose my gallbladder two years ago and I believe that it was caused by the scleroderma. The pathology report came back that the muscle wall was loaded with histamines and white blood cells, so my body was going after it for no reason that they could discern. I do believe that it is related to all of the GI involvement.  \n\n\nIf the lungs are okay, then I am going to be okay, but I had bronchitis when they did the pulmonary function test and I know that was horrible. We will see what the CT scan says. If that looks good, I will request a second PFT before we jump the gun on the heavy meds. I feel fine right now.  \n\n\nThat is all the experience that I have at this point.   \n\n\nI did find out that mineral oil, paint, stain, etc all trigger a flare. I will get skin ulcers where no skin was touched by anything. As painting furniture was my primary hobby, it is helped a lot to get away from that.   \n\n\nThe glue gun is still safe so far, though. ;-) Eczema is not so much an issue - Scleroderma is VERY specific. For systemic it really only presents on the distal ends of the limbs (hands feet). Above the elbows and knees has nothing to do really with Systemic Scleroderma.   Wow I am not the only hobby induced scleroderma patient! Apoxie sculpted for years, and I also painted what I sculpted. I do not think the paint did as much as the sculpt dust and sanding, but who knows.  Where did you read that paint could cause it?  Oh, I did not read it. I lived it!\n\nI was too busy to 'play' during Nov and December The first chance I got I set up my paint table outside and pulled out a dozen projects that had been simmering on the back burner for months. Had a great day and got a lot done.\n\nWas not feeling so well that night, but nothing alarming. Next morning I woke up with my hands and legs on fire. Full-on scleroderma flare.\n\nI was doing *great* for months until that day. I would already figured out that the mineral oil I was using in my bath to soothe my legs was actually causing my flares. Once I cut that out, it was smooth sailing until paint day. I am still healing from that foolishness. smh Hang on... silica exposure as in construction dust? I work in construction. Mainly in the office but Dec 2017 I did a job walk on a cold, windy, dusty day...and I got very sick. I am also allergic to dust. I had not been that sick in years. I had to get a new &amp; stronger inhaler so I could breathe. \n\nI will bring it up with the doctor.   Yep. Rock quarries, rail road workers, blasting...all sorts of occupational related exposure. I do not know where you are located or your details, but I know that there is at least one firm where I live that specifically lists scleroderma under the FMLA/workers comp type cases, and I bet there is some toxic tort attorneys that probably get into it as well.  That is really fortunate! I have struggled with finding good doctors. Best of luck to you.\n\nAlso wanted to confirm that during my extensive research on scleroderma I found lots of info about how silica exposure causes it in some people. Also some clusters of scleroderma in neighborhoods which likely means an environmental cause. It is a poorly understood disease but if you look into it more you should find info especially regarding silica exposure. Hey just curious what specifically happened with your gallbladder? I have been having issues over the years but have not wanted to take it out. Never thought of it being related to the scleroderma. I am in a situation very similar to yours. Every case is different. Your lungs could be fine. Do not assume the worst. It is my understanding that they cannot really predict disease progression based on blood tests. I have read that about 1/6 of patients have progressive lung disease and the treatment is somewhat effective at stabilizing the disease. There are anti fibrosis drugs on the way that will likely improve mortality. Do you have other symptoms like tight skin on your fingers or acid reflux?  No tight skin. Just eczema is some areas which is probably just an allergic reaction to something I am eating. \n\nAcid reflux yes. But my symptoms are more like gut bloat and swelling at the base of my ribs than actual reflux. It also runs in the family so this did not raise a huge red flag at first.  The GI issues sound like a symptom of the disease. I have mild skin issues. I might not have noticed if i did not know what to look for. The doctor is going to pinch the skin on your fingers to see how tight it is. There is a point system that the rheumatologists use to make a diagnosis. Each symptom is worth x number of points and they add them all up and if you have enough points they make the diagnosis. You might want to look that up before your appointment. Skin tightening is an important symptom, its worth a bunch of points. Be skeptical about any mortality statistics you read, they might not be relevant any longer. They are have been advancements in treatment of the disease.  \n\nThis video might help:\n The doctor was quite baffled. Had not seen anything quite like it.\n\nMy HIDA scan had a refraction rate of zero. The surgeon expected to go in and see a dead organ. What she found was a beautiful-looking gallbladder. Because it was not functioning, she went ahead and took it out. When the pathology report came back it said that it looked normal, but under a microscope the entire muscle wall was full of histamines and white blood cells. All of it. She said it was under attack and it was so bad that the muscle could not function anymore.\n\nIt makes sense to me. Scleroderma is autoimmune and I have heavy GI involvement from my lips out the other end. Why would the gallbladder be immune from attack? It is part of the GI system.\n\nIf your HIDA scan is abnormal, you might want to think about it.\n\nHaving it out has not slowed me down at all. I am eating a high-fat diet and it does not bother me not having a gallbladder. I am glad it is out.  I received my diagnosis over 20 years ago, when I was in my 20s.  It is really important to remember that your health is not your diagnosis alone, and that there is a very large spectrum of symptoms that people experience.  I have read a lot about scleroderma, but every time I read, I think this is a possibility in the disease and not my fate.  My symptoms are definitely present, all the time, but on average, and through the years they have not been debilitating.   Getting the care of a rheumatoligist has been a great help.  I am glad for you  that you overall feel okay - that is a really good sign, so I have been told over the years.  By the way, if you have reflux - definitely treat it with prescription drugs and changes in your eating habits if you can.  Reflux acid in the mouth is very damaging to teeth.  Unfortunately I learned that the hard way when I decided to try living-without-medication for a while.    Thanks for the response!! Did you experience pain? I get random pains during the day that are not severe by any means but it is daily.\n\nI have not had a HIDA Scan, I have had a gallstone for a few years now.\n\nGood to know it has not changed your life at all. I have heard a lot of nightmare stories about gallbladder removal so it has made me hesitant to get mine out!\n\nI will ask my doctor about doing a HIDA Scan. What were your specific symptoms? Not really. As you said, a twinge every once in awhile, but not that knock-you-to-the-floor gallstone pain. In the last few months, there was not even that. I felt fine. I think the nerves were dead by that point. I had all of the other gallbladder symptoms, but that is pretty generalized and it hard to differentiate between gallbladder and all my other issues. Things did improve to a point once it was out, so it was causing significant issues, but it was not a cure-all. I still have scleroderma.\n\nAfter that was out, removing all fiber from my diet made another huge improvement. I was inspired to try that when I came across a study clearly saying that high-fiber diets are not recommended for scleroderma patients. That they can even be fatal. As my dr had me eating exactly that and I felt like it was killing me, it was pretty easy to give it a go. I messed the last sentence.\n\n- chronic nausea\n- some vomiting\n- diarrhea that made no damn sense. typically worse in the mornings\n- bloating\n- a few times a month I would have oily/fatty stools\n- sometimes black stools like tar. very sticky\n- sometimes I would feel sick after eating a fatty meal. it was not always clear and sometimes I would get away with it. but sometimes there was a no-doubt, direct, \"I should not have freaking eaten that oh lord help me,\" reaction that could not be denied.\n\nI had mine out exactly two years ago this month and it took a long time to adapt to eating fat without a gallbladder, but I did. I do not take bile salts or anything like that. The first six months the nausea got better and that is about it. There was gradual improvement from there, but I would say it was a full year and a half before I was really, really fine. \n\nOf course that is when I also cut out the stupid fiber. Again, symptoms get tangled with all the different things going wrong. All I can say for sure is that by removing my gallbladder and eliminating fiber and dairy, my IBS symptoms went away completely. The gallbladder helped, but the dietary changes cinched it.\n\nNow that I am losing weight, I do have that occasional twinge and I think that my body is trying to clear the excess cholesterol from dumping all the fat off my hips. There may be small stones forming in the duct that take a second to pass. So far nothing terrible has happened, but I am wary about the potential problem. The only real option to stop it is to stop losing weight and that is not happening just yet.\n\nIf you have more questions, reach out any time. I am doing really well right now and it is taken a LOT of trial and error to get these improvements. I had the awful gi symptoms you have and started taking a medical grade probiotic and it is really helped. It is called visbiome if you are interested, but it is rather pricey at $86/mo (cheaper if you buy two at a time) but there may be something equivalent for not quite so much $. I am just scared to switch to something lesser now that I have gotten good results on this one. The typical drugstore varieties will not cut it for this, but there is probably something in between those two spectrums. Hey man,\n\nI am sorry to hear that!  My father had systemic Scleroderma for 4 years until it took him on the 23rd of January.  Ultimately he had developed pneumonia which was the final thing he could not fight off.  We tried a lot of things with him but unfortunately there is not many things you can do.  But PLEASE look into stem cell research, we were going to a doctor in Boston.  His name was Dr. Trojanowski.  Also we took my father to Northwestern Memorial in Chicago.  All I can tell you is that I am praying for you and that Stem Cell has been somewhat proven to help fight off this terrible disease!  I wish you all the luck in the world! What markers where in your blood? Did you have other signs than just positive ana and scl-70?

I am not seeing the doctor to talk about the results until tomorrow but I am noticing I am having a lot of anxiety about it now because I truly do not know anything about it. Can someone help explain? This sub is amazing but it looks as if people have different symptoms. Mine are just that I am super itchy all over my body (have been for 2 years and not knowing what it was), I do have rosacea or eczema on my face which I am not so sure is related to the scleroderma but I would love to find out. I do not see any swelling or anything and on my hands or feet. Sometimes my right knee gives me a lot of pain when I sit on my feet. And I do run out of breath easily but I do not pay attention to that. Also, I am female and 28. Please help! There is a very high rate of false positives on that test,so I would try not to worry too much. I had a very high positive (over the top of the range of the Mayo clinic test)and it turned out to be a false positive. See a rheumatologist perhaps, but it sounds like you do not have the clinical symptoms of scleroderma, so it is probably a false positive. Well that helped ease my anxiety today. Wow thank you so much. I am hoping it is one. Will know more tomorrow but could be a good idea to get another test done. Adding another false positive to the pile. Rheumatologist did not want to order the full scleroderma panel, but eventually caved to the studies I pulled up on false positives. I have some assorted autoimmune symptoms but nothing scleroderma specific. Came back all negative. Oh wow. Okay this is also good to know. Sorry about all the worries on your end! Hopefully good news for me tomorrow at least. Best of luck - will keep you in my thoughts and send you some positive vibes. If you got a positive ANA it is still possible you have something else (as is my case, probably RA), but the standard scl-70 test is not that great. The full panel is a bit more accurate, but even that can have false positives. Why was the test done? Do you have Raynauds? \n\n  Scl-70 can have a really high false positive rate. ( The test was done because I have been having really bad skin problems for the past two years. Mainly on my face which looks like rosacea or eczema. My face can get super red and itchy. I then also can get rashes all over my body which I cannot see sometimes. But I get super itchy around my legs and arms. Doctors cannot seem to figure it out. The other day I finally had a rheumatologist just say, \"listen, scleroderma is just a label and honestly we do not know that much about autoimmune diseases. You have something, it has scleroderma-like qualities, but I cannot label it.\" And it gave me so much relief because I have been chasing down the diagnosis for so many years. I do not think it works like cancer most of the time, like, \"you have x, it will cause these symptoms and appear here, with this survival rate.\" I think autoimmune diseases are a whole continuum of various symptoms that are hard to pin down. So maybe try to think of it that way. It could be little signs of lupus, some from scleroderma, a grab bag of symptoms. I have met a lot of people with stuff like that. Autoimmune diseases run strong in my family and everyone has some weird thing that is autoimmune or comes up positive on a test that sometimes has effects, sometimes does not.", "GERD issues Does anyone else get really awful GERD/bloated feeling from water? I have to look up PH levels and avoid acidic water brands because water can make me feel awful! My GERD is so awful sometimes. \n\nAny tips to help with it? I am vegan/GF, avoid acidic foods, take famotidine periodically, sleep elevated and only on my on left side and still have issues. It might help to take famotidine more frequently. I was confused by your post because my GERD seems way better than yours, but then I thought about it and realized I am on 80mg of Esomeprazole daily!\n\nMore drugs is I think the only real advice I have for you, which I know is kind of useless advice. \n\nAside from the drugs I only eat once a day as early in the day as I can. Being empty most of the time has seemed to help calm and stabilize my entire disgestive tract. Also eating early in the day means that I do not have any food in my stomach when I lay down to sleep so there is not any excess acid going up my throat. With all of this I have been doing well enough that I am thinking about weaning down to 40mg of Esomeprazole daily.\n\nAlso you almost certainly already know this, but just in case, never eat spicy food, fried food, caffeine, chocolate, and alcohol (I think there is a 6th I always forget). Even a little bit of any of the above can destabilize your digestive tract for a long time. I am only able to permanently give up alcohol, the rest of them I still have as occasional treats which is probably why I need so much Esomeprazole. I was having issues with water so tried different brands. I really like Divinia which was suggested by my ENT, it is just so darn expensive. Also under care and observation of my integrative GI I stopped PPI\u2019s and acid blockers because they were causing gut issues-SIBO which is not an ideal environment for autoimmunity. After fixing SIBO the reflux is manageable. I had low stomach acid to begin with and stopping acid production causes the growth of bacteria. Before I tried divinia water I purchased those acidity strips to test the water I was drinking. Remember you have to sip it slow and drink small amounts at a time. How did you address/fix the SIBO?? Prescription- xifaxan I ended up taking Omeprazole daily and it has helped amazingly.  It was worth taking because it is helping my esophagus heal. I did not realize that my GERD was tearing it up so much.  Think of Omeprazole as a way to protect your esophagus to help lessen future issues.", "What not to eat? What should you cut out of your diet in order to both ease or prevent the symptoms of scleroderma, in any of its forms? For example I read here that you should cut out coffee, is this true? Why? \n\nThanks! I did an elimination diet and discovered that it was wheat that was causing me the most heartburn. I still get heartburn, but it is much less if I stay off wheat. I did cut caffeine down, but still drink lattes every once in awhile. I think it is pretty personal with this disease what effects people differently.  My dietary goals focus around increasing my Omega 3s and decreasing my Omega 6s. Omega 3s help reduce inflammation. Omega 6s are found in a lot of instant and packaged foods and in fast foods. They can increase inflammation if you get too much. Any many people get too much. I was also told to increase the amount of fruit in my diet for my chronic severe diarrhea. The pectin in the fruit significantly reduces diarrhea. So I started drinking smoothies and they have helped a lot.\n\nI use a lot of fresh ginger in my diet for nausea/upset stomach. I try to make sure my grains are whole grain. I try to eat fruits and veggies of all different colors, especially dark leafy greens. I try to learn as much as I can about my foods and be thoughtful about them when buying and preparing them. \n\nI have to keep coffee in my diet because it is the only thing that treats my migraines. I cannot take any NSAIDs. Coffee has started upsetting my stomach so I started making my own homemade mocha frappes in the morning. \n\nIf I keep these in mind and cook at home with a variety of foods it drastically increases my energy and reduces my pain. \n\nI do not take herbal supplements due to seizures and I do not take any supplement unless my doctor tells me to.  Stimulants like coffee, smokes and alcohol are said to be bad. I am trying to cut out alcohol and have quit smoking and have given up caffeine. Not sure if it helps, there is no way to know but worth it anyways.\n\nI eat super healthy (whole foods, nothing processed) and again, do not know if it helps but I started FODMAPS diet to figure out what my IBS triggers were and ended up finding out I can eat few foods without symptoms. Not sure if it effects my Sclero but damn did it help my IBS! It probably depends on the type you have, but there is definitely no diet that can prevent it. One good thing to keep in mind is that since this is an autoimmune disease, foods that boost the immune system should be consumed with care. Overdoing them could cause symptoms to progress faster.

I dress in layers, drink decaf drinks(caffeine can constrict blood vessels and make raynauds worse), and always have a blanket to toss over me if I start to get cold.  For leaving the house, my husband got me a battery operated heated jacket for Christmas which is a game changer.  We also bought a new car two years ago that has heated seats, steering wheel and remote start.

The doctor ordered a blood test and my wife tested positive on the ANA screening. My wife was referred to a specialist and saw a rheumatologists for further testing. \n\nThis morning, my wife received a call from her rheumatologists and they said she tested positive for CREST syndrome. The doctor plans to do more testing beyond blood work next week. My wife does not seem to show many physical symptoms (beyond the joints of her hands hurting occasionally). I have researched quite a bit to better educate myself but I am honestly scared, shocked, and concerned at the moment. I do not want to share this concern with my wife as I am trying to stay positive and support her. \n\nWhat do you all recommend we/I do from here? I know the answer is to wait for further testing and not worry too much but...but that is difficult to do right now. I would love to chat with anyone who has experiences with CREST syndrome in their 20s or hear general advice based on this news from her doctor. \n\nThanks,\n\nZach (skyline8428) Hi Zach. I am sorry to hear that you and your wife are going through this. You are not wrong that there is some scary information out there on CREST/scleroderma. What I have learned is that much of the information on the internet is not really up to date with current treatment and prognosis seen in recent years.\n\nYour wife is very early in the diagnosis process, and I have learned from my scleroderma specialist that not everyone who has the antibodies for scleroderma develop the full illness. So, as best as you can, try not to get caught up in the frightening information on the internet.\n\nThey diagnose scleroderma off of a criterion measure that includes both antibodies and active symptoms. They have a point system where different symptoms are assigned various point values, and only once a specific threshold is reached do they consider scleroderma an active diagnosis.\n\nI have also been told that the antibody testing has a fairly high false positive rate. I would recommend they repeat the antibody testing through a different lab to confirm it. My doctor had me test antibodies 3x in the beginning because I had antibodies and a few symptoms, but not enough symptoms for the full diagnosis at that point.\n\nWhat I would recommend at this point is for you and your wife to look into the AIP diet, which is a method to test food sensitivities and clear out her diet of any foods that are increasing inflammation. Even if it is not scleroderma, the fact that she has positive ANA means she has something going on with autoimmune, so AIP will help her identify foods that are causing symptom flares. Also, get her turmeric capsules to take, as it helps reduce inflammation in the body.\n\nOther early symptoms seen in scleroderma are GI symptoms (e.g., acid reflux), so that will be something to watch for.\n\nIt does not hurt to get a second opinion. When I first got my test results back, I reached out to my nearest scleroderma specialist to see if they would review my medical information and schedule a consult. They were phenomenal in providing information and educating me on what to look for. I highly recommend connecting to one if symptoms progress. Most doctors do not know the nuances in treating scleroderma because it is rare, so an expert is really the best way to move forward if she does develop CREST.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nETA: Also, this subreddit is not the most active. I know most young people are moving away from facebook (I deactivated mine again a few months ago), but there are a couple facebook groups for scleroderma that are HIGHLY active-- over 100k members with tons of posts daily. If you are open to using FB, I would recommend hopping into those groups, even if just briefly to get some information and advice. I spent a couple months on their initially to connect with others and get information. They are very information and supportive. \n\nThere is also a peer support group through the scleroderma foundation if your wife would be interested in connect with others with the illness. It can be an isolating experience having an \"invisible\" illness that is also very rare and not very well understood. I was not diagnosed with CREST until my 30s, but I first started having symptoms in my 20s. It was very scary at first when my hards would start to turn blue or when my joints would hurt really bad. I also used turmeric for a while and changed my diet. Unfortunately, neither of those helped. What has helped me is Plaquenil and Gabapentin. Gabapentin has done wonders for my fibromyalgia as well. Just tell your wife to hang on as diet changes and/or medications may help to relieve her symptoms. I wish you both the best! 26F and this sounds similar to my situation. I started having general autoimmune symptoms (mostly joint stiffness+ inflammation, raynauds, etc) and blood tests confirmed positive ANA. I believe I was 22 at the time. It was... very scary at the beginning. My rheumatologist did not have a great bedside manner and showed me a bunch of pictures of highly developed scleroderma patients and basically told me to \"Google it\" to find out the rest. But since then I have been doing regular screening, blood tests and checkups and the the scleroderma has not developed any further. I am diagnosed Mixed Connective Tissue Disease and also Fibromyalgia, but do not have an official scleroderma diagnosis and may never have one (fingers crossed). Unfortunately it is a waiting game, and it really sucks and it is scary. Right now I am also 20 weeks pregnant and they are monitoring me VERY closely for potential issues, but so far all good.\n\nI am not sure if I have any advice, but all this to say it seems common to test positive and not have a diagnosis for a long time, or ever. You are probably both scared but you are not alone in this. It is been surprisingly manageable for me so far. My best recommendation is to try to see a therapist or counselor. It is hard living with a looming diagnosis like that. I can usually forget about it and feel normal for a while but then fear will hit me all at once and can be overwhelming. I found a counselor who specializes in chronic pain counselling and it has been a game changer for me. Would highly recommend. I have CREST and was diagnosed with Scleroderma in 2019. I am young as well. All of these changes happened fairly quickly and learning to live with them takes an emotional toll, so being supportive this way is a big help.\n\nI made the mistake of playing Google Fu the week I was diagnosed to get educated on it. It scared the shit out of me because the information was not specific to my manifestation of the disease and it painted a grim picture. It was traumatic.\n\nSuggestions---\n\nThis disease invokes many questions. Type them all out and bring them to the appointments. This way, she will not forget to ask and a copy can be given to the doctor for his/her own patient record. It helps organize and track what is going down. \n\nI notice a lot of people come to this sub asking if they have CREST / Scleroderma / Morphea etc based on a million things. While I think it helps to connect with the community, I would not treat it as medical advice because it may mislead. \n\nFor me, I am on a cocktail \ud83c\udf78of pills that have made a world of difference. I hope her doctors work and find a solution that suits her condition.\n\nPlease reach out. Do not panic! Live your lives and enjoy every moment, and breathe. Hopefully, your wife figures out a way to get the painful joints to improve (or the pain just subsides on its own and never comes back -- would not be surprising at all). \n\nI was diagnosed with CREST about 20 years ago. At the time, the Doctor said it was benign CREST. Not sure what he meant -- he did not have my esophagus and I have never heard anyone else mention \"benign CREST\" -- but he was not wrong. I have bad esophageal issues but they have improved over the years. Also, after being on Low FODMAP diet for the last 2 years (for IBS-D), my ANA is lower. It is true that CREST can be devastating for some people. But I am not sure how many people. Five years ago, most doctors did not even know what it was. Now, there may be more doctors running ANA tests and finding CREST, idk. I probably will not live to be 90 like my parents, but 80 is a pretty good possibility (and do not get me wrong, I am shooting for 100 with all my faculties intact, dammit!).\n\nOne time, my joints swelled horribly. I could not walk up the stairs. Luckily, I considered the possibility that it was allergy related. Taking Claritin for 3 days cured it. Now ten years later, I realize that we all go through periods where we have weird health issues. Mine has a name -- and now so does your wife's -- but everyone has these weird things. I have come to look at it as part of the human experience. My ex had horrible back issues and eczema. CREST is easy in comparison. \n\nThe silver lining to CREST is that doctors pay a LOT of attention. I get every possible test known to mankind (or so it seems), and my doctors are really interested in me. I get referrals to specialists with no problem.", "I have limited systemic scleroderma.

Ok I am so glad I finally used Reddit to get some true advice lol", "Scleroderma Groups Launch Scholarly Journal with SSc and Related Disease Focus ", "Sharing something my deceased father wrote about his battle with SSc. Scleroderma\n\nBy Dr. Ronnie M Warner, M.D.\n\n\nI am a doctor who knows a thing or two about scleroderma because it chose me.\n\n\nThere is an old joke that medical students tend to think they have every disease in the pathology book. That is not true. My take was often \u201cWell, I do not want that,\u201d or \u201cI really do not want that.\u201d\n\n\nScleroderma was interesting but uncommon, and we did not spend much time on it. It was not one of \u201cthe biggies.\u201d During my 42-year practice, I have seen only a handful of patients with the disease. That probably has something to do with my choice of radiology. We see a few scleroderma patients with problems throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The subspecialty of interventional radiology developed over the course of my career and became a large part of what I did every day. Of the connective tissue diseases, I saw much more lupus. It was particularly heartbreaking to see a woman in her twenties with kidney failure and sepsis. We place many dialysis catheters, ports, and other central lines as the last resort for folks who have \u201cworn out all their veins,\u201d and once more in need of access. Fortunately, most of them rebounded time and again.\n\n\nI was rather rudely introduced to scleroderma. During a procedure in 2010, my right index finger went to sleep. We all know the pins-and-needles feeling, but this one would not go away. I popped off the glove and discovered that the finger was white, completely devoid of blood from the first knuckle to the tip. This phenomenon, known as Raynaud\u2019s, is common in young women and almost always an aggravation rather than a foreboding sign, but it should not present in a middle-aged man. Over the course of the next week, I experienced the same thing in various fingers of both hands.\n\n\nSecondary Raynaud\u2019s is commonly the presenting sign for the connective tissue disease known as systemic sclerosis, or scleroderma.  Bloodwork from the rheumatology doctor confirmed a very high antinuclear antibody with a pure nucleolar pattern diagnostic of the disease.\n\n\nIt is all been downhill from there. All the major organs are involved except for my brain. That is fortunate, since I was not born with much reserve up there. \n\n\nAt first was the dance of pale and temporarily dead fingers. I would stop what I was doing, go to the nearest sink and run warm water over my hands for several minutes. The fingers would go through the cycle from white to a deep purple to a bright, hyperemic red, and back to normal. This usually was over just a few minutes, and was merely a nuisance. Staff understood, and supported me. I rarely let anything stop the course of an interventional case, as I retained motor memory and was not in pain.\n\n\nThe real problem started when my intestinal tract became involved. For much of the past decade, I have had intermittent bouts of  small bowel obstruction, with a building over several hours of bloating, pain in the lower abdomen, and often the sudden onset of protracted vomiting. Inevitably, the final flourish is with a round of diarrhea. I have had as many as twenty bowel movements in the course of twenty-four hours, and reconstitution of fluids has occasionally required intravenous infusions. Most of the time, I have been able to keep up with a special powder containing electrolytes.\n\n\nMy bowel problems largely arise from SIBO, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Normal people have sterile small intestines. All the microbes of digestion live in our colons, and there is a one-way valve separating the small intestine from it.\n\n\nIn scleroderma, there is altered motility as a result of muscle damage in the lower part of the small intestine called the ileum, and material cannot pass through fast enough. This stagnation allows bacteria to set up housekeeping where they are usually not allowed. These bacteria love to eat complex carbohydrates we usually cannot and pass as \u201croughage.\u201d So greens and such that are good for you are bad for me. A side product of this foreign digestion is large-volume hydrogen, which bloats and obstructs bowel loops until usually blowing out prodigiously.\n\n\nScleroderma also involves the upper intestinal tract. Reflux is often a very severe complication, and it can eventually destroy motility in the esophagus. I had severe reflux, known as GERD, in the early years, but this problem has largely burned itself out.\n\n\nMy diarrhea is different now, generally waxing in waning in indeterminate cycles. It is manageable thus far.\n\n\nIn 2014, I developed adhesive capsulitis in my left shoulder. It happened on the right side two years later. Each time, it took over a year to essentially disappear. These were the most painful times of my life, as I could only find sleep in a recliner. Collectively, I slept in that chair for over three years.\n\n\nI was reading CT scans in my office at Bartlett at the end of an average day when the world started spinning and I was seeing two of everything. Dictation became garbled, and I told Dr. Roberts that I was heading to the ED.\n\n\nMy blood pressure was 230/180. I had never been hypertensive before. My EKG demonstrated a Wenkebach phenomenon that deteriorated to a complete heart block. The large electric cord connecting my atria and my ventricles had suddenly been cut. I was in renal crisis and at the same time in third-degree block.\n\n\nMy blood pressure was controlled by medications, but my heart rate remained 38 for two days before the EP cardiologist placed a biventricular pacemaker. I improved dramatically overnight, and was discharged the next day.\n\n\nThe next two years consisted of bouts of intestinal involvement and not much else, until I started experiencing particularly severe pain and cramping. I got an xray and saw free air within my abdomen. My intestine had perforated! A quick CT scan confirmed the gas outside the bowel, but did not demonstate the location of the hole.\n\n\nI called my gastroenterologist and my surgeon, and drove over to the big hospital to meet them. Oddly, I did not have symptoms and signs of peritonitis despite the leak, so I was admitted with IV fluids and multiple antibiotics. Throughout the night, I downloaded and intensely read a number of medical articles.\n\n\nThe next morning, I showed my doctors three published cases of spontaneous small intestinal perforation in association with scleroderma. The assumption was a micropuncture in the wall, and surgery was contraindicated unless peritonitis and sepsis had set in. They had not, and we rode it out. I had dodged another crisis.\n\n\nAll was well other than what I cannot describe better than to say I was slowly and steadily deteriorating everywhere. It was all I could do to get through a work day, and this was coming at a time when all of us were having to work harder and faster than ever. Retirement had been planned, and did not arrive too quickly.\n\n\nWithin a couple of months, I developed a chronic cough that steadily worsened, and went to our imaging center down in Southaven for a CT. Lung involvement by scleroderma is the feared and usually fatal complication of scleroderma, and I clearly had interstitial lung disease. Inflammation was clearly present in a bit over 20% of my lungs, and would be irreversible if allowed to become progressive scar.\n\n\nI immediately knew what must be done, having read virtually everything about the complications of this disease and experiencing several of the most severe. Up until now, the treatments were purely symptomatic: take care of each problem in its own context, since there was no known preventative.\n\n\nBut with lung involvement (ILD), I was firmly within protocol for aggressive treatment, and headed up for a full rheumatological and cardiologic consultation at the University of Pittsburgh. They are world-renowned, and have full-time faculty devoted to this somewhat rare disease.\n\n\nWe headed into chemotherapy, with a six-month course of intravenous cyclophosphamide. My hair fell out, I felt like shit a lot, and I atrophied severely down to 127 pounds, but the cough disappeared and I could breathe!\n\n\nEight days after the fourth treatment, I experienced almost forty-eight hours of nonstop diarrhea, followed by the sudden onset of severe shortness of breath, known as dyspnea. I could not walk across the room without losing my breath. It was all I could do to muster up a call to my pulmonologist. \n\n\nA trip to the ED resulted in a three-day admission for an acute exacerbation, with oxygen, breathing treatments, high-dose steroids, and multiple antibiotics. I recovered uneventfully, and the assumption was that I had contracted a virus that ordinarily would have been subclinical took me down.\n\n\nI am off chemotherapy now and am taking CellCept, an immune suppressive drug commonly given to heart transplant patients. The lung involvement has actually improved, and it is time for optimism. \n\n\nThe other thing that has me really excited is that there is now a drug approved and specifically on-label for retarding the advancement of lung disease in scleroderma. This is the first time in history such a drug has achieved that degree of confirmation, and I will likely end up on it soon.\n\n\nAll of this is not intended to depress or evoke sympathy. Hey, it is not metastatic cancer or a rapidly-advancing neurodegenerative disorder. There is always someone with worse luck than you. The fact is that we all die. There will be a fatal condition. Most of us just do not know what it is going to be. Unless another type of train runs over me, this is mine. Despite a whole host of complications, I am still here ten years into the disease. This a long haul. Immunological discoveries confirm that it is treatable. And I am motivated to learn and be a good patient.\n\n\nThis is me, right now.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nAddendum: Dad passed away about 9 months after he wrote this; he went into cardiac arrest at home following a 2-month stay in the hospital. The Cellcept and steroids kept his lungs from getting worse- they even improved- but the scleroderma weakened his heart muscle. \n\n\nIf anyone out there is struggling with a loved one\u2019s diagnosis, feel free to reach out to me. You are not alone. Sobering but I so appreciate his matter of fact approach and sense of humor. This disease is a bitch and very few doctors know what it is much less what to do with it. Thank you. My dad had a great sense of humor, even when he was hurting. It really is amazing how rare this disease is, and how few doctors specialize in it. My dad had to advocate for himself quite a bit. \n\nAnd it was SO hard to get all his doctor teams on the same page! He was taking so many medicines, so many organ systems were failing. Trying to prop up one organ at the expense of others. The liver medicine would be vetoed by the cardiologist, the oncologist would debate with the pulmonologist. The rheumatologist and hospitalist trying to keep the whole orchestra in tune. It is just so complicated. Sadly, I am all too familiar with that. The hardest step was getting someone to admit it was not all in my head. Getting doctors to see me as a whole person not a part has been the newest hurdle. The fact that your dad was a medical professional and had struggles just shows that there is a massive problem. Again, thank you for sharing. Thank you for sharing this in such detail. My sister is managing her scleroderma and it is hard to watch. She is young to have it, she is 31. Thank you for sharing his story, I am so sorry for your loss. 31 is so young. It IS hard to watch a loved one suffer. I hope your sister is doing well. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f Final year medical student suffering from scleroderma here, sounds like your dad's story is about to happen again:(\n\nI am so sorry for your lost! Thank you for sharing. I know of persons who fought scleroderma for decades including my own mother and their passings were at minimum testaments of strength, endurance, love, and courage. Their lives and experiences provided sound lessons for all of us to make adjustments in our own lives, and to also grow in strength. Most sincere condolences. I am two years-plus or so into treatment. I can certainly relate. I would like to give a shout-out to the dedicated professionals at Keck/USC Medical Center. I thank you for sharing, I have had scleroderma since a child. I really do not believe most people are aware of the multiple problems this disease\nCreates. Including physical features that can become destroyed. You do not look or feel like yourself. Indeed a difficult disease to treat and understand. I am really sorry for your loss. Your dad was a great writer. Dealing with my own diagnosis has been really difficult for me lately and reading words like this from someone who understands is a big help. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f My mom has scleroderma. It started with a hard shiny patch on her temple that was incredibly painful. Today she told me she thinks it has spread to her pointer finger and thumb joints. She also described a persisting cough and being short of breath. I am terrified and trying to learn all I can to help her.", "I saw this and thought the people on this sub would totally understand.  OK, I can totally relate. I get a majorly itchy back and scalp, but I never thought it could be scleroderma. Can this happen without obvious skin thickening? I get an itchy rash on my back/scalp at times, but I do not have skin thickening (yet). Well, because my skin is thick, it reduces my mobility so I cannot reach my back to scratch it (even with a normal back scratcher). I would think if you had an autoimmune disease you would have more symptoms than just itchy dry skin. If you suspect you might have scleroderma, it would be worth a conversation with your rheumatologist. If your scalp and back itch a lot, I would first examine your skincare and hair care routine to see if any products you are using are drying out and/or irritating your skin. I have several issues, currently mostly well managed; mast cell activation syndrome, microscopic colitis, GERD, SIBO, raynaud's, gluten intolerance (possibly celiac, but this one's not officially diagnosed). Recently I had high ANA (1:640) and SCL-70 (\"&gt;8.0, reference range &lt;1.0\"). I do not have any skin thickening, but some of the other issues fit, including the GERD and constantly cold hands. I am seeing a scleroderma specialist at the end of the month.\n\nI think you are right, for me I am fairly sure the itchy rash comes from when I have gluten. I was just curious if that could be scleroderma or systemic sclerosis since I am still trying to figure out whether it fits me and which symptoms it explains. I have been waiting for over two months already to see the specialist, and I am impatient and so have been doing a lot of my own research :)", "Botox and fillers Hi everyone! I am searching for studies about botox and fillers on person wth scleroderma. I wonder do you know anything about it? After my research maybe I can consider to use lip filler with my own fat cause there is lost of volume on my lips.", "Has anyone here been on mycophenolate? I just started taking mycophenolate a month ago to try to improve some of my skin issues. Curious if anyone else here has tried this, and if so, did it help and how long did it take before you saw improvements? Mycophenolate is the generic of Cellcept, so you can search by this name as well. I am taking it since three months now. Too soon to see any improvement. My nephrologist says that it is common to see improvements and sometimes even disapearance of the skin issues after some tens of months.\n\nWe are here for the long run... Thank you! I had a feeling it could take a while :/ My dad has been taking Cellcept for the past 5ish months, after he finished chemo. His is for SSc-ILD and his lungs are looking \u201cremarkable\u201d according to his last scan :) Everyone is different, but it is a ray of hope. ( on Cellcept with LSc. Thank you for sharing your dad\u2019s experience with it! Hi, I take it mostly to support my lung involvement, and I have not noticed an improvement in the skin. I have been on it for over 4 years and take 3 a day. Sorry not sure what dose. I can say since taking it and also methotrexate my condition has been stable and not progressed at all. I have been on it for close to 2.5 years. I will think I have plateaued on my progress, but about every six months I look back and realize my skin has improved. It is a very long burn. I took it for a year.  I did not see results and had some side effects (digestive issues, constantly sick with viral illnesses).  My doc and I agreed that it was not the right med for my symptoms and I have been off of it for a year.  I have lssc.  I do not have much skin involvement, more vascular tissue is affected.", "My dads toe..... ", "My sister is getting a skin biopsy tomorrow to confirm that she has scleroderma. I have a few questions and I want to know how to best support her. Any advice would be so helpful. She has been sick for a while now and been going to doctors for years trying to get a diagnosis.\nHer biopsy is in the bend of her leg, behind her knee. \nIf the biopsy comes back positive, what happens next to see if it is localized or has affected any organs?\nHer girlfriend (care taker) came to me last night saying if it is positive it is a death sentence which was very frustrating for me. \nI also have chronic illness and searching for a diagnosis and we both live together. How can I best support her and make her feel like there is hope?\nAnd is it true that as she is now, with scleroderma, she is only going to continue to get worse and more sick? \nThank you for any help at all. 1.  Scleroderma is not a death sentence. I was diagnosed with scleroderma 28 years ago when I was 33. Now I am 61. And I worked full time for the majority of those years. But that may not be your sister\u2019s experience. \n\n2.  Do not trust everything you hear or read on the internet. Go to a reliable source. Www.scleroderma.org. Look under patient resources and order a package of new patient information for her and for you. It is free. \n\n3. There are many forms of scleroderma and it effects everyone differently. Other people experience will probably not be the same as your sisters experience. \n\n4.  Just listen when you sister wants to talk about it, but also inform yourself so you can have fact-based conversations, not weird stuff you hear on others experience or on u reliable internet sites. It effects everyone a little differently. \n\n5.  When you read about scleroderma, many of the effects of scleroderma may never happen to your sister. For example, some people with scleroderma have lung, heart or kidney issues. I have never had any of these. \n\n6.  Please stick to reliable sources for your information. \nUS: Www.scleroderma.org\nCanada: \nAlso us: \n\n7.  Become a member of Scleroderma Foundation for $25 per year to get up to date emails, information about the disease, and support groups. \n\nYou sound like a caring sister. Straighten our her caregiver and do not let her scare your sister with wild predictions of what will happen to her. She needs to see a rheumatologist to determine if it is just skin or systemic. With it being behind her knee it sounds like localized and NOT systemic though since that is typically involving the fingers/toes/mouth area first Yeah, totally not a death sentence. More like a Sword of Damocles. You always wonder when it is going to drop, but it might not.\n\nI have got the CREST variant so the biggest deal for me is Raynauds and the resulting digital ulcers. Followed quickly by the acid reflux, which has made staying in shape extremely difficult. The calcinosises are a pain, too, but once they break surface they are much less annoying.\n\nAfter those is the fatigue and malaise. Just feeling tired and crappy all the time is tough.\n\nOccasionally my GFR will tank like my kidneys are shutting down and everyone, myself included, will freak out. Then, next thing you know, the numbers are back up to very good.\n\nThe biggest quality of life item is those zippo hand warmers, by far, but just having people around who understand, even a little, is helpful. Hello, diffuse systemic male here.  Number one thing I would do is find a specialist.  You can find them on the Scleroderma.org website.  Finding a rheumatologist that specialized in Scleroderma was a game changer for me.  Secondly I would start on the AIP diet.  I figured out real quick that I had a gluten intolerance, a dairy intolerance, cannot eat plants in the nightshade family, and cannot eat nuts.  Once I started my course of treatment with immunosuppressant drugs and removed a lot of the inflammatory inducing foods from my diet I started feeling a lot better.  I started yoga and meditating on a regular basis aswell.  Do the research on your own.  Depending on where you live many doctors you see may have never seen a case os scleroderma.  As was the case with my first rheumatologist.  She was very arroagant.  Lastly avoid the noise. I browse the Facebook groups and this sub periodically but to be honest some of the folks on these forms are insufferable.  They are attitudes and mindset are not where they need to be to beat this chronic illness.  She will have good days and bad days, but carry on, that is important.  No matter how you feel you have to keep going. **I found links in your comment that were not hyperlinked:**\n\n* (\n\n*I did the honors for you.*\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ^( ^| ^&lt;3", "I am afraid I may be positive for this, thoughts? I will try to make this as short as possible, but the way my mind is racing, I doubt it. Sorry for grammar problems, stress will not allow me.\n\nNot seeing a rheumatologist till December 30th, yikes, so yeah I am a bit stressed (bit is an understatement actually)\n\nIn 4 parts, 1.PRIOR CONTEXT 2.CURRENT CONTEXT 3.TIMELINE 4.THOUGHTS\n\n1. PRIOR CONTEXT\n\nEarly 20\u2019s adult male with history of anxiety and gastric/h pylori issues.\n\nI tested negative cpr and stuff but positive ana  1:80 and nucleolar.\n\nH pylori positive 3 years ago. Bad acid reflux. I overused ibuprofen (2500+ mg for an extended period of time, yes I am an idiot, I am aware)\n\nTook antibiotics and was negative. Had on and off heartburn but managed well, based on my diet.\n\nFast forward and I take Aleve this summer for bad leg pain and bam really bad acid reflux. Then it suddenly left.\n\n2. CURRENT CONTEXT\n\nThen in October started melatonin, made me really stressed and panicked like never before. All the stress caused health anxiety which led to me thinking I had blood clots and what not. Took aspirin and had blood in stool. Really bad reflux for like four weeks now but was worst during stressful periods.\n\nI had poor concentration, bad memory, bad anxiety but this has mostly cleared up. I also had indigestion, could not pass gas, thin poops, constipation, gluten would make it worst, despite eating gluten all the time before this. This has not died down.\n\nI also developed joint pain, muscle aches, inflamed tendons in arms, rashes, dry skin, burning skin sensation, raynaud\u2019s in toes and slightly in hands, bone pain, cracky joints with discomfort, achy feet. I can feel and hear a click in my esophagus.\n\nMy skin seems a bit red all over and developed a crazy glue like feeling that burns and hurts. Bad breath and black streak on behind teeth. Feels like every time I go to sleep and wake up I find a new damn symptom. I definitely think some may be anxiety but they all cannot be! \n\nIf I squeeze my joints they do not hurt, but they will hurt on their own and then I squeeze and nothing, feels fine. Diet seems to help but to early to tell. I think fasting for 3 days helped but again too early to tell. \n\n3. TIMELINE of symptoms all 2020\n\n7/26 -went to ER after bad acid reflux from aleve \n8/31 - ER shortness of breath, thought covid but it was common cold. Thing is common cold has never caused such shortness of breathe before. Was given inhaler and steroids. Antibiotics for knee injury from biking.\n9/2 - discharged hone\n9/2 - 10/25 - stayed home for a large amount of time, little to no sunlight exposure because if knee issues\n10/9 - take melatonin\n10/15 - first sleep paralysis (did not know it but set off alarms in my mind)\n10/23 -  had my 3rd sleep paralysis ever\n10/26 - had my 5th sleep paralysis ever, stress and anxiety through the roof, went to ER\n10/28 - pains and needles in feet, shooting pain, but I think all anxiety\n10/29 - always had blurry vision  and dry eyes but this is ridiculous, now sudden onset of double vision and blurriness. Improves after waking up and gets worse throughout the day. Probably made worst by stress but still odd.\n11/1 - ibs-c symptoms begin, crazy neck and upper back pain, think it was stress/anxiety\n11/6 - still stressed, stabbing joint pain in ankle commences\n11/10 - joint pain progresses feeling odd discomfort and occasional pain, feels weak.\n11/13 - restless leg syndrome \n11/15 - mild sleep paralysis nothing like before \n11/17 - restless leg syndrome\n11/18-11/21 - fast\n11/23 - stress decreases and feel better but joint pain still progressing and getting worse \n11/24 - very light sleep paralysis, think its going away\n10/26 - turkey day, ate crazy\n10/29 - joint/bone and muscle pain all over lower legs, feet and wrist and raynaud\u2019s syndrome but mild compared to pictures on google. Still feels cold and looks blue and pale. \n10/30 - got ana result and highly stressed\n\n4. CURRENT THOUGHTS\n\nRight this moment, stress, I feel joint pain, cracking and discomfort. I feel my tendons always pinched. I feel stomach discomfort, acid reflux and bloating. \n\nI probably have some vitamin deficiencies for sure, most likely due to my stomach symptoms.\n\nI am certainly missing some things/symptoms, but I feel stress makes symptoms worst. Could I just be psychosomatic and one those few who test positive (1:80) for ana but has no autoimmune disease? Or is this the start of hell.\n\nIf you made it this far, sending you a virtual hug \ud83e\udd17 Thanks for the hug, positive ANA does not confirm the diagnosis, mine was 1:1260 that is when there is a very strong possibility of scleroderma. Take care of yourself and put yourself on strict scheduled diet. Continue till you feel better, if you do not, you did not follow the diet long enough. If my experience has taught me anything it is that your body might take a long to show symptoms after years of mistreatment(junk and unhealthy food) of it. Treatment takes the same dedication(diets) I was diagnosed in 2019. I suffered from a lot of thoughts and \"mental back and forth\" over my past and current symptoms. The stress of that was really hard. Reading online about Scleroderma made my fears and concerns worse. Apparently, I was marked for death.\n\nWhat really helped with this was going through the motions and doing all the diagnostics / appointments. This took awhile and required a lot of patience on my end. But, listening to what I was told and asking questions was critical to getting answers and feeling mentally better. They are supposed to tie all these symptoms together in order to help you arrive at knowing what is going on.\n\nI was told by my treatment team to get my information from them or local scleroderma associations. While there is value in online information, a lot of it is out of date, sensationalist or just anecdotal. \n\nI was in bad shape. But there are treatments which have reversed much of it and are not unaffordable (where I live anyway). Thank you! Second virtual hug sent \ud83e\udd17 !\n\nQuestion, what should my diet look like? Any examples? May I ask what your ana test was like? If you do not mins of course. Regardless, thank you and wishing you the best! Hey there- best wishes to you too. I do not wish this disease on anyone. But there are treatments and answers.\n\nMy ana, when diagnosed, 2019:\n\n&gt;1:640, speckled pattern, nucleolar pattern, ENA positive, JO-1 &amp; SCL-70 positive. Good times.\n\nMy ANA was tested in 2016 for an unrelated allergy panel. It was 1:320 with zero symptoms. But since there were no symptoms, there was no investigation into that.\n\nSo, the disease was left unchecked since at least 2016. Hey man, I do not know what you are experiencing, as I do not follow this page because I have it, but my sister who is one year younger than I has it and I have seen her battle with it on all counts. I wish you the best and I am here to talk if you would like a friend. Keep fighting man. Wow, so would I have with only 1:80 titre nucleolar pattern? I guess anything is possible at this point.\n\nGood luck though, here to chat  if ever needed! So you both have it? What was your ana titre levels and pattern? \n\nDefinitely just began so I am hoping I can go into remission, but maybe by fixing my gut health I can also make improvements. I do not have it. She does, sorry for the misunderstanding. \n\nI wish you the best. I hope so to, she is more steady these days but has been through a lot last couple of years. Its fine, misunderstandings happen. Thank you and I wish her the best as well as you! I was told that everyone is experience with scleroderma is different and that you could not diagnose based on the titre alone. There is a whole picture to look at including everything you are going through. It could be worth exploring it with your rheumatologist to see what they think. The most important thing is to find answers you need. \n\nBest wishes to you too. Reach out any time too. Thank you! :-) Thank you! I have one last question! What are your symptoms like and what do you think offset it? \n\nI think for me it was melatonin, bad sunburns, poor gut health and toxins in my environment. Probably more things im unaware of\n\nThe reason I think its this specific type is the nucleolar pattern and my symptoms. Originally, it started with Rayneuds. Then, every joint and muscle began to  ache as I experienced myositis. I had rapid weight loss around the same time. I also was showing fibrosis in my lungs which increased the urgency of my case. The last symptoms to emerge were difficulty swallowing, slow gut motility, gerd and sore gastro symptoms. Now I am dealing with speech difficulties. \n\nThe medicines that I am on now have put a stop to most of these symptoms and quieted others down. I still deal with the swallowing troubles,gerd flair ups and speech troubles.\n\nThey are totally at a loss for what offset it. It could have been chemical exposure when I was a kid. Or genetic. Or both. I was told I could have gotten an infection or virus at some point that fucked up my immune system. It is a real mystery. Even more so since I am a male and younger than I should be to have these issues. :) Lord, I do hope you get better and possibly into remission! \n\nI am here to talk and chat whenever you may need to! I will keep you updated with how it goes for me. Truly scary stuff, I am hoping we have a solution moving forward! Thank you, friend. I hope the very same for you as well. Wherever you are, I hope you can get exactly the help you need and feel better soon! :) \n\nI am sure there will be answers for you. My last idea is to never be afraid to advocate for yourself.  If something is not right, push. It helps to document your symptoms and questions ahead of any appointments:)\n\nI would definitely like to know how you are doing in the future. I appreciate the offer to connect and extend the same to you! You will definitely be hearing from me again! \n\nIf you want add my discord,  \n\nAnd funny enough I have a whole notes section dedicated to this! \n\nI one note that have one with my symptoms chronologically \n\nOne with all symptoms with descriptions of how I feel\n\nOne with my history prior to this\n\nOne with my thoughts and assumptions\n\nOne by specialty for the different doctors aside from the main complete one, though I bring the complete one up much more.\n\nOne thing im noticing is one minute my joint, muscle or even heel now hurts and then next thing I can move them with no pain. One day they creak with every movement, other days they creak less. My tendon flares up and then it goes down.\n\nLets keep our head up and strive to make lemonade from lemons! Glad to hear! I will try to figure out the discord thing too. Much appreciated for the invite.\n\nGood to know you are documenting so much! The doctors should appreciate it. Though I found I had to keep things pretty   short for the short appointments that I had. Yah mine are not very short lol. We can always chat here!", "Changes To The Subreddit A little over four years ago, I was invited to become a moderator of this subreddit.

Who knows, with recent advancements in modern medicine and understanding of the underlying issues which cause Scleroderma, we may have one soon. Till that day though, I still have a strong desire to see this community expand further and persons find the help, direction, and assistance needed. \n\nIn light of recent developments however, the moderators have had to institute a few changes which should guide how we engage going forward. \n\n* There are now seven (7) new rules, which govern all posts and comments.

Hi everyone! I recently was tested for auto immune disease because of joint pain and fatigue. I am 37 yr old female.

My mother does not have GI, any pain, fatigue and raynaud\u2019s phenomenon (at least no apparent change in colour). However, she does have some thickened skins and swelling hands, face fingers. I checked online and i wanted to know if it is really true that systemic scleroderma differentiates morphea  by whether impacting the fingers? It also shows that the thickening spread from her hands to her upper arm gradually. Does it confirm diffused systemic Scleroderma.\n\nAnd i also would like to like if it is possible that people with systemic scleroderma does not have organ involvement throughout the course of the disease?\n \nI am really worried. Would be really grateful if you could share you opinion... Thanks in advance... Upper arm skin thickening is usually a sign of diffuse systemic. Limited systemic usually sticks to lower extremities. \n\nWith that said, get her into a scleroderma specialist. There is so much more that can be done now vs. 10 years ago.

I do not think I know enough about morphea to say, I am sorry.  It is certainly possible, but it could just be very early for her. I know with my experience, I had everything else before the skin involvement... but everyone is different.\n\nMore testing would give a better idea. She should also get an echocardiogram and PFT to test organ functioning.

I woke up in November and my index finger was swollen and I thought that is weird but figured it would go down. Shortly before this I got two tiny sores on the tips of two separate fingers. They were so small that I did not really think anything of it except they hurt really bad when I bumped them on something. The swelling eventually went down, but it kind of morphs into something else. It has never been the same I very rarely look at it and thing that is normal. I also have continued to good the little sores on my fingers and I have realized I do have some capillaries that are visible in my nail beds. \nI have had raynauds since I was a teenager and I never thought anything of it. \nI am afraid, I have been trying to get into nursing school for years and I finally got in and then this happened. I got a referral to a rheumatologist but the only one in town that is accepting patients is not accepting any until next November. \nMy question is, could it be scleroderma? Does it get better and then worsened that? Idk what I am suppose to do for a year without talking to a doctor and I have been really scared Hey! I am really sorry this is going on and hope you get answers from a doctor soon! \n\nFwiw- my partner just got diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis and a \u201csausage digit\u201d and small bumps is exactly how he presents.

Hmm, that is frustrating. You are going to be your best advocate! Make sure to stand up for yourself and get the care you need. \n\nHe is doing well, glad to have the diagnosis and get on the path to feeling better- hope you will be doing the same soon! Praying for you So... you have basically described the intro to how I discovered I have scleroderma.\n\nSo, if it is scleroderma, the bumps could be a couple things, either digital ulcers that have not broken the surface yet or calcinosises(sp?). Definitely get it checked out and do not panic. There is a lot of things you can do to mitigate if it is scleroderma.

My GP seemed to be very nonplused by these symptoms, did however seem a bit cautious about me developing Raynaud's at the end of winter. So perhaps it is going to be reassuring to hear for you that the swelling and sores/blisters could simply be a bad case of chilblains? \n\n(My GP noted that he had seen a lot more chilblains this year than throughout his previous years - and hypothesised it could be either simply this winter being tougher than others, or a hand version of the 'covid toe') \n\nAnyway, not sure if this helped, but I can totally emphatise with both the slight panic AND being annoyed with fingers not looking right for months without an end.

I recently saw a neurologist for severe headache I have been having for four months. I will not bore you with all the details of that, but the blood work she ordered was for a lot of auto immune diseases. I have a CRP of 8 and my anticentromere came back as greater than &gt;8. I have read a lot of information and I am still confused. I cannot imagine that I have scleroderma and I certainly do not have crest symptoms. My main symptoms are an unrelenting headache, joint pain, fatigue, always cold. I have not been diagnosed with anything else related to those symptoms. What do you think the next steps will be from the neurologist? I was able to get access to my lab work on their portal, and when I sent a question about the elevated ACA, the lab report disappeared. I am expecting I will get a call tomorrow. I just realized how long this is. Sorry about that. If I did not have scleroderma, why would I just have a random elevated ACA out of nowhere? Sorry if this has been addressed elsewhere in this sub but I have read a bit and I did not see anyone with my exact profile. Thanks for any thoughts..... I cannot respond to your initial\nInquiry based on your lab results but hoping you got some clarity around your follow up call? We are definitely here for you if you need anything. ACA itself is not a test for systemic sclerosis but can help serve as an indicator for an underlying rheumatic condition/connective tissue disease. Some common distributions as were mentioned were systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and other \u201ccommonly seen\u201d connective/rheumatic diseases.\n\nIt is to be noted nearly all patients who do come out positive for ACA were found to have an autoimmune disease/autoimmunity so as a proxy this is a strong predictor/non-insignificant correlation (this is somewhat UNLIKE ANA values, where clinicians argue about specificity/sensitivity, multiple testing, population prevalence as issues to substantiate requiring further exploration/context).   \n\nI suppose you may eventually go on some sort of DMARD eventually (note there are next generation monoclonal antibodies and biologics that block interleukin-1/3 have anti-TNF activity), which means they will test you for the usual (hepatitis, etc.) in addition to regular blood work to get a baseline. Given you are seeing a neurologist and he/she/they operate under the context of a neurology background and also your symptoms (cold hands, headache), this specialist is probably going to look at vascular/cerebrovascular involvement. Obviously rheumatoid cerebral vasculitis is on the rarer side, but unsurprisingly many autoimmune diseases have some sort of neurological manifestation during active period (as it is reported). Keep pushing and advocating/communicating so the right tests get done. I would also assume you have had/or will have an MRI and EEG recording if you are reporting changes in consciousness. Do your fingertips turn blue? If sensitivity to the cold, I would guess they would also check thyroid biomarkers.\n\nThere is sine scleroderma but it sounds like we may be looking at a sister illness. Of course, there is not enough information from a post to make clear cut cut calls, but this is just based on information of symptoms, choices (going to see a neurologist, what they did), and questions you had. I hope that was not over-sharing/pushy. Wishing you the best of luck on your journey to diagnosis and management/positive health.\n\nNote: I am a health data scientist/rare disease advocate but NOT a medical doctor. Also I have a form of scleroderma/antiphospholipid syndrome myself (at the time took 10 years to diagnose and dozens of doctors), so empathize with what you are going through a lot.

As of today down 40lbs since January w/o trying, major GI issues (at this point the entire tract from esophagus down to the, well, \"exit\" point to put it delicately) and other indicators of heart and lung problems, not sure how serious yet, referrals lined up.\n\nIn hindsight it is obvious I trusted the wrong doctor (rheumatology, suburban area) for quite awhile. I had told said doctor \"I do not think this is RA anymore\" and he did not listen. Rapid physical decline from January, and I stopped seeing him bc he would not listen to me. \n\nThe good news is that I finally have answers - this diagnosis comes from the head of a nationally renowned medical academic research center in the arm of rheumatology already set within in a prestigious medical center. I am very blessed to live here and even more blessed that my PCP \"fast tracked\" me getting in (usually months long wait list) based on what is been happening. But all I can do is move forward.\n\nWhile I realize that all the different types of this disease are \"not good\" and am *not* minimizing that at all, I got the impression from this doctor that it is looking like I have red flags for the \"really, really not good\" subtype. Then again I know nothing about this right now, except for how horrible I feel physically. Absolute misery at this point does not begin to describe it. Will be seeing several different specialists in the next week, w/ follow-up w/that rheumatologist after that, about a week and a half.\n\nI am finally in the right place and among the best physicians for managing it, but I am pretty scared right now. \n\nHow fast *can* this progress is what I want to know more than anything. I *know* that no one has a crystal ball, I just want to know if it is realistic to think there is a possibility of slowing it down now that we actually know what we are dealing with here, if that makes sense? Is it one of those disorders that waxes and wanes or once it hits this hard is it like a domino effect that cannot be stopped?\n\n**With the disclaimer of me knowing that there are no simple answers, I am just kind of flailing about in the unknown, so if anyone has any feedback on how fast** ***can*** **this progress (so I can hope for the best but be emotionally prepared for the worst) I would greatly appreciate it.** Ok so here it goes.\n\nGot diagnosed with the same thing 4 years ago and when I read your symptoms, I can pretty much say I went through an identical situation.\n\nI was lucky because diagnosis happened in 2 weeks.\n\nLet the doctors do their tests. I STRONGLY suggest emergency hospitalization to get all tests done ASAP. When the decline is rapid and heart and lung involvement is evident, you have to know how bad. Your life expectancy can be only a couple months in some cases.\n\nWhile they do their tests, get your weight back up. I was prescribed Domperidone. It helped with the processing of food. I had lost about 40lbs as well, and I was able to get it back up.\n\nI did not only stop work, I gave up my business that had multi million revenue, pretty much for nothing. All to avoid stress as much as possible and focus 100% on my health. I really hope you can do the same.\n\nIf you live in Canada, see my other post about money. You are officially disabled, so sign up for disability asap. The wait can be long!\n\nIf you get you health up and stabilized you might be eligible for a Stem Cell Transplant. Only 3% qualify so do not get your hopes up too much. Fyi wishing for a stem cell transplant is like wishing for an amputation. It is hell. But if your life is in danger, a necessary one.\n\nGood luck and if you need referrals let me know in DM's.\n\nEdit: I did not tell you the good part. I do not feel miserable all the time anymore. Everything is stable and I am able to be a Dad to my kids and enjoy life. You can make it through this! I cannot speak to how fast systemic sclerosis can progress, but I definitely agree with Top-Independent:  Get any heart involvement tested ASAP, and work hard to get your weight back up!  My sister had systemic sclerosis and began having GI issues -- heartburn and difficulty swallowing.  She lost too much weight too fast, and it damaged her heart and she died of heart failure because of it less than a year later.  Try weight gain milkshakes -- there are (  Best wishes to you, and make progress on your weight right away! So sorry about your sister... WHOA that is amazing how similar our stories are! I am in the USA but I have met my deductible and not paying a dime from here on out this year. I have been under increasingly worsening stress but it was all from the hellish months of playing whack-a-mole with endless doctors while my health went down the tubes. I was ready to give up. \n\nBelieve it or not, just KNOWING what I have has lifted a metric crap ton of stress from my shoulders. Not the physical stress, but the emotional stress, which is huge. I do not work at this time (was a freelance writer for many years; my husband supports our family and comfortably, I have a really good support system, etc. so I am VERY blessed. I can 100 percent focus on getting better).\n\nI do not think I am at emergency hospitalization point bc this doctor would have done it, no doubt in my mind. But I have been fast-tracked to literal heads of departments for this week (we are talking doctors that do not take new patients as a rule, or have year long waiting lists). So I am feeling confident in the process. Scared, yes, but knowing I am FINALLY in the right hands with doctors at the tops of their fields. \n\nThe GI problems have been the most excruciating. I have never in my life had abdominal trouble, and it started in January and has gotten worse, and worse and worse. Just, I am actually proud of myself for powering through and not giving up tbh. I am sure you know the feeling.\n\nAgain, thank you SO much for your detailed reply and sharing your story. You have given me hope, which I have not felt in a very long time.  :) In our situations doctors have to work together. If your Rheumatologist has not treated a person with rapid onset Systemic Sclerosis before ask them if they want a referral. In my case Doctors from multiple countries are working together. Just DM me and I will give you the info.  \n\nReally happy your treatment is running along. I am sure you will get better after the appointments this week.\n\nGood luck. I am so so sorry about your sister, that is beyond tragic. :(\n\nThank you very much for your advice! I will be seeing top notch GI, cardiologist and pulmonologist docs, getting all my ducks in a row asap. Your sister's tragedy certainly is a cautionary tale for me, and I appreciate your willingness to share. And the recipes are a godsend, I have been drinking lots of Ensure. \n\nAgain, my sincerest condolences. Stop calling people fat in your comments and practice eating. NAD Sorry about your diagnosis. My husband was recently diagnosed with diffuse scleroderma, progressive systemic sclerosis. He has also declined rapidly. Best advice is get on an anti inflammatory diet. His rhumetologist ramped up his mycephenolateto stop the progression. What meds are you on? Just got the diagnosis, will be having lots of other tests soon and we will go from there. I am so sorry to hear about your husband!

That ANA titer is not very high. This could easily be a false positive. Your rheumatologist should be able to help you work from symptoms to see if you have something diagnosable.\n\nI had a higher titer (1:640) and high positive scl-70 multiple times, but not enough symptoms diagnose anything.

So, my brother has scleroderma with a morphea overlay (After reading through this subreddit I do not know if those are the proper terms but that is what the doctor told us). Anyways, he was diagnosed about 4 years ago and has been dealing with a lot of other autoimmune disorders and related medical issues. He is been really struggling. He used to play trumpet and bagpipes but cannot anymore as he is almost completely lost the use of his hands due to everything tightening and developing open sores that are not healing. I have been trying to help him find some new hobbies so he feels a little more purpose. What have you guys tried? What has worked for you? Any ideas or suggestions?\n\nWe tried calligraphy for a bit, but he is not really able to hold anything in his index finger and thumb anymore. His mobility is rather limited (he can walk slowly but cannot stand for very long). He does compose music, but his ADHD makes it difficult to have only one thing to work on. He does not want to join a support group, and as much as I want to I do not understand everything he is dealing with. Suggestions for a younger sister to help support her brother? I just want to help and I am at a loss and do not know what to do next. Has he tried audio books? What about a swim exercise class? Maybe astronomy? He should be able to sit and look through a telescope and hopefully not have to manipulate it too much with his hands! Citizen science, maybe. Scistarter is a good place to look for projects. I have logged native plants, counted birds, reported squirrel activity, collected acorns, cleaned up invasive plants, and much more. One can really pick and choose from what interests you (or your brother).\n\nedit: Link to (\n\nSome projects are totally independent. Others are scheduled. There is a wide variety, so he should be able to find things to align with his interests as well as his abilities. He does listen to audiobooks, but falls asleep a lot because he does not have anything to help keep him awake (many of his treatments have fatigue &amp; sleepiness as a side effect). When covid calms down and he is not so immunocompromised I will suggest the swimming class. Thank you for the ideas! Oh that is a good idea! We actually have a telescope that one of our older siblings got from a yard sale awhile ago so definitely good potential there. Thank you! That is perfect! I have struggled a bit since losing some of my abilities so I know it can be tough. I hope he can find a hobby he loves! If you do not mind my asking, how did you/how do you cope with that? I would never heard of this before so we will definitely check it out! Thank you! Honestly, therapy has helped me realize that losing some abilities is a loss, and is often accompanied by grief. That was mind blowing, but so helpful to understand my emotions. \n\nNow I try to focus on things I love to do, and make accommodations so that I can do them (when I am feeling well enough). I know that is not possible for everyone though. I have also found new interests by accident really. We moved and I am now really into flowers and trees since we have so many cool plants at our new place. I cannot always go out and pull weeds or prune things, but I can observe the flowers, insects, and wildlife! I set up a wildlife fountain recently and I have gotten so much joy just watching all the creatures use it. \n\nThings like that help me cope and feel joy that I kind of lost from my old hobbies. I hope that helps. \u2764\ufe0f This helps tremendously, thank you. I am excited to share your story with him. Thank you so much for your help \u2665\ufe0f Absolutely!

A Patient's Experience. What to do if you get diagnosed with Scleroderma? A Patient's Experience. \n\n4 years ago I was diagnosed with diffuse Scleroderma. I went from a healthy 31 year old father of 2, to not being able to stand without a cane and even a walker. I had lung and heart involvement, with severe GURD that led to big weight lose. Aside from other skin issues. \n\nI was a plumbing contractor with 8 or so employees. Work was stressful and hard. With 2 young kids, it was a scary thought that I would not be there for them as they grew. The thought of not being at my daughter's wedding terrified me. She was 2 at the time\ud83d\ude05. Funny thoughts run through your mind when faced with your own mortality. \n\nSo I had my mental break down. \ud83e\udd2fNormal. I made mistakes, and I made good decisions. What I am about to offer is personal advice. So take it for what it is. \n\nRemove all stress from your life. Good stress, bad stress. At least until the medication stabalizes you. Stress for me was the biggest trigger of symptoms. The more I got my anxiety stabilized, the less damage my body seemed to suffer. \n\nWhen you get your medication, take it like clockwork! Yes, the side effects really suck! \ud83d\udca9 But stick with it. Once your body adjusts it is metabolism to them, about 2 weeks, things will get back to 'normal'. Skipping them just once, can ruin all your hard work. Follow the instructions like your life depends on it! Because it does. \n\nRaynaud's is more than just your hands changing color. The lack of blood flow causes digital ulcers, autoamputation, calcinosis and other skin damage. Not to mention it greatly reduces your capacity to heal. My solution, find my triggers. Stress, cold, drastic temperature change, high humidity. Once I found the triggers, I avoided them like the plague! Wear gloves to keep warm and prevent injury. Doing dishes is a bad idea. So you see, it is not all bad news.\ud83d\ude09 \n\nSeperate each problem you have and approach them individually. This makes things more manageable, and less intimidating. Some things have very simple solutions. For my calcinosis on my joints, it was band aids with Polysporin, the one with the pain killer. For other issues it was more complex, like a Stem Cell transplant. \n\nThe important thing is you do not over do it. Keep things simple. Let the doctors do their work, but communicate your issues properly, even small issues are important at the diagnosis stage. \n\nSome symptoms can be embarassing to talk about. Not fun to talk about erectile disfunction as a 36 year old, but talking about it opens the door to the solution. Put your pride and fears to the side, their not worth your happiness. \n\nThe reality is not all people will have it as bad as I did. No matter what you are facing make sure you surround yourself with people who support you well. As for those who do not, it might be time to take some distance from that relationship. Scleroderma is not a mental illness, but some can develop because of it. Ground yourself often and make sure you take things a day at a time. If that is too much an hour at a time. \n\nI see Scleroderma as an opportunity. One to prove your faith, love, resilience, and strength. This is the end of a lot of things, but also the beginning of others. Make sure you still keep room for happiness, and never give up. \n\nYou have my love. I hope this helps.\u2764\ufe0f Thank you for taking the time to put your journey into words. My fianc\u00e9 was misdiagnosed in 2009 and was properly diagnosed just four weeks ago.

It is such a rare thing to have. If your doctors lack experience, it is best to transfer to one who does. Scleroderma demands being treated by a specialist. For example I temporarily moved 4 hours away for 6 months to get my Stem Cell transplant. The difference in survival rates was over 10% between hospitals. All because of the experience of staff. \n\nGood courage to you both! Thank you for your words of hard-earned wisdom! It is very important for everyone to hear about your experiences. I hope your medications bring you some relief. I am doing much better now. I no longer need a cane and have recovered 70% what I lost. Probably why I have the strength to write.

Thanks in advance! You did not mention your age, this sounds exactly like my symptoms when I was in my mid-thirties. It took quite a while to get a diagnosis but they always treated my symptoms as they appeared so initially it was the Raynaud's and the swelling and soreness of my hands. Over the next 10 years I had more symptoms of CREST syndrome with esophageal / swallow problems, telangiectasia, and ulcers on my fingertips.  \nSounds like you found a physician who cares about figuring out what is going on.  But even once you have labs that point in the direction, do not expect a definitive diagnosis right away. Continue to keep your physician appraised of new symptoms and if the treatment plan is not working make sure you let your doctor know.  When they send you home with a prescription, give it time to work but if there is no changes, let your physician know.  if it isnt working and you do not tell them, it just drags out the process. \nBest of health to you!

My rheumatologist is a God send and a saint of a doctor, so definitely keep searching until you find one that listens and believes you. On the medication note, if you have ever taken anything for another illness entirely that you were like oh my gosh I actually felt like myself again, be sure to mention that to your rheumatologist as well. One of the reasons that I was so adamant about looking into the possibility that it was an autoimmune disease is because I was put on Prednisone for a hiking trip because my lungs never recovered after having bronchitis. And I felt like myself for the first time in four years. telling my rheumatologist that was a huge step in her listening and believing that I knew my body and then I might be on to something thinking that it was autoimmune. It is really good to hear similar stories. My current rheum is my 3rd one and she is very thorough and listens to me. She says she does believe I have something autoimmune at this time, and shes the first to say so. I have my first in person appointment with her in a week where she will examine me and send me for further testing to narrow it down. Considering I have Raynaud's, GERD, and some suspicious skin on my hands I am guessing a CREST diagnosis is likely but she also mentioned lupus as a possibility.

I do not know if that is my thing but options are always great.\n\nI guess the one challenge is it can be harder to use if her hands are unusable but when mine flare up, I turn it on and hold it against my leg on its side rather than gripping it. Maybe that would be awkward for others but I still swear by mine Tacrolimus ointment and cellcept/mycophenolate did pretty well for the tightness on my skin and hands. Also, getting cleaning brushes with rubber detail nubs has been a lifesaver. Not sure if I personally would want a massager because I know that using my hands is what makes them swell the next day, but I would be willing to try one. \n\nFrom personal experience I can only recommend  budget hand relief ideas like some arthritic \"handy helper\" gadgets to help make all regular tasks easier.\n\nI use all of these things listed below nearly daily and they help a ton...\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\nYou can cut these and put them on anything she might need to grip, especially if you get ones with a range of different diameters.\n\n(", "is it safe to break up my own calcifications in soft tissue? I knew I had enormous chunks of gross crunchy stuff in my muscles for a long time before I realized that I may have scleroderma.  I have been using gentle heat, gua sha, and cupping to break up all the dystrophic calcification/calcific tendinitis.\n\nIs that considered safe?  Are there reasons why I should not do this?  Overall, it seems to be improving my life considerably; I used to be in constant agony from calcification in hamstrings, quads, IT band, etc and now I am not.  My muscles all felt stuck together and I felt trapped in my own body and had to dissociate to handle the pain.  But I have heard breaking these up this can introduce toxins into your system. According to my Rhuemotogist it is safe. Getting them on digits and squeezing them out is not really safe cause it can lead infection. I know from experience lol... Cupping works though? I have been wondering how to combat them That is great to know!\n\nCupping works, but it is definitely a process.  I fell about 12 years ago and dislocated my femur and tore almost every muscle in my thigh, and it took me, deadass, 18 months to break up all those calcifications.  I have been sitting on a heating pad *almost all day long* during that time and spending about 3-5 hours a week just working on breaking them up.    I do not think cupping alone would work - I do think you need to pair it with gua sha.  But fortunately gua sha tools are super cheap and easy to find.\n\nA very well trained PT could probably break it up faster, but we are all just sitting at home doing nothing right now anyway, right?  haha I am a physician with scleroderma/CREST. I routinely use this process on myself. Because it worked so well, I went through training for deep deep tissue work and trigger point therapy, which I currently offer my patients. \n\nThere appears to be no laboratory abnormalities caused by this, with the exception of mild lactic acidosis or Rhabdomyolysis in rare cases (and only with extensive and aggressive work). Rhabdomyolysis is the mass breakdown of muscle tissue and it is worse when one is dehydrated. It is also more common in people with sickle cell disease/trait or renal disease (that is because the enzymes are ultimately flushed out by the kidneys). \n\nI have never seen therapy-induced Rhabdo bad enough to require hospital treatment; it resolves with aggressive hydration. If you have a lot of muscle pain following a treatment, it is likely from a build up of muscle cell enzymes and/or lactic acid, both of which are caustic to surrounding tissues. They just can be flushed out with a good 2-4 liters of water over the following 24-48 hours.\n\nYou should have your parathyroid, ionized calcium, serum urea, and creatinine levels checked routinely if you have renal disease. I check those labs in my chronic kidney disease patients before performing manual tissue therapy on them. Since many people with autoimmune disease end up having some degree of chronic kidney disease, it might be worth asking your primary care physician to screen these labs if you are going to have any kind of aggressive tissue work done. \n\nIf anyone has questions, you are welcome to contact me privately. :) Yea absolutely! Wow, awesome, thanks so much! Also just for some more context, the reason I kept on doing this for 18 months was because a small piece would break up basically every few days.  A lot of times, i could literally hear or see it release under my skin.  It was so, so satisfying, like crunching a perfect fall leaf, except the leaf is an enormous source of pain!  I also had calcifications on the left half of my stomach and diaphragm, causing gastroparesis and compulsive breath-holding, and I break those up with the same method.  It was truly incredible.  It is so satisfying to feel like you actually have your recovery in your own hands.  Of course professionals are great, but it feels better to me to do this myself.\n\nI started out using blackseed oil with some terpenes and essential oils in it, and that worked pretty well, and then recently I tried a MMJ cream that was 1:1 THC/CBD, and it just like, melts the top layer of the calcification, so that you can get your skin un-stuck from.  It is MAGIC how fast that stuff works. Omfg I cannot believe I did not think of cannabis cream. I am an mmj grower and user for pain and a million other things. I am going to make some feco my next harvest... The calcinous in your stomach, how did you find out that is what it was? I have compulsive breath holding for some reason that started a few months ago and digestive/stomach issues that keep getting worse, than ok than worse again. I see a gastro alot and he knows about CREST but maybe calcinous being the cause is something he did not think of. I really did not even know that that is what it was.  I thought it was just fascial adhesions.  I have known for a long time that I hold tension in my abdominal muscles, diaphragm, etc (I grew up in ballet and was taught to focus on the lines I was creating with my body moreso than, you know, breathing).  I watched a video on fascial adhesions that said they could spread along fascial lines, so I assumed my constant ab-flexing made the problem spread to other surrounding tissue\n\nUnfortunately, very few doctors seem to understand that calcification can cause things like gastroparesis or breath holding.  My doctor's mind was totally blown when I told her.  I certainly do not think it is causing *everyone is* gastroparesis etc, but it is something I hope many people will consider, as the fix can be relatively simple I am definitely going to bring it up to my gastro that is for sure. Thank you ! Hi! I am curious, where are the calcifications you are trying to break up? Is it palpable?\nI am asking because I am an acupuncturist and can start cupping and guasha on her ASAP. But I am not sure I can \"see\" or feel calcification on her. \nI have been treating my mom for various things, including muscle tightness and pain, reynaulds, chronic dry cough, etc. Just came across scleroderma. Her pulmonologist and PCP have never brought up scleroderma. Going to have to ask for a referral to a rheumatologist after perusing this subreddit.\n\nWe have been chasing symptoms for years with no real diagnosis. Not sure if realizing this could be it is reassuring or not, but better than not knowing, I guess. \n\nThanks in advance for your info!", "So my doc has put me on keto diet for the scleroderma. One week in and all of my skin flares are gone. I have a lot of gastro involvement with my scleroderma and that seems to have improved, but we will see. \n\nThat plus Aveeno baby skincare products and tons of mineral oils seems to be helping a lot.\n\nHas anybody else tried keto for this problem? What exactly is Keto? I have never heard of it I had great luck with keto regarding weight loss before I was diagnosed. I wonder now, based on your experience, if I should revisit that lifestyle... Low carb. You go into a metabolic state of ketosis and stay there. We will see how it goes. \n\nIt is only been a week. I was in the midst of a bad rash outbreak when I started and that all healed up. Had a couple of days with normal skin, then got a couple hotspots on my legs yesterday. Those stopped without blistering.\n\nSo far, my gut likes the diet very much. I do take a fiber supplement every other day to keep things on an even keel. I do have to add that I eat very few raw veggies. My gut cannot tolerate it. But I do eat my cooked veg just fine. And I am taking my vitamins and minerals.\n\nI have lost 10.2 pounds and that was necessary. (Have a LOT more to go, but it is a start) \n\nI did do two days of Intermittent Fasting (doctor told me to work it in) and that made a hell of a difference. Today I am taking a break from that. My hours for eating were 3-9PM and that did not stress me out at all.\n\nStill have a lot of muscle aches and inflammation, but my joints are't swollen one bit. That is actually a really nice change.\n\nThis is a long-term thing. My immediate impression is that there is an improvement and I honestly cannot see how this could hurt me worse than I was.\n\nGuess I will be the guinea pig and keep you guys posted.\n\n That is interesting. Thank you for the response. I will do some further reading on this. Yes, i am noticing the same this time around with a high fat / protein low carb diet.  \n\nI have less anxiety / raynauds flare ups, less random pains and most importantly, my skin (except finger ulcers!) is doing great! \n\nI feel absolutely amazing compared to where I was at a year ago.   I wanted to see how you are doing since you posted this 2 months ago? Have you maintained a ketogenic diet? Has it made improvements? I have lost 40 pounds. (Stalled right now because of a stupid virus)\n\nI am having improvements, but I am not sure how much is due to the diet or the new medication. The improvement in the gut is 100% due to the diet. That was already so much better than it was before I even started the medication.\n\nIt is not exactly an ideal keto diet. More of an elimination/keto diet. The only raw veg I get is lettuce and cucumbers. Plenty of cooked veg. I really do have an impossible time digesting raw fruit and veg and there is just no doubt about that now.\n\nThe biggest vissible difference is with the skin on my hands. Now some of the tightness in my fingers is due to weight loss, but some is clearly not. The skin is more supple. \n\nContrary to how scleroderma normally presents, the skin on the back of my hands was very thin and paper-like. That is thickened and softened.\n\nThe tightness around my mouth has settled down and my ability to make facial expressions is almost normal now. \n\nThe bad: Still have the muscle issues and flares of joint inflammation. Still feel tired, but I am having bouts of energy that I have not had in a long time. I am appreciating that I now have good days at all. \n\nThe rheumatologist said to give it all a solid 3 months before we make a determination about anything or make any changes. \n\nThe medication is plaquenil. 200mgx2/day and I do love it. So far NO side effects and I was really worried about that. \n\nMy overall situation has improved and I will keep doing what I am doing. At the very least, with the keto diet, I am no longer worshiping the toilet bowl and my belly bloat is gone. I am no longer lugging around the equivalent of a small child on my back. I no longer have any signs of insulin resistance or pre-diabetes or PCOS. (that is from earlier attempts that did not result in weight loss.) At least I am just dealing with scleroderma and a broken back. Not that AND diabetes, obesity, metabolic and endocrine disruption, etc.\n\nSorry this is so long. I want to be as honest as I can and hopefully somebody can get something of value from my experience.\n\nThere is no magic bullet and it does take time to turn the Titanic. I may find more benefits for inflammation as more time passes.\n\nI have a friend who introduced me to a multi-vitamin called FibroResponse. It does help me with some of the symptoms and, for the love of gawd, I cannot understand why. I have taken everything that is in that bottle at one point or another and never had a positive effect. So I have added that. ((shrug)) Whatever works.\n\nAlso mineral oil. Oil, oil, oil. I now use oil instead of soap to 'wash' my face and body. Buff off the dead skin with a towel after. (If it was good enough for the Egyptians and the Romans, it is good enough for me) Oil my skin after I take a bath or shower. Put oil in my bath when I am soaking. That seems to keep the bad skin flares at bay. The second I feel any tightness anywhere - OIL. In that regard, this has been the best winter that I have had in years.\n\nGood luck to you. I will keep seeking and sharing. Hopefully we can continue to find ways to improve our quality of life.\n\n(Forgive typos and errors. Not editing because I have the flu and I am lucky to have gotten this far.) Thank you for your thorough response! I hope you recover quickly from flu. \n Hi! \nI have connective tissue disorder, multiple autoimmune including scleroderma (that is what all labs point to anyways). \nDid you find intolerance to certain keto foods?\n\nI have tried to eat all animal proteins /whole foods vs collagen supps, hemp protein powders, nutritional yeast protein, but it causes too much pain. Did it take time to find a balance?  I have scleroderma and have started keto. Just like you I was in the middle of a flare and feel\n100 % better (fingers crossed).   This is definitely enough incentive to give up sugar. ", "Puffy base of fingers and toes early sign of scleroderma? In May I noticed my wedding rings were really tight. I put on about 20 pounds during Covid and had water retention. I figured that was the problem. \n\nI took off my ring for a few weeks. Some swelling went down, but the base of my ring finger (the front of my hand, not the palm side) is puffy. Like there is a fat pad or thickened skin.\n\nI showed my doctor. He was concerned and ordered tests. The results came back and indicate MCTD or early RA. (High ANA, RNP, CRP, and Protein indicating joint damage - pain in hips, lower back, knees)\n\nSince then I have noticed my pinky fingers have the same issue. Also the tops of most of my toes. I looked up skin thickening and scleroderma keeps popping up.\n\nThere is no pain and no shininess, but some tightness, especially in my toes. Also in my hands if I am retaining water.\n\nIs this a sign of early or mild scleroderma? I have my first rheumatology appointment in about a month.\n\nIn case it matters, I had Raynaud's in my feet as a teen into early 20s. It has not happened lately. I live in CA and I avoid the cold. But my hands go numb when I am driving. Honestly it sounds like early scleroderma to me. I am newly diagnosed though. I live in California as well.  Orange county Hi! I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years. My first signs were my hands swelled to the size of baseball gloves!!! Nothing for my toes. Saying all that everyone is different. Wait until you see the Rheumatologist before making any judgements. I also started a podcast for people dealing with Scleroderma. The first episode just came out!!! My journey. It might help you as you start this journey. It is called Mogils Mobcast. That is how it began with me. I thought I was just fat so I ignored it, I thought my feet hurting or swelling was due to fat or travel. Same - I chalked up all the pain to being fat and old (I am 41).\n\n I have know I had some kind of autoimmune thing going on for 10 years because I felt fantastic when I was pregnant with my son. But I could not convince anyone to test me.\n\n When I showed my doctor my hands his whole demeanor changed. If you got the proper blood tests it is simple. It is a yes or no. Sound like RA to me. If you can back positive for Scleroderma you would be talking to a Rheumatologist not your family doctor. Look up CREST and other signs of Scleroderma. Puffy fingers and swollen joints are rarely the only symptoms. This is good news for you by the way. Scleroderma is a bitch! Thanks \ud83d\ude0a I am seeing a rheumatologist in September. I kind of think it is RA, though I am negative for Rheumatoid factor. So far only ANA and RNP are positive.  They are low-positive so I hope I do not get dismissed. I have been struggling for years. You have no idea how much I hope it is not Scleroderma! I hope you find out what you have. I will give you the only health advice I give. Reduce your stressers to a minimum. Besides the Stem Cell transplant, it is the thing that helped the most. Stress is the fuel of autoimmune problems. I heard and loved your pod cast. I felt a warmth feeling know that I am not alone. Thank you so much. I look forward to more podcast and smiles. \u2665\ufe0f I am so glad you liked it! It is a scary new adventure for me!!! Both episodes 3 and 4 deal with the hands!!! One a hand doctor and the other a hand therapist. Hands are an issue with Scleroderma patients. Grrrr! I am going on 14 years now and my symptoms have remained the same. I only have mild joint hands and toe pain. I do not have skin issues. Besides dry skin but I take care of it with lotion. My blood test for Scl-70!has always remained at 2.3. Nothing changes. I get heartburn but I do love spicy food. I can control the heartburn. Funny thing is that I never knew what Scl-70 was until this year. I kept up with physical and my Dr would say it was Arthritis. I went back to my old records and found Scl-70 from 2008. If I had not checked every thing on my records, I would have never known about this. I have now developed Anxiety just knowing what I have. I am doing better now. I have an appointment with the RA Dr soon. My organs are healthy, thanks to God. Just seems hard to really understand this Autoimmune. Which RNP did you have? U1 RNP is specific for mixed connective tissue disorder which can also cause puffy fingers and the U3 RNP is for scleroderma. If it is the U1 RNP antibody and you tested negative for all of the scleroderma antibodies (anti centromere, U3, SCL-70 etc), I am pretty sure it would be mctd. I am pretty sure it was U1. The test details mentioned MCTD which makes a lot of sense with my symptoms. But the numbers were relatively low so I do not know if the rheumatologist will take them seriously. I am obviously not a rheumatologist but based on your symptoms and the positive U1 test, you are more likely to have mctd than scleroderma but some people with mctd have a very scleroderma-like presentation so skin thickening is possible (but not necessary for a diagnosis). If I were you, I would just ask your doctor for more clarifications. Update: no diagnosis but the rheumatologist prescribed 200 mg hydroxychloroquin twice a day to start. He said he is going to watch my ETA protein to gauge how well it works.", "Mother worried about test results A bit of context: my mother, who is 66 years old, was diagnosed with Lichen sclerosus 4 years ago. She has patches of dry skin on her back. They diagnosed her via skin biopsy. This year her fingertips began turning blue when cold. She went to her gp who decided to run a batch of tests on her via bloodwork. She is tested positive for ANA. She is worried about the possibility of having Scleroderma. Could they have missed this 4 years ago? I know you guys cannot make a diagnosis for her, but perhaps something pops out in her tests results I am providing that can offer some sort of clue. She just received these results today and has to return to her doctor. I cannot thank you enough!!\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n( CREST syndrome is the old name for limited scleroderma. The letters stand for a collection of symptoms. Calcinosis, Raynaulds, Esophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia\n\nthe color changes in her hands is the raynaulds syndrome. It is caused by exposure to cold which could be holding a cold glass or walking in freezer section at grocery. \nShe will likely be refered to a rheumatologist, and hopefully she will get a good one who will take the time to explain things to her. \n\nThere are a lot of terrible sides to Scleroderma, but limited sclero typically affects the hands only.  she may find she is had other autoimmune issues that were undiagnosed like inflammatory arthritis or dry eyes, and the diagnosis may help get her treatment she is needed. \nTypical treatment is symptom related, if the only issue is the color changes / circulation in her hands ( can include feet, nose and lips) there are medications for that. If she is had swelling and hard skin on her hands they may start other meds. \nI basically just gave you an explanation of what limited sclero consists of, if she has specific questions let me know. It is best not to search the internet - systemic Scleroderma is a terrible disease with many life altering symptoms, from what her lab shows she has the limited, not systemic disease. \nThat is great your looking out for her, she will need someone to voice her concerns with and it sounds like your listening, she is lucky to have you! Thank you soooo much for this response. I was taken aback not just by the news that she tested positive but by her telling me that someone told her that her 1:1280 ANA was outrageously high. Is that a number that is waaay off the charts? Does it make it more serious? Thanks for all the info!!", "I am scared Hello, I am new here. I recently tested positive for ANA and Scl70 for Sclaraderma, I have been having hives and \"allergic reactions\" according to the emergency room. Google is terrifying, basically felt like it told me I have Systemic sclerosis and I have 6 months to live. Even though my referral says urgent the rheumatologist cannot see me until December. I just need someone to tell me that Scl70 is not a death sentence. Diffuse Scleroderma was a death sentence 10 years ago. Not the case anymore for most people. Even the really aggressive types like mine. So stop stressing. Your doing more harm than good.\n\nThis is probably the best place for practical advice. As for medical, wait to talk to your Rheumatologist.\n\nStop using google. Thank you so much, you have no idea how much I needed this reply. While you wait might as well try and get the best coverage to pay for your future meds. Even in Canada they are expensive! I am just glad the meds exist. Google made it seem like there is nothing that can be done. I will definitely get off the internet, it just feel so helpless never even hearing about this and having no idea what it is. Tons of meds available. Worst case even stem cell transplants can be had. \n\nFYI do not wish for one. If it is offered I suggest you take it, however it is like trying to avoid getting hit by a car by jumping in rush hour traffic.\n\nAs for the meds, read all possible side effects. Officially I now have Addisons because of prednisone. I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years. It is not a death sentence but will change how you live. I started a podcast for Scleroderma patients and their family. It is called Mogils Mobcast it is on Spotify and Apple podcast. My journey in episode 1, I give suggestions on how to handle your diagnosis. Episode 3, is my hand doctor. Episode 5, is another Scleroderma patient\u2019s story. Please do not worry. You will be able to get help. My dr always says, please stay off the internet information sites. She says sometimes people that do not Even know what they are talking about post incorrect information and I should remember while we are sleeping the other side of the world is awake. Vise versa to remember someone somewhere is changing medical history every night. Therefore what gets posted could be wrong before morning. And always keep in mind someone is working on a cure/cause somewhere in the world right now. Thank you very much for sharing this perspective. I really appreciate it. I have positive scl 70. Right now im only presenting with Reynauds. Ive known for 2 years now with no change/ advancement in symptoms. Im 33. Ask you doc to set baselines. Have your heart, lungs, and skin checked. Its much easyier to track once you have baselines established.\n\nIf you smoke.. stop.. like yesterday. My mom smoked and it exasperated her symptoms and she ended up dying young from it. This disease is no joke if you smoke. Thank you very much for your response. Reddit is making me feel so much better. Keeping you in my thoughts, friend &lt;3 I too am positive for SCL70 and ANA. 39yo female. My physical showed the start of neuropathy in feet which I was unaware of. My doc had me do bloodwork and also an MRI. Initially he suspected MS before the bloodwork came back. MRI came back fine. Just saw rheumatologist and he put me on vitamin D3 50,000 unit daily for a week and then once weekly for 8 days. He suspects that it is my low vitamin D that was causing the scleroderma to \"show up\". So right now he said I do not \"have\" scleroderma although I do not know how he can officially say that. He also said I could live my whole life with no issues and no need to go on medicine.  I developed a small skin rash the next day and was there for over a week. Cannot wait for my next visit with rheumatologist so we can go over bloodwork and go from there. I am not opposed to getting a second opinion. In my state we have a hospital that has a scleroderma clinic and I really want to get referred there because they know their stuff! Yes Google is scary but I am the type of person who has to dive in and research the possibilities of something just so I can wrap my head around it. I have been to too many doctors who just go through the motions and it is because of my research that I find stuff out and then am able to ask, hey what about this?  I found that scleroderma info.org was an AWESOME resource \n(lots of awesome articles for both patients and practitioners!) and I do plan on listening to Mogil's Mobcast :) There are several Facebook groups for scleroderma that are super helpful. My wife tested positive for ANA and a scl-70 as well. Follow up with rheumatologist is in a week but could use some reassuring news. She is allergic to predinose. Are there other meds that are still effective? Prednisone is just a steroid. Others can be used. Also, its a bad drug long term. Major side effects like Addison's. My mom was told to expect less than a year to live (and felt like it) over 20 years ago. She is tried many different treatments over the years and has had a few fallbacks but in general she always says that she felt like she was 80 when she was diagnosed at 40 and she is been \u201cmostly aging backwards since.\u201d Hang in there and good luck \u2764\ufe0f This just helped calm me down as well. I tested positive for Centromere B Antibody and 1:160. Google almost caused me a panic attack.

Morphea is a form of scleroderma, it is just a matter of circumstances if it evolves to a more serious issue or not. \n\nWhere is it located? Steroids are painful and depending on the person, the progress is individual. It is on my lower right hand side of my back which apparently is a good thing. Theyre recommending hydroxychloroquine. The options your doctor have given you are normal treatment options in the beginning of morphea if it is not severe. You can also try antibiotic protocols, immunosuppressants, and even stem cell treatments but this usually is not done.   \ncause of the rarity and the way biopsies are returned. Sadly all forms of scleroderma come back as positive for morphea when in reality it should say positive for excess collagen this gets those with systemic scleroderma the wrong diagnosis and internal progression can occur without it being tracked. Now to be safe you should be aware of the more common forms of systemic scleroderma or be treated by a scleroderma specialist who specializes in morphea. Things to watch out for that may mean you are misdiagnosed. Now the symptoms I am about to mention can be seen in both but in morphea, it would not be caused by morphea it is just something else going on. In systemic scleroderma it is the cause. Symptoms: Raynaud's, GERD/acid reflux, swallowing issues, GI issues, shortness of breath, abnormal nailfold capillaries, PAH, and more. If you have these you should be looking into finding a specialist just to be safe. If you have not been misdiagnosed morphea will never turn into systemic scleroderma but as noted misdiagnosis is pretty common.   \n\n\nOral steroids work well for getting you out of a flare and stopping the spreading which in most does not go away. Phototherapy has worked wonders for many morphea patients and is worth trying. AIP and other diets can work because they reduce inflammation or can single out food triggers some have.  \n\n\nThe options your doctor has given you are normal treatment options in the beginning of morphea if it is not severe.

For me I had skin progression, joint pain, loss of range of motion, mental and physical fatigue, and extreme itchiness as my main complaints. I am now back to what I would call my normal before but with now a hyperpigmentation mark with minor thickening it thinned out a lot. I have morphea in remission right now. I was on clobetasol ointment if I remember correctly. It would get rid of the plaque but did not stop it from expanding. \n\nI did not try oral steroids or phototherapy, but dietary changes worked for me. My gastroenterologist thinks I have celiac disease, so that could be why diet was effective. (I have a gastroenterologist because of a high colon cancer risk, not because I have morphea or schleroderma diagnoses.) My close family member has aggressive flare-ups. The steroids (although strong) was able to keep it under control but they were on it for a year. The family member has also been on Methotrexate since age 4. \n\nThe family member has linear scleroderma so it effects one side of the body and their face. \nWe have attempted alternatives but her flare ups are so aggressive that they have permanent atrophy along with the collagen scarring. I have on the 5th week of a 6 week UVB phototherapy course, and using clobetisol  on the plaque spots. The red areas are lightening and the clobetisol keeps the plaque spots from hardening. I wish I was better with an anti inflammatory diet. I do not want to take hydroxychloriquin as it effects the liver and I would rather keep that organ healthy.\nMorphea \u201cburns out\u201d in 5 yrs or so according to my research.\nAlso- my insurance covers the UVB phototherapy . Has anyone found that people become dependent (not addition wise) on immunosuppressants once they start taking them? I am worried that once I start I will have to cycle through it every so often. My Morphea does not bother me at all (no symptoms, just dark patches os skin). Has methotrexate helped you? I began 25mg injections 4 weeks ago to treat morphed. I am curious what to expect Hi curious what to expect, I am dad. My morphea is all over my body. I am 38F and was diagnosed when I was 12. 2 months ago was the first time in my entire life that I was offered a treatment so I would gladly cycle through immunosuppressants (currently on week 4 of methotrexate injections) if it means there is a chance at it helping Methotrexate worked well for me and I am in remission. It took 8 weeks to notice any improvement I noticed that my joint pain went from 7 days a week to 2. At 4-6mths it slowed down for spreading and at 8 mths it was fully in remission no symptoms at all Thank you so much for your response. That is so wonderful to hear that you are doing well Did you suffer from any side effects to the medication? To date I have not received anything other than being a bit sleepy the morning after I take it so I am not quite sure if it means it is ineffective. I was expecting much more than I have experienced. Methotrexate takes quote awhile.to begin working 9 weeks is the earliest point to notice it slowly down symptoms and even progress. But generally it takes longer which is why we waited till the 4-6mth range before considering a change to cellcept. But u had massive skin progression slowly so we kept me.in it. In the beginning I noticed nausea but if you do thr injections before bed you can ride out most symptoms. I have hair thinning nothing massive and some dry shampoo to my hair and it fells normal to me again. We did change me from folic acid to folinic acid cause it can be mroe effective for side effects but it is only worth the change id you have side effects worth addressing since with 7$ a pill Canadian so I am sure that is much worse elsewhere. Wait your plaque resolved? I did not know that could happen? I have this exact same spot Update: saw a specialist, recommending clabetasol as a preventative steroid but nothing else. Says it looks very localized and not active. You know how they say it can 'burn out' eventually? It is that. It left a slight indent on a my inner thigh, and it looks a bit red. Sometimes it looks purplish. I do as well!", "ISSUES OF FAITH: Terminal joy through faith ", "Gluten-Free Diet in Treating Scleroderma A new research article was just published which investigated the effect of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on systemic scleroderma (SSc) patients.\n\n\nOf 60 SSc patients, they found that 96.6% had some form of gastrointestinal issue, the most common being flatulence,\nheartburn, abdominal pain and gastric fullness.\n\n\nFourteen of these 60 patients agreed to adhere to a gluten-free diet as part of the study. The result of the diet was that all but one patient had symptomatic improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms. On a scale of 1-100, patients went on average from a 67.5 to a 27.0, meaning their symptoms were more than halved from eliminating gluten alone.\n\n\nWhile it is hard to draw conclusions from a study this small, it is certainly encouraging to see that it had a positive result, and hopefully this will lead to more research on the role of diet and the microbiome in autoimmune disease.\n\n\n\n", "Bob Saget\u2019s Battle Against Scleroderma, the Autoimmune Disease that Took His Sister\u2019s Life ", "Docs to suggest ways to cope with scleroderma ", "so confused and scared. Not sure if this is or is not scleroderma. I am 33 years old and have a history of thyroid cancer, Hashimotos thyroid disease and always have a positive ANA since my late teens.  One of my doctor's 8 years ago did a full panel antibody test at LabCorp and it showed my anti-scl-70 antibodies at **4** .   My ANA came back positive as **1:400** All other antibodies came back normal and I had no symptoms of scleroderma.   I had a repeat 3 weeks later at Quest labs and it came back in the normal range.  I took these results to a rheumatologist and he said was not concerned give that I had no symptoms.  \n\nFast forward 8 years to now and I have had a general feeling of malaise which may be related to anxiety but my doctor again did a full panel bloodwork along with antibodies.  I went to LabCorp again and my anti-scl-70 came back **&gt; 8%**  and ANA positive as **1:1280 speckled pattern**.  I had to find a new rheumatologist since the one I went to 8 years ago retired.  This rheumatologist said they do not know.  She said it may be it is early disease but that also a speckled pattern ANA usually does not present in scleroderma but it is hard to say.  She said I have no symptoms now she wants me to get a repeat at Quest again since LabCorp was the only one that resulted in the positive anti-scl-70 test.  \n\nI really do not know what to make of any of this or how to proceed. This is almost me in a nutshell, along with the Hashimotos. I had this come up with the first Rheumatologist I went to and he blew me off telling me that because I was young and a single mom, that I just needed to rest because I was stressed. I had actual symptoms of continually joint pain, etc. I found another rheumatologist who listened and redid labs and went ahead to start treating me 3 years ago. \n\nI would recommend that after these labs come back and this rheum says nothing needs to be done because you are not \u201csymptomatic\u201d, you need to be your best advocate and find another rheumatologist that will listen to you. This left untreated, will cause Irreversible damage. If you can start treating now, the better off you are to have a \u201cnormal\u201d lifestyle. thank you!  what if these labs come back as negative though?  It seems I only come back positive at LabCorp.  Last time after getting the positive anti-scl-70's , my repeat 3 weeks later at Quest was negative. I am consistently positive for SCL-70 on Mayo Clinic's panel, at &gt;8.0... I.e., off the charts positive. But I had a more accurate test and was negative. It turns out that the majority of positive tests for SCL-70 using the method LabCorp and Mayo use are in fact false positives. So statistically speaking, you probably do not have scleroderma despite the positive test. Especially given that you do not have scleroderma specific symptoms.\n\nLots of good info here: \n\nSee if you can get the more accurate test. You can also look for a scleroderma specialist in your area; I did. They did some extra testing and made sure it was not scleroderma. So it is worth following up as a precaution, but try not to worry too much in the mean time It seems as if one lab has more sensitive testing vs the other. My rheumatologist preferred Lab Corp for all of his testing. I do not think it would mean you do not have an autoimmune process going on, but would be strange that this rheum would question the this new lab work. Maybe because you had mentioned what happened years ago?? I have a feeling you may need to start looking at other options after this, just seems weird to me. Do not give up or be discourage though! thanks so much.  When you say \"more accurate\" test, do you know what the test is called or what to ask for..or what the \"less accurate\" one is called so I can ensure I do not get that again? See the link I posted. If I am reading it correctly, ID is better than ELISA which is better than Multiplex; Multiplex is the least accurate.\n\n\"The best way to do this is to retest for Scl-70 antibodies at a lab that still does testing using the more accurate double immunodiffusion method. In the US, we are only aware of one lab that currently offers ID testing for Scl-70 antibodies, RDL Reference Lab in Los Angeles.\"\n\nI do not remember the details but I got the paperwork from RDL and got my doctor to order it. If you find a scleroderma specialist they might also have better testing.\n\nGood luck! thank you so much I just did some digging around and the anti-scl-70 test at LabCorp uses ELISA alone but what is interesting is that if the doctor orders a Scleroderma Comprehensive Profile blood test at LabCorp ( ( ) , they check all antibodies for scleroderma and it even mentions that for that test as part of this test, they double check using the ID method:   \n\n\n`Anti-Scl 70 are highly specific for scleroderma. They are present in about 20% of diffuse SSc, and 10% of limited SSc. The antibodies are associated with digital ulcers, Raynaulds, pulmonary fibrosis, renal crises, and heart disease. EIA testing can yield false positive results, therefore, all EIA positive tests are confirmed with immunodiffusion.`  \n\n\nWhereas if the doctor orders the  anti-scl-70  test alone (not part of the Comprehensive Profile test), it just uses the Elisa method with no ID confirmation. \n&gt;\n&gt;I would recommend that after these labs come back and this rheum says nothing needs to be done because you are not \u201csymptomatic\u201d, you need to be your best advocate and find another rheumatologist that will listen to you. This left untreated, will cause Irreversible damage. If you can start treating now, the better off you are to have a \u201cnormal\u201d lifestyle.\n\nI needed to read this today, so thank you.  I am struggling to get a referral to a rheumatologist from some professionals because I do not check all the boxes. \n\nIt is really frustrating because I do not want to have to wait until I cannot reverse things before I start getting things under control.    \n\nThanks again! This is good information. I have been testing positive at 2.3 for Scl-70 but negative for everything. The only symptom I have is mild joint pain but that is on 2 fingers that does not last long. I tested positive 13 years ago. Nothing has changed as far as symptoms. I have a new RA dr in October I had no inflammation markers on my blood test indicating Autoimmune. I would think my value would be higher by now but nothing has changed. I keep wondering as well like everyone else. I just saw a Scleroderma specialist in NYC and she confirmed what I had heard in the Inspire forums:  there are THREE blood tests for anti-scl-70 antibody.    The first being multiplex, then ELISA, then ID.  The ID is the most accurate test with 90%-ish accuracy and is not done unless specifically ordered.  The next is ELISA, which studies should can have a 40% false positive rate and then the least accurate being multiplex, which some studies show can have an 85% (yes, 85%!) false positive rate ( ( ) .     \n\n\nThe reference range for multibead/multiplex is 0.0 to 0.9 so at 2.3, it sounds like this is what you had.  If you had the ELISA, the positive result would be &gt; 20 so does not sound like you had that.    \nAt LabCorp, they even have a blood test that tests with ELISA and if that comes back positive, they test it via the ID method to confirm it ( that shows the confidence they have in ELISA :-/ )  The lab results state: **When Anti-Scl-70 by ELISA is positive (&gt;=20), a confirmatory method is performed to improve predictive value for the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis.**\n\n  \nIt is a shame they still order the multibead/multiplex method of detecting antibodies knowing that it can give false positives just so they can save money.  Anyways, try to have your doctor order the ELISA, or even better the ID, and see what it comes back as Thank you so much for the information. Yes I had the multiplex test. Every time I have my physical I request for an autoimmune test and it is been the multiplex since 2008 with always reading 2.3. It is never changed. I will ask my Dr to request the ID.", "Initial Labs Hi!\nI was referred to a rheumatologist by my derm because I had pain in one finger (I thought it was cell phone usage \ud83e\udd74) and sometimes tightness in my finger joints. I have Hashimotos, Psioaris- and my family is heavy with autoimmune disease like RA and my grandmother with Scleroderma.

Or is there a way to test positive for ACA and not have Scleroderma. My RA panel and lupus was negative. I am not sure how common it js to test positive for this antibody. \n\nThank you! Just curious to other people's experiences since I have to wait 3 weeks for some answers \ud83d\ude43 Hey there..\nIt is hard to say what we may actually have. I tested Positive ANA and Scl-70, 13 years ago. I had no clue what it was besides having mild joint pain. My dad has RA so I figured it was RA. Surprisingly in April I decided to google what I was tested for and read about Scl-70. My Drs never told me what I had and dismissed it. I went along with life. I went back and read all my labs in the summer and I had always been positive for Scl-70 through the Multiplex ANA at 2.3. It is never changed on the scale. I still have the same symptoms. Mild joint pain and heartburn which I can fully control not eating spicy food. I keep on reading about false positives through the multiplex is 80%. I will be seeing my RA Dr in a couple of weeks. I think my biggest symptom is Anxiety. Every sound, movement, pain makes it worse. \ud83d\ude10 The advice I got was to not jump into conclusions because it can be anything. Everything will be okay. \ud83d\ude0a Ah okay, my Scl-70 was negative but my Centromere Antibody B was high (lab says &gt;8). Thank you for sharing and good luck! I have anti centromere positive antibodies too but not at your level. Mine appeared this year following covid and Epstein Barr reactivation.  I have some of the symptoms for limited scleroderma but not all. Instead, I have Sjogren's! My doc ruled out the anti centromere without testing it and since I am waiting for more symptoms I have decided to relax, get into the scleroderma clinic when they can see me, and in the meantime focus on what this Rheumy has found. It took many years just to get the Sjogren's diagnosis because my body does not produce high antibodies and instead, I have the symptoms. But in your case, if you keep testing high for the anti-centromere antibodies and have scleroderma symptoms you need to find a scleroderma specialist. Also I have read the research papers like crazy on the anti-centromere antibody, and although highly correlated with limited scleroderma, it is also found in other types of scleroderma, and of course in Sjogren's. There are several antibodies that can be tested for but they should not actually be used to diagnose scleroderma. Scleroderma is diagnosed based on signs and symptoms. So you need a collection of them to make the actual diagnosis. A biopsy to affected skin can be used to get you under the scleroderma umbrella. If it is positive it will come back for excess collagen and could even be labeled morphea which is another form of sclerodermas localized form it does not mean you have morphea it is just old naming in testing sadly which causes misdiagnosis.  It does confirm you have a form of scleroderma though. There are quite a few scleroderma antibodies you can test for but most rheumy's do not even know them all unless they specialize. Most specialists wont use them to diagnose but it can give an idea of issues you could face and potential progression. So what you should be looking out for is the scleroderma symptoms like: GERD/acid reflux, GI issues, swallowing difficulties, shortness of breath, PAH, raynauds, and of course so much more which you can find online. Also just because you have an antibody does not mean the scleroderma will even become active. Also some patients have been diagnosis with scleroderma without an antibody.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can find more information on ( and the scleroderma education project. The scleroderma foundation has a youtube channel with all the videos from the conferences. I highly recommend giving the channel a look to learn more.  If you do get the diagnosis or have enough symptoms that you feel you have it having a diagnosis by a scleroderma specialist is recommend as well as treatment they are the experts.

There is a strong theoretical basis for believing that it will work for Scleoderma, because of the similar disease pathology.

I have been on methotrexate ever since then, and every time I seem to be improving, we switch to biweekly - and then things get worse and I am back to weekly again. Just had an appointment with my doctor and because I have been getting new lesions lately, I will be switching back to weekly after about 1.5 years of doing biweekly. I am just so tired and frustrated repeating this time and time again. Waiting and hoping for a magical remission, then being let down. Constantly worrying about new lesions and flare-ups, other autoimmune conditions, the list goes on. I do not know how much more I can take. And COVID certainly is not helping either, I am starting college this fall and all I want is to be excited about meeting new people but since I am immunosuppressed I have so many things to be worried about. Sorry this is not even a question, I am simply feeling sad and found this community. My family and friends are sweet, but I wanted to rant to a community of people who get it. 21F here. Totally get what is going on. Life with scleroderma is constantly a frustrating mess that feels really helpless. I was a full time student, just got my associates and am planning to start my bachelors next year. I was excited to start networking for my major, but I do not think I will be able to for at least my first two semesters because of covid. My scleroderma has been flaring up recently and I am in constant pain almost every day. It is exhausting and I feel so guilty for not being able to help my family around the house but at the same time my body just cannot take too much physical activity. I am currently looking for a rheumatologist, so i am not on any medication now but i have had plenty of times when docs saw improvement, decided to change the schedule, and then would change it back. I am sorry to hear that you have to go through this, it is not easy. Just hang in there and be strong. This will be a lifelong journey that we will have to learn to manage, but please do not give up. Every day you are getting stronger, although sometimes it does not feel like it lol. Sorry for the long message, i have a lot to get out of my system, too haha. :) You are in my prayers for healing and that soon you will wake up and all this will be just a bad dream. Do not give up.

I started with a tiny bump on my neck that spread into a very large plaque. A dermatologist originally diagnosed me via a biopsy. It seemed dormant for a while but now both of my nipples are being affected and a tumor was found on my adrenal gland.\n\nIs this typical of morphea? I just cannot seem to find much info on morphea with nipple involvement. Got an appointment coming up with a rheumatologist but it is a ways off.\n\nIm trying not to worry much and I am waiting on a bunch of blood work, starting to have muscle and throat involvement and lots of aches and pains. I had it start on my right foot, up my leg on the right side of my body just below the shoulder. In patches. Tried UV therapy to no avail. Considering tattoos to cover the scars. I have Universal Morphea (the systemic form of Generalized Morphea). It started as small plaques on my legs and arms that spread to cover most of my body in a symmetrical way. I was originally diagnosed with systemic scleroderma, but ruled that out because I have no CREST systems besides calcinosis and sclerodactyly. However, I am beginning to progress to internal involvement of the bowel and kidneys. Hey! So I also have a large number of plaques of Morphea, back, forearms, ankles (UV therapy also did nothing..) so I decided to try getting a tattoo over the smallest patch on my arm to see what happened. It was more painful over the patch and the ink did not take as well to that part but it seemed to work out.\nHowever, when I searched some forums about tattooing over Morphea (very few and very old forums) I saw that it could be risky and could potentially cause new flare ups. I decided to risk it and got my tattoo. However, after 7 years of being in remission, I ended up getting a new patch on my side 6 months later which I am now having to go back to hospital for. I have no idea if the two are related (tats and new flare up) but I just wanted to put this on here so you are aware! Morphea is a subtype of scleroderma so this is the correct subreddit.   \n\n\nThere are several different forms of morphea and probably even some that havent been documented. The main thing to note with morphea is it will never result in organ invoment. Sadly because the biopsy for any form of scleroderma can come back positive for morphea lots get misdiagnosed when they actually have a systemic form of the disease. That Is why its very important for diagnosis and treatment to be carried out by a scleroderma specialist. This is usually a rheumitologist that speicializes in Scleroderma. Some signs of systemic desease are: GERD/acid reflux, raynauds, GI issues, shortness of breath, skin thickening or sclerodactyly (morphea wont ever effect fingers see the scleroderma foundation youtube video from the scleroderma conferences these speaches are done by doctors. \"Localized scleroderma (morphea) by the Scleroderma foundation on youtube\"), PAH, lung fibrosis or fibrosis of internal organs. Morphea will only ever effect the skin and some underlying tissues of those with the deep version. Lots of us feel joint pain this can be globally or near our effected areas, fatigue is common it can be just general fatigue or muscle fatigue, we should all be expericing a form of skin thickening resulting from the excesses collagen in the area, this can also result in disfingerment and mobility issues.   \n\n\nAs for your rheumitologist if they are not a specialist in scleroderma please try to find one. It will be better for you in the long run. As for nipple involvment I havent seen anyone mention it before but checkout the facebook gruops: Morphea, Scleroderma, Scleroderma support group. Also throat involvment isnt a thing with morphea but the systemic forms this can be acid relucx or mobility issues of the esophagus that result in swallowing issues. Blood work isnt really used to diagnosis what type of scleroderma it can help but they look more for clincial symptoms it can mostly help once you have a label for progression since msot with certain antibodies progress a bit more similarily.   \n\n\nI personally had alot of joint pain around my effected ares so hip, knee, ankle, and toes. However, my knee was  the worst i woul be limping pretty badly but I wasnt super conerned I had rapid spreading of my skin being effected. It started with a loonie sized \"bruise\" that turned out to be a morphea plaque. I noticed the bruise stick around for a month and went that is odd but I have anemia so ill give it more time to heal. Then I noticed it stay for a month more and was now spreading and feeling thick this is when alarm bells went off and I scheduled an appointment with my GP for after my finals cause I thought if its cancer I need to finish my finals first. She was super facinated when she saw it and had no idea since it had a yellow tinge we thought my fat was doing something weird. She did a deep biopsie since we werent sure how deep it effected me. It came back postive for morphea and again lets not that means you can have anyform but neither I or my GP knew that at the time and she scheduled me to see a rheumy. I saw my rheumy Feb 14 she told me the biopsy actually only means I can have any form of scleroderma and she asked me alot of questions about all the common systemic symptoms which i wasnt aware of at the time I thought I had morphea and was very thnakful. She told me because I had head to toe intense itching and rapid progression she was leaning systemic scleroderma so we did all my baseline testing echo, PFT, xray of my lungs. She told me before I left id be starting methotextrate in a week if I was okay with that treatment and if it was morphea or systemic shed be treating it the same since my spreading was so intense. Mine continued to spread for a month or two but I noticed it had slowed down. She saw me every month she wanted to make sure she got it under control. As a young female at 22 I was thankful I had read how serious systemic scleroderma could be. More of my blood tests came back and I didnt have any other symptoms so right now my label is morphea but we arent sure if we just caught it super early and stopped it in its tracks so were being careful about it. My joint pain was still around with my methotextrate so we added hydroxychloriquine which stopped all joint pain that was left. I was also on presidone for a month to knock me out fo a flare.   \n\n\nFeel free to ask my questions but that is my story and tha advice I would give you I have a single large patch on my inner thigh, diagnosed by biopsy. Currently in remission about 4 years, no other patches. You can see where it was, but it does not look that bad anymore. For me I mostly have small patches on my abdomen and one on my back. The patches have never grown or anything that I have noticed, they all look like they did the first time I spotted them, but more keep popping up. Currently treating topically I was diagnosed with morphea 10 years ago.\nIt started with a small dot on my belly. In the following 3 or 4 years it progressed on my right shoulder and arm and a small dot on my foot and right thumb appeared. Since 5 years it has seemed to stop. I hope the optical shiny parts of my skin are the only \"problems\" that this disease caused/ will cause.... what do you think? Hey. I have covered up some of my scars with tattoos. I still have 42 hours booked in. Honesty feel so much happier already. I have tattooed over two of mine so far, if you look at my post history. one of my scars was under the ravens wing. and another at the bottom near the plants. It was more painful, but it is worth it to me. I have had new patches come up after 5 years with no new scars, but this was prior to my tattoo also. Mine feels like it is causing a lot of fatigue and joint pain. I have never had involvement with my nipples, diagnosed 12 years ago. Oh wow, that Raven is gorgeous! I am so glad that it is worked out for you. I am really keen to try another smaller piece (I have some patches on my ankles that I would like to cover) and your story gives me hope. Buy some TKTX (or txtk I cannot rememher) numbing gel. I used it for part of my tattoo and was amazed by the results - so much so I have ordered 5 tubes.

Hi All, \n\nJust embarking on the this new journey as my blood tests came back SCL-70 AB positive and antibodies detected via extractable Nuclear AB test screens.  Currently waiting for scans/tests to be done (but those are delayed due to pandemic).  \n\nBased on some personal research, the recommendation is to develop a solid care team with professionals that are knowledgeable about scleroderma.  \n\nI am a young adult, just got my career started and just kind of want a fighting chance before things get more difficult.  I thought I would jump the gun and ask to see if we can get a list of rheumatologists and professionals that you all recommend in your region/city, etc. If you are not comfortable sharing for privacy reasons, feel free to msg me personally and I will post on your behalf. \n\nThanks so much in advance and I fully intend to bring some of my tenacity to our fight. Ok. In Canada it is simple.\nMontreal : Jewish General Hospital\nOttawa: Ottawa General Hospital\nCalgary: Do not remember the name honestly, sorry.\n\nThese are the 3 hospitals with Scleroderma experience.\n\nThe Ottawa hospital is specialized in Stem Cell transplants. That is were I got mine, even if I live in a different provence, we moved temporarily for it. \n\nJewish General has the best Rheumatologist I have ever met. Specialized in Scleroderma and is currently researching a treatment to replace Stem Cell transplants. Trust me, you do not want to need one. Some U.S.-based recommendations based on some of my experience. Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center in Maryland, the Cleveland Clinic Orthopedic and Rheumatological Institute in Ohio, and the Scleroderma Clinic at George Washington University in Washington, DC. I can attest to the excellent care I received at the Cleveland Clinic for 10+ years: holistic, \u201clet us address this head-on\u201d kind of approach. No matter where you go, however, there are good doctors and there are bad doctors. My recommendation, for what it is worth, is to get in with a place and see how your first appointment goes. Remember that if you do not feel comfortable, the power is in your hands. The best advice I received from a fellow autoimmune disorder fighter: no one\u2019s going to care about your medical journey as much as you. Hope these suggestions help! Hi!\nIn Minneapolis I would recommend Dr. Jerry Molitor he is out of the University of Minnesota where he heads the multidisciplinary Scleroderma clinic. \nAlso I have started a podcast called Mogil\u2019s Mobcast. It is for Scleroderma patients family and friends. The first episode is my journey, I have had Scleroderma for over 20 years and can give you some tips on navigating the disease. Thanks so much to those who have submitted their recommendations.  \n\nAnyone else willing to chime in?  I am thinking with how a lot of preliminary apppintments/consultations are via telephone/remote, the more recommendations we have, the more helpful it can be for others too!\n\nThanks again and looking forward to other rheum/professional suggestions! I have not been impressed with the JH Scleroderma center with more than one doctor. They seem to be VERY conservative in their approach. Any time I bring up anything that seems to have shown any kind of benefit according to peer-reviewed research I have read I hear the same line: \"Well, that is not a first-line treatment for scleroderma.\"\n\nI respond with, \"Great. What IS a first-line treatment for scleroderma?\"\n\nThis is followed by some hemming and hawing and eventually it comes out that we are not going to do anything to try and treat the disease, we are just going to barely treat any symptoms and watch things to see if they resolve on their own. I have made it clear that if they have a treatment that they want to try that has proven reasonably safe for other indications I am about it. I have signed paperwork to that effect. Any treatment that I have been on that provides any kind of perceived benefit, they want to try to go without it.\n\nBest treatment I have had to date is the Oklahoma Arthritis center in OKC. The VA medical center in Indy was not terrible. Anyone with experiences outside of north america? Recommendations in Boston area? This is great to know! I had one appointment with one doctor at Johns Hopkins previously, and my impression was that they are very research-focused and less focused on the individual patient. This is to say that overall I did not feel like there was a lot of personal care. It was, however, just one appointment so others may have had other (hopefully better) experiences. These are good to know, thank you!  \n\nHoping mine doesnt turn out to be aggressive to need serious medical intervention.  The whole investigation process (i.e. the wait for other scans/tests) is pretty brutal.  \n\nKnow of any options for our western Warriors in BC?  If not, totally cool.  Just thought I would trigger further discussions/insight from others too. From my research Calgary is your option for stem cell transplant.\n\nI watched the movie brain on fire 2 months ago. When she started getting her scans I had a total break down and had to stop the movie. \n\nI agree with you. The tests are Brutal to go through. Hang in there. Thanks for this!  I have also read via preliminary research that the JH centre is solid for research.  \n\nAnd thanks for the words of encouragement.  I am losing my patience with my current practitioner, so definitely trying to take a more aggressive approach to finding proper care for myself. Thank you for the suggestion.  \n\nI actually got started on your podcast last week!  Lol.  Still new to the journey, so learning as much as I can. \n\nKeep sharing your journey :) As always, YMMV. I am also male and since something like 80% of scleroderma occurs in women that may exclude me from many studies, dunno for sure. Thanks for listening to my podcast. I hope it will help.

I have a positive ANA at 1:640, speckled pattern, which I believe is quite high. Positive Centromere at 63 (standard range is 0-50) and positive SCL70 at 5.3.\n\n\nThe only symptoms I have are mild Raynaud's and fatigue. I occasionally get heartburn. Based on the results my rheumatologist said I may develop the symptoms of scleroderma but not to worry too much right now, and she did not diagnose me with it. \n\n\nI have had an echo and CT scans of my lungs and a lung function test as a baseline, and they have all come back fine, thankfully. \n\n\nHowever I have been having unexplained shortness of breath for a few months (before I knew about these results) and issues with my lips losing color and looking purple/blue often. No one has any explanation for that, my bloods are otherwise good, no lung or heart issues found and overnight oxygen tests do not show any drastic drop in oxygen. \n\n\nMy rheumatologist is very good and thorough but I am obviously concerned About my high results. I am seeing her again in December, should I be asking for medication or anything to prevent it from progressing?\n\nEdit: also she did not specify the difference between crest and scleroderma, are there tests to specify which one? And would there be a way to see if it was diffuse? Do you have skin tightening? That is one of the signature symptom. \nGo to Facebook group, a lot of information there. No, I do not have any skin symptoms I have similar labs as you, ANA at 1:640, speckled pattern and positive centromere. I did come back negative for scl70 though. I do not think I have any symptoms though, as far as I know. I had some joint pain that started and got some lab work done, which showed my positive ANA and \u201ccentromere b associated disease crest.\u201d I also have heartburn sometimes as well, it only happens when I get super stressed out. I then went to an internest and he referred me to a rheumatologist bc my ANA and centromere b came back positive for a second time. I have an appointment with the rheumatologist next Wednesday. Pretty nervous tbh, I have never been to one or have had any health issues previously. Did she tell you to keep an eye out for anything? it is good to hear that all your lab work came back normal! I would definitely bring up any concerns you have with your rheumatologist. If you still feel like you did not get clear answers or are still worrying, maybe you could look into getting a second opinion. I would make a complete list of the questions you have for her, including the ones you asked on here. Ask all the questions you can think of I have shortness of breath due to POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) that is secondary to scleroderma for me. POTS can be caused by many things but since your lung tests were good I would keep an eye on your heart rate when you are short of breath. Without proper testing, you can do an at home \"pretest\" before mentioning it to your doc. Basically does your heart rate increase by 30 within 10 minutes of standing. If it does I would mention it. Just throwing this out there because it took me too long, years really, to find out the two were connected. Unfortunately with POTS and scleroderma, both are treated by symptoms, no prevention meds at this time, so diagnosis is not always necessary as long as you are seeing a rheumatologist on the reg.", "Flu like I was diagnosed in December with scleroderma.  We are not sure yet if it is diffuse or limited.  \nWednesday, I started to have a headache and assumed it was just hormones or not enough water.

Chills like I could not believe, a fever (high for me at 101) excruciating headache, body aches, joint pain, sore throat and just overwhelming exhaustion. I also have a bunch of ulcers on my tongue making it difficult to eat, drink, or talk.  This happened to me about a year ago as well.  I have had 3 covid tests (all negative) and a strep test which was also negative.  I am wondering if anyone\u2019s ever had this kind of thing happen to them? The ulcers are what scares me as sjogrens and lupus are the two that keep coming up in my searches and I know when my Rheumatologist was initially trying to figure out what was going on with my body those two were the other conditions he was looking for.

Last year i was told by a rheumatologist I had scleroderma based off of a Negative ANA (I have had my ANA tested 3 times, all negative) but slightly positive Scl-70. No other symptoms. I later got it rechecked a few months later and my Scl-70 was negative and my PCP said that these tests were prone to have false positives and that it is very unlikely I have scleroderma. I have had no other symptoms such as skin tightening on hands, raynauds, or swelling just occasional heart burn. \nThe skin on my face does not feel tight or anything, and I have no issues with opening my mouth. Well about a month ago this patch started to appear around my mouth (mouth does not feel tight or anything) but the patches are extremely dry and have to be covered in aquaphor to not flake off and look very dry. I have a very small patch on the other side as well but is not noticeable at all and is very small compared to the picture above. When moisturized, and not irritated, the patches do not necessarily look red like the picture (I had just exfoliated the dry skin off) but they look raised and will start to flake throughout the day. \nShould i be worried that this is scleroderma? Does this look familiar? I explained my concerns to My Dermatologist says that it is not scleroderma. she almost laughed at me when I Brought it up! She said that it does not present this way and that it is perioral dermatitis from wearing masks but the cream she prescribed has not helped! I go back to see her in a few days but I have been having some anxiety about this. And nothing I see on google explains this, especially rashes associated with scleroderma. From what i understand, the skin around your face will start to tighten, which causes the tight mouth, not necessarily raised patches of skin?

She has harlequin syndrome likely resulting from one of the several TIAs she is had as a result of her blood clotting disorder.

This winter has been brutal on my hands and toes  :( Do you need ways to keep them warm or hydrated or ulcer management? Warm!! My fingers hurt but I cannot wear gloves at work. Hand warmers, use gloves when going in fridge or freezer, gloves in every coat, eucerin intensive repair hand creme, neosporin and a bandaid on ulcers. These work for me. Check with your doctor for their suggestions. Would fingerless gloves be okay? I found some on Amazon and they help keep my hands warm while still letting me use my fingers to type or do other tasks. If I may ask, what kind of work do you do? I work in a molecular biology lab and I teach swim lessons on the side. Latex gloves make my hands sweaty but do not warm up my fingers so I usually just have to go run warm water over them whenever I am about to hop on the scope. Before I was diagnosed, would also warm them up by running hot water over them. So, I do not think there will be anything that can give you full, 100% relief, especially with my limited knowledge of what is needed in terms of your gloves and what you can touch while working, but I think you can manage it.\n\nFor the easiest solution I can think of, I would suggest looking up rechargeable hand warmers on Amazon. I would think you could easily sanitize the surface so you could place your hand on it, alternate your hands on it, or even cover it with some kind of paper to help with contamination management. Again, that would be up to your discretion of what you can and cannot do. Not really sure if this would help. Definitely cannot use it in the water.\n\nThe tougher solution is to ask your doctor if you can have a Nitro Bid ointment to use to help with circulation on your fingertips. I was given this to help heal ulcers on my fingertips and it definitely made my fingers warm when I used it. I think this would help you the most and you could take it off and reapply it after swim lessons.\n\nThe potential issue with it is how familiar your doctor is with it being used to help with scleroderma circulation and how willing they are to give you that for that reason. If you Google it, there is literature out there on how it is been used for scleroderma of that would help your doctor prescribe it to you. I would also be more than willing to help you find articles if you need help. You would essentially dab it at the base of each your fingers and cover it with a bandaid.

Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f Oh man i cannot get over the fact you remembered this post that is thoughtful of you I really appreciate it", "Ciclamini per la sclerodermia... ", "13 y/o male pos ANA and pos scleroderma AB IgG Hi, glad I found this sub, my nephew is having rashes all over and recently started getting swelling in his hands and was not able to move them. ER gave him steroids and did blood work. Today it came back with positive ANA and his knly other positive was scleroderma AB IgG his value was 1.3. My sister has a call in to the ER and her pediatrician trying to figure out what to do. Her pediatrician has her going to an allergist and dermatologist.  I told her to find a pediatric rheumatologist ASAP. Any other suggestions? Are there other tests she should be asking for? Just trying to make sure we are moving in the right direction. \n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA positive scleroderma antibody does not mean your nephew has it. You can have the antibody and never have scleroderma become active. Scleroderma is diagnosed based on symptoms and biopsy. They need to biopsy the affected skin, scleroderma will cause hyperpigmentation or hyperpigmentation of the skin as well as thickening. You will be able to feel its thicker from the collagen; like a scar. For a scleroderma diagnosis, the test will come back positive for excess collagen sometimes labeled morphea which is the localized form this does not mean he has this form and this is outdated naming in the tests which causes misdiagnosis of systemic individuals. So if the biopsy is positive they have the scleroderma umbrella label and can have any subtype. To figure out the type it will 100% be based on the symptoms and how the skin is affected. I recommend checking out the scleroderma facebook groups there is even one for parents with kids who have it. The groups have some really knowledgeable people even a researcher in the area. So my main thing here is do not panic. commonly see GERD/acid reflux, GI issues, swallowing issues, SOB, PAH, and so much more all caused by the thickening of organs. The systemic form has 3 main branches limited systemic scleroderma, diffuse systemic scleroderma, and sine scleroderma. Sine scleroderma is unique in that it does not affect the skin. Diffuse and limited differ on how they affect the skin. Now the antibody is not usually super helpful in diagnosis but it can give an idea of future issues and sometimes possible progression. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand this is a lot of information to take in when your nephew may not even have scleroderma but I personally find knowledge to be power. Once I knew more I knew how to tackle mine and all my options. I would agree pediatric rheumy is a good first step to figure out what autoimmune issue could be at play. If it does end up being scleroderma then finding a scleroderma specialist is ideal especially one who does it with kids. I understand that could be very hard to find. Id get a biopsy of the effected skin this could help rule out scleroderma but if it comes back positive find a specialist or someone who treated a bunch of patients with it successfully. swelling of my fingers was the first symptom i had with lab work positive for scleroderma. it was over 10 years before i had any hardening of my skin. more than the diagnosis, the important thing is that each symptom is controlled, especially in a young person who will be very active and putting a lot of stress on the joints in his hands.  i had raynaulds since i was in my teens so i had been to a rheumatologist for that already.  does he get any color changes in his hands when he is cold?  i wish you all well in this process.  it would be nice if it clears and he has no further problems, if not- communication with the dr is important.  if a treatment plan is not working let them know, if you do not they will figure things are going better. Thank you I shared your answer with my sister, we are glad to know we are on the right track. I really appreciate all the time your took to answer. Thank you, I will ask about raynaulds, I do not believe so but he is also a red head and extremely pale so it is possible if it is mild they have not noticed. I will tell her too look out for it. They were moving towards an allergy but autoimmune disease runs in our family (including my daughter) and I encouraged her to ask more questions and as soon as his hands swelled I knew there was something more, it was such an odd symptom. My daughter has a rare disease some I am helping her to be more proactive with the doctors than she is used to. No problem feel free to ask me questions and I will do my best to answer or tell you who to ask. Hopefully it is not scleroderma or if it is a more localized version but either way you have alot of knowledge now and the steps to go down So does scl-70 not necessarily mean you have got systemic diffuse? My wife tested positive for it but has no skin issues. She did have a persistent cough for a long time but she is been on gabapentin and the cough has not been a problem for a few months now Itd jsut one factor to consider but diagnosis of systemic scleroderma either diffuse systemic scleroderma, limited systemic scleroderma, or sine scleroderma. Is done based on symptoms and skin issues. Limited tends to take longer to show skin issues and sine has none. A cough can be a sign of many things from GERD to lung issues when it comes to systemic scleroderma. So having scl-70 can literally jsut mean you are a carrier. You can have thr antibody and never have active scleroderma which us why diagnisus is done based on symptoms.", "Pretty positive I have a mild form or early stages of scleroderma Hi all! I would like your opinion of some of the early warning signs of this disease. See the timeline below. 27F and showing syptoms of this disease. There is also a strong family history of auto immune diseases. \n\nAt 19 I switched birth control from the pill to Nuvaring. I was only on it 3 months but it brought out all kinds of problems. It sparked a new allergy to sulfate which I still have today. My doctor did not know exactly what was going on yet so they did a lot of blood work and I **tested positive for Scleroderma**. About a month later I could not handle Nuvaring anymore and stopped using it.  I saw a rheumatologist and they did more blood work. **Comes back negative**. Their conclusion was Nuvaring brought out underlying or dormant auto immune diseases and it went away after I stopped using it. \n\nAt 23 I started getting gastro problems and eczema. I was in school at the time and chalked it up to stress. And I noticed I was getting sick almost every time I would try and drink. Even if it were just one glass. I still have this problem and I still have eczema. \n\nAt 26 I start weightlifting and noticed my hands were really weak and could not hold heavy weights for very long and physically hurt after every set. Also started seeing a chiropractor (physical therapy for my neck) and noticed how inflammed my body was and how easily my joints pop and slip out of place. Loose joints and tight muscles. And I became very dependant on taking high doses of vitamin D2 at 50k UI a week because my whole body would hurt and my joints from the hips down felt like burning growing pains if I stopped taking it. \n\nNow at 27, I experienced Raynaud's 4 times in a week. Both on my fingers and toes on my right side became tingly and turned white. \n\nI see a doctor in a couple of weeks to be retested. I am pretty sure I have a very mild form of it. Even if I do not I am already changing my diet and exercise routine to help with inflammation. If I do have it, I consider myself lucky that it is not worse (that I know of). \n\nTldr: family history of auto immune, had a false positive test when I was younger. My symptoms are telling me it is real now. Seeing a doctor soon to be retested. Definitely sounds autoimmune related for sure. Keep up with the rheumatologists until you figure out exactly what is going on. Autoimmune diseases can have some overlap, so that can make it difficult to diagnose sometimes. Remember you can always get a second opinion from a different rheumatologist if you want. Keep a copy of all of your test results in the event a different doctor takes a look at what is going on. I hope you are able you figure out what is going on with your body. I believe that birth control and stress started my autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases also run in my family. I got Implanon in 2008 and within the year my symptoms began. Unlike you I had symptoms that I felt on the surface of my skin, intense itching and burning on my legs and abdomen. Then the dark skin discoloration began on the left side of my body. I quickly had the implant removed but the tightening, tearing, and scarring of my skin continued. I saw a dermatologist and that is when I was diagnosed with morphea, a rare type of scleroderma. It is been almost 8 years since the scarring and skin pain has stopped but the scars have remained and I now have ongoing joint pain. I find that managing my stress and staying off birth control have been beneficial. The correlation between our joint pain and taking birth control are similar. I hope you are able to correctly diagnose and manage what ever it is you have. Good luck and keep us posted. Great advice, thank you! \n\nSmall update, I had a re-exam with my chiropractor and I told her I thought I had an auto immune disease and she said we can test you right now. I did not even know they did that at my chiropractor office. Turns out she has lupus and is very aware of the diversity of auto immune. I see her again next week to go over the results. If it is positive then she will refer me to a rheumatologist. ", "Hermiston man deals with tough diagnosis ", "Morphea ?

She gets sick often because the medication they have her on leaves her vulnerable to disease. She is also recently had a blood iron infusion to help with her low iron from anemia. She has reynaulds as well.\n\nI do not know what to do. She is seeing the doctors a lot, and pretty soon wont be able to work.

I am in debt so I cannot really help pay for bills if she stops working. I do not know why I am writing this post, it is just hard to deal w this disease. I am so sorry for your mom's pain and the predicament it puts you in.  I have the morphea form of scleroderma (consider myself lucky as it is just skin related, but also with reynaulds) so it is painful and annoying but not life threatening.\n\nI can sort of empathize with your mom, and her other diseases but sadly have nothing to offer for advise.  Is there some long term disability she can apply for through her current workplace if it comes to that?  There may be disability payments available through social services (depending where you live?).  I think her doctor might be able to refer her and your family to organizations that are set up for this type of information- health, financial and patient support.  \n\nI am sorry for your struggles. My mother had systemic scleroderma. I am sorry to hear that yours does too. At home, it was me her and my little sister. Little sister put her head in the sand and did very little to help out. I essentially gave up three years of my life to be her carer, because if I did not who would? It massively impacted me at university. \n\nTo answer your post of not knowing what to do, there is not a whole lot that you can do. You need to keep in mind that it is nobody's fault that this illness has happened. What you can do is to be there to support her when she needs you, within reason. If you have family at home, then the support needs to be shared. It is important that no one person ends up doing the majority of the looking after. It is likely going to reach a point that your mother will need to be looked after. That is just how the illness is. \n\nI fell into the carer role by necessity, and then it became accepted. \"Oh, AndyF1069 is with her, we do not need to do this or do that because he will do it\". You are at college and working. It is important that you try to not give either of those things up. Your life needs to keep going as it is. I say that entirely from my experience and knowing what I missed out on and how far behind I am now that I am no longer caring for her. \n\nIt is difficult to give practical Scleroderma advice because everyone has their own symptons and it is likely your mother will develop more as time goes on. With my mother, we (me and her) kept her as warm as possible because of how cold she was always feeling. She had lots of ointments and lotions for skin care to try to ease her symptoms. She had lots of \"scabs\", particularly on her knuckles which caused her a tremendous amount of pain, so any amount of pain relief was a good thing. \n\nIf you would like to discuss your own situation further or ask me questions about my own, you are welcome to get in touch :)  I am so sorry to hear about your mom\u2019s struggle.  It can be a very frustrating disease because every single patient is affected differently, and many of the symptoms are really draining, like pain, fatigue, and gastrointestinal issues. \n\nI do not know where you are located, but has your mom (or you) considered going to a Scleroderma support group?  I find that other patients are often the best resource for advice and information.

Thanks From NIH rare diseases website: \u201cMost cases of systemic scleroderma are not inherited, but instead, occur in people with no history of the condition in their family.  However, several studies show that the risk of systemic scleroderma in first-degree relatives of people with the disease is increased and and a few cases of the condition have been reported to run in families, but there is no clear pattern of inheritance. Also, some people with systemic scleroderma have relatives with other autoimmune disorders.\u201d\n\nFrom my understanding since autoimmune conditions run in your family, you are likely at increased risk of developing an autoimmune disease, but not necessarily scleroderma. Also since you are a male your risk is much less than if you were a woman. I do not know, but my mother is dying of scleroderma and I have a few autoimmune diseases.

I am hoping someone here might have some insight/advice on what to look for next.\n\nBackstory: Originally I went to the dermatologist for what appears to be erythromelalgia (it is kind of like the anti-Reynaud's). From that appt, I got a positive ANA test and sent to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist checked me out and ran a bunch of labs including redoing an ANA titer. This is where it starts getting weird.\n\nANA came back high (1:1280), but the pattern was nuclear, fine dense speckled - which is apparently super normal and rare for scleroderma and related. The rheum said she would never seen someone get such a high titer, but normal pattern. I also got a really high SCL-70 (7.5). From what I have read, this can have false positives but it is less likely with such a high ANA? Every other blood test came back well within normal (the only one I have run across that I did not get done is RNApol III), including regular checkup blood tests.\n\nFor other Scleroderma-related symptoms, I have had minor Reynaud's for a long time (\\~15 years since first diagnosed), but it is not often and it is mostly the blue/red and rarely the white cutoff thing. I have always had pretty dry and itchy skin (allergic to dust mites and grass pollen, so I am just allergic to being places). I have never had GI issues, my blood pressure's always been nice and low, and I am hypermobile.\n\nSo other than the ANA and the SCL-70, which are both strongly positive, I seem to not have anything to indicate scleroderma? The rheum did not give me an official diagnosis, but still ordered a PFT and echo to have as a baseline. Does diffuse scleroderma sometimes present like this? Is there a chance the SCL-70 is still a false positive even with such a high ANA? Is there something else that this could be that I could look into/ask the dr about?\n\nThanks for any suggestions/input you all have! I do not have much to add here except that \u201cwnl\u201d is often \u201cwithin normal limits\u201d. Cannot promise that is the case here but\u2026probably. Okay cool, I had a hunch it was that, but I could not find anything specific to the nailbed cap test. How is that ANA pattern considered normal? And regarding the RNA poly 3 antibody of you have scl-70 you most likely would not have it normally people just have one antibody. Thanks for the response! Good to know about the RNA poly. As for the ANA pattern, my test results say this:\n\nNuclear, Dense Fine Speckled:\nDense fine speckled pattern is seen in normal\nindividuals and rarely associated with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome and systemic sclerosis.\nAC-2: Dense Fine Speckled\n \nIdk if that helps but that is what I have got to work from.\n\n(To clarify, I just meant the appearance pattern was normal, the titer is clearly not. The rheum even said that she would never seen someone with an ANA titer that high with this appearance/pattern.) Ok I have same pattern at 1:320 titer no specific diagnosis. I take plaquenil and Ldn medications I consistently get &gt;8.0 on the Mayo clinic scl-70 test and have high ANA (speckled). But mine is false positive... I went through numerous tests and I do not have scleroderma, thankfully. So it can happen. Here is a good source on false positives: \n\nI ultimately got my doctor to order the more accurate test panel from RDL reference labs and got a negative test. I have only minor, nonspecific symptoms of scleroderma (mild reflux, reynauds only one time)\n\nMy doctor still sends me for periodic PFTs just to be safe.\n\nAnyway, I think it is worth trying to get the better test from RDL if you can. This is really helpful thank you! Do you mind me asking what other tests you did beyond the one from RDL? Some kind of autoimmune panel from Mayo is what showed the positive ANA and positive scl-70. I saw a rheumatologist who did not really know scleroderma but ordered a pulmonary function test and high resolution chest CT to look for interstitial lung disease. In retrospect the CT was probably not worth the radiation in my case since my symptoms were so minor. I saw a scleroderma specialist who examined me and asked questions. They figured the test was probably a false positive based on my minimal symptoms, but they ordered a motility study and did a nailfold capillaroscopy (sounds scary but it is really just looking at the base of your fingernails with a microscope.) This stuff came back largely normal. It was a bunch, but good for peace of mind...

Throat problems, broken blood vessels in the face/fingers/legs? Or digestive issues? I have scleroderma and those are what lead to my diagnosis. But the dr can run an antibody test to see if you are scleroderma positive/neg. schedule an appointment with a rheumatologist. Honestly, This sounds more like psoriasis then scleroderma No Raynaud's, besides the patch of brown skin on legs no other dermatological skin problems. Maybe my hands are a bit red but it is hard to say my doctor does not notice anything there.\n\nAs for the other symptoms, I have gastro issues that is what scares me so much. I have had problems swallowing since March. It feels like food gets stuck in the chest and bottom of throat. What do you mean throat problems? I have to constantly clear my throat alot and have hoarseness, I have always attributed that to the silent reflux I have. \n\nI have also had my lung function test show mild restriction. But I have been told I did not do the test properly. You see why I am so scared cause all these things are adding up. \n\nWhich blood test is the one you are talking about? I just took blood work for ANA and Creatinine Kinase as well, are those the ones you were referring to? Throat problems how? Discomfort or issues swallowing? Interested to know if the swallowing issue is part of having it. I have noticed similar discomfort, even with drinking just water. (No diagnosis) have dr mentioned venous staining? White male here with scleroderma diagnosed 4 years ago.  I had skin involvement in my calf area but my skin did not present like your pictures.  The skin got super tight and extremely itchy.  I did have a few issues with swallowing early on. They were very isolated incidents.  I am curious as to why you had a PFT test already without any real diagnosis.  Are you seeing a rheumatologist or your PCP? No they were not quite sure what it was. I am seeing a dermatologist on Friday do you think theyd have a better idea?\n\nIf it was that any particular symptoms I would notice? What did your skin on your calf look like? Mine's not really itchy just dry hairless and discolored mostly. I guess it is tight too. Have had it for atleast a few years, it seems to have increased in size though.\n\nI got a PFT because I have had shortness of breath. That is why I have been so concerned. My anxiety definitely makes it worse but idk it is hard to tell if there is something wrong. I have had mild restriction on the PFT, I have actually done it twice and got slightly better the second time with mild restriction still. They both noted that I was not performing the test properly though. \nI have not been seen by a Rheumatologist, this is all from begging my doctors to give me these test. You think I should get a referral for one? I am really concerned I have a serious case of scleroderma The throat issues could easily be anxiety. Getting the same myself My skin really did not change much on my calves. I did have some hair loss but I attribute it to me scratching all the time.  The diasease presented its self in my hands at first.  They were painful and swollen at times.  The skin got extremely tight from fingertips up to my elbows.  I started getting raynauds a while after that.  From that point I was seeing a Rheumatologist and was put on a course of treatment. I highly suggest you find a Rheumatologist at this point.  Do your due diligence and find yourself a good one.  I had to go through a couple before I found one that knew what was going on with regards to Systemic Sclerosis.   On a personal note try to calm down and do not let this consume your day to day life.  Try to be positive as best you can until you get answers. If you do have systemic sclerosis you do not need the added stress and anxiety.  There are a few good Facebook groups also.  I would suggest joining them and asking some questions in those.   Also check out the Scleroderma.org website. They have a directory of rheumatologists that they recommend.  Send me a DM if you got questions and I will try to answer the best I can. I had swallowing issues too. I would not panic, but I am talking about the ANA test too. Also best advice I was given when getting diagnosed was this. I went to a lot of rheumatologist that kind of gaslight me into thinking that my disease was not real because they could not figure out what was wrong. So doctors have a way of making you feel like you are making it up and if they do that you need to go to a new one.\n\nLook up CREST syndrome with scleroderma. It involves the throat as well.\n\nI also would start focusing a lot on what you can do for yourself lifestyle healthwise because there is only so much the doctors can do. Like look up AIP diet! This will eliminate  inflammatory foods which helps your immune system out greatly. As well, go to a functional medicine doctor and they can test for SIBO and \u201cleaky gut syndrome\u201d which most doctors do not do. They will supply you with supplements and a better game plan as to what to do lifestyle wise. I was in critical condition until I did this and my gastrointestinal issues are so much better Yeah I could not swallow. Like food would get stuck in my chest and I would have to literally pound on it to get it down. I did a barium swallow test in that show that one of the speakers in my throat loss mobility due to  scleroderma. They did a simple procedure though and it is all good. But throat problems are really, it with scleroderma *Sphincters Have they done ANA blood test? That can be a great place to start to rule out autoimmune.", "Kristin Highland, MD: Practices and Metrics for Improving Scleroderma Care  This is such good news.", "Morphea and blood tests Hey everyone!\n\nMy wife developed some purple patches on her right leg in 2017 (a larger area on her thigh and some smaller ones down the same leg). She got the diagnosis as localized scleroderma/morphea back then and we did not really think more about it - she was also prescribed some cream, which did not do much to the patches.\n\nAnyway now, a few weeks ago, a new purple patch developed on her stomach so she went to the dermatologist who did some blood work. The results showed ANA positive and among the many tests I think DFS70 and anti-Ku were positive (SCL-70 was not). I think the titer was 1:100. Because she was ANA positive, the dermatologist also sent her to the rheumatologist in early May.\n\nShe does not have symptoms such as Reynaud's and her fingers look normal and has none of the symptoms for SSc actually aside from the patches. What do you think - is it probable she has systemic scleroderma at this point?\n\nThanks in advance Late reply...but were the purple patches biopsied? \n\nMy niece was diagnosed at 3 years old, first by a dermatologist who performed a biopsy and referred to a rheumatologist. Hers is very aggressive and she has been taking methotrexate for 18 years now as well as prednisone years at a time when extremely severe flare ups occur. She is needed two surgeries so far. \n\nMay I suggest, if the patches are growing fast that you try and see if the rheumatologist can see her sooner? The patches do not go away but will lighten and can cause permanent disfigurement. \n\nI am not a doctor and only basing my answer on my experience with my niece She was biopsied back in 2017. But we are not in such hurry because they are not growing fast, if all. A rheumatologist will see her in about a week. Our biggest concern is if it might me systemic sclerosis, not morphea. That is good news. My niece has linear morphea and we had joined our local chapter and went to Washington DC to advocate for research (funds for research). \n\nYour wife is lucky (in a weird way and please dont take offense), and Scleroderma is so hard to tell if it may turn to systemic. There is talk as if they are separate and my niece shows no signs of systematic...She is battled it for 19 years\n\nI am not sure enough research has been done to figure out if it will develop into systemic but it appears she has the morphea like my niece and although it can be debilitating, it is not always so, with the right doctors and medication.\n\nI wish her and you the best. \n\nPM for any questions Hello, At the beginning of last year when I started a new job. I started to notice a lump on my right side of my neck and I did not think about it, later down the track so I went to the doctor had  2 ultrasounds and he said do not worry about it it is nothing and anyway it kept growing for months i went back for a second opinion (Different clinic) the doc sent me to the hospital because he knew it was not normal. \n\nNear the end of last year November / December I started to see a specialist and I had 2 biospy done, 4 little pieces out for the first time and second time had to go deeper due to my neck is 2mm thick 7x7cm this was in the morning before I had my work Christmas party . I am on medication as well methotrexate prednsilone and ointment. It is the condition it is called linear morphea due to being on my neck it is affect my head movements I cannot barely look over fricking shoulder, all the physical work I do at work puts a lot of pressure is being applied\n\nI hope you are wife is doing okay  I am under the impression those with morphea are not at an increased risk of getting systemic sclerosis. I have been diagnosed with morphea since I was 14, I am now 27. I have gotten a few new patches over the years even after being told my condition was no longer active.", "Symptoms consistent? 10 years ago I got a hard line of skin on my thumb.. it is somewhat smoother not, but just last week I got another one on my left hand. \n\nOther things that are off are my digestion, a mild dry mouth and dry eyes, and tired all the time. I mean they could be consistent. Youd need blood work, biospy, capilary fold tests, and so much more to even beging to diagnosis if you have scleroderma and then even the type. Youre best off getting a biopsy of the changed skin. If you have scleroderma itll come back as excess collagen or morphea. Morphea in the test result does not mean you necessarily have morphea you can still have any type of scleroderma. Id see your GP and get the speciliazed blood tests since it can help seeing the right doctor as well as a biopsy. You can also look into the scleroderma foundation website and youtube videos. The localized scleroderma video from 2018 actually generalizes alot of the forms of the disease. Morphea itself doesnt attack the fingers so that would rule out morphea. Since youre having digestive issues id be concerned about the systemic forms of the disease: Sine scleroderma, Diffuse systemic scleroderma, Limited scleroderma, and Multiple connective tissue disease. It also could not even be related the skin changes and it might not even be scleroderma. Its just best to bring your concerns to your doctor and get tested.", "Possible scleroderma? So, I just need some opinions I guess. Back story is I have had many medical issues, not many real answers, and lots of questions. I have had ANA positive bloodwork multiple times, but also a negative one in between. With my most recent blood work I was told something about a pattern that is an indicator of CREST or scleroderma. I have dealt with pain for years now, muscle aches, joints hurting, migraines, and just a lot if chronic pain. I also experience nausea quite a bit, and vomit occasionally from it. I feel constant fatigue, and get spells of dizziness. My doctor said that I have fibromyalgia, which would explain my symptoms. With my bloodwork I was told that even though it looks like CREST/scleroderma, if I wasnt having all the symptoms not to worry. Ok, cool. But in the past few months I developed a spot on my hand that concerned me. First I thought it was a burn I did not notice, due to the color and shininess. But it is never gone away, and has even grown a bit. It is a line along my thumb and the skin is hardening. I have found similar lines that are not as noticeable, but are getting harder as well. It is similar to a callus in the way it feels, but looks like a healing burn or scar in color. I will try to post a picture. I played Dr Google and looked up something about lines forming on skin, and one of the possible things was sclero. I also have pain in my hands, mostly in the joints. By the time I am in bed my hands just ache and it hurts to straighten them. I deal with all over muscle and joint pain. I often feel like I have a burp stuck in me. No Ranuads, except for in my feet occasionally. I also have asthma, but it is mostly under control. So, does this sound like scleroderma?", "Retreat, Recover, Reinvent - My Scleroderma Journey-Past, Present, Future ", "Confused about blood work and diagnosis Hi everyone, hoping you can help me understand what my bloodwork means for the future. I have 1:1280 ANA and 2.6 AI anti-centromere B antibodies. Otherwise my blood work is all normal. Normal complements, no signs of inflammation, no deficiencies, etc. I am 35 years old.  \n\nI know ACA indicates limited systemic sclerosis. I also know that diagnosis is dependent on symptoms. At the moment, intermittent fatigue and low grade fever are my only symptoms (luckily!), and they are fairly mild. \n\nFrom what I have read, it sounds like I will not get an SSc diagnosis without more symptoms. But what does this mean for the future? Will I probably develop SSc later in life? Should I make autoimmune diet changes now to prevent the progression of the disease? I am really confused about what positive bloodwork means for the future. Thank you! Do you have Raynauds syndrome? I think pretty much everyone diagnosed with scleroderma has it. I think I am in a very similar boat as you! Same two blood tests always come back elevated and have been for about 8 years. No other major scleroderma symptoms such as raynauds or tightening/hardening of the skin, but definitely always tired and a few other random symptoms that could be caused by other autoimmune issues as well. Right now my rheumy calls it Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease, but that is about as far as I have gotten as she said there is not much else they will do if there are no major symptoms. \n\nJust keep taking care of yourself as best as you can and keep an eye out for anything new! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Yes I do! I should have mentioned that! It is quite mild as well. Thanks, this is super helpful! Makes sense that you get checked regularly and just keep an eye out. Has your doctor considered putting you on medication, like plaquenil? Or is that not an option because your symptoms are too mild?\n\nHave you found anything that is helped with the fatigue? I have been dabbling with the AIP and plant based diets and it seems like they have helped, but it is too early to say for sure. I have also read posts from people that say Wellbutrin or Adderall helped with their fatigue. My rheumy did put me on plaquenil and I think I was on it for about 2 years before I decided to stop taking it. One of the reasons she prescribed it was to try and target the fatigue but I did not notice much of a difference and I figured I did not need to bother taking it then if it was not needed. \n\nStill no luck with the fatigue issue! I definitely have more energy to get stuff done if I have taken an adderall, but I also have bad anxiety and the adderall can sometimes make it worse \ud83d\ude1d Anyway, you are not alone! The fatigue can be so frustrating at times. I cannot even remember the last time I woke up feeling refreshed! It sounds like maybe you have a mild form...I hope it stays that way, I have heard that it does for some people! For the limited form of systemic scleroderma you used to have 3 of the 5 symptoms in CREST to get a diagnosis. But I do believe this has changed. My first symptom was raynauds and I too ran low grade fevers around the development of it. I developed 4 of the 5 symptoms of CREST within about 3 years. But I did not get my bloodwork and diagnoses until later. Are you seeing a rheumatologist? I would recommend finding one who specializes in scleroderma if you can as it makes a huge difference. Treatment to slow the progression is very important in many cases.", "Does anybody here struggle with motility? And/or SIBO from the motility issues? I am feeling defeated. I have chronic SIBO from Scleroderma affecting my colons motility. I saw my GI today and he said I just have to take laxatives weekly now. The antibiotic that was supposed to help kill off the SIBO got rejected twice by my insurance... so now we are not even working on getting rid of the bacterial overgrowth. I am experiencing joint pain that keeps me up at night and I am 99% certain it has to do with this bacteria overloading my system and causing me inflammation.

Xifaxan has a few ways to save money; it might be worth seeing if any of them apply to you:\n\n(\n\nIf not, other antibiotics can work to fight SIBO, they just have more side effects. My GI did flagyl after my SIBO recurred...  it had side effects I did not care for, but maybe there are other options.\n\nMaybe your best option that is a lot cheaper than Xifaxan is herbal antibiotics.
