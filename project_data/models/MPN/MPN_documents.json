["20F with possible ET? Looking for other opinions! Not sure if anyone still uses this sub but it feels like the best place to post in. I think that I might have ET and I know none of you can diagnose me, but i am just looking for some input!\n\nI am currently 20 years old and my symptoms are bone pain that feels like the growing pains I would get as a kid, slightly swollen lymph nodes (Dr said CT scan showed swelling but nothing looked abnormal?), slightly enlarged spleen (getting a CT scan this week), pain under my left rib cage, tingling in my feet, mild chest pain, headaches (i have a history of migraines w/ aura) weight loss (from 114 pounds to 107 in 2 months), and of course: high blood platelets. My platelet count is not anything crazy though, in January it was 453, in July it was only 403, and last week it was 457. I asked my doctor about my elevated platelets and all he told me was that they could be caused by inflammation and seemed to brush them off. I read that birth control pills could cause elevated platelets, but the pill I take has no estrogen in it (progestin only) so I do not know if the one i am on would increase platelets. \n\nI have had blood tests for everything because of my symptoms. From mono to an autoimmune disease panel and everything in between. All of my results have come back normal, except for my CBC which shows elevated platelets.\n\nI am not sure how to feel or what is going on. My platelets seem to be low in comparison to those with ET or other MPNs so sometimes I feel like this is not worth worrying about, but then other times when I consider all of my symptoms I start to get really anxious over the possibility of ET or something worse. Does this sound like a type of MPN? Could I just have elevated platelets and not ET? How do I bring all of this up to my doctor when he does not seem to be concerned at all? My platelets were barely above normal when I was diagnosed. I do not think any of my general practitioners were too concerned. I was going to a specialist for another reason and he was diligent about me taking a blood test for Jak 2. You should have your doctor test you for that and CALR if you do feel strongly about it. I had never heard of ET previously and honestly it probably would not have been caught this early had it not been for that specialist. I hope you find out what is wrong. I have been there and it sucks feeling sick and not really knowing what it is/the doctors not really diagnosing you. 48M with ET. i was diagnosed with 1.1 million platelets around your age.  I just take some meds to keep them low and live a normal life. \n\nA portion of patients with ET have a gene mutation. In my case, Jak2.  Basically, my bone marrow is always in platelet production mode. \nMy platelets have been in the mid 400 range for the last 2 decades and my oncologist always says that is \"good\".  I can relate to the tingling but do not know what to think about the weight loss.\n\nSeems like they are monitoring you very well having three CBC tests since January.  If they continue to be elevated, ask your doc if a oncologist/hematologist would be worth a visit. A DNA test or looking at your bone marrow (platelets) under a microscope could be useful info.\n\nIt is frustrating to have symptoms without a solid diagnosis.  Your Doc is still gathering data. Perhaps your levels will go down on their own (bodies are weird)\n\nYou got me curious. If you are comfortable, post an update sometime 35 m y/o, diagnosed with ET JAK2+ last year. Five years ago my platelets were 450, two years later 550, at the moment they are hovering between 600-700. My RBC is also raising, was 5.2 five years ago, 5.6 now. I had similar symptoms, frequent headaches, migraines with aura without headache etc. These symptoms were resolved when I started to take daily low dose aspirin.\n\nLast year I lost 17 pounds in 6-7 months, but I believe my ET was not the only thing causing this. I was not eating enough after gym where I was doing a lot of running and swimming. Also I have been VERY stressed at that time. So you might want to check you lifestyle to address weight loss issue. I was able to regain my normal weight afterwards.\n\nYour doctors should check you for JAK2 and/or CALR and/or MPL mutation (blood test) to exclude MPN. The CALR mutation  is usually presented with higher platelet count. Also they can check your platelets under microscope, they do not look normal (have much bigger size) when you have an MPN.\n\nTake care I am 27 and they are hesitant to diagnose me because my platelet count is over 1 million, I have a slightly enlarged spleen, but everything else falls into normal range. Had an ultrasound for spleen.\n\nI just had a bone marrow biopsy that I have not gotten the results from yet.  They are testing me for myleoprolifertive disorder. I also have the JAK2 gene mutation. I also have a history of daily headaches. I think I have ET but my hematologist is very careful not to call it cancer even though web md is cancer cancer cancer. Once they get the biopsy results back, they want to send me to Hopkins to get a second opinion. thank you so much for the reply! i have a doctors appointment in november (possibly sooner depending on my abdominal ct scan) so i will ask my doctor i could be tested for JAK2 and i will be posting an update for sure!\n\nif i end up testing positive for JAK2 is that a confirmed ET diagnosis or will i have to get a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration? they seem so painful even the thought of getting one is kind of terrifying to say the least. JAK2+ is not a diagnosis. My local (smaller city) hematologist/oncologist thought it was ET and said I should go to Boston for a second opinion/official diagnosis.  Not sure if they still do this, but a team of doctors would get together, discuss new cases every week and make a team diagnosis.  What I am saying is that the process takes a while. Some months and a few referrals may be between you and a diagnosis if the evidence points this way.\n\nMy last bone marrow from last spring was not too bad.  They keep them forever, comparing to my first ones back in 1991.  This will check size and shape as well as for fibrosis (scarring that can cause blockage).  You would be a lot sicker if you had that.\n\nIt is hard, but try not to dwell on it too much.  I am sure you googled all about ET. The World Health Organisation recategorized ET as a neoplasm (cancer) about 10 years ago.  Previously it was called a disorder or a disease.  The websites that raise awareness and research call it cancer (give me money) while the major hospitals and cancer center websites still call it a disorder (having extra normal platelets is not actively killing you).  \n\nNot saying that it is not serious, but in my 28 years of sitting in waiting rooms for blood work at the cancer center, every other patient seemed a lot sicker than me.\n\nOther commentors seem to echo your experiences.  Perhaps you have it maybe its just an odd reaction to your birth control. IDK. yeah i guess it was pretty naive of me to think that something as complicated as an MPN could be diagnosed by just having a gene mutation. \n\nthank you for all the information though! i am getting an ultrasound on my spleen tomorrow (my insurance was taking too long to approve a ct scan) so i guess once my doctor calls me with the results then i will ask him about the possibility of ET and go from there. 52m Jak2+ and ET. Just starting treatment platlets at 850. Easier said than done but worrying does not help. I joined a few groups on FB and there truly is a wealth of relevant information. It is tough to find a lot about it, maybe because it is considered a rare blood disorder.", "26 with pv Hi everyone. I am a 26 Year old male. I was just diagnosed with PV. I am jak2 positive, with hemoglobin 17 and hematocrit level 50%. My doctor says that what I have is still very mild. I am only on baby aspirin every day, with blood tests every month to detect if my blood levels are getting worse or stable. \n\nPsychologically, I feel horrible. I am shocked to have such a chronic and dangerous disease when I am still young. I was counting on living long and having a productive life, but now I feel like I am going to die sooner and if not, I am going to live a life with considerably lower quality. \n\nI am happy to have discovered this subreddit though.  I am not sure if all these MPNs are cancers, as they are mentioned to be sometimes and other times it is just omitted. I hope they are not lol. \n\nAnyway, I would love to hear from anyone who has had any experience with pv as well.  Sorry to hear about your diagnosis at the same time welcome to the group. While some say MPNS are not cancers, by definition they are a cancer. An over production of cells. They are just not like traditional cancers. We usually are expected a long mostly normal life, with proper care. I recommend you find an MPN specialist. It is very important to keep our levels in check. HCT should be under 45 according to my doc, most say 42. \n\nBeing diagnosed at 35, last year, I completely understand your feelings. Read a lot, go to mpn research foundations website and learn. Go to one of those MPN meetings that incyte organises with voices of MPN, there is some good information. Above all try to stay positive, I know it is hard believe me. If you run out of people to talk to or just need another ear or friend feel free to reach out to me, PM me or anything, anytime. I would say welcome to our corner of Reddit, but unfortunately it is never good to be diagnosed with something like this. GunGeek below has said pretty much everything I would have. A Mpn specialist is definitely the way to go. Most hematologists/oncologists have some knowledge of the condition in my experience.\n\nI was diagnosed with ET at 29, so I understand dealing with this relatively young. It can be tough knowing you will have to deal with this the rest of your life.\n\nEven though our community is small, if you have any questions I am sure that someone would be glad to help.  I do not have pv, but I have aquagenic pruritis, which is a symptom of PV.  I get my blood levels tested yearly.   There are many people in my Facebook support group for AP, that also have PV.  Many have had pv for many years and have lived pretty healthy long lives.  With treatment, you can have a normal life span.   Make sure you keep yourself healthy with a good diet and exercise.   ", "I got ya homie! ", "27 years old with JAK2 I (27M) was notified that I have the JAK2 mutation. Only abnormality I had was a high platelet count which led to further testing. What does this diagnosis mean for me?", "Platelet and other CBC numbers To anyone who has ET apart from raised platelets were any other numbers in your cbc tests elevated or low? Like low MCV MCH MCHC and low normal HCT/ HGB? My hemoglobin is low with high platelets with CALR ET. My iron is low at 33L and mcv mch mchc low.. hemoglobin 11.8 borderline low and platelets 447k. I do not know what this means? Is this ET? If anyone has any sight it would be really helpful. Was at my doctor on Monday and everything else is within normal range except high platelets, low vitamin D and increased uric acid. Does anyone know if low mcv mch mchc and borderline low hgb hct and 447k platelets looks like ET? Iron total is 33L?? I am no expert, but it looks like things are not too bad. To know for sure you need a bone marrow biopsy and gene study. Mine showed up because my blood test showed \"nucleated red blood cells.\" They should be zero. I would ask my doctor to test for them. They may not even show up unless you have them. Or maybe if there is no mention of them you do not have them. Do you have night sweats or itching after a bath?  Those are symptoms. I would not worry yet but read up on ET and keep an eye on things. Maybe you could see a hemotologist, but your platelets would need to get considerably higher to really worry. Was ur mcv mch mchc also low? And iron also low? I do not have night sweats or itching No. Your platelets are not really too high and that is what ET is based on. No to both low iron and low mcv? Sorry for asking the same question again. Those are a big sign of ET. Ok thank you for that information. Last thing were mcv mch mchc iron.. any if these numbers low? They are OK. Thank you for replying back. Hope you are well. If you dont mind me asking how much was your hgb when they diagnosed ET? I do not remember. Low but not too low. Everything else was fine for me. I have elevated platelets sitting at 400k consistently. I did all the tests and ended up with the JAK2 diagnosis. Everybody is different though. See a haematologist and do all the tests On my CBC I normally have 12 things out of range. Ill have to find my paperwork, but my ET is categorized as Hemorrhagic. Mine:\nWBC high\nRBC low\nMCV high\nRDW high\nPlatelets high\nMPV low\n% Monos low\nAbsolute Granulocytes high\nAbsolute Lymphs high\n\nAll in all this was a good report for me. 447k is still in the normal range. My doctors would be thrilled to see 447k. Have you been diagnosed with anything? ET that is hemorrhagic. When I was diagnosed my platelet count was 1.3 Million. Iron anemia can drive up platelets a bit (reactive thrombocytosis). You need to have your ferritin levels done, get the anemia treated and then reassess your platelets. I have polycythemia vera. (My platelets were over a million when diagnosed and are now stuck in the 600s. My other blood counts were high as well, but not as dramatically (rbc, wbc, hemoglobin, hematocrit, monocytes and basophils).) In april iron total was 54 and ferritin 54 both low normal. Saturation 12 low but in September iron total went down to 33L. Do you think iron defi is causing elevated platelets? Yes, it absolutely can. When it is caused by iron deficiency anemia, it is called reactive thrombocytosis. \n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that your platelet levels should be consistently elevated for an MPN diagnosis. I cannot remember if you said whether they were they elevated on one test only? Or every test?", "Overwhelmed and having trouble processing Long story short my wife has been feeling terrible for years, we thought it was a neurological disorder but it turns out she is likely been suffering from the symptoms of MPV. She had a bone marrow biopsy done and we are getting results in two weeks but talk about taking the wind out of our sails. \n\nWe have young family and in our early thirties. I am trying to remain sickeningly optimistic that treatment can help and she can feel better. It is been tough watching her decline over the past couple of years and god dammit she deserves to feel better. \n\nThanks for the great info in this subreddit and it is looking like a lot of people turn the corner after treatment. Just so you know, once PV is being tested, you all can live a normal healthy life. You have your whole lives ahead of you. Thanks for the kind words. I hope you are right. I second this. Diagnosed with ET ~6 years ago at 33 with 1.1mil platelet count. It is being treated successfully with hydroxurea.\n\nIf she does have an MPN, it is serious and medical attention should be sought, but her doctors will likely be able to manage it.\n\nBest wishes. You will get through it. I also had over 1 mil platelet count. That is why my doc was concerned. MPNs are manageable. At that young age, I would ask about Pegasys since it can reverse the progression in some people. \n\n\nThis is a great list of questions for her doctor:\n", "About to start taking Hydroxyurea and I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences with it Hi everyone! I am 25 years old and I was diagnosed with ET about 2.5 years ago (JAK2 positive). So far I have been taking aspirin 1-2 times a day, and my platelets count has been rising steadily from 600 when I was diagnosed to 1900 today.\nAfter my recent blood tests my hematologist suggested that I will start taking Hydroxyurea to lower the count.\n\nI am a bit worried about the side effects of this drug, and the restrictions that come with it. My doctor also told me that this is probably going to be a permenant thing now, although I have read in a few posts here about people who only took it for a relatively short period of time.\n\nIf you take hydroxyurea or took it before, I would be happy if you could share your experience with it, particularly the side effects and how it affected your daily life if at all.\n\nAnother slightly unrelated question, I have not had a lot of symptoms so far but I do sometimes have moments of a mild (but annoying) dizziness, went to a few doctors and could not find a reason for it, and my hematologist says that it might be because of the ET. Is this a common symptom? And if so will lowering my platelets count help with it?\n\nTL;DR\nHad ET for 2.5 years and my platelets count just got to 1900, doctor suggested Hydroxyurea and I am worried about the side effect. \nIf you have experience with it I would be happy if you could share it. \n\nThanks in advance!", "COVID vaccines and risk of blood clots  For those who stress easily like me, this article is more of a reassurance that it is ok to get the vaccine.

I did have a rough day right after the second shot, but it did not last long.\n\nI would not worry.  It feels great knowing I am now protected.  \n\nI have PV, by the way. I got Pfizer, no symptoms at all from shots...Living with ET", "Waiting for my jak2, calr, mpl results... It is so frustrating not knowing. And I have nobody to really talk to about right now. I am not going to ask for a diagnosis on here, I just want to vent a little bit.\n\nThis year my gallbladder started to get infected and I had to have surgery to remove it. The surgeon said they got it all out, no more infection, no follow up measures. I was getting regular bloodwork a lot.\n\nMy platelets kept rising, we thought simply from the infection. But after healing from surgery, my platelets still continue to climb. My primary doctor referred me to a hematologist. We first retested to see if they were still rising, they were. I just took a blood test for the jak2 mutation and to see about ET, and I find it so hard to wait.\n\nIdk why my brain keeps wanting to tell me that my platelets have to be rising for a reason. The googling spree did not help.\n\nThen I see all of your posts. I have had the headaches and fatigue for so long but I chalked it up to stress or depression.\n\nI may know by Thursday. It is just really hard waiting. I will update with what the doctor says. I found out recently I have ET and jak2.  It is weird knowing you have cancer, but honestly the aspirin has relived many of my symptoms and I am not real worried about it anymore.  There is a good chance this mutation will be cured in the next 10 years, there is so much research being done on it.  If you have it, you have it and your life will not change much. What is being said on some of the groups I follow is that you live a normal lifespan with the Jak2 mutation. There may be medical intervention, for instance, I will be on blood thinners for life because I had a clotting episode and then was tested and found positive for Jak2 even though my blood levels are normal. I was diagnosed with ET five or six years ago, honestly I forget how long. I have the CALR mutation. Feeling fear and anxiety is perfectly normal and valid right now, and I will echo what others will say\u2026 This will not change your life much. Most days you will not even think about it. Hang in there, feel your feelings, and know that it is going to get easier very soon. I have just accepted that I am so happy I have found an explanation to my daily headaches. Honestly, the only thing that concerns me is if I want to get pregnant and we have not gotten them stable enough to decide it is right to be able to treat me without drugs. \n\nI take hydrea, and Emgality for migraines. I have PV.  I am in the same boat right now. I just had blood work done for the jak2 mutation and am awaiting the results. It just sucks not knowing and having to wait. Luckily though, from what I have read, it seems to be a very manageable illness and unlikely to progress.", "Anyone got an MPN diagnosis AND clean genetic tests? My spouse has a mystery anemia/enlarged spleen thing happening and our latest rabbit hole is a likely MPN (spleen is trying to produce blood, other symptoms are consistent) BUT bone marrow and genetic tests (including JAK2, JAK2 exon 12, CALR, and MPL) come back clean. I am not looking for a diagnosis, I want to hear if anyone else has been on a similar journey and wound up at an MPN.\n\nThank you! Triple negative is possible for MF.  Ask about Ruxolitinib/Jakafi.  It is a JAK signaling inhibitor, but you DONT need the JAK mutation for it to work. What he said. \n\nAlso, def possible occurring in 5%-10% of cases. \n\nBiopsy will certainly shed more light. \n\nBest of luck on your journey I am triple negative. First I was diagnosed with MF but my current diagnosis is PV. Triple negative is a term in essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis that means you are negative for the JAK2, CalR and MPL mutations. It does NOT mean you had a negative bone marrow biopsy as well. Bone marrow biopsy is definitive. I suggest you join this Facebook group for secondary polycythemia and undiagnosed and see if they have any insights for you. They are very knowledgeable about the gray areas and should be able to point you in the right direction.\n Yep, that is me.  Triple negative MF.  Am 51(f).  Otherwise really healthy, but was having a lot of bone pain, took a year for me to finally find a wonderful MPN specialist who did a bone marrow biopsy on me (which no other hematologist wanted to do since all my genetic testing was negative) and was finally diagnosed correctly.  My doc lectures all over the world on MPN\u2019s.  She said I am only the 2nd patient she is ever had with this and no genetic mutations.  So that makes me in the lucky 5-10% group. Am in the early stages and am taking PEGASYS as there are some studies that show taking it early can slow down the progression.\n\nHe definitely should see an MPN specialist and get a bone marrow biopsy to get a definite answer. How does that happen??  I have only ever heard of you either have Primary MF, or secondary (PV or ET that transitions into MF).  I have never heard of it transitioning the opposite way. \n\nHow were you diagnosed with MF, through a bone marrow biopsy?   And so your bone marrow has stopped progressing with  becoming fibrous??  Or has reversed??   I have never heard of that.   I would love to learn more.  Thank you. So I was originally diagnosed when I was a teenager and have had something for about 12 years now. It is possible that I was misdiagnosed with MF when I was going to childrens oncology (they do not see too many children with MPNs)\u2026 I have had probably 10 or so bone marrows and when I was originally diagnosed I did have fibrosis. After treating my symptoms over the course of a few years (basically maintaining my platelet count at normal level) the fibrosis went away. My latest bone marrow from about 2 months ago showed MF grade 0!! \n\nI have been seeing an MPN specialist for about a year now and he is fairly certain I have PV. As of the last year my red blood cell count has occasionally gotten a tad bit high which seems to further confirm I have PV. Started pegasys a few weeks ago and working on getting off anagrelide. Oh wow, that is so interesting.  Thank you for sharing!!   A PV diagnosis is much better than having MF, so I am happy for you that however it happened it will be easier to treat and a better prognosis.   Good luck to you!!", "Just diagnosed today. I was just diagnosed or at least half diagnosed with an MPN today and was glad to find this subreddit. I am 35 and have been confirmed with the JAK2 mutation. They do not know yet if it is ET or PV but the doc was surprised to find it in someone my age and says \"we just caught it very early\". If it was not for a head injury that I sustained in Feb of this year I would not even know about it. My daughter now thinks im an Xmen because she heard the doc say I have a genetic mutation. I am just starting to learn about it and wanted to say hi and join the ranks here on reddit.  Oh I thought it was pretty ironic that I was diagnosed in September. This is not a very active subreddit, but welcome anyway. Sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I have been diagnosed with ET for 8 years or so, so if you have any questions, I would be happy to answer what I can for you. Unfortunately we are not X-Men, some people get eye lasers and we get super clotting blood. \ud83d\ude11  Welcome to the club! I was diagnosed with ET about a year and a half ago. Aside from some occasional bouts of fatigue (and the admantium skeletal system), I would never know anything was abnormal. LMAO That was my daughter thought too Sorry to hear of your diagnosis. I am a graduate student studying new potential treatments for MPNs. Treatment development is always slow but I wanted to encourage you that new treatments are being pursued!

I am having trouble finding information online. I see some sites say \u201csometimes\u201d. Yet a lot of people I have come across online have all progressed to MF. I am just confused. I am so young and in my 20s. No diagnosis yet but soon. High platelets for years with no known reason... and because I am so young I am worried I only have a good 20 years left before it progresses. Or even less than that since I have had high platelets since I was a kid. Currently reading a forum that states medication will not stop the progression. So does this mean that eventually we will al progress and if you are lucky you will not for a long long time? I was diagnosed at 24. I gave up looking for information on long term prospects.\n\nTo me it seems obvious that the longer you have the condition the more chance there is it progresses but the only number I have been given is the chance of progression on average despite the average age of diagnosis being something like 60+\n\nI try not to think about it now. My counts are in the normal ranges becuase of treatment and I am hoping that while they are there is no extra stress that would cause progression. It is actually a very small percentage of people with ET, who progress to MF, but your still higher risk than the average population, so you need to be aware and have a bone marrow biopsy done to check for any pre-cancerous cells. You may have have to search around the internet, look for a trusted source like mpnconnect, but the information is out there. I have had ET myself for over ten years diagnosed,  guessing more before.\nCant tell you how many hours I have spent googling stuff, when I fall down the dark hole, trying to get answers.\nTook years before I was put onto MPN Voice, did me the world of good,  even went to one of their forums (I live in the uk).\nSo did i find the answer , no. But have learned.\n\nYour not at high risk till you hit 60\nYou have about a 10% chance of it turning into leukaemia \nIs ET going to kill me, no, but a heart attack, stroke or thrombosis might , when your older \nSo you need to look after your health, like really, that is your best bet What kind of medication are you on? My platelets have been high 400\u2019s-500 since I was younger. It is never gotten as high as others buts it is never been normal for 5+ years either and steadily increasing. It is 502 now. I am thinking of taking Natto supplements. I saw a Facebook post of someone using this for years and their ET has gone into \u201cremission\u201d. Wish I would have saved the post Should I get in contact with an MPN specialist after my diagnosis? Or is that not necessary until later down the line? I read online the best MPN specialists are in Memorial Sloan Kettering and I happen to live an hour away. Thank you. That is how I feel right now.. in a dark hole. Facebook groups make me feel worse there is always a new post about someone getting worse or progressing. I will check out MPN Voice Felt bad last night for not adding more to your question. It really is a head fuck trying to get to grips with  this \"disorder\". I cant even decide if I am allowed to feel ill or hard done by. The first few years after diagnosis I kind of buried my head in the sand. Even now very few people know about it.  But a couple of years ago ( after the MPN Voice forum) I got a new purpose in life, it was to take back control , and start to live the healthiest life possible.  \nI realised that getting diagnosed young gives you the  best chance of not getting ill later.  At the forum there was  lots of slightly older (beening nice here) ladies ,that did not have a clue anything was wrong with them till they had their first stroke or heart attack.  So I have made it my mission to preempt the unhealthy lifestyle choices most people make.\nI sometimes think it is done me a favour, I am forced into exercise,  eating really well etc. I even stopped drinking, a bit excessive I know, but I am Scottish and was getting major hammered,  alot!!\nI just need to know for my own peice of mind that I have tried my best. I sleep better now, I feel more in control. \nTry not to Google the hell out of it, I do everytime before I get my bloods taken, like falling down a deep dark whole, with still not enough answers.\nI am sorry you got this young, but a fat , smoking 60 year old would not fair as well as someone that has looked after themselves. \nStay positive,  stay healthy \ud83d\udc4a I plan to do the same. Will be changing my diet and lifestyle. Also will be implementing Natto and Limu Juice into my diet, I do not remember where I have seen the information but there were like two people with ET who has gone \u201cinto remission\u201d with these foods or it at least has helped. Good luck and thank you! Facebook groups are the worst.  When I was first diagnosed with PV I looked at a few of the FB groups and they were full of people who seemed to be loving making a drama out of their illness, and overexaggerating the severity.  People can have serious symptoms, but plenty of us live perfectly normal lives with very few symptoms.\n\n  \nThere is some evidence emerging to suggest that interferon therapy can improve things (perhaps even to the point of remission) rather than simply dealing with symptoms - there are side-effects to that, though. Yes. Definitely see an MPN specialist. For what it is worth, I am 41 and suspect I have had it since I was about 21. I am doing just fine right now and have met many others who have had ET for decades. See an MPN specialist, maintain a healthy weight, exercise, and try to have a lower stress life. They do not seem to know really what the chances of us progressing are because most are so much older than us when they develop it, but I do not think it is a for sure thing and definitely not anytime soon. You are at a higher risk for strokes, heart attacks, etc, so focus on that right now! Are you jak2+? Or calr+? JAK2+ Btw there is a medication that has shown to put people into remission. Check into interferon with your MPN specialist. Are you taking interferon?\n\nI am jak2+ as well. Found out 10 years ago\nOnly HU is covered by insurance here. Not yet, but I will try it in 2021. I have a surgery coming up (not related to MPN) that I would prefer to wait until I recover from before introducing interferon. I am not sure my insurance will cover it either, but I am not willing to take HU at our younger age. We dont have mpn specialist here unfortunately. \n\nMy first hemo wanted me on HU/Anagrelide ASAP (platelet 700k) and the other said no need for any meds as long as your CBC is stable (not even aspirin).\n\nIn the end I decided not to take any meds. I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you could chat one on a video consult somewhere else. It could benefit you for that someday. \n\nSounds like you have a good plan for now. I take a baby aspirin daily, but since you are young and 700k ish platelets I do not see why you would need HU either unless you are in the high risk category and have had a past clot or something. STAY AWAY FROM THE WWW. DR. GOOGLE HAS  NO DIPLOMA AND HE HAS ONLY  \nPATIENTS WHO HAVE THE WORST DISEASE. The thing is that this is a disease more often found in older people, so all the numbers are based on people in their 60's.  There is so little data on younger people that no one really knows what the chances are and whether it is age related or time from onset related.\nLike others have said, I have also searched and searched with no solid answer, which means that no one really knows for sure.  All we can really do is try to take care of our bodies and as grim as it sounds, be prepared that it might happen one day. I have been over a million for a year and I am still on Aspirin.  I think it depends whether you are experiencing other symptoms that may affect your quality of life or put you at risk of thrombosis OR if it continues to skyrocket.", "Interferon (Pegasys) is making me feel awful. How did you guys deal with side effects of this drug? 26 yo female, diagnosed with Essential Thrombocythemia seven years ago. I switched from taking Hydroxyurea 500mg daily to Pegasys. \n\nI started Pegasys six weeks ago, 180 micrograms per 1 ml, once a week. The first time I took it I was fully expecting to be knocked out for a few days. To my luck and surprise, I was only symptomatic for about 24 hours. My subsequent injections did not produce ANY side effects. Naturally, I was deliriously happy because most people are just about bed-ridden on this medication. \n\nThis past injection, everything changed. I went from experiencing zero side effects to having all the common issues with this medication. Fever, headache, dizziness, nausea, joint pain, ringing in the ears...you name it, I had it. \n\nGross alert: I also had my period this past week. I lost maybe double if not triple the amount of blood I normally do. I am guessing the interferon also inflamed my uterine lining which caused it to shed more. As a result of this, my blood pressure got really low and my dizziness is worse. I stopped taking aspirin as I assumed that was also making me bleed more. \n\nThe good news is, my platelet counts have entered normal range. Thank God. I do not know if that means that my disease is \"retreating\". My doctor said that interferon can make the disease go backwards. \n\nI am seeing my hematologist tomorrow. I am probably skipping my dose this week (regardless of what he says). I may even skip it next week too. \n\nWhen I inject myself again, I think I want to go down to half the normal dose. \n\nWhat is your guys' advice on making yourself feel better on interferon? Actually, any advice at all is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance, kind souls. Hi pretendWasabi\n\nI am was on Peggy for a while and am also around your age (27 now). I found the symptoms were worse when I was changing dosage but found it to have a negligible effect otherwise.\n\nI startered at 135 and have tapered down to 90 then fortnightly and now I am not taking anything apart from aspirin.\n\nI used to take mine Sunday night. Originally I took it with paracetamol but I gave up on that pretty soon. If I did feel any symptoms I thought they were worst on the Tuesday\n\nDo not know if any of that helps 30 year old male, similar situation, been on Pegasus for about 7 months now after switching from Hydrea. I have tolerated the acute side effects pretty well. Lots of sleep on the day the injection, low carbs during the week, do not smoke or drink at all if you can help it, and definitely not for a 2-3 days after the injection. Take Tylenol if you need it. Hopefully if you are getting a good response, your injections will be less frequent. I have heard that moderate cardio on the day of the injection can actually help your body tolerate it better so I am experimenting with that. Best of luck to you! That does help, thank you. And that is great that you are only on apsirin now! Did Pegasys really tame your platelet situation? Okay, that makes sense. I think I need to adjust my diet now that you mention it. Thank you :) Your dose is too high. I am on 45mcg weekly, had very mild flue like symptoms without fever once. After 7 weeks my platelets down from 700-800 to   350-400.  Hi there! I am 33 &amp; have PV, so a little different since it is taming my RBCs, WBCs, and platelets. My platelets may not have started from as high a number as yours. \n\nPegasys has worked great for me so far. I started at 90 mcg once weekly. Occasionally, I will experience some side effects - mostly just at the beginning, and before we decreased my dosage. The second week I was on it, I was SOOO itchy (pruritis was one of my biggest symptoms before diagnosis). It was like all the cells getting killed off were letting me know how mad they were. \ud83e\udd23\n\nBut luckily that was a one-off; it is effectively nixed all itching and my headaches associated with the PV. The only recurring thing that happens is every other week or so, I will have a little tingle of a sore throat the morning after injection. We do it right before bed so I mostly skip feeling funky. \n\nI hope you adapt quickly / your numbers get to a place where your doctor is willing to decrease your dosage. IMO it was worth it. Good luck!! Sorry for late reply. Yes it did. I am now stable at \\~350 - \\~450", "Need some info- Hey all. My FNP just ran a MPN panel and it looks to be negative. The lab was not able to load the results into the system but she called and they told her negative over the phone. She has not reviewed the actual report.\n\nMy RBC count was 5.8, hemocrit was elevated, iron was as low as 28L ( serum iron) , an enlarged spleen 14.9. cm, and uric acid was 7.6. Also calcium was a tick off at 10.2\n\nAll of that together made her test  for blood cancer. I was also tested for Multiple myeloma and bone cancer. \n\nI have been on Lisinopril for 20 years and Omeprazole for almost that long. \n\nThe PPI can cause an absorption problem and lisinopril can effect kidneys long term. \n\nI not looking for a diagnosis just any thoughts on next steps. \n\nI am asking for a referral to a hemotologist. \nJust for another set of eyes on the blood work. I am not a doctor, but if they have checked for things like jak2 then maybe this could be secondary polycythemia. Do you smoke or have any symptoms of sleep apnia or COPD? There are quite a lot of secondary things that could cause raised blood counts, but which can be easy to treat, but your doctor does need to identify the cause. It sounds good that they are ruling out the most serious first but speaking to a hematologist would seem wise. Thanks. Non smoker. Apnea. I have not been using my cpap. &gt;I have not been using my cpap.\n\nThat can cause high counts and put you at higher risk of a stroke etc, so you probably need to get that CPAP sorted. It is still wise to do the other investigations though as you want to make sure there is nothing else. Yep.  Probably secondary polycythemia then.  And exactly what munehaus says Did you get any more results from your lab work? Did they test for JAK2 mutation? The MPN reflex panel that includes that was negative. Still not sure why my bloodwork is upside down.", "Feeling better while exercising? Hi all,\n\nI am being referred to a hematologist for unusual blood work. My hematocrit and hemoglobin are too high, but my platelets are too low and ferritin are normal to a bit low. These results have been gradually hanging around and getting closer to outside normal limits to out of range for many years until they finally became abnormal enough and my doctor took note.\n\nFor what it is worth I have always been a bit curious about my blood work as it is counter to what I would expect as a lifelong female vegetarian. \n\nOne physician suspected polycythemia.\n\n I am a 38F that often feels generally unwell (headache, tired, feverish, irritable, sensory overwhelmed) despite looking very \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\nOne constant in my life has been that I feel much, much, better while active or working out. \n\nNormally I would think it would be the opposite - if you feel unwell while resting or doing the usual things like working, then you feel too unwell to exercise.\n\nJust something I am curious about how f there could be any relevance to my blood work! I do not know anything about blood work as mine is almost normal except my plateletes are too high, but I have a similar experience with exercise. I am always tired, often feverish, I feel heavy, cannot breathe, feel like my heart will give on me, etc. But exercise makes me feel energized and light as a feather. Yes. The best recommendation for fatigue by MPN experts is exercise! Yeah, I have been hitting the gym 4 days a week the past 3 weeks and I have felt better than I have since before my ET symptoms first started 5 years ago. Exercise is the best MPN treatment. When I get joint pains, the best thing for me to do is push through it.

Six months ago, my hematologist said that my platelet count had stabilized. Great news. My most recent visit confirmed a stable platelet count, however my hematocrit levels are now increasing. Doing a little digging, I have found that my symptoms are much more in line with PV than ET. I am not panicking or anything, but was hoping one of you has had experience with this type of transition and can offer some advice. ", "Diagnoses today Hey! I (31F) got diagnosed today with ET. It was flagged from a blood test done in May and I finally got tested (lots of blood draws) this month. I am asymptomatic, no headaches, blood clots, itchy skin, and I have never had major surgery. I do have the JAK2 mutation and platelets in the 600s. The doc said I was low risk and to take chewable aspirin every day. I have to go in every six months and get my blood checked. \n\nIt is not that serious, or it does not sound that serious for me, but I am having a hard time wrapping my head around the idea that I have a slow form of \"cancer\". I know I will probably be ok, but I am just stressing a bit. \n\nI guess I am just writing to put some thoughts down and get some clarity. Resources moving forward would be helpful. Hi!  I got my diagnosis at about 34.   Not fun, but you have great perspective.  You have to join healthunlocked/mpnvoice.  It is amazing.  The message boards are ridiculously helpful!  Lots of great info.  \n\n\n I got a diagnosis at 27 of PV. My platelets were off the chart at over 1 mil. But my doc sent me to another specialist because I was the youngest she would seen with the disease.  Showed up on routine bloodwork at GP. \n\nI am being treated with Pegasus and Hydroxurea but right now , my bloodwork shows no symptoms so my hematologist said to stay off of it and then check in a month. \n\nI am mostly asymptomatic. So you were on hydroxyurea due to how high counts are? I was told I did not need it yet and might never. Yes. For about 6 months, then restarted. My counts as of my last blood test on Thursday are staying at normal though. They had me on Pegasys because they thought I might want to get pregnant. I was told to maybe reconsider birth control cuz it raises potential for blood clots. But it was not critical cuz my condition is not critical. Just something to consider for the future. Ask your Doc about JAK inhibitors.  There are clinical trials investigating ET and JAK2 inhibition. CAL-R mutation, 37yo, diagnosed 5 years ago, 1.1 mil platelets at the time.\n\nI understand your concern. Just make sure you are taking your medication and getting your blood tests as directed. Every time I see my hematologist I ask her if I should expect to live a normal life expectancy. Every time she says yes. I (31M) was diagnosed with ET/PV 7 years ago now. Those are not bad platelet counts. I was diagnosed near 1 million and prescribed Hydrea. I have struggled with some depression and mental cloudiness, but I honestly think that is the Hydrea not the disease. I usually do not even think about having a disease, despite the fact that it is technically cancer. I am glad you do not have symptoms and hope you can continue to manage with only aspirin. Sounds like you will be fine!\n\n( is a cool site that aggregates news stories for MPNs from the web. You will see news about ET, PV, MF and AML. I look around for new research now and then. Sounds like there is a good course plotted for more targeted therapies with fewer potential side effects in the future.\n\nWish you the best! Always feel free to message with me questions or if you need someone to talk to about it.", "Thrombocytosis for over 2 years? Hello friends \n\nSo I am not too sure how to explain things in a tldr... But I will try my best! \n\nI am 29f, hypothyroid, iron deficient anemia, consistently inconsistent blood test results, and sinus tachycardia, JAK2 negative. \n\nI was referred to a hematologist because my blood test results were always all over the place and my platelets we are always 500k+. \nIt was determined through a lot of testing that I had iron deficient anemia and I was treated IV fereheme in January of this year. It seemed to definitely help improve my quality of life a bit, but that wore of rather quickly. \nMy platelets reduced to almost 400k for the first time in a really long time so we figured my elevated platelets was due to untreated anemia. \n   That is not the case though, \nI get blood tests often for several reasons... But once every 3 months for my hematologist. \nMy platelets went right back up to 450k in a matter of a week. \nWhen my platelets are on the lower end of high, I can definitely feel a difference with the way I feel. Like, I just feel better somehow when its lower. \n\nAnyways, \n\nmy platelets have been elevated for over 2 years now and no matter what, I constantly feel absolutely terrible. \nMy hematologist is only concerned with my anemia and nothing more, but I really feel like my elevated platelets have something to do with my near constant inflammation. I have brought it up to my PCD and she seemed a bit concerned too... I have so many symptoms present pretty much without a known cause. The only consistency is my high platelets. \nMy thyroid is under control, I drink way more water than anything, my diet has been improving because clean eating def. makes me feel better, anemia is controlled... \nSo what is the deal? \nAlso when I explain the pain I experience, it really depends on the day. The best way I can describe the pain I go through is that it is inside my bones. My actual bones hurt. \nI do daily stretches and a few times a week l do some low impact work outs. \n\nSo I just do not get what the deal is. \nI see my hematologist again in April 2022, and I hope by then there will be some focus on reducing my platelets. \n\nHas anyone been diagnosed with ET or Secondary ET being only about 150k above the normal expected platelet count and negative JAK2? \nDoes anyone have any suggestions or other ideas? \n\nMy doctor is starting to put me as more of a priority patient as time just seems to be proving to her that I am not getting better and I am only getting worse... \n\nI am just at a loss. \nShould my hematologist be paying better attention to my platelets, symptoms, and my concern? \nShould I be concerned? \n\nMy immediate family all suffers from fibromyalgia and other easy to diagnose illnesses, but I am the only one with things far different than them so going to them for guidance or anything does not really help me because they too literally do not know. \n\nThank you for reading! \nAnd thank you in advance for responses \nWell wishes friends xo I am Jak 2 positive. Maybe you should ask your Dr. about a prescription of Hydroxyurea. It lowered my platelets substantially. At first I felt really tired and queasy when i started taking it, but now I have adjusted. Good luck to you! Also, have you joined the FB Thrombocytosis page? They have lots of information. I have actually been taking a mental health break from FB for the last few months, but I will definitely get back on to join that group! \n\nThank you so much for your input! Were you tested for CALR, MPL, THPO, or TET2 mutations? Only about 50% of ET patients have the JAK2 mutation. 70% of those negative for JAK2 are positive for CALR. Your PCP can order these tests, a JAK2 cascading reflex test would run through the most common. \n\nFind an MPN specialist (believe me, not all hemotologists are MPN \"literate\", and some can be nearly useless). Here is a list of specialists in the US  Thank you so much for your help and input! \nI have not been tested for anything else you mentioned, but I will bring them all up to my doctor when I see her next. Good luck! It took me a few years, and various doctors being useless, to get a diagnosis. My PCP stayed on it, believed me when I told him something was not right, it was invaluable to have that support from at least 1 medical professional. Unfortunately the closest MPN specialist is 5 hours away, and without reliable transportation I do not think I will be able to go to one. \nWhat drives me nuts is that my doctors are all through University of Rochester and RIT, and because of that I would think I would have some of the most knowledgeable medical care around. Like the campuses are right in the city. \nThat aside, I have a small surgery coming up on the 20th and I am curious to see my blood tests before and after  and how my body will respond. \nI will talk to my doctor soon about MPNs and that I think it is something really worth diving deeper into. \n\nI am desperate for answers. \n\nIf I need to find other doctors, I will do it. \nI am so annoyed at how slow moving everything is. I second MPN specialist. Maybe try a video appointment if that is possible.  In addition to the other mutational tests suggested, I would ask if a biopsy would be warranted.  Best of luck. Also there is another list of specialists \n\nIf you are in Western NY. \n\n You are the best! I literally cannot thank you enough! \ud83d\udc96 My pleasure. Best of luck getting to the bottom of it, best to go with the specialist of specialists.  Cannot be too careful.  Push, push, push.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsincerely-\n\npushy internet stranger I also had the bone pain you mentioned and my doctor said it was a side effect from your platelets being mass produced by the bone marrow. I drive far away to my MPN specialist. I only have to see her twice a year so it is worth the hassle. Unfortunately, that is not a vetted list of vetted MPN specialists. It is just hematologists that a forum user recommends. The PV reporter list linked earlier is a vetted list.\n I have no idea why I forgot about video appointments \ud83d\ude39 Fascinating! That makes perfect sense, too. \nIt is such a unique pain that (most) people just do not understand what I mean when I say it. At first *I* did not even know what I meant when I said it. I keep forgetting that there is medicabs available to use Vetted is probably always best, but if someone is unable to travel far distances, I think it is at least prudent to see someone who the patient knows at least has some experience with MPN's.  But hey, there is all sorts of arguments for and against this I suppose. I am Just trying to encourage to seek potentially a more \"thorough\" opinion. I am sure I am echoing advice other posters already gave. But there is other mutations that are not JAK2. I have the CALR mutation which was not discovered until the past decade. So, when I first started going to see a hematologist a few years ago for my high platelets he also tested me for JAK2 (negative) and told me mine was secondary thrombocytosis. He just was not up to date on the science enough to know about the newer mutations. Eventually he tested me for the mutation and did a biopsy. Hopefully you can get a second opinion from another doctor that would be willing to at least test you for the other mutations. :) Good luck! I hear you. After going to 3 clueless hematologists, I now travel to my MPN specialist, but I am fortunate to live where I do. They wont prescribe HU at OPs age and current platelet level...especially since hes already anemic. The best thing here is to address the anemia and determine if the platelets are just reactive. Since your platelets dropped when your anemia was being treated it doesnt seem likely that you have ET. Most likely it is reactive thrombocytosis from your iron levels. Also, your platelets are definitely in the normal range even if a little high.", "JAK 2 positive. What does this mean? I am sorry, how do I interpret the JAK 2 positive results? My doctor just started his vacation. \n\n\nJAK 2 v61f detected. \nExon 2 no.  \nCarleticurin exon 9 no. \nMpl w515k/L/a 5505n no. \n\nConsistent with a diagnostic of myeloproliterarive neoplasm. \n\nSorry for the typos It is a mutation that can manifest into different forms of cancer like ET,  PV of MF.\n\nFind an hematologist that is specialized in MPN cancers.   This link to the national institute of health is helpful.  Hang in there.  My diagnosis was about 1 year ago. What I do not really understand is which of the MPNs I suffer from? What triggered this and the only value that remained high was platelets. Everything else stabilised. So it is ET?\n\nI am so frustrated that in the day I finally got my results, the doctor took a vacation. &gt;I am so frustrated that in the day I finally got my results, the doctor took a vacation.\n\nI have one, but exactly the day I got my results, he left on vacation for a week. I know that one week will not make a difference but I just want closure. This has been going for so long now. That is very frustrating.  My diagnosis of ET was not complete until I had a bone marrow biopsy to determine whether or not the marrow had turned fiberous. The way that I understand it, they do not know what causes JAK2 mutation.  It does not necessarily appear to be hereditary.   My platelets have bounced around for years. I am glad to have a diagnosis and treatment. What was your platelet level when you were diagnosed?\n\nI was initially going to get a bone marrow test, but the doctor told it is not necessary. I have read the symptoms of ET and I have kind of had them all. I cannot say that I have had any from the other MPN but if reading Web MD taught me something, is that if you want to find that you are sick fo something, you can make it happen.\n\nStill, I had the burning extremities and so on. Also, platelet count was what triggered the investigation. I have read quite a lot on this by now and I guess ET is not that bad.\n\nIt is better to not have it but between this and other cancers, ET is a low impact disease. \n\nWhat treatment are you on? I am on Plavix at this moment, without aspirin. I have started this before the tests. \n\nI feel calmer about all of this now than when I started. I just want closure. The doctor explained to me that it can be one of those three MPNs and that leukaemia does not work this way, my platelet would go down, a lot, not higher. \n\nSo yeah, strange - but getting the results today, actually lifted a big weight of my shoulders. I was expecting them because the last test results suggested to a MPN, especially ET but I can finally let go, well, mostly, because I still need to know if it is PV or ET or the third one (even though, technically...\n\n... they are treated the same way, right?\n\nI mean people die from this because of heart problems, stroke or heart-attack. \n\nI guess I am not looking for a medical diagnostic here, I just need to talk to someone. Call the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society at 1-800-955-4572. Tell them your story and they will send you helpful literature and connect you with someone who has been in your position who will answer your questions and give you advice and support. Highly recommended. The website is LLS.org. If you have high platelets and normal everything else, ET is the most likely form of MPN. It is also the least serious, usually. My platelets were in the upper 400s when diagnosed but I have been in the 800s.  About 10 years ago I had thyroid issues, which elevated my platelets but they never went back down to normal.  My biggest symptom has been fatigue.  \n\nI am currently on 81mg aspirin daily and 1000mg Hydroxyurea 5 days a week.  The doctor had me change the dosage a couple of times in the beginning but now my platelet levels are normal.  I still have some fatigue but part of that might be because I am 50.  I definitely feel better overall because there was a while when I felt too tired to do things that I enjoy. \n\nI believe that one potential treatments for PV is bone marrow transplant.  I am not sure medication-wise.  It is always possible that it ET could develop to PV but I try not to focus on it.   \n\nAnd yes, if there is a cancer to have to battle,  this one seems more like a lower case c rather than the big C. Thank you! My GP said it is most likely ET. He arranged all the tests and so on but the oncologist is on vacation. He was happy to see the results so I guess it might just be ET. He explained to me about HX but also told me some people are allergic to it so it is a personal choice. \n\nMaybe this is the end of the story. That would be nice. To just take anti platelet and let it be. This has been officially the scariest month of my life. \n\nWithin one month I...\n- feared for HIV (as what prompted all of this was blood tests when I took PEP). That is fine. I still have to take a follow up test but I can let it go. \n- feared for brain cancer / als because of my constant twitching especially head side. Took an MRI. It is fine. They are fine now. \n- and feared for some form of aggressive cancer. I was afraid of lung cancer or some others that are associated with high platelet count. So seeing the JAK 2 mutation results actually gave me relief. It is done. I know. \n\nI have no idea which of the MPNs is but the lab test results said ET, the GP said ET and the oncologist said it is either ET or PV. So I guess ET? \n\nIn any case, I have finally had the first good sleep in forever. I am glad to hear that you have some more peace of mind.  Merry Christmas to you! Sorry to hear. I am JAK2 positive, 30 year old male, been dealing with this for 6 years. My platelets were near 1 million at the time of diagnoses. I took Hydrea for about 6 years (until this summer), then started Pegasys (interferon alpha).\n\nYour doctor will likely start you on Hydrea. You should follow whatever treatment they recommend to get your blood count under control in the short term. If you are young, I would HIGHLY recommend looking for a doctor that specializes in MPNs, and asking about starting PEGASYS injections instead of Hydrea. If you are able to tolerate them, they seem to be much more promising as a long-term treatment, and some patients even go into remission with interferon.\n\nI have followed ET and PV research for several years - if I can ever help, PM me. I have a great doctor, but the problem is that most oncologists/hematologists handle such a large variety of cancer cases, they will not always have the latest research or in-depth experience on MPNs. I hope you find the information you need to be well. The 2016 WHO guidelines and NCCN guidelines mandate a bone marrow biopsy. The reason it changed is due to misdiagnosis: cases of polycythemia vera masquerading as essential thrombocytosis, and cases of early myelofibrosis being missed. Find an mpn specialist. This disease is rare. Ordinary hematologists do not see it enough and do not keep up with the latest developments. List of mpn specialist here\n Update for everyone - I have had my final visit with this oncologist.\n\nHe decided based on my metrics, age, lack of prior issues that I should stay on aspirin and do blood tests every three months. No further treatment needed. He also confirms it as an ET and does not think a bone marrow test is necessary right now. \n\nSo, I guess that is all for now :) Just an FYI ET has to be diagnosed with a bone marrow biopsy.. its also very very helpful to get a starting point as far as if their is any scarring in your marrow..  I had one and it showed positive for ET (triple negative for mutations) , I am on aspirin only and will continue to get bloodwork every 3 months and bone marrow biopsy again if my bloodwork or symptoms change. That way they can compare to see if it is progressing That is a battle for another day. I am backpacking around the world and been doing this for a while. This means I have to change specialists often. I will do this with my next CBC. The doctor told me there is no need for a bone marrow biopsy at this time but I have realized that eventually, I need to get one. Have a blast backpacking! Eventually, when you settle, Try to find an MPN specialist as they will be most knowledgeable about these weird ass disorders lol. Thank you. \n\nHonestly, I know I should settle and find a specialist and manage this. At the same time, I have realized that while this condition may be nothing (and compared to most diseases, ET in its benign form is harmless), it could also mutate into leukemia or cause bone marrow scarring. \n\nAnd this means my life expectancy would go down dramatically and there is not much I can do about it. From what I understood there is a 3% chance for ET and up to a 10% lifetime chance for the other two to mutate. \n\nSo, I will just make the most of my life while I can. I certainly hope that I will live to 80, and the odds are extremely in my favour but I will treat life as I do not have that time remaining. \n\nI will not say that this diagnostic was a blessing because it is not. But I also realize I problably had this for years or a decade or even all my life and I have just discovered it, so apart from knowing about it, nothing really changed. So, I am just trying to make the most out of this situation. Let us both hope we will take an aspirin until we are 80 and that nothing will change. That is what I am hoping for! I am 36 and we noticed high platelets last year.It was my first ever CBC so I have no idea how long they have been high. I am pretty asymptomatic so who knows.  ET was just confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy last month. Getting the diagnosis scared the hell out of me at first, but I had to remind myself it is just a name to something I have had for at least a year and was not bothered by it. I cannot let a name scare me.  I do think we are lucky bc a large chunk of people find out bc of strokes and clots. At least I can watch for early signs and being monitored every 3 months I can hopefully avoid it altogether:)", "ET and Acute Visual Changes My father (74yo) has Jak2+ ET.  His platelets have been very much controlled with HU.  He has had a lot of problems with acute vision changes.  He will have acute onset blurred vision in one eye that does not immediately improve.  He sees a retinal specialist who does injections of steroids and vascular inhibitors almost every 2 weeks now...but it continues to recur.  \n\n\nAnyone with ET have any experience with this specifically? If his platelets were uncontrolled i would attribute the vision problems to that...but they have not spiked in a very long time.  Any input would be appreciated. I feel like I have vision changes in one eye that seems to come and go. I also have low platelets counts. I went to my optometrist and said there was not an issue with my eyes. Would love to have an update if they can get to the root of the issue. Female 48/et/Jak positive/ 14 years now.\n Before  diagnosed I had what I thought were 'silent migraines '. It would start as a crest of light in both eyes and then change into a total blur in my central vision,  would only last about 30 mins, but as I used to cut hair it happened a couple of times at work, was a scary experience. \nSince diagnosed I just take an aspirin a day, never had the visual disturbance since. \nThink it is just one of the symptoms of ET. Thank you for responding!!! But yeah, i definitely think it is associated with the ET.  He takes the asa and HU though with normal platelets and is still having regular problems.  \n\nFrustraring for him because his heme/onc and retinal specialist disagree about the etiology.  It is a tough disease.  Thanks again for the response! When the vision changes came on, I would try sit quiet and have a bit of chocolate (any excuse). They go in about 30 mins.  But yes, visual disturbances are related to ET.\nSound like when it is all under control he sound feel much better.  Kind Of hard to deal with a blood disorder no one really knows about.\nGood luck too Maybe it is the medication? I never had migraines until I started meds, and sometimes they are \"silent\" and just those visual disturbances. My specialist attributes my migraines to medication, but I guess there is no way to really prove it.", "Miserable So, for those of you who do not know my drama here it is. \n\nWe currently live in South Korea for the army.  I had a total hysterectomy last October (I am 34), and since then have been feeling terrible. A few years ago, I started having dizzy episodes that felt like a \u201cwave\u201d but it was brushed off as hormonal. \n\nNow I am having full body aches. Like the flu. Or growing pains. Super easy bruising and insane,  severe itching that has no rhyme or reason. My face flushes and its painful. I am so so fatigued, and my hands go numb when I sleep. \n\nH/h is no where near as terrible as some people who have PV. Highest 17 and 47. Jak2 and exon 14 negative as reported from a Korean doctor. He told me my symptoms do not match? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEpo in August was 5.7, but my most recent one was 2.4. Korean hematologist wants to wait six months to do another CBC and repeat EPO. \n\nI do not want cancer. But I cannot live like this for another six months with no answer. I have reached out to my doctor here and have yet to hear back. I am going to ask for testing for Lyme disease, RA, lupus....I do not know what else. But I need help. Any suggestions?\n\nI am just lost. Super depressed. Also seeing a psychiatrist. I used to be a triathlete and half marathon runner. Now? Cannot even walk up the stairs without feeling like I am a 90 year old woman. Which MPN do you have? I could not follow the initials. Have not been diagnosed but they are ruling out polycythemia Vera. Do you have high platelets?  Normal or low platelets would probably rule out essential Thrombocythemia. Platelets have been on the high end of normal Sorry to hear you have been going through all that. Because you have a negative JAK2 mutation and hematocrit below 50 it does not sound like PV but the low EPO might indicate otherwise. I am also interested in what your platelet count is. If it is high you could have JAK2-negative ET with some crossover symptoms resembling PV. There is honestly no way to know for sure unless you get a bone marrow biopsy. \n\nAll your symptoms do not sound like they are blood-related though. Unfortunately, they are pretty vague...I would suggest getting several blood tests including a Complete Metabolic Panel, iron/ferritin/Vitamin B12/folate, thyroid hormone (free T4, TSH, and thyroglobulin antibodies), Lyme disease, and an ANA. If calcium, sodium, potassium, or thyroid hormones are abnormal you should see an endocrinologist. If ANA is positive, you should see a rheumatologist. If iron/ferritin/B12/folate are abnormal you may have anemia (but this is unlikely considering your hematocrit). You may also want to see a cardiologist to make sure your heart is ok. You can also see an ENT to have inner ear vestibular testing called VNG. In addition, a neurologist could check you out and may order a brain MRI. I would not wait 6 months for repeat blood tests. I would get every test I can now to get to the bottom of it and stop the suffering. Good luck!! :) I cannot see any reason to be concerned about MPN. It is very rare and you have no blood results to indicate it. Use your energy to look down other avenues. CMP, Akron, b12 and folate are all normal. Ent has not seen me, but I had an MRI done to view my inner ear. Labs for ANA and RA are pending. \n\nPlatelets have been anywhere between 330-350. Hm well your platelet counts are normal and your red blood cells are borderline elevated. Since you are JAK2-negative this sounds to me like secondary polycythemia. But your EPO is low...very strange! If you smoke, are dehydrated, or live at a high elevation you may have boosted red blood cells but EPO would be higher too. Your EPO dropped so much in a month. That seems unlikely. PV would take years to do that to you. I think you should get the test redone again in a few weeks (not 6 months). You could have something environmental affecting you too. It is hard to say.\n\nAs for the other symptoms, infectious disease is a possibility. I do not know what South Korea has but I am sure you were vaccinated before being deployed there. No fever, vomiting, or diarrhea makes this less likely though. Could be neuromuscular-something like fibromyalgia? You may want to see a neurologist. Itching and flushing could be caused by an allergy. You may want to go get allergy testing done. An MRI shows internal ear structure but not function. You may need a Videonystagmography test or Visual Evoked Potential test to make sure the inner ear and eyes are functioning properly. Just throwing out ideas...that ANA test result is important! Stay positive! You will figure it out! Thank you! I will bring these up next week", "Another ET Voyager Hello everyone! I am new to this sub-Reddit \\ as well as Reddit itself, so please bear with me if I seem a little bit out of it.\n\nI am 72 years young, and have ET, JAK2+. I was diagnosed in late 2016, but a review of my blood tests from earlier indicate an above normal platelet level since 2013. Like most, I was scared at  first, thinking that this was the end. I had some sort of blood cancer. It did not help when my first visit to the local cancer center - Mountain States Tumor Institute \\ here in Boise, Idaho - included a visit with the social worker. She was very friendly, tried to put me at my ease, but nevertheless was quite insistent that I have a plan for the end time, and wondered whether or not I would made plans on how to pay for my treatment in the event that I . . . By the time I had my blood drawn and saw my hematologist/oncologist, I was in quite a state. I am willing to wager that the first words out of my mouth, after hello, were, \"Am I going to die?\" My doctor responded, \"Yes, of course. Everyone dies, but hopefully not today, and certainly not from this disease if you take care of yourself.\" Then we got down to the business of learning what Essential Thrombocythemia is, and how to treat it. That was the beginning of my journey, the details of which I will be happy to share. I have that. I was diagnosed last year at 68. I am CALR+. Of all the Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, this is the \"good\" kind. Baby aspirin can prevent a lot of potential problems. If you take a medicine to slow down the proliferation, it may cause anemia. You will need to find a balance. There are probably not many symptoms. Night sweats is one. The percentage of people with progression to myelofibrosis or leukemia is low. Good luck! I have PV, JAK2 positive but not very severe (after half a dozen venesections early last year to bring my haematocrit down, I went eight or nine months before the next one).  I find the framing of the disease fascinating - it seems to be routinely described by American doctors and charities as \"incurable blood cancer\" which to my mind is unnecessarily alarmist even if technically (maybe) true.  In the UK, there is more nuance - my haematologist was very keen to reassure me that it is not cancer, and that although I was going to be treated on the oncology ward that was just because that is where they deal with haematology problems too.  Now maybe my haematologist was not being totally technically truthful, but in terms of the experience she was more accurate than doctors who give the impression that an MPN diagnosis is on a par with being told you have leukaemia or myeloma.  The other interesting thing is the \"how to pay for my treatment\" question, because of course in the UK that simply does not arise.  I pay 95p a month for some low-dose aspirin, and a few pounds for car parking when I do have to go in to have another 450 ml drained out of my arm, but that is it, everything else comes out of general taxation.  My platelet count is too high still, so the current haematologist is talking about hydroxycarbamide, but even then it is \u00a39 per prescription (I pay \u00a318 for a month's supply of statin and blood pressure pills), and if I persuade my GP that it really is cancer, prescriptions are free. From what I have read, the CALR mutation is indeed the 'good' one, if you accept the premise that your DNA is essentially mounting an attack on you! The 81 mg aspirin seems to be the adjunct treatment of choice, since it apparently prevents your platelets from sticking together.\n\nI take Hydroxyurea, aka hydroxycarbamide, and it does wreak a bit of havoc on my red blood cells. One of the things I have discovered is that the drug may cause you to develop macrocytic anemia, because we are unable to absorb enough B12 and Folic Acid \\ from food sources. This manifests itself in chronic fatigue in most people. Even when they do a blood test to check your B12 level, it is likely to come back within normal limits. But what is the normal limit for a person with an MPN? My GP recommended that I take a folic acid and B12 supplement, or a B12 shot for a quick fix. I opted to take 800 mcg of folic Acid and 3,000 mcg of B12. They are B vitamins and water soluble, so Id have to take an awful lot of them to do any harm. The better indication is your red blood cell count, the size of your red cells, or Mean Corpuscular Value \\, and how much hemoglobin is being packed into them.\n\nThere are lots of life hacks to deal with the disease and the side effects of the drugs. I usually will get dizzy or fatigued soon after taking my usually dosage, and almost always when I take a double dose on weekends. I deal with that by taking it at bedtime. Might as well leverage the fatigue by sleeping it off. My daily life is not controlled by the disease, but it is a consideration. I have learned far more about it than I ever thought I would, or ever cared to know. They do say that knowledge is power! Hope you are doing well in your own journey. We have an expression that says something like, \"What you pick up on the Merry-Go-Round, you lose on the Ferris Wheel.\" You pay little or nothing for your blood work and doctor's visits, but pay for your statins and BP medication. If they put you on hydroxycarbamide - hydroxyurea over here - you will pay about $11 US for the drug. Depending on your insurance here, you can pay little or nothing for your drugs. I am on Social Security and Medicare, and my health plan pays for all of my drugs through a mail order pharmacy. My routine visits to my GP cost me $5, and my hematologist/oncologist visits cost $40. All routine blood works is free, regardless of how often I have to have it taken. I am one of the lucky ones. People who have lousy insurance, or none at all, pay a lot of money for health care. The problem with universal health care as it is being proposed, is that we simply do not have enough doctors, nurses or other health care workers to take care of a population of more than 325 million. I cannot really see the difference between rationing by cost or rationing by population. Either way, a lot of people fall through the cracks. I think that the government is putting their money in the wrong places. Every person deserves to have access to basic health care at a reasonable cost. If you want more than that, I see no problem with a fee for service. Our problem is that health care as become very expensive, and a lot of it has to do with the cost of educating doctors, limiting the number of doctors who can get into any of the medical schools, and the cost of prescription drugs. We pay more for prescription drugs than any other country. We pay more so that others can pay less. Its a nice theory, but in practice it leaves our own poor and people on fixed incomes in the lurch. The flip side is that there are many drugs that promise to extend your life by a few months, but at a cost of thousands of dollars a month. For MPN patients on interferon, the costs is thousands of dollars for every course of treatment. It always raises the question of how much health can you afford.\n\nMost doctors who specialize in treating MPNs agree that it is in the cancer family. There is nothing magical about what one calls the disease. Calling it cancer does not get you any points or breaks. I think the reason is that the natural progression of the diseases can result in AML, CML, etc. One doctor told me that if I lived long enough, I would likely progress into a more serious disease. Since I am already 72, it is not something that I worry about very much. The diseases is still listed as incurable, since there are not many, if any, cures due to medication alone. The only seeming cure is via a stem cell transplant. That is usually reserved for those who have myelofibrosis and is a last resort because no medication is working. The procedures is very expensive and dangerous. I know of one person who had the procedure and it cost upwards of $1 million. Fortunately he had decent insurance that covered most of it. Again, the question becomes how much health care you can afford. I can image the uproar if every person in the US with an MPN demanded the government pay for the SCT rocedure. At something like 1% to 1.5% of the population living with an MPN, you are looking at somewhere between 3 and 5 million people at a cost of $1 million each. Do not know where we would come up with the $3 - $5 trillion bucks.\n\nGood luck with your treatment. Hope all goes well for you. Thanks for the reply. I saw the doctor Wednesday. My hemoglobin is up to 11.4 but I am still very tired and out of breath. He said I should be feeling better than that. My platelets are creeping back up since I quit the Jakafi 10 weeks ago they are right at 500. He said if they get much higher he will put me on anegrelide. He was suspecting a progression to myelofibrosis but said he found no indication of that. \n\nI talked to a rep from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society who sent me a bunch of resources. If you have not talked to them give them a call at 1-800-955-4572. Leave your phone number and they will call you back. \n\nI will start taking B12 again and folate.

Stay strong. Did you go to a hematologist? Also have you had a Jak2 test? He is a hematologist. I had the JAK test and the other genetic tests that follow. No mutations. There are a lot of things that can cause thrombocytosis. The bone marrow biopsy is the definitive test. So if you have not had one, I am not sure you can say it is definitely not an MPN. There are triple negative cases that do not show any of the primary mutations. Some hematologists are more knowledgeable than others.

I am surprised none of them share our opinion. I guess I should be glad I never joined the Facebook pages.\n\nI wish it was more active too, but frankly there is not much to report.  Occasionally we will have a kind soul updating us on research or new trials, which is great. Every post where someone offers a suggestion or some sort of medical advice I always say \u201cdo not start taking any supplement without talking with your doctor.\u201d Frankly I have had a very different experience reading (not so much using) the PV support group on FB. Most of the issues you are describing are present, but are like 5% of the posts that occur there. Generally speaking the posts are very similar to this subreddit, the volume is just 100x greater. \n\nI guess I would be interested to know what you are trying to get out of an MPN subreddit/FB community? The FB community's sole purpose is to provide support, whether that is emotional, general guidance, etc. If you do not need support or not interested in providing it, then the FB page will be useless and a waste of time for you. I would also argue that this subreddit would mostly be useless to you. However, I do not think it is fair to turn people away from it just because the handful of posts you look at on any given day do not jive with you. The moderators and most users in that community are really good about shutting down pseudo-scientific stuff, recommending seeing an MPN specialist, and deleting posts/comments that violate their rules.\n\nMost of the people that use this subreddit and the FB group are looking for some guidance and reassurance. Sometimes things are easier to go through/deal with when you know you are not alone. Hopefully after over a year of covid that is something we can all empathize with. I left the fb groups for that reason. The idiotic repetitive questions were so annoying. Has anyone ever heard of the search feature!?

Apparently not\n\n2. Is that if my hcrit is below 45% then I am x% less likely to have a stroke. Given someone my age has a base rate for strokes of 1 in  a million then even if it reduced my risk to 0.5 in a million, who cares. I think my \"favorite\" comments in groups are people who second guess your doctor. \n\nI had personal experience with this. I had posted in a group about a treatment my doctor wanted me to undergo. I posted in the group, asking for advice on how to handle that particular treatment. Instead of getting advice, i got everyone and their mother giving unsolicitated second opinions about my diagnosis, my doctor, and my treatment plan. It was infuriating. \n\nI do not post in those groups anymore and just review posts every now and then to see the \"special\" responses people provide to posts. Do not know if it is just me, but I have always wondered about those dozens of \"may Jesus help you\" and \"God will heal you\" comments that people seem to get.\n\nI am still part of the groups though I have been sometimes thinking why I do that. I mean, there has not really been any useful info for me at all (apart from *MPN Investigation &amp; Discovery* group which is pretty cool).

Of course I receive them on a Friday, so I am left in limbo waiting until Monday for an interpretation. WBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit and MCV came back within normal limits, but my platelets came back mildly elevated at 457. At first I thought it was of no concern, until I did a bit of googling (probably the worst decision but I cannot help it :P). This made me realize that I have also been having a lot of abnormal symptoms that correlate with ET that I have been writing off as minor annoyances, such as vertigo episodes, fatigue, mild headaches, burning hot hands and feet, unexplained itchiness and bruising, and sorta tingly feet to the point it keeps me up at night from discomfort.

I had the worst panic attack ever and I called my hematologist. The nurse told me that if the doctor had been concerned he would have called me.\nSo it is ok for a patient to see results that would indicate they are at risk for having blood cancer and the doctor does not call me before I see the results online?\nI think this is really poor customer care.

Incidentally, I also have a sensation on the left side of my abdomen beneath my ribs, not sure what that is about. It is constant also, but relatively recent. Hard to describe, it is like I just notice something there.\n\nMy gastroenterologist was more concerned about my pain than me, and started doing tests to rule out other things. Celiac was ruled out. Ultrasound showed a very large gallstone, over 3cm, so they want me to get my gallbladder removed. I am scared to do surgery since getting my bloodwork back.  My full ultrasound was in 2017 and says my spleen, liver and pancreas were normal.

The most painful part for me was the lidocaine shot, which was just a brief stinging.    \n  \nThe actual procedure was uncomfortable, but for me the pain itself was similar to pressing on a bruise. I have a lot of fibrous tissue in my bone marrow (discovered in the biopsy), so it was difficult to get all the marrow they needed (and in fact, one test was inconclusive possibly due to the fact that they only had a small marrow sample), but even so, the procedure probably only took 30 minutes.\n\nI spent some time leading up to it worrying, especially in the days right before, but it was really no big deal at all\nI I am JAK2 positive with polycythemia Vera, not ET, but I know about ET since it is so closely related. \n\nThe BMB was no problem. They numb up the location and the only slightly painful part was when they core the bone marrow, but it really is not painful.\n\nIf it is ET, it is not that big a deal most of the time. With new research, more is known about the MPNs but most hematologists take a very simplified view of the disease and only care about the blood count numbers. The disease progresses slowly so it is hard to identify your symptoms. So you will  find everyone has a different experience.

I was recently diagnosed with a genetic condition that causes high cholesterol so I am about to be put on a medication for that.

Have not been diagnosed with anything yet, my hematologist appointment is in October. My platelet counts have been rising throughout the years though, 437 5 years ago and now it is 502. (WBC, RBC, HEM are all normal) since my hemoglobin (iron) is normal (11.8) I do not believe iron deficiency is causing my high platelets and I possibly have ET. Does anyone have information on the donating of platelets? I am wondering if this will make my platelet count go down but I cannot find any information online. I am also wondering if this is an effective treatment plan for people with high platelets? Unfortunately no, they dont want the risk of passing it on to someone else. No donating blood, platelets, organs, nothing. It would be irresponsible to try. I did not know it could be passed on to others. That really sucks that I have so much and cannot help someone in need. Thank you. It is not so mach as \"it can\" as much as \"it could\". Its not worth the risk to even really try a study on it. The answer is they really dont know what is the cause so it is not worth the risk. I asked the foundation in charge of blood donations here in Australia and could not get a straight answer. I spoke to my Haematologist about it and he basically said although my platelet count is higher, it does not necessarily mean they are quality platelets which he then added they are more than likely very bad quality platelets. That being said there is also the risk of passing something on in some way through platelets. I had the same thought but unfortunately we are off the list for blood donations. Thank you for the information. I will ask my hematologist more about it during the appointment Coming from an ET patient that was diagnosed about 7yrs ago and donated platelets against my better knowledge and also being advised not to, please do not do it. I knew the donation center would not consider my platelet donation viable after testing and realizing how abnormally high the platelet count would be but I thought it would be similar to plateletpheresis where I could rid of some platelets and lessen my debilitating symptoms. I was sorely wrong, our bodies have a baseline and most of us with ET tend to have an average range our platelets fluctuate within (which varies from person to person) and abruptly removing or adding something can wreak havoc quickly (which it did for me). Many are unaware also but when platelets are donated, a portion of plasma is also taken so not only will you feel very depleted but your body will most likely register it as an alarming loss and counterintuitively ramp up the production of platelets. Thank you for this information! Did your numbers ever go back down after donating? I still have not seen the hematologist yet but when I wrote this post I was really worried and scared and also wanted to help others but now I have already accepted that I have ET even without my diagnosis so I will not be donating any. It actually surged higher in a matter of days. Please seek out an MPN specialist and there are also a few great FB groups that have been very informative and supportive (MPN Blood Sisters &amp; Brothers).

Ended up having ET, but no doc could ever explain the numbness.  Interesting to hear you had the same symptoms. Thanks for the information. Thanks for the comments everyone! This is a little more reassuring hearing from others that this disease does not have a too big of an impact on your daily life. May I know what kind of Lifestyle that you guys suggest to keep good condition? Is there any specifics diet? My husband has this since 5 years ago.. I want to support him and go diet with him if it is necessary. I am 37 and was diagnosed a year and a half ago. Triple negative, platelets just over a million. Only on aspirin. Live normally :) I do get tired, headaches and wonky vision from time to time, but nothing unbearable I am not a doctor, but as I understand it, there is no specific diet that helps. The risk with ET is blood clots and stroke, so controlling other conditions that can also increase the risk of stroke is important. That means a generally healthy diet will help keep his blood pressure low and decrease the risk of ET complications. I was just diagnosed with the JAK2 V617F mutation and will be going to hematology  on Tuesday . My red blood cells are just a tad over the high normal range . White blood cells normal . Hemoglobin is also a little high  . Platelets are normal . Tryptase is elevated to 19 . General Practitioner is not real concerned but wants me to go to Hematology to be safe . \n\nI will let you know after Tuesday what they tell me . I was diagnosed with ET 3 months ( annual blood work picked up a dangerously high platelet count of 2352. I was referred to a Hematologist, then had a bone marrow biopsy. It was not painful, except for the local numbing. I was able to work the next day. \n\nAfter the biopsy I was put on Hydrea. I have been on the medication for 3mnths now. The fatigue has been a nightmare. Some days I wake up okay, other days I feel like I ran a marathon. I am now down to 1500 platelet count. My specialist said I will never have a normal platelet count, so our goal is to be under 1500. \n\nTrying to stay positive because this special cancer friend is now with me for the rest of my life :) Just curious, what medications did you use during pregnancy? I was put on interferon alpha and aspirin during the pregnancy. Pegasys was not widely available back then. Lots of blood tests, lots of ultrasounds to monitor baby. I wore compression socks while giving birth and I forget how long after. I also had injections that I had to take after the birth for a week - warfarin or heparin I think? Thank you so much for your response! I am yet to be diagnosed, but my Jak2 came back positive and chances are that it is ET based on what I read. We just started thinking about a 2nd child, and when I saw the positive test, I started to wonder whether this would be an option at all. I am 39. Your response gives me hope! There are quite a few FB groups for MPNs that are a lot more active than this one on Reddit, including one purely for women. If you do end up being diagnosed, I would recommend joining. A lot of knowledge and experience on there. \ud83d\ude42", "Is a hematologist definitely going to order a bone marrow biopsy?  My platelet count has been well over 500 since 2016. My primary care doctor only became concerned about it back in January. They had never noticed until I said something. Just got the results back from Quest today and it is the highest it is ever been: 620. My PCP office realized it is Friday and peaced out before calling me.\n\nI know I have got to do something about this. If I am ill, delaying this seems stupid at this point. I am going to bite the bullet and finally see a hematologist, but I am terrified of the idea of a bone marrow biopsy. Is that a guarantee, or do they just run tons of bloodwork first? In my experience, they will run tons of labs first. They will probably test you for the major driver mutations and test your iron. If you have a driver mutation, that might be good enough for them to consider you diagnosed (though not technically a thorough diagnosis until you have had a biopsy). If you are negative for a mutation but your iron is low they might blame your high platelets on low iron and have you try to boost your iron before considering a biopsy. \n\nTry not to worry about the biopsy if it comes to that. People's experiences vary, but mine was totally tolerable and forgettable. Thank you for helping to remove some of the anxiety. Can confirm. I have had two bone marrow biopsies. First time I got the gas and local anesthesia, was a piece of cake. Second time I asked if I could do without the gas because I had somewhere to be afterward. Still just a pinch and a little pressure.\n\nYou will feel much better with the information the biopsy provides you! Best of luck If they have reasonable confirmation that you have an mpn, they will want the biopsy for a baseline of where your blood cell generation cells are at in terms of percentage with mutations. It is best to have a biopsy in my opinion. It is the only way to really know what is going on. If you ask, they will give you something beforehand to help you relax. I am in my 30s and high platelets (~1000) were caught in an unrelated blood test. Got ET diagnosis after a battery of blood tests, no biopsy required. I take aspirin daily and have a blood test and phone appointment with the haemologist every quarter. Otherwise life is entirely unchanged. This is what I am hoping for. Having unpredictable WBCs and constantly high platelet levels is scary and the Googling is not helping. Rare from what I have seen and heard.  But an MPN specialist usually will.  That is how I was finally diagnosed correctly.", "Recently Diagnosed ET with MPL Exon 10 Mutation. Also terrified Hi everyone,\n\n32/ F here.  I had high platelets during my pregnancy and was sent to see a hematologist.  She noted that my bloodwork needed for college admission back in 2007 indicated that I had high platelets then (480,000) and was surprised no one followed up.The number lowered from 700,000 to 480,000 with a daily low-dose aspirin and my doctor prescribing ferrous gluconate to treat anemia.   Bloodwork she had ordered for JAK2 and MPL as well as other mutations came back negative so she suspected it was reactive to the pregnancy and from untreated anemia.  \n\nMy doctor recently left the practice to move west so I was switched to another doctor in the practice. He was  alarmed to see my platelet count lingering back in the 600,000s and had me get a bone marrow biopsy which came back positive for a MPL Exon 10 Mutation and diagnosed me with ET.  He said I am the youngest person he has seen with a MPL mutation, especially not having any family history of blood diseases, and is having me get a second opinion at a hospital in Boston. He also said that with the ET diagnosis, I am considered low risk right now but is having me get an ultrasound of my spleen.  \n\nMy husband and I are trying to get ahead of ET complications with healthy diets and exercise to deal with the possibility of clots.  The MPL mutation is the thing that I guess I do not fully understand the impact of or how it affects my diagnosis/my life span.\n\nI am absolutely terrified hearing that I have what he calls \"a blood cancer  considers a pre-cancer,\" especially after he had said at the appointment before the bone marrow biopsy that he did not think I had any kind of blood cancer.  The diagnosis kind of blind-sided me and his delivery is different than my previous doctor's bedside approach which made it harder to digest. He made it sound like any lifestyle changes were futile in deterring complications of any kind so I have been disheartened and a mess since I have seen him.  \n\nI am just wondering if there is anyone else with a similar situation/ diagnosis who can share their experience.  I am terrified to ask and put that timeline/any potential complications in the back of my mind but I also want to know; we just started our family and I want to be there for my baby and husband/ plan ahead. Thanks in advance for any information or feedback you can offer.", "CALR Mutation Represent I was just diagnosed with ET because of the CALR mutation. Did not see a lot of us on this sub, so I wanted to say hi! I am 35/f and mildly terrified! I have not heard of this mutation. I am Jak 2 positive. I was diagnosed in 2016 after a mini stroke. I was so scared. But now it is just normal. Good luck to you! I am 49/m end was diagnosed with CALR ET five or six years ago. You have every right to be terrified, and I will tell you that it will pass. After the initial shock I found that life was pretty normal. Feel your feelings but know that it is going to be ok. I can only speak to my own experience, but I was diagnosed with ET with the CALR mutation two years ago and it is not bad at all! I get a monthly\nblood test and take a few pills everyday, but otherwise my life has not changed at all. My hematologist says that this does not really effect life expectancy at all either. That is nice to hear. It is what my doctor said too, but it is good to hear it from a person who has it. Just kind of a lot to take in that I have a disease I have to treat for the rest of my life. I am definitely glad it is not as bad as it could be! Thank you :) 39/M CALR positive here.  Had high Platelets since 2013, but only officially diagnosed in 2018.  I do not notice any difference in my life at all other than I get some weird bruises because I take baby aspirin every day.  You will be fine, just live your life, but be ready to have blood drawn every few months indefinitely. \ud83d\ude00 &lt;removed&gt; Do not be terrified.  Which CALR type are you? It is  either deletion or insertion. type 1 or 2 and you can find it on your bone marrow biopsy. I also have ET but have another mutation called Jak2.  We are rare! I get the bone marrow biopsy next week, so hopefully I will find out... thanks! I am here too! Just (literally today) found out my genetic test came back CALR+ with consistently elevated platelets (700-800k) and I have a BMB in a few days to confirm. 32/F!\n\nIts such a mind game. ET seems overly simple... So we make extra platelets and literally just need an aspirin. I keep thinking if I google search it in a different way then I will find some new rabbit hole to go down that has more research and answers, but all the info is the same. You have a rare blood cancer but you are fiiiiiine. \"You have the Cadillac of cancers, take an aspirin and move on with your life.\" For some reason this info just has me feeling weird.\n\nHow did your BMB go? Any new answers or developments since then? Hello, welcome! It is kind of weird that is my Dr.'s attitude. \"It is fine, everyone has something wrong with them, be thankful this is your thing.\" It is still freaky!\n\nI just had routine bloodwork done and OH HEY YOU HAVE OVER A MILLION PLATELETS go to the CANCER CENTER. \n\nI do not want to freak you out or anything, but the BMB was... unpleasant. Let me know if you want to know more! I had my bone marrow biopsy this past Monday and the drs put me on versed where I was awake but really out of it. I could feel something done on my backside but really nothing intense except the initial lidocaine shot that lasted a second if anything. Do not be worried about the actual procedure! Ask ur dr if u can be put on twilight sedation and u will not know what is happening. I remember wanting to fall asleep lol", "Curcumin induces apoptosis in JAK2\u2010mutated cells by the inhibition of JAK2/STAT and mTORC1 pathways An interesting research paper:\n\n(", "I cannot find anything out online Hi there. I am 27 years old female and have been diagnosed with mild polocythemia Vera. I have a massive platelet count; over 1 million. They have done a bone marrow biopsy and I do not have acute leukemia. My doc is sending me to another doc because she is never treated someone my age. \n\nBut I do have abnormal blood tests that show CO2 in my blood and I do have the JAK2 mutation. Idk what is causing this or if I have essential thrombocythemia. Idk but a lot of my tests seem to be pointing to kidney/liver malfunction. I also get migraines with aura and have a headache today. I also had daily migraines for years and just have now started a treatment for it. \n\nBasically all I am trying to do is get an idea of what is going on and why and what the outcomes are and if they are positive or if hydroxyurea is not that bad. Is it? I also have no children. \n\nMy doctor says she does not know how to treat me because she is never treated someone my age before. She prescribed me hydroxyurea but I am afraid to take it. How did you get answers or a solution to your high platelet count if you have one? It seems low platelet count is more common and less dangerous. I was diagnosed with ET and jak 2 positive at 15 and I went to so many different specialist and doctors because no one has ever treated someone that age in my area.  I have been taking hydroxyurea since and I am now 25. Hydroxyurea is definitely scary but I was having strokes from my platelets and it has definitely helped with preventing that. So, for me, the pros outweighed the cons.This is such a rare and underfunded disease, the best advice I can give you, is to keep being persistent. It took me so many times to find a hematologist/oncologist who was knowledgeable on this disease and willing to treat me. Do not feel bad if you have to keep switching specialists until you find one who is right for you. I wish you the best of luck! You will be okay. \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f Thank you. My doctor is great- but her office staff is completely useless and I am really aggravated that they cannot respect my time. Please find an MPN specialist. The earlier you have a specialist monitor you the better. MPNs are very complex and can be challenging to manage. Checking out MPN Forum would be a good start. \n\nLife is too short to feel bad. I have felt much better since getting the proper care. I wish you the very best. \nHi! 33F here, diagnosed with PV at 31 while pregnant (but suspected misdiagnosis 8 years earlier, so probably been there a while); JAK2 / ASXL1 / TET2 positive with additional mutations in KDM5A and BCORL1. Welcome to the MPN club. \n\nI am going to second what is already been said and suggest you find an MPN specialist in your area. I go to MD Anderson; there are several other choice facilities around the States. Seeing someone who is specifically versed in this field is super important - they are up on the research (or involved in it), and can help make sure you have the most up to date care guidelines applied to your needs and symptom burden. \n\nI see you have done the BMB; did they do a mutation panel or just check for your level of fibrosis? Certain mutations (thanks, ASXL1  ) can up your chance of progressing to post-PV MF or AML with a worse prognosis than someone who just flat-puts started with MF or AML; others (CALR, MPL) can help sort you into the right MPN category or change how they treat you. (\n\nOH MAN, I hope you finally get some relief on those headaches. I cannot tell you the difference just doing the daily baby aspirin and monthly phlebotomies made before we moved to medication. I used to have fuzzy-edged vision, headaches, tinnitus, mental fog, and *such* bad itching. I had high RBC, WBC, &amp; platelets, and bringing those numbers down changed how I felt instantly. \n\nMedication is a very personal choice between you and your doctor. I know personally that United Healthcare and Cigna both make special exceptions for Pegasys use for young adults (which here means &lt;40) or women who may become pregnant, as HU is contraindicated for pregnancy. It means a once-weekly subcutaneous shot, as well as a high copay. Mine\u2019s $250/month through Cigna Home Pharmacy (and was the same through United Healthcare/BriovaRX); it is expensive because it is a self-administered injectable specialty medication used off-label for MPNs. \n\nBut my doctor and I felt it was the right move for me. It is immunotherapy - a substance you are body already makes to fight illness, which is why some people experience flu-like symptoms. It brings down your allele burden (percentage of your cells that are mutated) and is looking like it may slow the number of new acquired mutations, in part because it is keeping the mutated cell numbers down. It is more targeted (  ). HU, while it is still considered BAT or best available therapy, is more of a \u201ckill cells indiscriminately\u201d kind of deal. It is cytotoxic but not targeted. There has been shown to be a link between long term HU use and skin cancers too ( ) So that was a big nope for me. But it is also a hell of a lot cheaper and comes in a pill, way more convenient. I can see why people do it. \n\nOn the horizon, there is ropeginterferon, aka Besremi ( Pegasys is interferon-alpha with PEG (polyethylene glycol) to make it longer lasting; ropeginterferon lasts even longer. It is been approved in Europe; just a waiting game over here. If you try HU and fail (i.e., it does not work or the side effects are too much for you), they may try you on Jakafi. And last (and least, and with a million platelets probably not an option for you) is watch &amp; wait + baby aspirin. \n\nThere are loads of resources out there. MPN Voice ( ) and Fight MPN ( are two forum communities through HealthUnlocked. There are lots of people on MPN Voice in particular. Follow the hashtag #mpnsm on Twitter - Drs. Mesa &amp; Pemmaraju, and other MPN researchers post using it, plus their respective hospitals and MPN conventions, etc. \n\nThe MPN Research Foundation is absolutely invaluable ( TONS of great info, contacts, a newsletter they mail to your home, as well as a force in funding research. And the MPN Education Foundation ( If you are just dipping your toes in MPN research, this ought to help you differentiate between the types and a crash course on meds and treatments. Cancer Support Community ( has resources available in multiple languages, if there is someone you need to share with. They link to a couple podcasts that have done specials on MPNs (though they mostly cover the basics). There is also caregiver resources, because your friends and family may need help not just understanding MPNs, but also finding themselves in this surprise role. \n\nI would also like to say that if the cost of Pegasys has you worried about the future, but you believe it may work better for you, Genentech (the maker) has just added Pegasys to its cost assistance program ( I have not tried it myself; have to get my application in. But thanks to the MPN Research Foundation ( ) for letting me know!  I would love to not pay $3000/year to feel okay, LOL. Thank you for your detailed reply. Now I am going to call the facility today and make an appointment. Hopefully it is not 6 months. Best of luck!! I was just diagnosed with PV, but I am older (54). I was having multiple migraine auras per day, until my first phlebotomy and starting medication. Now I do not have them at all. HU is no big deal for me at 1000mg, providing very good control of platelets, but I still need periodic phlebotomies to keep hematocrit down.\n\nI noticed pretty bad cognitive changes just before diagnosis, and though I feel improved mentally since that time, I still kind of feel different. That is the worst part for me. Fatigue is pretty bad too.", "Stressed So, this is long and probably rambling but here goes. \n\nI was sent to onc/heme a while back by my pulmonologist for a follow up on some \"odd labs\". Literally all she told me besides saying it has nothing to do with my breathing. Its been a whirlwind of blood work (something like every other month or so) and my platelet count has remained high. My doc wanted to rule out secondary causes, including bone marrow cancer. So that is been ruled out and now I have been diagnosed with ET. My counts are not super high but the daily migraines and the fact I have already had a DVT (I am 22) has me personally somewhat concerned. IDK how to really talk to the few people in my support network about it because there is so much to explain but also like.. I feel pressured to keep it under wraps with my co-workers as well (I am in healthcare). It is nice that I am just on a daily aspirin regimen but at the same time ive noticed my h&amp;h coming down. As in, my hemoglobin was at 9.6 last draw about a week ago. My last hct was 36 which is not too too bad but still low. And I am just.. idk how to deal with sorting through everything and just.. managing I guess. \nI guess I am just looking for support from some people who \"get it\". We totally get it. I think everyone here is willing to be an outlet for you. \n\nIt is important to find someone, perhaps a counsellor, whom you can sit down with and share face to face as well. I found that when I was first diagnosed with PMF, I also felt like I could not speak to the people around me, but eventually I did. Not everyone provides the support you might need, but there is usually at least one person who does. When you identify that person, do not be afraid to lean on them. \n\nBut for the time being, we are all ears! You are going to be just fine \u263a\ufe0f I have been pretty open with friends and former colleagues on the subject, but I am currently looking for a job and not disclosing.", "Article from physician at UAB discussing the Cytokine Storm I am sharing here as he is quoted stating certain types of blood cancers can trigger a  cytokine storm.

Dreadful headaches that literally will not go away at all. \n\nIs there any device that I could take my blood like a glucose meter? Does that exist? It exists for several thousand dollars from Chinese medical equipment suppliers. You need a centrifuge for a CBC. As far as I know there is no tech than can do this on a small/personal/consumer scale. Would not that be cool though? Quest Labs (and similar) let you schedule things ad hoc, but you would need prescription if you want to use insurance. \u201cPrivate MD Labs\u201d can give you prescriptions online. Still gets costly. See if your doctor will have you in more often\u2026 I used to go every other week until I had things managed well. I can always go to the lab early in the morning since it is near where I work.  But going to the doc is a pain. Go to a lab like Quest Diagnostics whenever you need labs drawn. It is much cheaper, efficient, and more reliable than any at home test kit. I just call my hemo when I need a new blood work order. I do. That is good. I do not think there is any specific platelet monitor other than getting labs drawn. I have PV but my biggest problem are my platelets. Mine too. Sanguina App, just measures HGB. I have found it useful at times, did thorough comparison testing.  Would use the app in the waiting room, get my blood drawn, and it would be within .3 grams per deciliter. Just have to make sure your phone camera is on point. \n\nThere is also an Istat machine, but sadly does not do platelets. \n\n\"These tests include arterial and venous blood gas and electrolytes, common metabolites, cardiac troponin I (TnI), Hct and Hb, and coagulation tests such as the INR and ACT.\"\n\n$5k plus.  \n\nAdditionally, I recall some start up companies are \"testing\" at home CBC machines for certain cancer patients.

I will pay my $20 copay to get my blood drawn", "High platelets (stressing out \u2639\ufe0f) Hello,\n\nI am a 26 year old male with allergic asthma. In July of this year, I went to see my allergist to get prescription inhalers (I was having allergy and asthma issues since late April with runny nose, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and chest cold). The chest cold went away after 2 weeks. Since taking my inhalers, the runny nose and chest tightness went away but I still have shortness of breath issues (but I had noticed that I feel tightness around my throat and I can take deep breaths and not feel discomfort in my chest).\n\nIt was around the time I saw my allergist that I had some blood work done at the medical facility and they noticed that my platelet count was high and wanted me to see a blood specialist. (My platelet count was 1.3 million at the time)\n\nA month later after a appointment cancellation as the specialist was out, I saw a blood specialist and his assistant or intern (not sure what his role was). They redone the test and ordered other tests. When I went home, I got a call from the blood specialist mentioning that my platelet count increased to 1.5 million, and I have to take hydroxyurea. I was told to take 3 capsules a day.\n\nTwo weeks later, blood work was done again and my platelet decreased to 800,000 and the blood specialist told me to take 2 capsules a day for now on. I was supposed to do a follow up visit with the blood specialist sept 1 but it got cancelled due to the blood specialist being out of the office and got rescheduled to sept 29th.\n\nRecently, I was told that I have to do a ultrasound ordered by the blood specialist to check my spleen and liver. \n\nOverall, I have been frustrated as I feel that I have been given vague information over the status of my condition. I was looking up the possibilities of what my condition is and I believe that I may have essential thrombocythemia (ET). Other than the possibility that long term use to hydroxyuera can lead to leukemia, I am worried about the possibility that I may not be able to have children (I am currently single but I hope to have children in the future). I have been looking at forums to see if people have ever stopped using hydroxyuera and seeing no one has not has filled me with anxiety. When I spoke with someone from the facility (I believe it was the assistant/intern), he mentioned that while they were still waiting for one more test to come back, everything in the complete blood count (except platelets) was normal. I asked him if I would be taking hydroxyuera long-term, he said they are still waiting for the test to come back to make a determination. When I asked the blood specialist that same question, he said that it is too early to make a determination.\n\nI am wondering if anyone had any similar experiences and took hydroxyuera and if they ever stopped using the medication. My first suggestion would be to find a better doctor, who has knowledge and experience with MPNs even if you have to travel a little so you can get better answers to all your questions. \n\nThe long term effects of hydroxyurea are not really known. Some studies say it may increase chances, but most doctors think it is more that people are living longer on them and would have gotten it anyways instead of dying from strokes and other problems. So basically jury is still out. But that is the case with any of the MPM medicine because they are pretty new. Hydroxyurea is the go to because it is easy to tolerate and is effective.\n\nUsually when your platlets are over 1 million they want you to be on something because the other risks are too high. Typically you would not come off the medicine unless it was not  effective anymore.\n\nI do not know about your children concerns. I would definitely  work with a specialist on them as I do not know how Hydroxyurea would effect things. I am 29, female taking Hydroxyurea and without it my platelets were over 1 million. \n\nI tried Pegasys, and interferon but they just did not control my counts really well and I was still getting terrible migraines. \n\nMy MPN specialist, told me there is a risk of an MPN turning into acute myeloid leukemia with or without Hydroxyurea.  It is not saying it is likely, but they do not know. \n\nI just posted about anyone who had been pregnant on this sub with a diagnosis of PV or ET. \n\nI am currently on hu and I am afraid to start trying to conceive because I most definitely do not want to get pregnant while taking hu. I have been told it may cause birth defects and just I can use birth control, it is not worth the risk to get an accidental pregnancy. God I want to smack my mom when she says \u201caccidents happen.\u201d I am like, mom\u2014in my world, it cannot. \n\nI am also afraid of my ability to have kids, but quite frankly if I cannot have kids I am alright with that idea I think because I have always wanted to adopt/foster and will not be participating in IVF. That is simply not important to me. I second finding another doctor. I have ET and it took about 6 months to get diagnosed.  Bounced back and forth between a bunch of specialists (mostly neurology) after having some weird symptoms.  My platelets have always been around 700k to 900k. \n\nAsk your (new) doctor about getting a test which can confirm ET, either a bone marrow biopsy or a specialized blood test.  Once you know for sure you can work with your (new) doc and make a treatment plan.  I do not take Hydoxyurea, only baby aspirin.  \n\nI live about one hour outside Baltimore.  While my local docs are fine for most issues, i traveled to Hopkins in Baltimore to talk to a specialist once I was diagnosed.  I still see my local hematologist for regular appointments, but if something major comes up, I always travel to the Hopkins.  I would suggest you try a new doc in a well respected hospital.", "Anyone here from the UK? Recommended hospitals or specialists? Usual NHS treatment? SE/south-central England.

I am going to start a new website for people with MPNs to share their journey. I know the MPN research foundation has a place to do so but I am more looking at a site that people can put entries as to the progression and life around it. I have purchased two domains, MPNjournal.com and MPNStory.com and am debating which one to use. I am pushing more towards MPNJournal.com as it implies a journey and multiple entries. Thoughts? Great idea! I personally like MPNstory more. Feels less formal to me. I have never done any journaling and my mind goes immediately to a professional journal. I dunno, just my initial reaction and 2 cents. Either way you go, I think it is a really nice idea. It would have been nice to have something like that when I was first diagnosed. I have already started on the site. Thank you for the feedback. Based on feedback from family and friends I am going to go with MPNjournal.com. Formal, informal do not matter and I will make sure to make a note of that based on your input. This is going to be first, second and third person view type of thing.  It is currently in progress and should be up in the next 30 days at least in some capacity. I invite you all to join when the site is up and hope you will share your stories for others. Hey I just did a soft launch on the site. Its not 100% yet but I figure I can work on it as it grows. Check it out. ( Oh awesome! In newly diagnosed, and have only really found Facebook communities... And any Facebook group is eh eh at best Please come sign up, we need members and stories, it is free of course.  Somehow I missed this when it was posted to the reddit. It seems like a really good idea and something I will definitely have to check out. Any sort of exposure is a good thing in my opinion.  Its a work in progress, I will improve as I have time to devote to it as far as the design and functionality. But you can sign up to it now, looking for feedback as well. Looking for more people to post. If it ends up just me that is fine too. ", "Can PV/MPN cause \u201cGouty Arthritis\u201d with normal serum Uric Acid ? Hi!  I am new here.  Please be nice ;)\n\nMy uncle died last year of stealthy Myelofibrosis that was only diagnosed in his autopsy.  My elderly Dad has unexplained fatigue, that hits him \u201clike letting the air out of a balloon\u201d most (not all) afternoons.  He is working with his doctor to diagnose that, with an eye on MPN.\n\nIn the mean time, I got a home genetic test that clearly shows that I have the JAK2-V617F mutation.  (It looks homozygous in the 30x reads, but I read there is a weird mieosis-like thing between the short arms of chromosome 9 that might falsify that).\n\nI am 57, with no obvious MPN symptoms and normal blood tests.  (My Dad and I have mild eczema that the JAK2 explains).\n\nI do have unexplained arthritis in my right knee and ankle.  The Rheumatologist has ruled out Rheumatoid arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis.\n\nMy ankle has been swollen for ~a year, and is often hot (like gout).  I read that PV sometimes causes \u201cgouty arthritis\u201d.  But my serum Uric Acid tests are consistently good (5.6-5.8) \u2014 seemingly ruling out gout.\n\nNow, I read that is not always the case \u2014 you *can* have localized gout with low Uric acid overall.  I asked my Rheumatologist about this. She admits that she has no experience with PV \u201cgouty arthritis\u201d.   She does not think I have gout because it is relatively constant and \u201cnot episodic\u201d.  Tests continue.\n\nMy question then \u2014 any of you have PV \u201cgouty arthritis\u201d ?   How does it act ?   Is your overall Uric acid normal ? PV can cause blood clots.  A hot swollen ankle could indicate a blood clot (DVT - deep vein thrombosis)  in your leg. It is probably  worth getting an ultrasound to rule that out. Here is a good article on gout in MPN - ", "Triple negative and in doubt Has anybody been diagnosed with triple negative ET? I read that only 10% of ET falls under triple negative, making it very unlikely for an already rare disorder. I have a feeling ET is coming based on my tests so far not showing any reactive processes. If she does no further testing (blood marrow), I am not going to accept a diagnosis like this. There are quite a few who are triple negative, so if you have unexplained and persisting thrombocytosis you should have a BMB. It is the only way to find out if your thrombocytosis is reactive or not. I wonder if I can request one.", "I have MPN since i was 14. I am 32 now. During a random check when i was 14 my platelets where 650k. They tested me for jak2 and the rest, all negative. For a few years they remained around 500k. In the past couple of years theyve dropped to 450k. My MPV is high. The docs when they see my blood under a microscope say it looks like MPN.\n\nBut, they are all confused as to why they are dropping. I have no symptoms. No other out of range blood tests. Oh i do. I have low UIBC. But normal iron and ferritin. \n\nAnd i know this might a silly question, but can ET actually mimic another blood disorder? Is it normal for ET's levels to drop or to remain normal for nearly two decades now?", "Are PV and ET a big deal? Hi,\n\nI am currently testing for the JAK 2 gene. So far, all indicate to ET although it could also be PV. \n\nI am waiting for the results. If JAK 2 is negative, what would be the next test? The oncologist I was assigned was not very clear about that. \n\nI have also eliminated all other reasonable causes for the high platelet count and I am already on Plavix. \n\nLast but not least, is MPN bad? I mean, it is better to not have it than have it but compared to other cancers, it seems quite harmless. It seems easy to manage and as long as it does not progress to leukemia or cause bone marrow scarring, I will have a normal life. \n\nI am a bit frustrated because nobody give me answers. I did not even understood why I had to start on plavix until I researched myself. \n\nMale, 29, platelet count 660. Six months ago it was 600, six weeks ago about 670, two weeks ago 666. \n\nWas a heavy smoker for a long time. I do not have the other metrics with me now but at first several values were off the chart including red blood cells. In the last test they have all stabilized apart from the platelet count. \n\nI was supposed to receive the JAK 2 test already but the lab has not send the results yet. \n\nThe oncologist made it seem MPNs are PV and ET are actually not a big deal. I do not know what to think. I really do not. I am 47 m and was diagnosed with ET about three years ago. My highest count was around 1.2 million, though I usually hover in the 800's. I only take aspirin. \n\nIs it a big deal? I would say no. It is just something to manage. There are things you will deal with... Fatigue can hit hard, crazy itching out of a hot shower, night sweats... But all in all things could be so much harder. Take your meds, see the doc as instructed, eat a healthy diet and push yourself to exercise when you feel tired. That is the routine that works best for me. \n\nTry not to feel anxious about the unknown. It can seem really scary, but it is easily managed. I have started making some big life changes. Walking 10k daily. Running. Eating healthy not so much for health reasons but because plavix causes acid reflux and I need to avoid acid reflux foods. Tea is awful for me so is a lot of chocolate. \n\nI do not have any symptoms yet. Apart from the CBC and the subsequent extensive testing and having an oncologist with specialization in hematology, I would not have know about this. \n\nI want to talk with someone about this but it seems nobody knows much about MPNs. The oncologist knows but it is hard to gain access and he is not the most communicative person. I guess he is very busy. \n\nI feel so stuck in my life. I just want closure to know what is wrong. I wish those damn results would come already. I guess PV and ET are fine. The third option seems dangerous. \n\nIt may sound childish but it is hard to stay calm even if I may have one of the \u201clightest\u201d form of cancer available, at least compared to something like leukemia or brain cancer or whatever. I was diagnosed with ET about 6 months ago and it really has not effected my life all that much. I take aspirin and hydrea and I get regular blood counts. My hematologist told me that ET usually does not effect life expectancy at all. He has not told me anything about hydra so far. Googled it. Seems good. He only told me that I will take something to thin my blood once a day. \n\nAre you afraid of head injury? This is something that is on my mind. I do go outside and do \u201cstuff\u201d as hiking and I am also clumsy. Maybe I read too much that blood thinners can lead to bleeding in the skull. I have asked the doctor and he said I should not worry about it. I did get acid reflux, the bad kind. Now I am off all foods that can trigger acid reflux which thinking about it, is not a bad thing. I can finally start eating healthy. I was diagnosed at 26, I am now 39. ET does not affect my life. I take my meds and I get on with it. Be wary of some support groups - I am on a few on Facebook and my goodness... I have actually seen one person comparing us to acute cancer and claiming we have it harder. I think mindset plays a large part in dealing with MPNs.  Hi now, I am Dad! I have ET. I think if JAK2 is negative, they check for CALR and the MPL. From what I can tell, ET is the least serious, then PV, then MF. My worst part for me is the anemia caused by the medicine for ET. Call the number on the website for Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. They are very helpful. Question - do you know any advantage of taking aspirin over clopidogrel for example? They do the same right? Did you have any major side effects from the meds? I assume you either take aspirin or clopidogrel. The entire \u201cbleeding in my head\u201d scares me a bit as I do hit my head from time to time. \n\nI just cannot find any resource on this on what consistites a real risk. We are talking about car accident level? Mountain bike level? Me slipping on the bathroom floor level? I have asked a doctor and he dismissed it as \u201cnot going to happen\u201d. JAK 2 mutation was positive. Carl and mpl was negative. I am happy the doctor had the idea of running all of them at the same time instead of eliminating one by one. I take both aspirin and Hydrea, and was on Interferon for years as I was diagnosed in pregnancy. The hydrea gives me really dry skin and mouth, so I moisturise and chew gum a lot. The interferon gave me fatigue, but it was manageable. Did you start treatment right away? Here is the NCCN guidelines for MPN patients. \n\nThe NCCN guidelines set all the protocols for cancers. They were changed for MPNs in 2016 and now mandate a bone marrow biopsy. A lot of hematologists are not up to date on this and still follow the outdated guidelines. You can see the tests you could get on pg 14.\nI recommend seeing an MPN specialist. You can find one here:\n I am glad you said this! I was diagnosed last month (triple negative) and had to leave some Facebook groups bc they scared the hell out of me with all of their negativity!!", "JAK2 neg PV? Hi all,\n\nI was diagnosed with PV when I was 26F. I am negative for JAK2, and was wondering if there was anyone here who was also negative; I am trying to learn what life is like without the mutation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks! I have hemorrhagic* ET without the JAK2 mutation at 30.\nIt is likely I have always had it but they found it when they had to remove my spleen, pancreas,  and gall bladder. (I had sever pain in my spleen and swelling and a tumor on my pancreas, gallstones) Despite all of that I live a somewhat normal life. I had 2 pulmonary embolisms before they caught it and a platelet count of 1.3 million,  10 times the normal average. \n\nThey put me on blood thinners and a chemotherapy drug called Hydrea that targets the blood productions. I might have it. (Biopsy was negative a couple of months ago, but symptoms have been increasing in severity. Second opinion next week.) \n\nWhat are your symptoms like? I do not really have any symptoms yet. My blood is just crazy thick. I am in the process of being diagnosed with ET and I was negative JAK2. That is why my hematologist wants more testing before \"confirming\" a diagnosis. I was negative for JAK2 and CALR. I hope that you continue to have no symptoms! Hi.. I am Jak2 negative PV ..30 F.. they did bone marrow biopsy to confirm.. however, one of the doctors I met recommended Next generation sequencing to confirm.. have you been recommended anything like that?", "ET Side Effects Hey all 28 yr old female here with a positive JAK2 mutation and platelets at about the 700-800 range. Lately I have been having some side effects, like dizziness, general fatigue, sensory overwhelm, of that nature. Have any of you had the same? What have you found that works to counteract them? The dizziness is the worst part of all of this \ud83d\ude43. Thanks a bunch! hydroxyurea helped my headaches go away and lower my platelets. Have you seen a MPN specialist?  Has your doctor already put you on any medication? I have. No medicine just two low dose aspirin a day to manage clotting. My counts are below 1.5 mil so no treatment unless they climb that high. I do not have an easy answer for you. Aspirin is the free answer that I am that is has few side effects. What did the specialist say about efforts to help with your symptoms?\n\nOne thing I can say is definitely do your research before starting on Hydroxyurea at such a young age. It can increase your probability of progressing to AML which you definitely do not want. \n\nOutside of medications, there are three things that are not drugs that make a huge difference for MPNs:\n\n1.\tExercise. Walk daily, running works great for me once a week aside from my regular walks. I do strength training also and it helps. What I have learned is that even when I do t feel like it, I always feel better if I push through and at least walk for a few miles even if I feel crappy. \n2.\tDiet. Mediterranean diet is a great option - lots of vegetables, fish, lower meat and as little processed food as you can get away with. \n3.\tStress. This is a harder one but stress can cause an inflammatory response and MPNs are in many ways inflammatory diseases. Do what you can to reduce your stress levels. \n\nNot easy answers but if you have not maxed out these three, I would start there as they all can have a profound effect and have no negative side effects. My specialist focused more on the headaches and just said that the aspirin should relieve them. He also said they would not put my on hydroxyurea since I am so young it would likely be interferon if I needed it, but he does not want me on any treatments right now since my platelets are not high enough to cause lasting problems. \n\nI will definitely start exercising more frequently, even if it is just a short walk and focusing on incorporating better foods.\n\nThank you so much for the help! I wish I had an answer for you.  I sometimes feel super horrible (like right now) with dizziness and a feeling like I am getting the flu. I am also just on aspirin and watch and wait.  Waiting to see an MPN Specialist as my hematologist is rather blas\u00e9 about me as I am considered low-risk. Yeah my old hematologist acted quite indifferent to my diagnosis and just passed it off as no big deal. My specialist was happy to answer most questions I had and actually give me direct answers. I think with the nature of MPNs a lot is just unknown so idk. I also went on antidepressants so I am not sure if maybe the combination is making side effects worse. I will be reaching back out to my specialist to see if he has any suggestions as well. I am on the same treatment plan as you. I am 32 with PV, originally diagnosed with ET at 29 and symptomatic since early childhood. Platelets are around 1100 (more blood work tomorrow, yay!). No treatment other than aspirin and phlebotomy (for PV) unless I am over 1500. Besremi was just FDA approved in the US for PV patients, so that may be an option for me. I believe it is not approved for ET yet. I have no idea why they keep suggesting to wait and watch while platelets are climbing. There are meds that can fix your blood count, slowdown the disease or even put you in remission. Check Pegasys or the new one Basremi. Not a chemo like hydroxy.", "Covid Vaccine 3rd dose? I know the CDC just announced the need for a 3rd shot of the Covid vaccine for immunocompromised people today. Does anyone know if MPN patients would need it? I know Hydrea is chemotherapy and can effect our white blood cell counts, but I do not know if we are considered immunocompromised. I do not believe we are considered immunocompromised unless you are on HU treatment. My doc\u2019s office sent an email out saying anyone who was taking infusion or oral immunotherapy (interferon alpha, pegasys for me) then they recommended a third dose. I consider my condition well managed right now and feel fine, however I do not want COVID \u2014 An illness that can literally cause mini blood clots. That is scary. \n\nSo anyway I had my third one today. If I did not actually need it then no harm done but if it saves my life then I will never regret it.\n\nThat being said follow your doctors advice, do not take my word for it. How are you feeling after the 3rd shot?  The 2nd kicked my butt, so I am trying to gauge how the 3rd might be. Not that I will not get it or anything, just preparing myself! The second kicked my butt too! I have been vaccinated for ~25 hrs now and I was getting fatigued slowly throughout the day yesterday. Last night sucked though. Hot and cold, could not peacefully sleep. I have a throbbing headache sometimes but other than that I am okay. I read that the third was more mild than the second and so far I would agree. That is good news!  The more mild side effects, I mean.  Hope it passes quickly for you!", "Possible ET Diagnosis Hey there,\n\n28yo Male and I have been having blood test for the past 6 months and have had consistent platelet readings of 550-600. I saw a haematologist 2 days ago and had a full check up with more blood tests, 12 large vials to be exact apparently to check my genes? I cannot remember the exact details.\n\nThe haematologist mentioned its quite likely I have ET but that he did not want to rule out some sort of weird infection causing my platelets to rise. I am aware that my count is not super high but even then the haematologist said it did not matter, as long as they over the normal count there is a possibility of ET.\n\nIt is all a bit hazy for me at the moment and I have not retained all the information from the appointment due to the shock and worry of it all. I still have to wait a month to get my blood results.\n\nIn the meantime I am preparing for the worst and wanted to know how you get through it? What is your tips for staying active? Can you still go to the gym and lift weights? Can you get out and run a marathon? (on my list of things I still want to do). Can you live a normal life?\n\nSorry if I am coming off dramatic. I was diagnosed with ET 7 years ago at 23. I have struggled with fatigue and depression at times, part of which I chalk up to the disease. But when I have taken care of myself, exercised, slept and eaten well, I am able to do all the things I have always done. I lift weights, play basketball, etc. You will be alright. PM me if you ever need to. ET patients pretty much lead a normal life. Find a good doctor, stay physically active, and keep a good attitude. I was diagnosed with ET 13ish years ago. I am 39, I work full time, look after 2 kids, stay active. I used to do martial arts with no issues and quit not because of the ET but because of my dodgy ankle and knee (again not ET related, did my ACL). I do pilates now because I am a scaredy cat! Honestly, having ET does not affect my life. This is true. \n\nTypically you want to do a full diagnosis, that means bloodwork and a bonemarrow biopt. You want to find out of you have the typical mutation that go with an MPN type of cancer like ET. There is JAK2, CALR and MPL that are usually (but not always) the driver mutations. In the BMB they can also see if there is scarring in the bone. This is usually associated with MF, a different type of cancer that ET can progress into. I am 47 m and was diagnosed with ET about four years ago. Everyone here is right, there are few symptoms and you will live a very normal life and you have every right to be stressed. The unknown is scary. You are doing the right thing in getting information here. Just because it is not one of the bad cancers does not mean you are not allowed to worry. It was very stressful for me when I got my diagnosis. You will come to terms with it in a short time and find that most days you do not even think about it. Hang in there and take things as they come. We are all here when you need an ear. I am basically in the same boat as op.  Everything I have read says something like an Outlook for 15 years, which sounds ominous for someone diagnosed in their 20's and 30's.  Is this just because of a majority of people being diagnosed later in life (in their 60's), and they live a normal life and die of unrelated causes?  Or is this because it keeps getting lumped together with other related diseases? Hey there,\n\nAs someone in their 20s who was recently diagnosed, I had the panic inside of me. \n\nAfter the last few months, I can say that (as muelleaj) has said, I often forget I have it. The bouts of fatigue and minor depression happen but being able to push through that and make yourself do something has helped me so far.\n\nI used to do a lot of sports and went to the gym and I have cut back a bit. Do not give up on what you need to do though, find that sweet spot for you that makes you feel better.\n\nLet us know what the hematologist says and if you want to talk, post here so we can all see. The more awareness we have of this, the more people will join the forum if they feel lost out there. Yes, these numbers are skewed because the majority of people diagnosed with ET are older than 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s, closer to 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s, so that 15-20 year prognosis applies to the older crowd. If you are in your mid-late 20\u2019s like I am you can expect to lead a long mostly normal life. I am 36 with triple negative ET.. normal life, aspirin only :) have 3 kids, a job and workout regularly... just do yourself a favor and avoid Facebook groups lol, they are kind of negative and scary Reddit and MPN Voice is the best place to see real people. I think Facebook will be full of people that are not helping themselves.  \n\n\n\"Help, since I was diagnosed I have put on a lot of weight and cannot do anything.\"  \n\n\nRight, it is not the 10 cheeseburgers, was it?", "I have a hematology referral this Friday. What should I expect? So, my platelets have been kind of high for a few years 400K+, as high as 480K on record and 520K that I recall. I have had heavy periods and problems with bruising, but also fatigue, lightheadedness, and other symptoms.\n\nI have had high WBCs on and off for years, with my ABS Neutrophils, ABS Lymphocytes, and ABS Monocytes going high periodically.\n\nAs far as I know, I have the genotype that predisposes me to develop the Jak2+ V617F mutation. I also have many risk factors for multiple benign blood disorders that add up.\n\nI have a borderline enlarged liver, but I am not sure about my spleen, though I do seem to have a left-side lump at my ribcage that is painful, and a few other lumps from my chest to my hip.\n\nI also get really deep bone pain that hurts a lot and is kind of dull, but persistent. I get it all over my body including my head, and am generally pretty lethargic and physically weak.\n\nDid anyone else get an official diagnosis below 500K on their platelets? I do not know what to make of the high WBCs other than maybe chronic illness or repeated infections.\n\nLeukemia does not seem to present with high platelers and sporadically high neutrophils, leukocytes, and monocytes as far as I can tell.\n\nAny advice or input would be appreciated. I believe that you will be sent to *bone marrow biopsy* (BMP) which will then a lot more. As for the painful lumps, they might mean something or they might be just one being hyper sensitive. I mean, you are no way crazy or anything, but sometimes if we fear some health issue, google is and start poking ourselves, we also tend to find all sorts of sore sports and lumps.\n\nI got my ET diagnosis with 650 platelets. But a heart attack + a stroke kind of made the diagnosis faster. But it was confirmed with positive JAK2 test and a BMP. That makes a lot of sense. When I was about 14 or 15, I was supposed to get an angiography to assess if I had been having TIAs. At age 19, I had a borderline ECG that was suggestive a possible inferior infarct. Also, I supposedly have a risk factor for EDS IV, the vascular type.", "Voice of MPN? Tracker tools? Hi all, what does everyone think of Voices of MPN? I have stumbled across their sites a few times while doing some research. I saw they had a \"tracker tool\" on their website and I thought it sounded useful for tracking symptoms/labs/etc. I have tried to register twice and each time it has not worked. It said they were sending an email and I had to confirm my email address but that email never came (I extensively search all spam folders, etc.) Has anyone else successfully signed up for these? Did you find them helpful? Is Voice of MPN cool or a scam? Haha This page is run by Incyte, the pharmaceutical company that developed and markets Jakafi and ruxolitinib.   I do not think it is a scam, but rather a way for the company to engage with those with MPNs.\n\n( Ahh that makes sense!", "Just jumping into testing Hello. Wife of potential PC dude. Heading to a hematologist next week (Jan 5th) to see what he would like to do next. Family doc had a pathologist examine his PB Smear and recommended the further investigation: for PC, secondary erythrocytosis, cold agglutinin, or monoclonal gammopathy. My husband\u2019s paternal grandfather had Polycythemia, that turned into MDS, and died from complications of it. So, familiarly, there is a genetic history of PC. My husband also suffers from multiple other  health conditions. Male, 35-40 years old. Looking for some support or ideas of what your first appointment looked like. Thank you. Did your husband's grandfather have polycythemia or polycythemia vera? There is a difference. Polycythemia is usually secondary, which means it is caused by an underlying condition such as sleep apnea or obesity. Usually once the main issue is treated, it goes away.  He may have essential thrombocythemia if he has high platelets. \n\nAfter a few discussions with my doctor out of monitoring my bloodwork, , my hemo  doc had me do a bone marrow biopsy and sent it for genetic testing. Turns out, yes, I have gene mutation. She sent me to an MPN specialist at University of Md. They did an eryrthropoeitin test on me and it is consistent with PV, even though my blood work did show I had ET. My doc sent me for a second opinion because I was the youngest person she would ever seen with it. Luckily the MPN specialist had seen it before. I was diagnosed at 27.\n\n It is very possible your husband's other health problems can be caused by an MPN. I have had constant headaches for as long as I remember  and not a single doctor ever did blood work and I think they should have because they could have helped me. For years, they are like we do not know why you have migraines and a simple CBC blood test could have determined this--but no one ever suspected it because 1. it is rare(sorta) , and 2. it is rare for someone in my age group. \n\nPolycythemia Vera is permanent usually due to JAK 2 mutation or CALR mutation which creates too many blood cells. I do not know what PC is or MDS is. I know that PV can evolve into Myelefibrosis , but I do not know what MDS is or what you are referring to. \n\ngood luck to you and your husband. An MPN is treatable. You will have some good days and bad days. Thanks so much for the reply. My husband does not know about his grandfathers type of PC unfortunately. His family is pretty medically ignorant and I doubt his grandfather would have even understood that difference. His platelets are normal. Do you know if a BMB is required for that genetic test? Seems like he should just be able to have a cheek swab or blood draw nowadays- ouch! My husband recently started getting insane migraines, about 4 months ago. And he also has had increased fatigue in that timeframe as well. I am sorry to hear your diagnosis took so long. We put so much trust in the health profession, it is hard to handle when they fail us. Because my husband already deals with another extremely rare disease (a heart condition), it is always hard to tell if the new symptoms are not just caused by his meds or his condition. We certainly hope for some answers soon, but do not wish for another condition that cannot be \u2018fixed.\u2019 Thanks again for your reply! i believe a BMB is required for a genetic test. Man, that is rough. I wonder if they will order one right away or do some more work beforehand. Sorry for the late reply.  It is not. I had all the genetic tests.  It was done via a blood draw.  I have PV JAK 2+.", "Went in today for bone pain (among other issues, but bone pain is a new symptom for me) and got some tests done. These are elevated but my doctor did not say it was concerning. Could it be MPN?  This looks a lot like my numbers except my platelets are in the 600s.  I was diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera Jak 2+ in January.  \n\n I would ask for a hematology consult. \n\nI have bone pain and I HATE it. Thank you! I will follow up Monday and ask about a consult.\n\nThe bone pain is definitely not fun! Definitely get a Haematology consult. Did your doctor put you on any blood thinners in the meantime? No, she said I should follow up with my rheumatologist about the pain but did not mention any medication or concerns about my test results. \n\nIt was not my usual doctor so I will be reaching out to my PCP on Monday and see what she says/ask about a consult. I assumed if it was urgent they would let me know (at least I would hope)! Ah okay cool. Hopefully it is nothing and just a flair up for whatever reason. My platelets were sitting at 520 and my GP at the time just prescribed baby aspirin, which I am still taking now that I am seeing a haematologist.\n\nMy GP was never really concerned to be honest and said it could be ET and just sent me home with aspirin until I made my appointment myself with my specialist Good to know, thank you so much! Hopefully it is nothing, but I will update my post once I get answers! Update: doctor said let us retest my CBC levels in 6-8 weeks and see how they look", "My Story December 28, 2009. A day much like any other, but a day I will not soon forget. I am asleep in bed, though I had not been for long, when my chest and my stomach both begin to hurt. I get up, thinking I need to go to the  bathroom, but it does not do any good. The pain does not go away. I begin sweating profusely and groaning in pain. By this point I have woken my girlfriend up and from the look on her face I can definitely tell I look pretty terrible.\n\nI have her drive me to the hospital and got checked in. To make a long story short, I was diagnosed as having a heart attack due to a blood clot in my left anterior descending artery. I was in the hospital for about a week while I recovered and they tried to discover what caused the clot. After drawing what felt like a gallon of my blood over the course of four days, I meet with a hematologist who informs me that she believes I have Essential Thrombocytosis as well as a secondary blood condition called Lupus Anticoagulant. Later this was confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy as well as a blood test where I was found to be positive for the JAK2 mutation.

I have also taken Lovenox and Plavix.\n\nIt is a scary feeling, knowing how close I was to death that day, as well as knowing that I have this condition that may some day kill me. I am constantly tired, though if that is from the condition or from the chemotherapy I do not know. The Hydrea has caused other side effects in the past three years I have taken it. My hair has thinned, I get mouth sores more often and they do not seem to go away as quickly. My overall quality of life has decreased considerably since then.\n\nIt is also difficult explaining this condition to people around me. I cannot really say it is cancer, though it does technically fall into the same category. And since there are no real visible symptoms, people seem to have a difficult time understanding why I am so fatigued all the time.\n\nI hope that others on here will be willing to share their stories as well.

But a \u2018Big C\u2019 Label Has Surprising Upsides.\n\nClassifying a rare blood disorder as a cancer opened new doors for disease investigation, treatment and hope for a cure.\n\n\nBy Ruth Fein Revell\n\nI have a rare blood disorder. When it was diagnosed 25 years ago, it was called an \u201corphan disease,\u201d meaning the small number of people affected did not justify research investments by major pharmaceutical companies.\n\nEnter the World Health Organization and its 2008 decision to classify the condition as a blood \u201ccancer.\u201d This opened new doors for disease investigation and understanding. It prompted a growing number of super specialist practitioners, and most important, hope for some 300,000 people living in the United States with what are now called myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MPNs.\n\nNobody likes to hear a cancer diagnosis, particularly for a disease they thought was benign. In fact, when I first saw my blood disorder referred to as a cancer, I wrote to the MPN Research Foundation, a nonprofit research and advocacy group, and suggested they remove the \u201cBig C\u201d word from their website. How, I thought, could they be so misleading?\n\nThat is when I discovered I was behind the times. MPNs were indeed reclassified as a malignant condition of the bone marrow, affecting sometimes one, two or all three types of blood cells: white cells, red cells and platelets.\n\nThe average age people are diagnosed with an MPN is 60-something. My diagnosis came at age 38. For the next 15 years, I was treated for essential thrombocythemia, a type of MPN that caused my bone marrow to produce significantly higher than normal numbers of platelets. The proliferation of platelets put me at risk for dangerous clots and ultimately led to complete blockages of two important veins of the portal system, which carries blood to the liver.\n\nThe Big C label began to look like good news.\n\nOnce MPNs were classified as blood cancers \u2014 including essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis \u2014 interest grew from research laboratories, major medical centers, and small and mega pharmaceutical companies, which now saw these rare and poorly understood conditions as an opportunity. Perhaps pieces to the MPN puzzle could shed light on more common blood cancers, like leukemia and lymphoma. And perhaps treatments for those widely studied cancers could be used to treat MPNs.\n\n\u201cThe cancer designation did open up significant new funding opportunities, for example from the National Cancer Institute,\u201d said Barbara Van Husen, board chair of the MPN Research Foundation. \u201cIt has definitely accelerated research.\u201d There are more than 200 clinical trials underway for various MPNs, as well as ongoing research into stem cell transplantation, currently the only potential cure for these rare cancers.\n\nIn my case, for reasons researchers are working to understand, my bone marrow flipped a switch. I was no longer making excessive platelets. Instead I was producing too many red cells and was given a revised diagnosis of polycythemia vera, a distinctly different MPN. I went for regular phlebotomies, the modern version of bloodletting in which pints of my blood were drained into a collection bag to reduce blood volume. Think blood transfusion, reversed.\n\nDoctors increased the dose of the 30-year-old chemotherapy drug I had been taking since my blood clots first appeared. The drug is still considered standard of care \u201cif well tolerated.\u201d It effectively adjusted my red counts. Unlike newer, more targeted drugs, however, it does not discriminate, potentially killing off not just red cells but white cells and platelets as well.\n\nI continued to live a full and largely unaffected life, though I often suffered symptoms such as debilitating headaches and bone pain.\n\nThe hallmark fatigue of these blood disorders was not yet on my radar. I hiked. I cycled. I traveled. I was a night owl typically functioning \u201cwell\u201d on five to six hours of sleep.\n\nThen, in September of 2019, my summer bike rides became an exhausting effort. By October, I was so fatigued that walking up a slightly inclined sidewalk had me leaning on a lamppost to catch my breath. Doctors identified scarring (\u201cfibrosis\u201d) in my bone marrow, elevating my diagnosis once again, to the third evolution of my MPN journey, myelofibrosis.\n\n\u201cYou are a poster child for exploring new drug therapies for MPNs,\u201d Dr. Ellen Ritchie, of Weill Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, recently told me. Just seven months into my participation in a global phase 2 clinical trial for a new combination drug therapy, tests indicated significant, measurable improvement. It appears my disease is beginning to reverse.\n\nMore than two decades after my first of many bone marrow biopsies, I have more energy than many of the \u201chealthy\u201d people I know.\n\nWe tend to think of cancer as acute. Get it out quickly, go through treatments, prevent it from spreading. But for those with a chronic cancer like an MPN, there is not a distinctive beginning, middle and end. It can be overwhelming, emotionally exhausting, and even as we learn more about the disease, full of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cOften, individuals with a chronic illness, like cancer, are more challenged to be hopeful about their future, while also needing to be focused on thriving on a daily basis,\u201d says Laura Kaplan, a licensed clinical social worker whose Connecticut practice helps people navigate serious illness. \u201cIt is important for their identity and quality of life to try to keep a good perspective about living with the process of their disease.\u201d\n\nFor years, I chose not to let my condition define me. I chose not to identify myself as someone living with cancer. I would simply live my life fully, day to day. I would work hard and play hard, enjoy raising my two boys, deal with whatever challenged my health, and keep on moving. That approach continues to serve me well.\n\nRuth Fein Revell, a health and environment writer, serves on a patient advisory board of the MPN Research Foundation. Thank you for posting!! Thankyou for posting this. I was recently diagnosed with a Jak2 mutation although my blood levels are normal so far. I go between being scared shitless and just trying to take it day by day.", "Donating plasma I have not been diagnosed yet, but have had high platelets in the 500s-600s for a few months and not seeing my hematologist for another few weeks.. I use to donate plasma a couple months ago and cannot find anything online if it would affect anything.. has anyone donated plasma with having high platelets? With covid and not working many hours and being a college student I am really in the need of the $20 that they offer for a donation. What are your thoughts?! I have always heard that the only thing we can donate is our eyes, but I cannot seem to find a source on that. We definitely cannot donate blood or platelets, so I think that would apply to plasma too. Pretty sure we are technically not allowed to donate if you are positive for the mutations since we are technically cancer patients.", "High Platelets and Fatigue? 49F currently waiting on a diagnosis.  My platelets have been high for five years, but nothing too dramatic.  Just slightly above normal.  For the past six months, they have been in the high 600s and holding steady.  My basophils have also been consistently high. My doc was sure I was anemic, but my iron, ferritin, and B-12 levels came back as normal.  Fortunately, everything else looks great and besides a weird form of arthritis in my hands, I am in good health.  My hematologist is thinking either ET or Reactive thrombocytosis from the arthritis.  Either way, I am wondering if any of you with ET have problems with fatigue and if so, how do you manage it?  The fatigue is really getting to me. I was diagnosed with ET at 15 and I am 24 now and oh my gosh, the fatigue kills me sometimes. I unfortunately do not have any tricks, other than to keep hydrated and rest whenever possible. I am sorry! I wish I had more to offer! Sending strength your way! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f I was diagnosed with ET earlier this year at 25. Somedays I feel so much older than I am with how fatigued I get! Having a good diet and regular exercise keeps my energy levels up, but it is still a real struggle somedays. I am lucky to have a really supportive and understanding workplace. Please do not feel obliged to share, but I am curious, does your hematologist have a plan in place for you beyond monitoring? I have a lot of faith in my hematologist but I have seen people of similar ages with ET who are on treatment. That is such a long time for you to have this ET nightmare looming over you. Sending you some strength too \u2764\u2764 I am actually on treatment, only because I have had mini strokes. When I was 15, they started me on anagrelide, but my body did not respond to it correctly. So, around 16, they started me on Hydroxyurea 500mg daily and a baby aspirin daily. They also do bone marrow biopsies and aspirations every two years. My hematologist said I would not have to be on treatment if it was not for me having previous strokes. So, maybe that is why. I do not know, every hematologist seems to treat this disease differently. I wish more was known about ET. Thank you. This does help.  \n\nI am so relieved I finally have an answer for the fatigue and that it is not anything worse. I am so sorry, that is so much to go through! My hematologist said something similar, he was involved in some research which showed that if you have not had a blood event, then your risk is really low and there is no need for treatment. But that kind of scares me in itself cause its like, there has to be a first time, so am I just wait for something big and scary like that to happen?? Dont get me wrong, the treatments all sound horrendous and the last thing I want is to need treatment, I hope they dont give you too much of a hard time. I just struggle sometimes knowing I have this chronic condition and all we can do about it for now is nothing. I have a follow up appointment with my hematologist in the new year and I am so anxious about seeing the numbers. Do you have any helpful tips for coping with that? Also, it might interest you to know if you do not already, someone out there is doing research around the genetic mutations involved with ET. My hematologist sent some of my blood off to contribute to the research which I thought was pretty cool, I cannot remember where the research is being done but its somewhere really far away from me. I am one of the extra rare ones that does not have the most common gene mutations. Also just super grateful to be a New Zealander. Healthcare here is mostly free. You will probably need a bone marrow biopsy. I had one to diagnose my essential Thrombocythemia and it was not near as bad as I thought it would be. MPNs are extremely complicated. If your doctor is not knowledgeable, get a hematologist. Call the leukemia and lymphoma society at the number on LLS.com. They are very helpful. Luckily, my Rheumatologist referred me to a hematologist after the iron, ferritin, and B-12 test results showed I was not anemic.  I am currently awaiting results from gene mutation tests (JAK2, Calr, etc.)  to determine if I have an ET or Reactive Thrombocytosis. I found out a year (at 35 years old) ago that I had high platelets (640,000) so I was sent to a hematologist. She was positive I was anemic bc my iron, b12 and folic acid were low and I was exhausted... fast forward a year and all of those are normal with meds but my platelets are at 940,000... still exhausted.. had a bone marrow biopsy done last month and it confirmed it is essential thrombocythemia.... your situation sounds very similar to mine Thanks for your reply.  I find out Monday if I have Reactive or Essential thrombocythemia. Hello.  I just got home from the clinic and I have been diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera. Apparently it is a cut and dry case. I was just diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera.  I have the JAK mutation. So, after a nice nap, because I am always tired, I am going to head to Walgreens to get my baby aspirin and enjoy the relief of having an answer.  \n\nThanks again for all your responses. Omg! The fatigue is real. I am 57 f diagnosed with ET/JAK2 a year ago in April. Whenever I would go to my primary doctor just for check ups I would tell him that I am so fatigued. I eat fairly healthy do not get a lot of exercise but I do not have energy to do anything. I work a 5-1:30 work shift so my day starts at 3:30 am, but I go to bed at 7-7:30. I used to go to work and get off and head right for the golf course to play nine holes. Now I cannot wait to get home so I can take a nap for a couple hours before bedtime.", "Please help me understand? I saw my hematologist today, he said I had a myeloproliferative disorder, but when I asked him which particular one, he said I did not meet the diagnostic criteria for any of them? What I know is I have a CALR mutation, I am jak2 negative. My white blood cell count is elevated, my platelets fluctuate apparently, tend to run high and I have a history of high platelets and my red blood cells fluctuate, as well. Today they were low, but have been normal I am the past. My WBC has consistently been high for several years and but only ever so slightly. My doc said mine are like 12,000 which is above normal, but he said 50,000 would be considered high, I guess, so I really do not know what is going on with me? Also, I do not know if it is relevant, but I have scarring on my bones, which is what initially tipped off the doctors. They freaked the fuck out and told me I probably have leukemia, but I was tested for acute and the chronic form and I do not, so I do not know what the fuck is wrong with me. \ud83d\ude37 My hemotologist/oncologist recommended a second opinion years ago when I was diagnosed with my MPN.

Hydroxeurea helped with my bone scaring at one point.

Unfortunately, I do not have many treatment options, I am on state insurance. Currently, my hematologist is monitoring my situation, but does not seem very concerned? He said if my numbers were higher, then they would put me on medication, but as it stands, I am okay, I guess?  That is a new one on me. That batch of symptoms is one I have not heard about, though I am by no means a doctor. My initial thought is jak2 negative PV, but from my reading online that is pretty rare. Even rarer than normal.

I have been taking aspirin semi-regularly since (I am not good at remembering though.) At the time of diagnosis, my platelet count was high but not yet very concerning. Was terrified at first but then started shrugging it off as something that probably would not affect my life too much. I did not go back to the doc for a while because I had an insurance change, and I have just gotten back my latest blood test results with my new doctor. It is higher now and I am back to being scared like I was two years ago. I have always feared getting an incurable illness like this. I do not want to have to go on chemo. It is so easy to pretend like this is not happening, but I need to face it. I just want someone to tell me it will probably be fine, ya know? \n\nIt is interesting to hear it does affect vision because I have been getting silent migraines with aura for years. It is kind of satisfying to see some of my seemingly unrelated symptoms finally come together with an answer! Still, it is hard not to brood. I do not know what to do and it is so difficult to find solid answers for something so relatively rare. I should have been more diligent with my aspirin. I want to cry. Any words of encouragement would be much appreciated. I have been diagnosed with ET for a year. I had 1 million platelets in 2000. The life expectancy for ET is the same as a normal person. If you take a medicine to slow the proliferation, like Jakafi or hydroxyurea, it will slow the production of red blood cells and cause anemia. You will be really tired with anemia. Some doctors will not try to slow the proliferation of platelets. The dangers are blood clots and other vascular problems (stroke, heart attack) caused by high platelets. The percentages of this happening are really low and you can take baby aspirin for it. There is a low percentage of the ET progressing to myelofibrosis. From myelofibrosis it can progress to leukemia, but again the percentage is low. There are some youtubes about this. Search for \"MPN ET.\" This can get really technical but read and take notes and it will come into focus. How high are your platelets? Do you know your hemoglobin number? I got test results recently but for some reason it just gave an \u201cautomated count\u201d for platelets, whatever that means, showing it normal in the 400s. The only reason I know it is higher is I got a message on their website from the dr saying it is over the 600\u2019s (where it previously was) and to make an appointment, but not how much higher. I am new to all this, but for hemoglobin, on my results where it says HGBA1C%, it says 5.1% The HGBA1C is a test for blood glucose. They shine a laser through the hemoglobin or something technical like that. So at least you do not have diabetes. Hemoglobin should be listed as Hgb and next to red blood cells or similar. There are different normal ranges but under 10 you may have anemia. Google \"how to read a CBC\" and study this. If your Hgb and platelets are normal or close to normal, there should not be a lot to do as far as treatment, which is good. If your white blood cells (there are several types) are normal or close, you are doing good. Google and read, read, read until you get an understanding of this. It is really complicated so you will not be an expert by you can understand the basics. Thank you! This makes me feel better. Hi! I am sorry you have joined the MPN club. I am 32, diagnosed almost two years ago with PV (JAK2, ASXL1, TET2 +), and had symptoms 5 years before that. It probably would have remained misdiagnosed if I had not been pregnant and had a blood panel done. :| My symptoms included serious headaches (including one that was a solid month long, ugh), itching, visual fuzziness, etc. \n\nI am not sure where you are from and if you are seeing a specialist who has specific experience with MPNs in young people. I go to MD Anderson. Because I had a high symptom burden, my doctor put me on 90 mcg of Pegasys weekly. I cannot TELL you how much better I feel! I rarely feel itchy; the other symptoms are gone. \n\nSome benefits of Pegasys are that it lowers your allele burden and it is not general chemo. HU is BAT, but pretty much just because ropeginterferon is not through the US\u2019s approval process/we are using Peg off label. But Pegasys is interferon, a thing your body naturally makes. You may feel some flu-like symptoms after injection (though you can minimize with good hydration and having your injection right before you go to sleep), but it is not a foreign concept to your body. Hydroxyurea is general chemo and kills your extra blood cells... but it may take other things down with it. \n\nIt can be hard to get your insurance on board with because it is off label use. But I would say it is worth it. HU is associated with a potential increase in progression to AML. It is also for some reason associated with a rise in skin cancers. That is why my doctor decided against it. It is one thing to put someone over 65 that may give you another cancer in 15 years... but not us! Too young for that, LOL. And you have to \u201cfail\u201d HU to be put on Jakafi. So you would have to take HU, say it does not work for you, and -then- move to rux. \n\nAre you a member of MPN Voice on Health Unlocked? It is the largest online community I have seen for people with MPNs, and it is pretty active too. If you have a Twitter account, may I also suggest checking out #mpnsm? It stands for \u201cMPN social media.\u201d A number of hematologist-oncologists and patients use it to tag their posts. It is a mix of scientific journal updates, published study results, patient interaction, and conference updates. I think it is great to be able to follow what my doctor and his colleagues are considering important enough to retweet. Thank you so much for all the information! I am in the US - I am going to see a new hematologist soon. I recently switched to kaiser for insurance so I am not sure if I can see an MLP specialist unfortunately. I am really hoping to avoid chemo though so I will make sure to keep those options in mind to bring up! Best of luck! :D Went through the approvals process with United Healthcare last year and Cigna this year; never dealt with Kaiser though. If you cannot see a specialist, definitely check into some of those resources. You are your own best advocate. \n\nShoot me a message if you ever want to talk MPN experiences, Pegasys, or just need some encouragement. It can be scary to have a chronic disease, but at least we know and can get medical help now. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I am 46 and was diagnosed with ET about four years ago. I think of it this way, everyone has something to deal with and this is a pretty easy one. I take aspirin and do phlebotomies, otherwise life is pretty normal. \n\nIf I could offer one piece of advice from my experience is this... Diet and exercise have a profound effect on how I feel. Fatigue is a symptom that can sometimes knock me down. Not the, \"I feel a little sleepy at work\" sort if feeling, but rather a, \"I need to go rest because I have walked for fifteen minutes\" type of fatigue. I have found that when I eat healthy and do daily exercise, the fatigue is really mitigated. It can be incredibly hard to get up and exercise when you feel so tired, but try. A half hour on the treadmill may wipe you out today, but tomorrow you will feel so much better. \n\nI do not mean to make it sounds scary, but want you to know that the fatigue is a possibility, but for me, it is like less than 5% of the time. \n\nYour life will not be greatly affected if you do what the doctor advises. Good luck! Hi, I am sorry to hear about your struggle adjusting to the \"blood disorder club\".\nIt took me so long to really acknowledge it and deal with it too.  I have had it over 10 years. \nYou need your asprin everyday. That is the least you can do.\nThe other post about diet and excersise are spot on, most of the time I excersise (mainly just doing weights) for the feel good it gives my brain.\nWhen I started to properly look after myself is when I stopped second guessing what might happen to me in the future.  Excersises and a good diet mean you are doing all you can. Oh,  \n2 ltrs of water a day too. \nI see your young and it feels really unfair, but this path your now on has given you the chance to lead your best health life.

One of the reasons I went to the doctor was that I am getting partial or full auras almost every day now. I also have had high normal rbc almost my whole life before more recently. It does make me wonder how long I have been affected. Im 20 diagnosed with ET at age 17. My diagnosis only came because of the diligence of an ER doc. At age 17 I was an athlete in high school playing lacrosse and lifting weights and all those things. After a practice one day I got into the car and started to lose control of my emotions, weeping due to an extreme headache and dehydration. I made it home and stumbled upstairs to the bathroom where I called for my brother to get my anxiety medicine (misdiagnosed due to the affects ET had on my body). Shortly after he left i blacked out and only remember waking up twice the rest of the night, once being carried down the stairs by a firefighter and second to vomit in the hospital. That day changed my life forever. I have never really reached out to find anyone else who has been through this and have always hid the pain that comes with it. But after two years my numbers vary from 600 to 1mil regularly (super bad about meds) but pills beat the self injections. Hi! I know this is late but I can relate a lot. I got diagnosed with ET (JAK2 mutation) when I was 18, and get migraines with auras as well! Please take your aspirin regularly, but your platelet count did not jump because of that!! Aspirin just makes platelets less efficient, so they will not stick together as well which means it will reduce clotting. Clotting can cause strokes and/or heart attacks! it DOES NOT reduce your platelets! So that is not at all your fault!\n\nSide note: I am also pretending like I do not have it and not even thinking about chemo :P #denialgang", "Anyone take Hydrea for PV? Dr. just ordered the start of Hydrea for me. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed PV. Anyone here taking Hydrea? ( or similar ). Wondering about side effects etc. I did and had relatively little side effects. Did get canker sores though. I just started today. How long did you have to take it? 6 months and now only taking it twice a week. Honestly, I have tolerated it rather well. I started on Pegasys which is an injection. I guess it is working. Sometimes I feel crappy after I take it, but other times I do not feel anything at all. I have taken Hydrea for ET for 10 years or so. I have not had too many side effects that I have noticed, mostly just being more prone to canker sores. I have also noticed that cuts and scratches tend to take a little longer to heal and my hair is thinning, but I am not sure how much of that is due to the Hydrea or just me getting older (I am in my early 40s). Thank you for replying. I hope all is well and you are doing better. Glad to hear I may be able to get away from taking it everyday. I appreciate the feedback. I just turned 59 and was diagnosed last July. Watching my numbers but, Doc wants me on Hydrea. I am told most people tolerate it well. Minimal side effects would be great. Stay well. I have taken between 2-4  Hydrea pills daily for 4 years for ET. No noticeable side effects. I used to feel slightly nauseous if I took them without food, but that is largely gone away. Good luck. Thanks for the encouraging news! Stay well! My relative used it for a month after diagnosis and then started getting 40+ degrees (celcius) fever and was eventually hospitalized. Then tried it twice 2 weeks and 4 weeks after, but got the fever again both times. Then was put on other drugs (cannot remember the name).\n\nThe fevers started maybe 5-6 hours after taking the drug.\n\nEdit: Doctor said that the side effect was pretty uncommon which is the reason the doctor asked the relative to try it again twice before calling it quits. I take Hydrea for E(H)T. I lost some hair once the dose got up to 1,500mg a day but it balances out and my hair grew back. How old are you?", "Essential Thrombocythemia VS Having a baby Hi there, please bear with me as English is not my first language but I will do my best.   \nWe could really use some opinions. :(   \nWe are not here trying to seek medical advice, as we already decided on this matter, but would like to hear some of your testimonials because there is not a lot of people who went through this issue here in Portugal.  \n**Some background:**  \nI am a 34 year old female from Portugal.  \nMy husband (54 y.o.) was diagnosed with ET six months ago and started his treatment with Hydroxyurea right away. So far he has seen 2 different private hematologists (the best ones here), and both have different opinions concerning conceiving a child whilst under this treatment. We did not know, neither had the public doctor tell us that my husband should consider freeze his sperm before initiate the treatment. :(   \n**About having a baby:**  \nThe first doctor is absolutely OK with us trying to conceive, he only stated that the medicine (Hydroxyurea) might eventually affect my husband's fertility so we would think about alternatives if there was no pregnancy after 6 months.  \nThe next doctor we went to for a second opinion said that the treatment would 100% affect the fetus, so his suggestion was to stop it and take a different medicine (some injectable one) for a minimum of 6 months, and only then trying to conceive. Although this new one would increase his symptoms and perhaps bring new ones.  \n**Looking for people in the same situation to kindly ask you to share your story. Sending a lot of love to you all.** I am not in the same situation, I am sorry, but I know that I was prescribed interferon (probably the injectable treatment you mentioned) while pregnant and breastfeeding. My understanding is that Hydrea will affect embryos, but I do not know about sperm. If you have a Facebook account there are some much larger and more active support groups on there that may have better answers for you. Thank you so much. Did interferon worked fine for you? I am currently being tested for MPNs and am 32. While researching the various medications I have done a lot of reading of studies regarding these meds including hydroxyurea. It is believed to reduce sperm count in men. Changing the med was probably a good call for your husband. Thanks, we believe it was too :) Check out this FB group, it has a large active population. The topic about conceiving was discussed a few weeks back.\n\n( Thank you so much, I appreciate! We are still a bit in the dark with this. Yes it did. I had some fatigue, flu like symptoms right after injecting (paracetamol helped), and I did not enjoy having to inject myself, but it worked for me. My kids are now pre-teens and very healthy and happy. We also have an 11 year old. Glad it worked out fine for you and your family :) I am 27 female and have PV, but with high platelets. I am currently on interferon the injectable that is I give myself. \n\nIt is not as bad as the migraine shot, Emgality. Now that is a big needle, I digress. \n\nThe reason they have me on interferon now is because it is a better long term solution because they were Uber concerned about me being able to have children. And I was not even sure but I think I will be able to now because it can make my blood be normal. Which means less complications with pregnancy. \n\nI think it would be less of a problem for a man, but I have read the hu can be stopped within 6 months for men before trying to conceive. \n\n\nI am on a very small dose of interferon like .08 right now and will increase next week. I have experienced no side effects from interferon right now. \n\nBest of luck. If you guys have a baby, I am interested to follow your story.", "ET symptom? Anyone else get cold and cannot warm up? Hi all! I am not officially diagnosed with ET but my hematologist said I most likely have it. I am not sure if this is something that happens to other people but I remember reading about cold hands/feet being a symptom so I feel like this might be related. Sometimes once I get slightly cold i cannot warm up. I feel like I am cold down to my bones and it will take me hours to feel like I have warmed up. Curious if anyone else feels this? Before I got treatment I often had this. Ok glad it is not just me! Yeah this happens to me sometimes.  Tends to be when I am tired or stressed out.  I just have to get in a warm shower to try to forcibly equalize the temperature. That is a good idea!", "Anyone JAK2+ with no symptoms? And a few other questions. TLDR: 32F. Probably JAK2+. Blood results in Feb seemed normal. Anyone positive with no symptoms and no MPN? Anyone start off positive with no MPN and then develop one? What are typically the next steps when someone comes up positive? Should I consider seeing an MPN specialist if I am positive?\n\nHi all. New here. 32/F.\n\nLong story short I got referred to a hematologist as a precaution due to family history, who ran a few tests. She was going to call me if everything was fine, and said she would call me in if something showed up. Well, she called to bring me in and the only test \"pending\" is the JAK2 V617F Mutation PCR. I know this health system will not release results until my physician has a chance to review it with me. So I am guessing it is positive, but still hoping for the best. \n\nI might have symptoms, I might not. I have a lot of fatigue, which has gotten worse in the past year. I also started getting night sweats sometimes. Additionally, I do get headaches. But overall I am pretty healthy. I had my annual physical with blood work in February My WBC were 5.3x10^3, RBC 3.98x10^6, platelets were 300x10^3. Hemoglobin 11.7, hematocrit 37.7%. Iron a little low, as well as B12 and D (this could be the reason for my fatigue, but I have been on vitamins again for 3 weeks now with no improvement). \n\nHas anyone gotten a JAK2+ result with no symptoms? Anyone go through testing and find out they do not have an MPN yet? Did you start off positive with no symptoms and then develop one?\n\nWhat should I expect the next steps to be? I am assuming my doctor will want to run more blood tests, but what should I expect her to be looking for? \n\nAlso, if I am positive should I see an MPN specialist?\n\nThanks in advance everyone. I had unexplained headaches for years and I got itchy after I got out of the shower. But it was not anything I thought that was wrong.\n\nI knew something was wrong when I had a headache at all times, and I kid you not I saw 6 neurologists and 3 family practice pros to NOT run bloodwork. No tumors, nothing shows up on MRIs or CT scans\u2014but I am certain I have had this for a decade and nobody fucking bothered to do bloodwork. \n\nBut after treating my PV, which it turned out to be, I have PV with ET my headaches virtually disappeared. It still happens sometimes, when I get headaches because I also have chronic migraines but those have been very good as long as I remain consistent with my migraine CGRPs. \n\nI am pretty healthy otherwise. I had a platelet count of over 1 mil. I clotted real bad in my gut July of 2020. Mesenteric Veinous thrombosis. I had been having stomach aches that were not going away and looking back on it they were different than the usual food sensitivity problems I would had in the past. Went to the ER and had a CT scan and was diagnosed with colitis. A week later I was back in for another CT scan and I had massive clots. It was so bad I had to  have surgery that night to remove 33cm of ischemic small intestine. Two days later surgery did a re-section. Later I tested positive for Jak2 mutation and other than some anemia and low platelets in the weeks after I have had normal CBC. I go to hematology every 6 months and for over a year everything has been normal. I have no symptoms. I feel like I cannot eat a lot at one time or it is just me being careful that I do not hurt my digestive system. I eat 6 small healthy meals a day and I have lost 30 pounds. I have to be on blood thinners for life because the clots were so extensive. There is a recent study that concluded the mutation can precede a change in blood counts by decades.  \n\n(\n\nI would see a MPN specialist if there is one nearby.   I started having intermittent symptoms of my MPN well before my blood counts rose.  I was looking for answers for 7 years before my numbers went really wonky and I was referred to a hematologist.  I am sorry you are going through this. Thank you for the link and recommendation to see an MPN specialist. I am lucky enough to have 3 in my immediate area. \n\nAnd thank you for your experience. It is just surreal at this point. We will see what my hematologist says! Thank you for your experience. I also get migraines, but these are def not migraines. But they could just be normal headaches, too.\n\nWe will see what the hematologist says on Monday! Thank you for your experience. I am so sorry you had to go through that. \n\nIt is nice to know I could be just looking at monitoring for now but we will see what my hematologist says. I am guessing she will order another CBC at a minimum.  I should add that I was in my late 50's when that event occurred. I am fit and healthy and the doctors were baffled and my first response after that 2nd CT scan was WTF! I have some theories. My hematologist told me Jak2 causes the body to make too many platelets or red blood cells or white blood cells. He has not told me much else about it. Maybe because we have not needed to cross that bridge yet and he knows I am the anxious sort. But my theory is that with Covid I was home all the time, less active, having more adult beverages than usual because I had no evening rehearsals like I usually do. And the alcohol irritated my colon and we all know inflammation is not our friend. Body said \"let us get this thing\" and I had a buildup of white blood cells. Hematologist says I did not cause this to happen. But I do believe what I was doing at the time of Covid stay at home orders was not helpful. I had headaches that I had no clue what caused them. For literally 10 years. Started taking Hydroxyurea and CGRPs and the constant headache went away. It was a migraine/regular headache. Not always quite as bad as a migraine all the time.\n\nBut there was not a damn thing any medication could do for it. Nothing at all. Botox, chiropractic, otc meds, muscle relaxers, exedrine, coffee.  Nothing I could do to make them go away. This went on for a decade without anyone thinking maybe we should do blood work. CGRPS and Hydroxyurea has been a life saver. I also had constant headaches for years before my diagnosis. More of a pressure than a pain issue, but so constant that I barely noticed anymore. Did not realize how bad it had gotten until I started taking hydroxyurea and my symptoms subsided. 41F, last year had bad abdominal pain one night out of nowhere. After days with no real relief I ended up getting a CAT scan and they found a big clot in my portal vein / splenic artery junction area. Put me on blood thinners and had me follow up with a hematologist. All of my blood work came back normal except I was JAK2 positive. I have been seeing an MPN specialist since. My clot has since cleared and I have literally no other symptoms. I am probably on blood thinners for life due to the risk of that happening again, but at this point we just monitor my CBC every 6 months and that is it. No other treatments necessary as my blood counts are completely normal and I have no other symptoms. It is strange knowing this thing is sort of lurking in the shadows\u2026but I just keep hoping i will continue to stay healthy! Wow that link is really interesting! I am not always good at decoding the medical-speak, did they say there are any treatments yet for just targeting this gene rather than managing symptoms later on? Yours and my story are exactly the same except that mine had progressed into destroying part of my small intestine which led to surgery. I am doing well and the surgeons were able to put me back together. I have a strange feeling that I was misdiagnosed on the first CT because the clots supposedly did not show up until the 2nd CT scan a week later. How soon after having the stomach pain did you get checked? Yeah very similar story! I think it was two or three days between noticing the pain and getting the scan. Who knows how long it was there or when it started. I feel lucky I had pain before it got critical. I was 33 (m) at the time of my Portal vein thrombosis and it was days of agony without sleep. I spent three days in the hospital and only a year later, while living on blood thinners, did they discover I am Jak2 positive. No signs of an MPN at this point so here is hoping that more study and research is done before anything progresses. Wow it is interesting to hear such a similar story! Mine felt like a brick sitting at the top of my stomach and like you trying to sleep at night was rough. After they found the clot the ER doctors and even a vascular surgeon told me it was unlikely the pain was related to my clot! I was like how is it NOT related? Finally a hematologist agreed with me that the pain must have come from the clot. What is interesting is that pretty much a day or two after they put me on the blood thinner the pain was gone, even though I am sure the clot did not dissolve that quickly. Bodies are crazy Your blood work is a dream. I am 32 and have PV, also JAK2+. A previous poster is correct. New research does state that a JAK2+ result can prelude symptoms for quite awhile. Also\u2014 there are many people from the \u201cregular population\u201d who have mutated JAK2 who do not have an MPN. By having JAK2+ alone, you do not meet diagnostic criteria.", "E.T. plus I was diagnosed about 2yrs ago. I had a seizure and they took some x-rays and found lesions on my skull, cervical, thoracic, lumbar spine and pelvic bone. A pet scan confirmed. A bone marrow biopsy found M.M. but a bone biopsy was clean. I may have smoldering M.M. I am on Hydroxyurea and an aspirin every day. My platlets two months ago were over 700. Last month less than 300. It varies A LOT. I try to keep positive. Lately I cannot sleep or eat. Panic attacks etc. This sucks. I have to admit, I have never really hear much about Multiple Myeloma, but after doing a google search and a quick read through, it does sound pretty nasty. And combined with ET. I can only imagine how difficult it is to keep under control.\n\nI wish I could give you some advice, but this is a little out of my experience. Still, I wish you the best and hope your treatment continues to go well. I know hydroxyurea can be a finicky drug to get the dosage right on. It does not take much to go outside of the therapeutic range. ", "diagnosis with ET Hello, I am 19, M. I have high platelets count 800-970 range. Last week i test positive for jak2 v617f mutation. Doctor said I just happened to have produced too much platelets. She was vague about it. She scheduled a bone marrow biopsy for me. \n\nMy question is how bad it can be! Cause I saw it kind of cancer. (Little panic about it). \n\nHow the life expectancy is.! I was diagnosed years ago and want you to know that it is not bad. The life expectancy is pretty much normal, and the treatment for someone your age who is healthy may just be an aspirin a day. Most days you will not even think about it. My doctor was also vague, but I came to realize that was because he really saw it as a non-issue. It is a thing you have that you manage easily, and that is kind of all there is to it. You may have bouts of fatigue from time to time, but I have found that they pass pretty quickly.\n\nIt is important to feel your feelings right now as you process, but do not let your imagination run away with you. You are going to be ok. Thanks lot  I am kind of feel easy now! Google research kind of made me worried about it.  Cause they said it is rare disease. Do you maintain any dietary to reduce the complications? My husband was diagnosed 1.5 years ago and his was discovered because he was having headaches. Turned out his headaches were being caused by a massive bloodclot in his brain. He spent six days in the hospital to break up the clot and eventually had the bone marrow biopsy (not as painful as some folks make it out to be).\n\nI can understand your worries, but I think it is really good that your ET was caught early. The medications for it are working for my husband. He has a great hematologist and is doing great. (He is 30 years older than you.) Best to you! Not sure where you are located, but I strongly advise you to see a MPN specialist. Regular hematologists do not have the same experience from seeing many patients with MPNs. \n\nI was initially diagnosed with ET due to high platelets and JAK2 mutation.  Hemo said no need for a bone marrow biopsy. I went to a specialist, she ordered full suite of tests done and turns out I have early stage MF (myelofibrosis). Currently still same treatment of aspirin only, but a much more aggressive testing to watch for any progression that would require other drugs. \n\nThe only thing I can tell you is do not panic. Doctor Google will drive you insane. It is full of bad information about MPNs which is why it is helpful to see a MPN specialist. \n\nBest of luck! Thanks a lot. It really frustrating to see all of the scary information. I went to Florida Cancer specialist, are MPN specialist different! My hemo doctor scheduled an biopsy on end of the November. There are lists of MPN specialists. Since the condition is so rare, there are not a lot of them. Here are a couple lists to look for specialists in your area:\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your current cancer specialist is also an MPN specialist then great you are covered. If not, the lists are good resources to find a good doctor who will understand your condition in detail and be current in all the most recent research. Thanks a lot for the resources. I will talk with my Hematologist about it. Just making sure is it progress to worse or it kind of steady! I diagnosed earlier this year, I am 27(f) and it was discovered during routine blood tests. I am also scheduled for a bone marrow biopsy next week. So far I am just on a daily aspirin, my platelets are around 550-650. \n\nI have found lots of support on Instagram / Facebook and it is great to speak to people that have had it for years. Most likely you will have this a long time so just try to avoid Dr Google and focus on how you are feeling! It took me a few months to make peace with it but I am feeling better about it all now.\n\nBest of luck :) Same story and similar platelet count just 39 years old female. I was just diagnosed but looking back at annual blood tests, I might have had the diseases for longer. I gave birth last year with no complications and medications. Crossing fingers that the disease will be mild for all of us with no complications. Hopefully, in the long term this diagnosis turns out to be a blessing, as many people do not get tested and just die of a blood cloth one day. Best of luck to all of us! I was just diagnosed officially. My nails started changing about a month or two ago and I decided to follow up with a hematologist and tested positive with the mutation. Got a biopsy done last week. I went through the feeling you went through and really felt like my life was over. I have 3 babies and I just thought that it was over. A month ago it destroyed me. Today I am a much different person After realizing that I can live a full and healthy life. Like someone else said, you can lead a normal life- however, I would make drastic changes to diet and lifestyle if you already do not. I started taking turmeric with black pepper daily (immunity shots) green tea (every day as well) and eating better over all. I stopped anything that can potentially cause further inflammation in my body. I saw a drop in my platelets. I am on aspirin and will get my blood checked every 3/6 months. Eat well to reduce cardiovascular and diabetic issues. \n\nThis is a whole new world for me too. I am young and I wish I knew how this happened, but now that we are here we should do whatever we can to take care of ourselves. Kind of a blessing to know about it now while we are young, instead of only finding out after a serious thrombotic event. Yes, ET, PV, MF (which is what I have in the early stages), Multiple Myeloma, CML, etc\u2026 are all MPN\u2019s, but have very different prognosis\u2019s .

Seems like I tend to catch stuff when I am lacking sleep.\n\nWhen I was younger, I would stop my meds when I felt like I was beginning to catch something, hitting it with an elevated amount of white blood cells.   Sometimes, I thought it helped kill it off quicker.  But, that is horrible advise (and do not tell my doc or wife) lol. Doesnt seem to work when I am older.\n\nI plan to take it easy this month. Sleep in when I can ", "JAK2 Positive Hello,\n30y/o F. I recently went to a hematologist due to high platelet count and my JAK2 test came back positive. The most likely culprit is ET but are bone marrow biopsies required to diagnose? I believe so. I have PV with ET. I am 29, was diagnosed at 27 and female. It depends on the hematologist.  I had a peripheral blood smear at diagnosis versus a BMB.  I have PV JAK 2+. I was diagnosed Jak 2 Positive before my bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sounds scarier than it actually is. ET can be diagnosed by the platelet count and mutation tests, but to definitively confirm the diagnosis, a bmb is required. It is not as bad as you might think. Oh wow, I was diagnozed when I turned 30 too, good luck with the rest of you tests. They are not required but recommended, depends on the haematologist. It is good to do one to get a baseline to use for your future. You will absolutely need BMB, because ET is a diagnosis of exclusion, that is what the guidelines say.\nIt could also be prefibrotic MF as well as masked PV and there is no other way to tell than BMB.\nI know people who were misdiagnosed and missed the opportunity to start early treatment, e.g. with Interferon that can modify the course of the disease, because they  thought they have ET and watch and wait would be sufficient. \nIt is not that bad, find a doctor who is got exercise with BMB and you will absolutely be fine, but please do not skip BMB, it is officially required for accurate diagnosis of ET. I am in my 30s in the UK. High platelets (~1000) were caught in an unrelated blood test. Got ET diagnosis after a battery of blood tests, no biopsy required. I take aspirin daily and have a blood test and phone appointment with the haemologist every quarter. Otherwise life is entirely unchanged. I am 33 now, had a bone marrow biopsy when I turned 30, had a similar experience to  in that it was discovered from unrelated blood work, but the biopsy location while sore for awhile afterwards is not a horrid experience and I feel the data it gives is largely invaluable. It is been 3 years since my diagnosis (had counts around 1100) and now after losing nearly 50 lbs and trying to take better care of my health, I am down to 371 for a count as of two weeks ago. Not sure why as monitoring was the only thing done for me (no meds), but I am going to chalk it up to less overall inflammation. \n\nAre you experiencing any actual symptoms? Thank you! No actual symptoms (unless some of my fatigue is actually due to this), but my platelet count has been rising for the past 5 years (current doctor noticed the trend) as my most recent platelet count was in the 700s. But I do need to lose quite a bit of weight (~80-100 lbs) so hopefully as I go down that path I will see similar results to what you have seen wirh weight loss and lowered platelets. Thank you! I have seen some conflicting sources about whether it was necessary (although I think more say it is needed). I will just have to (wo)man up and do it Did your hematologist have no concerns that it might be something else? Did they recommend eventually doing a BMB? The doc seemed satisfied so that was enough for me. No mention of BMB, I will cross that bridge if I come to it. I am low risk and my condition is monitored. I feel fine and my quarterly check-ins have so far been 10 mins on the phone a couple of days after a blood test (there is a drive through blood service where I live which makes life easy). I am not overly curious and happy to take the advice I get at face value. The jak2 positive is often enough for a diagnosis, but they will probably want a BM to establish a baseline for how it is progressing.\n\nKeep in mind with ET, there is a chance of going from ET to PV, so a diagnosis now does not mean it is set in stone.

(UK Govt accepted recommendation last month for England.) ", "Can elevated iron with normal ferritin cause elevated platelets or the other way around?  Sometimes elevated platelet counts are associated with people who are anemic (so low iron). I would definitely say go to a hematologist if you are experiencing high platelets especially if it shows up on multiple tests. I have had a slightly elevated platelet count for a few years and doctors have always tested my iron along with it but it is always been normal and they have shrugged it off. Finally I went to a doctor who tested me for a blood cancer and it came back positive. I am sure this is not your situation but platelets can be elevated for all types of reasons but it is mainly a signal that something is wrong and it could be as small as you having a cold you did not even know you had so I would definitely keep my eye on it. Sorry for the long response! I am already meeting with a hematologist and am waiting for Jak2 results. My iron came back elevated, so I was just wondering if there is a correlation. I have not received the test results yet from the Jak2 and my next doctor\u2019s appointment is not until a month out, so I am a bit impatient. I also read online (yes I think I have read everything on blood cancer so far:), that low iron can cause high platelets, so it seems to me that the two events may not be correlated. Anyhow, I will be patient, and hopefully, it is not something life changing. I was discovered elevated platelets during my annual exam. I have zero symptoms. Same story here and zero symptoms too! Definitely do not read too much into it online, I know when my family doctor told me he scared the shit out of me and Google added to the madness. Hopefully yours comes back negative!

Currently I am trying to schedule my first as appt. with a hematologist but have not seen one yet. I am 47, and very active, doing crossfit 4 days a week and some other sports I participate in. My platelet count was around 600k, and I have never had any symptoms, this was just found with a routine check-up. Anyway, I hoping to see if I could affect this diagnosis in any way utilizing diet. I was eating pretty healthy before (no sugar or crappy food), but since my diagnosis I have stepped things up a bit by eliminating high glycemic foods such as white rice, wraps, bread etc. \nAnyway, if anyone has any info on diets tips or anything else on general it would be greatly appreciated. TBH considering I have no symptoms and my platelet count is not too terrible, in hoping the doctors take a wait and see approach, as I am not looking to be a guinea pig yet. My humble opinion and I am in no way any kind of expert. A whole food, plant based diet is the healthiest for anyone. Check out How Not to Die by Dr Grege, it has a complete chapter on blood cancers. And accompanying app the Daily Dozen. All the best. It seems like there is still very little research out there on this subject. When my blood work was done, my sugar (AC-1) was also high even tho my diet is better than average. So I may have some underlying condition processing high glycemic foods. I decided to get rid of all high glycemic foods (carbs), and may even lean into keto, since it is only a few steps further from there. I am not a believer in vegan for myself, but more in line with the most current thinking about glucose being the culprit.   One item that comes up is tumeric, I would love to incorporate that into my diet. Other than that, I am going to go for the typical Mediterranean diet, with plenty of healthy fats and proteins with a minimal amount of carbs in the form of potato or sweet potato...

Tomatoes, specifically the green/yellow gel around the seeds appears to be very helpful: \n\nHere are studies that discuss a range of foods and diets:   The main takeaway is essentially what has already been mentioned.

Of course it seems as though the creator made it specifically with MPNs in mind, so it would definitely be more accurate. I know there are some days where it feels as though my brain is in a fog that would put Silent Hill to shame. ", "Any of you vegan or vegetarian? Everything that I read points me in the direction of vegan, and the fact that it could improve blood flow and decrease plaque buildup is very encouraging to hear. So any of you veg?\n\nFor reference I am 25, jak2+ with polycythemia Vera and essential thrombocytosis. Diagnosed about a year ago in May. Currently just taking aspirin but will probably start interferon in the next few months. My first sign of polycythemia vera was an episode of \u201cgout\u201d about 8 years ago. Since then, I have eaten a MOSTLY ovo-lacto vegetarian diet. \n\nI eat yogurt 3 times per day. I eat meals with cheese up to 3-4 times a week (eg pizza, quesadilla). I might eat egg or egg whites once or twice per week, and I do not monitor any baked goods with egg (eg cake or bread). I do not worry about honey or rennet or gelatin or other sneaky animal products. \n\nThen I will eat a 4 ounce serving of meat about once per month. It is mostly a convenience for my wife and youngest daughter, who would prefer to eat a lot more meat. It allows my wife to prepare a single family meal with the meat they want without worrying about \u201ccontaminating\u201d my dish. \n\nThere was a time about 2-3 year ago when my wife (who is a stay-at-home mom) felt like a short order cook, preparing 2-4 different meals to satisfy the four members of our family with their various dietary requirements or just pickiness.\n\nBut most days of the week, I am lacto-vegetarian. I eat a fair amount of beans, tofu, seitan, peanut butter, etc. I stay away from those \u201cImpossible\u201d and \u201cBeyond\u201d meat replacements, because they are made with heme and have really high iron content. They also just make me feel weird (first bites are delicious, but want to stop eating by the time 5th bite). I also monitor enriched grains for their iron content. Iron and fats are my main dietary concerns. I should probably also be tracking sugar, but at a certain point, you need to live. I try not to go crazy with actual \u201csweets\u201d, but I do not want to have to monitor my fruit content, for example. Or count the grams of sugar in any yogurt I am eating, or monitor my carbs from grains. I do not see heme as an ingredient for beyond meat. Impossible says it is from a soy-yeast fermentation. Why is heme a bad thing for MPNs?\n\nI can completely agree with the difficulties of having a household with different diets. I never feel like I get to eat what I truly want unless I make it myself I am trying to restrict my iron intake as a means to control my hematocrit. Whether they have heme or not, those Impossible and Beyond meat replacements have 25%-35% of your daily iron requirements. I try to only eat foods with 10% daily iron or lower. Iron is EVERYWHERE. Mostly grain products (breads, pastas, cereals, tortillas, etc), vegetables, dairy, etc. I definitely get enough iron, but I am trying not to have 200%-300% of my daily requirement. This is obviously anecdotally, but my 28/f partner was just diagnosed with ET a couple of months ago. She is been veg for 10+ years, vegan for 6 of those. Her hematologist did comment that her veganism likely has been a good thing. Just treating it with aspirin for now, still have to do the bone marrow biopsy. She is also jak2+. Hey that is good to hear! Thank you", "29- Diagnosed with Primary Myleofibrosis- recommended for immediate Allogenic transplant Hello! Feeling lost- I was diagnosed with Primary Myelofibrosis last week. I am 29, some symptoms, and a bone marrow biopsy revealed PMF. Any young folks here have this disorder? Have you had a transplant? How have you managed your symptoms? I am 28 with prefibrotic PMF (somewhat newer diagnosis that lies between ET and PMF, which suggests the possibility for progression. I was diagnosed when I was 19. I have never experienced any symptoms, so I have not required a transplant. My case requires regular monitoring, but because I have not been symptomatic, there has been no reason to seek further treatment.\n\nEdit: I am positive for the CALR mutation. Is your spleen enlarged and have they prescribed any medications? It is hard to determine what symptoms I am feeling honestly because I have felt fatigue, brain fog, sweats, etc. but now that I have been diagnosed I feel my mind might be making them worse.\n\nBecause of my mutations (I forgot what they are but I will find out and edit) and blood counts-i have an IPSS SCORE intermediate2 (35 month prognosis) the thought of a Transplant is pretty terrifying haha Those are all very real symptoms of PMF. Do not ignore them. Given what you have written, I think it is important that you heed your doctors\u2019 advice.\n\nYes, I have an enlarged spleen. I just take a daily low-dose aspirin as a precaution against clotting. I was diagnosed at 39, but there were apparently missed signs of it many years prior, Currently 49 was on biannual tracking, tested calr positive 2 years ago still low risk.  tested for asxl1 this past summer and my oncologist had decided to start the process towards the transplant.", "I was just told I have jak2 mutation. Am I going to die soon? They want to do more blood work, but I am freaking out.  I am 40 and I am really scared I might have cancer and not much time left. No. You will be fine.  This is a highly treatable cancer. It is chronic, but once you get over the shock, you will see it is something you manage and live with.  Do not Google and scare yourself and whatever you do, do not join the Facebook group.  They are fear mongers over there.\n\nI am happy to answer any questions you have.  I have Polycythemia Vera with high platelets. Right now, I am considered low-risk and take aspirin to thin my blood.  I felt horrible when I was diagnosed, but besides fatigue, I feel great now.  Most of my symptoms were caused by having thick blood and baby aspirin fixed that. Are you having any symptoms? I have had what I thought was chronic fatigue syndrome for years.  Maybe this is why?  \n\nMy platelet count was between 400 and 600 in the past few tests which is why they gave me a jak2 test.  Thank you for calming me down a bit.  I cannot go in for more testing for another week because I am currently down with a breakthrough covid infection. How are your other numbers?  Any other counts high? Also, sounds like you have a knowledgeable doctor. My MPN was missed for seven years.  They kept on looking for other reasons for the high platelets. But then my other counts went sideways and I was referred to a hematologist.\n\nYes. The fatigue is no joke. I was sleeping all day the year before I was diagnosed. I was always a very energetic person. Everything else on the normal blood test looks good My doctor is at Mass General which is a pretty good hospital so I am lucky with that at least.  \n\nSimply taking an aspirin really fixed your fatigue? I am much less fatigued now.  Before the aspirin, my blood looked like motor oil.  Aspirin is an amazing blood thinner. That is tough. Sorry to hear it. \n\nYou might be interested in this community out of the UK.  There is so many interesting, knowledgeable people on the forum.  \n\n\n\nIf you only have high platelets, you might have ET. The life expectancy for ET is normal!  The life expectancy for PV varies, but is approaching normal with new treatments.  I was 49 when I was diagnosed.  \n\nPlease come back and let me know how your tests go. You will be fine. My GF has similar and she is 28. Basically she has an injection weekly to thin the blood and baby aspirin each day. Life does not change at all. You will grow old and likely die of something nothing to do with your diagnosis! The medical world is amazing now. Plenty of support on the mpn forum too. While I agree with everything you have said, I cannot understand why you would say \u201cwhatever you do, do not join the Facebook group\u201d. \n\nThe PV FB group is amazing, is far far far larger and more active, with people of all ages from countries all over the world. From what I have seen having been a member for several years, generally everyone is very supportive, good information is provided even down to what doctors and hospitals to look at, and the moderation team does a great job of getting rid of the junk and pseudoscience. \n\nI would love for you to elaborate why you do not like the FB group, because frankly I do not really get it\u2026 particularly if we are comparing it to this sub. Id hate for someone to not use it for help or general questions based on this recommendation. Dude, I am in my mid-fifties, have been diagnosed with ET for several years and have platelet counts around 800-1,000. I take a baby aspirin in the morning. That is it. As far as I can tell, I am not any more tired than I have ever been and am able to exercise regularly, though contact sports are out due to splenomegaly (big spleen). \n\nDo not let it weird you out. You will probably get a bone marrow biopsy, and then you are done. Blood work up twice a year and an annual visit to the cancer center. That is good to know.  Did you ever have silent migraines or have your arms and feet go numb?  Those are the sid effects that brought me to getting check out in the first place.  I wonder if the aspirin will stop those. Aspirin stops the optical migraines. I believe we might be talking about two different groups. MPN Investigation and Discovery is quite good.  There is another group, the name I do not recall, that would not admit me as I have not had a bone marrow biopsy. It was upsetting to have my diagnosis questioned.  \n\nPlease share the name of the fb group you are a member of.  \n\nI have found MPN Voice to be incredibly helpful as well as Patient Power. I have all sorts of migraines, toes go numb and feet cramp. Do not know how much of this is related to ET. From what i am reading those are side effects. Thank god, i have been getting those for like 15 years Yeah sounds like we are talking about different groups. Checkout the Polycythemia Vera Support Group. It is mostly PV focused, but there are people who have had/currently have ET or whose PV has transitioned to myelofibrosis. It is a good source for all of them, but especially PV. Thank you!  I will definitely check it out. Not the person who posted, but I hated the facebook group I was in because while there is some good information, it is mostly a space with people asking a bunch of us \"do I have pv\" based on my blood work, and of course the answer is we cannot diagnose anyone. \n\nAlso, most of the people in the FB group are much older than me, at 29, and have well, older people problems and the issues some of them describe, may or may not related to PV and just signs of aging. \n\nI also do not care for it because you have a bunch of boomer know-it-alls, talking like they are experts, acting like they are the authority on MPNs just because they have had this disease and have seen an MPN specialist and a bunch of women who are concerned for their husbands who cannot seem to care less. \n\nA bunch of people saying \" Why cannot we take ibuprofen?\" and a hundred answers saying \"because of x,\" or \"what are you talking about, my doc says it is fine.\" to people posting holistic bullshit about curing cancer by limiting their iron intake. \n\nThere is SOME good information being shared there, but the majority of it is people speculating on the disease when they are not doctors or treating you and everyone is disease is different. \n\nEach case is different, and must be managed by the physician who treats it, random strangers on the internet, I cannot speak for all MPN groups or your experience viewing it on any given day, but the PV Support group on FB is a good one. It is well moderated (although sometimes moderators can miss stuff, just like on reddit) and the pseudo-science/hollistic stuff you are referring to generally gets deleted quickly or corrected via a comment.\n\n&gt; Also, most of the people in the FB group are much older than me, at 29, and have well, older people problems and the issues some of them describe, may or may not related to PV and just signs of aging. \n\nA majority of people that suffer from MPNs are 50+ so this is not really unexpected. Not only do older people generally have more health problems, but MPNs are also harder an older peoples' bodies. I guarantee you FB still has a larger base of young people. Young people generally do not need as much support for these things as older people do which is probably why this group on reddit is so tiny and inactive. \n\n&gt; I also do not care for it because you have a bunch of boomer know-it-alls, talking like they are experts, acting like they are the authority on MPNs just because they have had this disease and have seen an MPN specialist and a bunch of women who are concerned for their husbands who cannot seem to care less. \n\nThen do not go to it and read posts. Supports groups are for support, full stop. If you do not need support or are not looking to provide support, then it is probably a waste of your time. However, lots of people do need support, whether that is finding a doctor, getting through the mental turmoil of having a chronic cancer, or even learning about the disease/seeing how it effects other people. Those people are looking for some reassurance or guidance and sometimes things are easier to process when you know you are not alone. Why are you so defensive about it? I have stopped notifications on it because I personally cannot stand the people in my group. I am sure there are MANY PV support groups on FB, but they are not all good.\n\nI am very much aware that is what you said, but I find Facebook annoying anyway and do not spend much time on it anyway. I have gotten some answers to my questions there if anyone else has experienced headaches like me.\n\nSeriously, not all groups are what you are describing and I have not had the experience YOU are describing. But if you would, share it with us because I would be happy to join a group with actual helpful. \n\nPlease share your group, as you can see, all MPN support pages are NOT created equal.  You are not going to die.\n\nBut you should still live like there is not much time left. That can be reversed: If you spend your remaining time on worrying, you will just waste 50 perfectly good years. Thanks for the inspiration.  The years are not perfect though I am suffering quite a bit from the symptoms but I am hoping the meds I will be getting can fix that.  Aspirin is not cutting it. Yeah, the symptoms are there. I figured that my headache, fatigue, and whatnot are not going away. So I better just try to ignore them.\n\nOne of the hardest thing with this disease is to live the fact that there is no cure. That can easily cause depression. Same goes for many other conditions too. Assuming you are talking about Interferon for the injection? Do you mind if I ask if she gets flu symptoms or fatigue?", "Question about ET and progression I am curious how rare progression really is? I seem to see many people who have progressed which surprises me bc all I have ever read says it rarely happens. I am hoping it is not as common as it seems in message boards and Facebook groups. I am triple negative and not sure if it is more, or less, likely to happen to me. I am also a bit worried bc I am 36, so does that mean it is inevitable that eventually it will happen? It progresses to MF. For some people after 2 years, for others after 20 years. I do not know which percentage of PV/ET patients progress.\n\nI am living with PMF (no history of ET/PV), there are still treatment options after progressing, it is not the end of the world yet.\n\nTbf there is more info on the FB groups than here on reddit, is my impression.\n\nEdit: triple negative is usually not favorable, though. But than again, everything is statistics, but nobody knows where they will be plotted on the curve beforehand. I am 47 m and have been living with ET since 2016. My counts have stabilized around 800. I only take aspirin, and only occasional symptoms. I was diagnosed at home by a local hematologist and had that confirmed by Dr. Verstocyk at MD Anderson (he is a leader in the field). Both told me that there is very little chance of ET progressing. Yes it does for some, but it does not for most. The reason you see so many posts about it progressing, is that those are the people who post. I would too, if I were in that boat looking for answers. I do not post much about ET, because there simply is not a lot to say. After the initial shock wears off, you find that life is pretty normal. \n\nTake it one day at a time. Exercise, eat a healthy diet and keep up with your hematology appointments. In short order, you will probably find this is just a thing you have, and not a huge burden. Good luck!! OPINION\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nProgression happens when you take their mutagen carcinogenic drugs like Hydroxyurea\n\nYou mean to tell me that if I do not treat it I have a chance it develops into something more? Is that what you are telling me doc?\n\nAre you also telling me if I take hydroxyurea their is a chance it could also become a more serious cancer?..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHmm..\n\nDoes this make sense to anyone? Is everyone here crazy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou want us to take a chemotherapy drug FOR the REST of our lifes to TREAT a condition that is not CURABLE?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat is a MUTAGEN, CARCINOGEN, AND A Teratogen? For the rest of my life?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah, no thanks. Ill go with a phlebotomy if it gets really bad, and use natural remedies, this is archaic and insane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou would have a higher chance developing into more taking their chemotherapy daily for the rest of your life mutating other aspects of your DNA rather than changing your lifestyle and a occasional phlebotomy if it gets way too high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is sick, absolutely disgusting behavior from big pharma.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(  Read this please if you are someone that thinks for your self and is not feared by every little thing a doctor tells you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow can anyone expect to NOT develop more serious cancers when the DRUG that you take needs to be HANDLED with GLOVES because its so TOXIC, how can you LOOK at this as a medication.. its NOT. Its a poison and it destroys every other aspect of your body, just to get one cell count down, PLATELETS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nits CYTOTOXIC WAKE UP.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow twisted is big pharma to pass this is as a recommended first line treatment for ET? Well luckily for me my hematologist has me on aspirin only.. my platelets hover around 940,000 and my symptoms are minimal. He has no desire to put me on anything stronger than baby aspirin Modern treatment protocol calls for aspirin only for younger patients if there have been no clotting incidents and platelets remain under 1,500,000. That being said, recent studies have not really shown a link between Hydroxurea and progression of ET There is no big pharma conspiracy here. ET is relatively rare, and Hydroxurea is a cheap drug. Aspirin is the first line treatment based on recent research, but Hydroxurea is still recommended in certain cases. That paper has nothing to do with Hydroxurea or ET. You did not reply about any of the dangers of Hydroxurea, but stated recent studies have not \"really\" shown a link between Hydroxurea and progression of ET, right.... do you have any common sense?\n\nYou really think consuming a mutagen carcinogen compound every single day for the rest of your life is not going to increase your risk? Sure...\n\nSaying that paper has nothing to do with Hydroxurea is another wrong statement, Hydroxurea is cytotoxic chemotherapy, the study was on the \"effectiveness\" of cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy.\n\nIve lost 3 family members to the TRADITIONAL ROUTE, they were given a longer life expectancy with their condition alone, and big pharma \"medication\" killed them 80% sooner than they would have normally. \n\nYou are ignoring the dangers of Hydroxurea, because \"meh studies\" \n\nThink! Do you know what a mutagen does? If not, research it.\n\nThis has nothing to do with a conspiracy, this is what it is, the first in line treatment for ET is a cytotoxic chemotherapy which can devastate you more than the condition its self.\n\n ( \n\nRight, you remember the time when \"doctors\" prescribed healthy cigarettes? Long term studies (17+ years) in sickle cell patients have shown Hydroxyurea to be very safe and patients taking the drug saw no increased incidence of cancers over patients not taking the drug. These patients often take an even higher dosage than someone with ET would need. The main limitation here is risk of side effects, but not everyone experiences them.\n\nEvery drug has risks and benefits, even aspirin. I am sorry you lost family members to this condition, but we cannot know what would have happened had they chosen a different treatment path. There are no guaranteed outcomes with MPNs or life in general.\n\nDoctors have been switching over to treating people more and more with aspirin alone for ET at least. There are still some criteria that indicate usage of Hydroxyurea such as age or propensity for bleeding (which would contraindicate aspirin). And there are other treatment possibilities used more rarely. Obviously there needs to be better treatment options for all MPNs. I do not think anybody would argue that.", "Myeloproliferative Disorders Forum | The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society ", "ET and BC? Has anyone had any interactions or issues with taking birth control? I know that it increases chances of blood clots but I am wondering if anyone has taken it anyways? I took BC for about 5 years while also having ET (I did not know at the time because I had a slightly elevated count, but missed subsequent blood tests for a few years before the test that lead me to a formal diagnosis).  It did not cause any blood clots that I know of, but it did cause migraines to start happening every few months as my platelet count got higher and higher (over a million).  I switched to IUD a few years ago and the migraine events have become much less frequent.\n\nIt really depends on the person though.  I have a platelet count of over a million, but somehow I do not have any symptoms.  Meanwhile, I have also heard of people with just barely over normal limit experiencing clotting events.\n\nTalk to your hematologist about the risk, and whether it is an issue for you specifically. this is why I do not take BC. Because without treatment I also had over 1 million platelets. I just have protected sex. \n\nClots have happened in women with no clotting issues at all and they are a small risk, but blood clots can be fatal. But I would like to know? How are you being treated with a platelet count over one million? It was a big problem to my doctors when they discovered I had that many and I am really surprised your doc is not treating you aggressively for this. I did not know I had ET at the time, but I probably would not have continued to take it if I had known.\n\nYou also have the option of using non-hormonal BC which does not pose any clotting risks.  Condoms/diaphragms are not for everyone.\n\nAs for treatment... I am only taking daily Aspirin.  I have no debilitating symptoms, and I am also fairly young.  My hematologist does not want to start me on anything because most of the drugs would likely have negative side effects/not great for long-term use. If my standard of living is not currently poor, there is no reason to *make* it bad.  I think the other part of it is that the bone marrow results did not show a huge amount of abnormal cells so they do not think it is progressing fast.  I expect whether my treatment changes depends on what my next biopsy shows and whether I still *feel* healthy.  My count is holding steady around 1.5 mill.\n\nBased on what I have read about on this subreddit, this is an unusual treatment.  Pretty much everyone with platelets higher than 900k seem to be on pegasys or hydroxyurea. I mean they are for me. Certainly not. I am sure iuds or depo may be for some people but I have just had no desire to try one.  \n\nBut do you still have over 1 mill platelets? I have PV but I have an over abundance of platelets and not quite as high as red blood cells because I do have a high count of those too. \n\nIf my platelets are even SLIGHTLY elevated I have headache central. I am also convinced I have had this for literally years because i had a constant headache for literarily years and no one ever did bloodwork. I have been to more than 15 doctors in 10 years. Now that I am being treated for PV with hydrea, my headaches are almost gone, unless my platelets are high. I am convinced I have had this for well over a decade. Yeah, I am still at 1.5mill.  I do not think that is going to change with just Aspirin.  The Aspirin is just to make sure my blood does not clot for no reason.\n\nBlood tests are standard during yearly body checks in Canada, so I would have known maybe a few years sooner if I did not miss my blood tests while trying to finish college... Are you seeing a hematologist or an MPN specialist?!? Were you diagnosed like only like 2 weeks ago? \n\nwhy is not someone (doctor) more concerned?  I have had my blood drawn every week for over 6 months. I have been having blood tests 2-3 times or more for over two years. \n\nDo they not do a blood check for you every time you go to the hematologist knowing you have ET? Once I was diagnosed with PV they do a CBC every single time I go into the doctor. Which for a while was every single week. They are not doing that for you?!?\n\nSo they have you just on aspirin?!? Why?!?! Your platelets are not going to go down like that The idea is that the medicine they have got to treat ET right now does not actually cure it. It kills platelets and a ton of other cells as well. I am almost over 1million and my doctor also has me on baby aspirin. I think that the chances of clotting chance based on everyone is health and the type of genetic mutation they have. I have JAK2 as was told that I am actually at a higher risk of bleeding out than getting a clot. \nSo yeah. No need to take chemo for the rest of your life if you are still young and healthy. It is strong stuff, better not take it if you do not need to! You CANT cure it though. There is nothing you can do to \u201ccure\u201d an MPN. You have to treat it and you need treatment for the rest of your life. \n\nI have exactly what you are describing but I am kind of shocked your doctor is not more alarmed by this. It has to do with the VonWillebrands factor. \n\nIf you are not already, you should be seeing an MPN specialist.\n\nAnyway, I just went to look it up and apparently it might be fine to leave ET alone, but you may develop complications from it.  \n\nI have PV so I must get treatment. Untreated PV is very dangerous. \n\nBut you said you have no symptoms of having  high platelets? If my platelets are even over 400,000 I have terrible never ending constant headaches, so for me, I HAVE to have the medication to kill them. \n\nYou do not have any headaches or other symptoms? I see one of the best doctors in the country, and I am pretty thankful that I am healthy enough to wait until I am older. Hopefully by then the medicine options to treat this disease will have improved as they do over time! I just do not think it is right to put my body through such an intense medicine while I am being monitored and feeling good.\nI do not really get headaches often at all. Maybe it is because I just take aspirin to treat it! Unfortunately I have symptoms so it is not safe for me to let them be that high in myself 100% agree. I also have the Jak2 mutation and was just diagnosed with ET last week. I have probably had it for years without knowing. Unfortunately I found out because I had terrible pain in my left side that turned out to be a blood clot that had traveled to my spleen. I was very lucky it was my spleen and not something worse. And my platelets are lower than yours - I hover around 600k. Had I known earlier and had taken something to decrease that I could have avoided the clot altogether. I am also on hydroxyurea now. Just be so careful and do not hesitate to speak up for yourself if you have to.", "Need opinions for ET Hey guys. This is going to be quite a long post so please stick with me. I am about to be applying to universities in a short while. However, I just realized that my mother has been diagnosed with ET. Her platelet counts are quite high, about 2-3x the regular amount.\n\nOn the bright side, she is low risk. She is in her mid 40s and is not diabetic nor obese and does not smoke or drink (and never has). She also has never had thrombosis whether that be a stroke or a heart attack. I have also never noticed her have any major clotting. The hematologist has only prescribed her to take aspirin daily. She does get tired occasionally and does not have headaches. She does feel her hands and feet get cold and tingly sometimes. I am aware that these are all symptoms of ET.\n\nBasically I need opinions on what to do. Ive narrowed my university search down to two universities. One is about an hour drive away while the other is 30 min away, so half the distance. I will not be living at home either way. The issue is, I do not know how much/if it is better for me to remain close. Since she is low risk, should I go to the closer university so that I can help if anything happens? The closer university is not the best university for what I am studying, in fact it is considered one of the worst options. On the other hand the farther university is considered one of the best options for what I am planning on studying. I have absolutely no issue going to the closer university if in your opinions (people diagnosed with ET) I could potentially be of help. Strokes and heart attacks are what I am mainly worried about but from what I have heard the person who has either of these two has to be in the hospital in about 10 minutes so either way I am too far. I should also add that she is not alone, my father will obviously be with her. \n\nI will make sure I come home every 2-4 weeks to checkup and make sure everything is fine either university that I go to and I will keep in close contact. What do you guys think I should do? I would really appreciate any input and my apologies for this long post. As a mom I can tell you I want my children to live their lives to the fullest. No one is guaranteed a long life whether you are healthy or ill or financially stable or not. I have a serious condition and my children do not live near me. Yes there are times I wish I was not alone when my symptoms are bad but them being near me would not \u201ccure\u201d me anyways. If I needed to go to the hospital they would not be able to be by my side until doctors okayed it first so the travel time would not make a difference. Like I tell my kids, yes I am sick. But I can get hit by a bus crossing the street. - They hate it when I say this but it is true. \nIf your concern is your mother being alone you already established that was not the case because she had your dad. A good way to help put your mothers mind at ease is to live a happy life and give back to the world. You making drastic changes that could hurt you in the long run will only make her worry for you and that is not good for her. \nSorry for making this long. I hope I helped a bit at least. I wish you and your family nothing but the best. Be safe. I have PV, and have children getting close to college age. Go to the college that is best for you! These MPNs kind of suck for us who have them - they mess with us in weird ways that we cannot describe or even detect easily. But once detected and monitored, are very unlikely to result in a rapid decline in health. Most MPN patients that have a serious thrombosis are diagnosed as the time of their event. So with the doctors monitoring her numbers and treating as necessary, you can rest easy about an emergency situation. That is my thinking anyway. You are a good person.

My father died from complications of acute myelofibrosis/leukemia. MPNs, though rare, are all around me and I am wondering if anyone knows the likelihood of a child of my boyfriend's and mine developing an MPN?\n\nAlso, although I am familiar with the various diseases classified under MPN disorders, I would like to know what I can do as a partner to help my boyfriend? Although he does not talk about it much and takes his medicine, I know it bothers him deeply that he will have this for the rest of his life, that it could very well kill him someday or develop into something more serious later. We have discussed marriage seriously and I know this is who I am marrying, so I want to be able to help him however I can.\n\nThanks in advance for any responses! I am glad you posted. This sub is pretty quiet. I was diagnosed with ET about a year and a half ago. The Dr told me it was a mutation that I developed and not one that is hereditary. I do not have the JAK2 mutation and I am not sure if those with it can pass it on. So, really I do not have any answers, but I am glad to see someone else in this community posting to this sub. That is good to know, thank you. I am under the impression I have it, my dad's doctor wanted to see my 23&amp;me raw data and mentioned it but I am not totally sure. I wish this sub had more activity but also I suppose it is good there is not a lot of people here affected by it :) \n\nHow has life changed for you since your diagnosis, or has it? We are an elite club! I also did 23andMe. They contributed to new findings about mpns. I think their sample size was 20,000. There were less than 500 with an mpn!\n\nThe way I understand it is that you can have some gene mutations, but not have an mpn. He may be looking for the gene markers that would indicate the need for more testing. At least that is how I understood it. I asked my Dr, because I was very concerned about passing it to my kids. \n\nMy life is pretty much the same. I take aspirin daily and that is it. My platelets are around 1.2 million. The only significant thing I have noticed is that I go through periods of pretty intense fatigue. Think of the weighted down feeling you get in the throes of a flu. Like that. Aside from dealing with that from time to time, I forget there is anything wrong with me!\n\nGood luck!\n Hi, I am surprised that someone managed to actually find this subreddit. I created it a few years ago but it is never really been active. \n\nI am sorry to hear about your boyfriend having ET, and yes it is pretty rare to be diagnosed that young from my understanding. I was diagnosed at 29 and my hematologist said that I was one of the youngest people she had seen with it.\n\nAs far as what you can do for him, well that is going to be fairly different for each person. There is a pretty diverse set of symptoms as well as side effects to whatever medicine he is taking for treatment. Personally, I have been fairly symptom free other than pretty draining fatigue, though whether it is from the medicine or the condition I am not sure. The main thing is obviously to be understanding about any issues that may arise. If you have not read it, I highly recommend reading over ( The TLDR is that (some) people with (some) chronic conditions like MPN's or Lupus or whatever, have a limited amount of energy (spoons) per day and everything they do uses up a number of spoons. That is a very simplified explanation.\n\nFrom my understanding, the question as to whether or not MPN's are hereditary is still pretty fuzzy. Basically, the JAK2 (and other) mutations are not hereditary in the sense that a child would have a chance to be born with that mutation. The mutation is generally acquired during some point. However there is evidence that having a parent with an MPN can increase the chances. Not very helpful, I know. \n\nHonestly, if your relationship is serious to the point of marriage, I would suggest asking your boyfriend if you could accompany him to one of his doctor visits and talk to his doctor about any questions you may have. \n\nIf you have any more questions, I will do my best to answer.

Could it be dehydration related why my counts are like this? I did have prior health run ins with not drinking enough fluids. Or could this just be my \"normal\"? I am no expert but it seems possible that being dehydrated could raise your counts? Did the doctor suggest any other tests? I have heard there are tests that can be run on the spleen and bone marrow but if you are not having any symptoms those probably would not be needed. I tested positive for the Jak2  mutation after having mesenteric Veinous thrombosis but all my bloodwork other than within the few weeks of surgery has been normal. Nope no other tests yet. He was thinking polycythemia back in 2019 so He did the Jak2 test after 2 labs came back high normal/slightly elevated. The results showed Jak2, CalR, and all those were Not Detected. Apparently 95% of cases of polycythemia have Jak2 positive. From what I have read the risk later on is blood clots. Which is what happened to me..I am in the right age group for that. Has your doctor suggested any kind of treatment for it? Nope. I have not even been diagnosed. He just ran these tests out of precaution and I think the Jak2 negative mostly eliminates the chance of it being PV which was originally suspected.

I hold roughly 1.2 million platelets at this time and have a nearly asymptomatic experience thus far. No treatment required at this time, but I was told to avoid fish oil (as well to avoid aspirin) due to its anti-clotting properties. Not sure if I agree that I should stop since I have had high platelet counts for potentially 3 years before discovering it. It was revealed by a routine physical and blood work which in turn lead that PA to refer me to a hematologist. Since I have no history of thrombosis, I thought well maybe that is because of the fish oil supplement I take (from LifeVantage) but I have only been taking it for the first half of this year so no way to really tell. Perhaps there is no real relation/causation there.\nMy curiosity is if anyone has done any deep research into the CALR gene specifically? My sister found an article that made it sound like CALR has a lot more to do with the immune system and wound healing. This concern has come up as I have been sick nearly every 2-3 weeks since May when the whole process started and while I recover within a day or two, it seems like I get run down much more quickly now and catch a cold super easily. Any thoughts from this group?\nThank you! I have ET with CALR. I think I read that with CALR, your chances of a thrombotic event are lower than with JAK2. I may be wrong. My doctor wanted me to take a baby aspirin a day. I am taking Jakafi and my platelets are now around 300,000, but I now have anemia.  I have ET with the CALR mutation. Very similar to you. Platelets climbed to 1.1 million, but mainly without symptom. I am 46, at low risk for stroke/thrombosis. I was put on baby aspirin and that is kind of it. Over the past year my platelets have stabilized at around 800,000. I have heard that the CALR mutationi is preferable as the research shows slightly better quality of life and longevity. I got a second opinion after my initial diagnosis. It confirmed the diagnosis and treatment, but I am glad I did. I would definitely recommend getting one. Good luck! Do you think the Jakafi has caused anemia? And was it prescribed to you?\nGlad to hear your platelets are low but do you find that the anemia has changed anything about your habits or lifestyle? Thank you for sharing. I am fairly trusting of this doctor but I am still surprised that he does not even want me taking any aspirin. Maybe he knows something that is part of newer research. How long have you been diagnosed? And has it become progressive at all for you? Yes, it slows the making of platelets, but also red and white cells. The doctor said it is a balancing act to get everything in the normal range.  I was diagnosed any two and a half years ago. My counts spiked, but no progression to another mpn.

My doctor thought nothing of it but I compared it to to old blood work and it looked like years before that, normals were lower. He begrudgingly agreed to send me to a hematologist.  \n\nThe hematologist said it did not loo like a classic PV case to him but he would run a bunch of tests anyways. He ordered a repeat CBC, EPO serum test, jak2 and jak2 Exxon 12 genetic tests, and CALC mutation test.   He also sent me for a spleen sonogram to check for enlargement. \nLastly, he said if I was very concerned, he would send me for a Red Blood Cell Mass test which he said measures the blood over a 4 hour period which is a hard test to find a center to do but I like in NYC so there was not one too far. \n\nMy RBC mass test came back normal, the spleen sono came back normal, my EPO was 7 ( reference range 4 - 27) and all genetic mutations came back negative.

Hey there, I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. My fianc\u00e9 was diagnosed with ET around the age of 14, and my father was diagnosed with myelofibrosis in his 60s.

If you are taking that medication and plan to start a family eventually, I would discuss with your doctor your options now for preserving sperm.

If I do not, I tend to feel run down and get much more tired. It is a vicious cycle if I do not stay on top of the exercise. I will feel too tired to get out and run, then the fatigue gets worse.

My platelets were around 750 last check and my hematologist and I decided to do the biopsy. \n\nAbout 4 years ago I ended up in the hospital for a week with some pretty heavy duty PEs, including a monster saddle embolus that damn near killed me (unfortunately, not hyperbole). We discovered I have the Factor V mutation and that combined with being on the pill over 30 deemed to be the \"perfect storm\" to create the gaggle of clots loitering in my lungs. I immediately stopped the pill, started Coumadin and ended up with an IUD which I am quite happy with.\n\nAfter a year or so, I stopped taking Coumadin but continued seeing my hematologist a couple times a year to monitor things. When I was hospitalized my platelets were normal-range. It is only been in the past year a half that they started climbing. \n\nI do not have the JAK2 mutation, I have another rarer one whose name escapes me at the moment. My doc said I have to go back on thinners but that he would not prescribe the chemo drug until I hit 1 million. I asked for an alternate thinner and he prescribed Xarelto.\n\nThat is where I am now. I am not sure how to feel about the diagnosis. I wonder if I am taking it too much in stride and I should be more concerned. My doctor seemed to worry about telling me and he is not one to overreact. I understand that it is incurable and it means I am more likely than most to develop leukemia, but that is not inevitable.\n\nI welcome any advice and suggestions. Hi. \n\nI think you sound mentally healthy and definitely recommend taking things in stride.  I went through two freak-outs when first diagnosed with PV Jak2+ in late January.  But time and distance from the diagnosis has helped me gained perspective.   I have also had some symptom relief from daily aspirin thinning my blood and that definitely helps.

I have the Jak2 mutation and normal bloodwork other than that,so far. I did not have a bone marrow biopsy to test for the Jak2, but a blood draw. The reason I was tested for the mutation is because I had blood clots in a bunch of the veins in my digestive area. I had terrible stomach problems and had the first CT scan and they diagnosed me with colitis, gave me some Bentyl and antibiotics and sent me home. A week later I was back in the ER in pretty bad shape, with ischemic small bowel from the clots. I have a theory that the Bentyl may have set me off or the fact that the inflammatory nature of having Hashimotos thyroid helped predispose me to the clots. I am on blood thinners and I feel pretty darn great actually. It is still scary every time I go have blood drawn, I hope they do not find any more abnormalities. Well you can push for it but they will not do that day. I mean is it causing you any other symptoms? If my platelets are high I have bad headaches Believe me. When you have a bone marrow study done you will never forget it. I am in the same boat. I have had platelets in the 600s for years and my mutation tests came back negative this week. Apparently it is a reactive thing, but they cannot tell why. My inflammatory markers are normal but my platelets and WBC say otherwise.

Here is how that went: \n\nAnesthesiologist: Any other issues?\n\nMe: I have essential thrombocythemia.\n\nAnesthesiologist: How low have your platelets gotten?\n\nMe: \u2026 low? The problem is they are too high. Essential thrombocythemia. \n\nAnesthesiologist: Right, that is low platelets.\n\nMe: No, thrombocytopenia is low platelets. Mine are high. Thrombocythemia. I have gone up to 575,000 so it is not too bad. \n\nNurse Practitioner to anesthesiologist: Thrombocytosis. \n\nMe: I tested positive for the JAK2 mutation, it is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. \n\nAnesthesiologist: Oh wow, I have not seen that since med school.\n\n\u2026you are welcome, I guess? My own primary care doctor has never heard of the Jak2 mutation. But the doctor at the walk-in clinic where I had a Covid test knew of it and what it does.", "Platelets significantly go down I have been diagnosed with ET since 2016, last year my platelet level was around 1.300-1.500 million. I have been on low dose aspirin since I have a baby and we are on breastfeeding. Yesterday I had a bloodiest and my platelet was just 0.400. How it is possible? Fluctuations are pretty normal for me, though never that much in the right direction. I would check with the doc and see what they say. Maybe I should have a baby. Tall order for a middle aged man. I would watch for trends, one CBC out of your normal range does not mean much. But platelets trending downwards are usually a cause for another BMB, because it could mean things are progressing.", "New PV drug givinostat showing positive signs in clinical trials ", "Hello again, I have a question about fertility. Hi there, I was curious if males here taking hydroxyurea had any issues while trying to start a family? Not sure if anyone here was diagnosed that young or tried having kids after the diagnosis, but I thought I would check. \n\nI was reading this article (link below) and the abstract said a review of only 4 men showed reduced sperm count, motility, and abnormal morphology while on hydroxyurea, but there is very little data to really determine otherwise. So I wanted to see what your personal experience was with it. Thanks in advance!\n\n\n", "41 y.o female diagnosed with non-specified Myeloproliferative Neoplastic disease..... anyone else have massive bone pain? Hello everyone ^^ I am new here. I had no idea there was a subreddit just for us. go figure! \n\nSo i got diagnosed with non-specific Myeloproliferative Neoplastic \ndisease (aka MPN-U) after many years of getting the wrong diagnoses: Hemochromatosis (close one! because I have both genetic markers but my blood tests shows it has not triggered yet,) Antiphospholipid Antibodies Syndrome, Secondary Polycythemia Vera, etc.....\n\nMine is non-specified because all of my cells are on the rampage, not just one type, and they cannot find a genetic marker that provides a label for it.... I have been on Hydroxyurea, which has been helping with my numbers and bringing them slowly down.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has been experiencing horrific bone pain in the legs? Some days I cannot even get out of bed they hurt so bad.... I have a ortho consult, but its a month out. Is there anything you guys take for the pain aside ibuprofen or tylenol for the pain? or anything you do? I find heat sometimes helps..... Thanks! How did you get diagnosed and what numbers were abnormal? Thanks. I was diagnosed by an Oncologist. All of my blood cells were elevated: RBC, WBC, Platelets, Hematocrit, Reticulocytes etc. Got tested for Primary Polycythemia (JAK2) - the Philadelphia mutation, and a few other tests that I cannot remember off the top of my head. All came back negative, however she said that in layman's terms that there is a genetic error somewhere where my body is not telling my bone marrow to \"turn off\" making new cells when it needs to. She said that being \"non-specified\" is not uncommon among those of us who do have MPN. The Hydroxyurea I have been on, has brought down the numbers quite a bit, but I am not quite at a therapeutic level yet, so we are adjusting as we go along... but in any case, my legs are killing me and I was just looking to see if anyone had insight for relief. Thanks!", "Nosebleeds at night? Does anyone else get these? I am pretty sure my nose is bleeding most nights - there is usually some blood when I blow my nose in the morning and there is also been dry blood when I have checked.\n\nI have ET and my platelets are not exceptionally high, around 600-650 and I am just on a daily aspirin.\n\nHas anyone experienced anything similar? It might be unrelated to my ET but would be good to know! I have had random nose bleeds that were not necessarily correlated with anything and then I realized they were happening  when the weather changed and the heat was turned on everywhere and my nose got dried out for lack of a better term.  Usually resolved within a few weeks, also got in the habit of jamming some Aquaphor up there and that seemed to help.  Also, probably a question for your GP as I am just a dude, formally with ET on the internet. Same! \n\nI also have ET and take daily baby aspirin. But my nosebleeds are likely unrelated. Any time the weather gets very dry, my nose will start to itch and I will find dried blood flakes the next day. Rubbing Aquaphor/Vaseline up there with a q-tip has been helpful for me.", "Anyone JAK2+ with no symptoms? And other questions Hi everyone. I am new to this sub and the world of MPNs. \n\nI am a 32F and I have a pretty strong family history of cardiovascular issues, as well as strokes and blood clots. My PCP, obgyn, and cardio all thought I should go to a hematologist just to make sure there was not anything more going on. \n\nThe hematologist thought I was low risk overall but decided to run some tests, and she would call me if everything was OK, and call me in if there was any more to discuss. Among the tests was the JAK2 Gene V617F Mutation PCR. The other 3 tests have come back, but this one still lists as \"pending\", and my hematologist called me last week to come in Oct 4th. I know that this health system will not release abnormal results until my provider has had an opportunity to talk to me. So I am guessing that the JAK2 test came back positive (maybe not! But everything is pointing to that).\n\nSince then I have delved into the world of MPNs, and tried to digest what information I could find. But I have some questions. \n\nI do not know if I have any symptoms. I have a few weird things that I feel are not normal. I am often very fatigued, and this has come about in the past year, year and a half. I have started to get night sweats sometimes in the past year. I also get headaches (used to get migraines, but these are not migraines, just headaches). \n\nBut overall I feel healthy and good. I had blood work done this February. My RBC were 3.98x10^6, WBC were 5.3x10^3, and platelets were 300x10^3.\n\nIs there anyone else who is JAK2+ but has no symptoms of the disease yet? If so, how long have you been positive and do you get routine blood work to monitor your situation?\n\nAlso, what should I expect from here? I assume my hematologist will run some more bloodwork, but what are typically the next steps in a situation like this?  \n\nAlso, if I am JAK2+, should I consider seeing an MPN specialist? \n\nThanks in advance everyone.", "Study Summary: Impact of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms on Employment Status and Work Productivity | AJMC  I know this is something that I personally struggle with myself.

I have just found out I have ET this week, it was found from routine blood tests showing a high platelet count and a bone marrow biopsy. I have none of the gene mutations so triple negative. My doctor said I could take a baby aspirin if I want... I will not be talking to the Dr till July for my next appointment after an ultrasound on my spleen. \nThe diagnosis was so unexpected and random I am kind of lost...\nAny advice or anything?! Hi there, I feel your pain and confusion,  it is a really strange one to get your head around. First of all, dont panic, you will be fine. What was your platelet count? And why did the doctor say you can take aspirin if you want, or was he not an actual hematologist? Go to \"mpn voice\". That website make it all more clear and positive. It helped me a lot. I am over 10 years diagnosed ET Jak2 positive, and I do just take a baby aspirin a day. I see the blood doctors every 6 months.  I kind of feel getting a diagnosis like this forces your hand to live a healthy life. Hi thanks for replying!! Umm I cannot remember my platelet count off the top of my head but I should be getting all that information in a letter soon from the dr. He did say my platelet count had lowered from my two blood tests about a month apart so that is good. Yes he is a haematologist but I think because of my age and otherwise great health he does not want me to start taking the aspirin all the time, more of a choice kind of thing I think. Not too sure, I wish I would asked more questions but I was just shocked!! Yeah I feel like I want to live healthier now with my food choices and exercise however I have had bad pains in my ankles and hands for the last few weeks so have been taking it easy. I am not sure if it is related to my ET. \nWill check that website out, thank you :) \nHow old were you when you were diagnosed and have you had any symptoms or anything? I was about 38 when I got diagnosed   nearly 49 now. Yeh  it does seem the doctors are not the worried about it till you turn 60. Anything under that is low risk. I must say I do keep really well. Sometimes I think I got ET for a reason, cos i was really abusing my body up until then. Drinking lots, smoking and eating shit. So my I am on the totally healthy path. Just seems really crap for you cos your so young. But the doctor told me ET wont kill me, it is a heart attack, stroke or blood clot that will, but I have the power to be in charge so that does not happen. Yeah suppose it has made you make better decisions for your body, I am sure I will be the same. \nIt is nice to talk to someone who has been through it all before, so thanks :)"]
