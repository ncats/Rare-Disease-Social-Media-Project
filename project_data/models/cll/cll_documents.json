My first treatment, immunochemotherapy Bendamustine + Rituximab, was in 2008 and resulted in about seven years of remission. Therefore I was leaning towards repeating it, which was also the first option my doc had addresed. But that was before Covid.\n\nNow my doc is telling me that immunochemo is off the table because Rituximab might block the effect of the Covid-vaccine. Therefore Venetoclax is my only other option (I have a heart condition, so  Ibrutinib is not a choice). But the same problem occurs with Venetoclax: I would not be able to take it with Rituximab. Which means I would be on it for an indefinite period of time, instead of just two years.\n\nThat is a real bummer. I trust my docs, but I would still like to read for myself how Rituximab interferes with the Covid-vaccine. I particularly want to know if it can still block the vaccine if administered a month AFTER the vaccine.\n\nI would be grateful for any lead. I live in Germany and have not found much about it here, at least no information that deals with cll, so I am hoping someone else has insights.\n\nThank you in advance! Hi, I seen to be in a similar situation. I have also been fully vaccinated and just started Venetoclax treatment, I will be getting Rituximab as part of my protocol. I received Rituximab with chemo 20 years ago on my first go through, so I was very positive about it being a part of my new treatment. There does seem to be some issue with Rituximab and sever Covid-19.\n\nBut as always the devil is in the details. These articles below were posted here recently, but they are talking mostly about autoimmune diseases and not CLL/SLL. But your doctor always gets the last word. It is the stuff we patients do not know that could make the difference.\n\nMy doctor is, at least at this point, still going to go ahead with the Rituximab. I will say, even though I just started a few weeks ago, the Venetoclax has been giving me great results, with barely any side-effects. \n\nGood luck to you, I second the recommendation to take Venetoclax. I did Gazyva (second generation Rituximab) 6 monthly injections last April - Sept, and Venetoclax starting last June. I tested uMRD in blood and bone marrow, and my oncologist has recommended stopping Venetoclax. The cessation of treatment should be based on testing results, and combining Gazyva with Ven can make it more effective, but Ven can also be effective on its own. \n\nI also did the LLS trial where they measured the Covid antibodies generated from the vaccine, which I took in March and April. I did mount a measurable response, even after Gazyva and during Venetoclax treatment, so it is possible!\n\nGood luck! Thanks for your reply! So, your doctors did not see any problem with giving you Rituximab after your vaccination? Did they address the issue of interaction at all?\n\nMay I also ask what articles you are referring to?\n\nI am glad to hear that you are tolerating Venetoclax well. Wishing you all the best! I have not started the Rituxamab just yet. But I am supposed to soon. I have had preliminary discussions about it with my doctor, but my next appointment will be mainly about the Rituxamab. \nSorry about the articles, I must have messed up when I added the links to my reply. But if you search this CLL subreddit for Rituxamab and Covid a couple articles show up. Thanks to you as well! \n\nI am not totally against Venetoclax, but the thought of taking it for an indefinite amount of time triggers my anxiety. \n\nI am also worried about the stress I may have at work during the adjustment period. With a chemo I would just be on sick leave for six months and able to concentrate on myself. With Venetoclax however I would probably have to juggle work and appointments, not to mention possible side-effects, and I am already on the verge of breaking down due to various reasons. \n\nGood for you that you responded to the vaccine! I am planning on having my response tested as well. The question however is, if Rituximab can still block this response after it has developed.\n\nI will keep looking for infos.\n\nGood luck to you too! I totally understand about the anxiety, and I suggest that you take a look at the CLL Society, they have a great website about CLL, and have support groups as well. I participate in 2 of them, and we are now all virtual, and have the meetings via Zoom. New members mainly listen, and hear about others experiences, and it is extremely reassuring. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: chemo can have damage to your bone marrow, which impacts can show up many years later, and the newer immunotherapies have very few side effects. Taking pills at night or in the morning had no impact on my ability to work, and I had no side effects. \n\nStay strong, we are all in this together.", "CAPTIVATE Study BTK Inhibitors With BCL2 Inhibitors in CLL ", "Randomized trial of ibrutinib versus ibrutinib plus rituximab in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia ", "An improved benefit\u2010risk profile of duvelisib in patients with CLL who received 2 prior therapies ", "First-Line Therapy for Older Patients With CLL ", "Statistics on age Although CLL is an older individual disease I wonder how many of you were young? Younger than 60? Younger than 40? And what were symptoms and treatments? It you do not mind sharing. Thanks \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb I was diagnosed at the very beginning of this year. I am a 43 year old male. I am not currently going through any kind of treatment my doctor thinks it will be 5 to 10  years before I will need treatment. That is great news. As far your blood work during diagnosis we are they all out of whack do you know? Any aggressive lymph nodes? Thanks \ud83d\ude0a So I have a lymph node in my throat that is huge. It is the reason I went to the doctor. The primary care doctor I was seeing at the time had no idea what was going on with me so we did blood work, CT Scan ,and then a biopsy of my armpit. I feel like I have/had other symptoms, however my doctor has not told me if they are related. I am 28 diagnosed 2 months ago. No treatment yet. Swollen lymph node in groin was the only symptom! In your throat? Or on the side of neck? Wow really young. Any abnormality in blood work? Sorry side of neck right above my adams apple. Some days it is about the size of a grape some days the size of a walnut. They will not remove it unless it hinders my breathing or ability to eat, which is kind of annoying. Fortunately I have a beard or else it would be visible the majority of time. Oh and one other thing. After I got my COVID shots the lymph node in my armpit swelled up so big it was uncomfortable for like a month. I guess it is a common response however I find it a little odd. Oh alright I see, you say above your Adam\u2019s apple? Is it visible to the eye? I am trying to picture it never heard of one there I was diagnosed when I was 27. The swollen lymph nodes were discovered by chance. I was on watch and wait for a couple of years, had a chemo that led to full remission, then some more watching and waiting, and now I started on Venetoclax. \n\nI have to say, except for the last couple of months where I felt fatigued, sweated a lot and showed a couple of haematomas, I feel like the disease has not affected me much physically over all these years. Even the chemo was almost like a walk in the park. \n\nWhat was affecting me mentally though was my face gradually puffing up from the swollen lymph nodes, until it was shaped like a peanut m&amp;m, lol. Makes you feel pretty self-conscious. But that is currently receding thanks to Venetoclax.\n\nWhat is your story? Are you a patient yourself? J Pretty common. Got my third vaccine and the lymph nodes under my arms are easily the size of baseballs. After my second vaccine, it took about a month for them to go down to the point of not being painful. Expecting the same, but this time is much worse so I am not that confident. Official diagnosis was at age 35, but we later discovered I would had CLL for a few years before that when looking at past blood work. \n\nI went to the doc because my vision seemed weird, had bad night sweats, and was waking up to high heart rate alerts from my Apple Watch. It is hard to say if any of these were related to CLL though, because I would have had it for years before those \u201csymptoms\u201d began. \n\nMy lymph nodes are getting pretty big, which is common for someone with an 11q deletion, and my white blood cell count is approaching 200k. No treatment yet, but I expect my Active Observation period will end soon. 44yo. Routine annual physical.  Blood work showed elevated WBC of 12000. Follow up a couple moths later had me at 19000. 7 months later 24,400. Wow 200k no treatment! You said you were diagnosed at 35, how old are you now, how elevated was the wbc then? And what is your ethnicity? Oh yeah! Sorry that is the thing that showed them. Had a white blood count of 49,000 Lymphocytes have been abnormally high since age 34.  Treated at 41.  Looks like 3+ years before another treatment. \n\nHeat intolerance above 74F, Sun intolerance beyond 15 minutes, massive splenomegaly on CT scan, upper left quadrant pain when diving deep in a pool.   Tenderness on left side eventually.   In the past 2 years night sweats.  Am ecxema like condition on my elbows and hip.  My lymphocyte count only grew to 17,000 before needing treatment.  \n\nDoc gave me rituximab monotherapy since I had an unusually bright cd20.  It seems to have worked well enough to resume a largely normal life.  The weirdest thing is that it cleared up my elbow skin and the heat intolerance. I am just about 38 now. It is been exactly 3 years since I decided to set an appointment. \n\nWBC was 14k at my first appointment and I have now officially doubled within 6 months based on my last lab. \n\nMost other counts are within normal range, so while my WBC is high, it is important, to me, to not treat just because of WBC. One can easily be in the 600k range without any symptoms whatsoever. \n\nIt is possible, although unlikely, that I will plateau around 200k for awhile. I know others where this has happened, but with the size of my lymph nodes, 11q, and unmutated status, I will probably look into a trial at MD Anderson within the next 6 months. \n\nFWIW, I am an American of Northern European decent, so about as white as they come. Interesting, thank you. White European tend to be the highest risk. One last question if that is alright, you say all other labs were normal. Did you/ do you have lymphocytosis? Interesting, thank you. How high were lymphocytes during diagnosis? Was it already &lt;5000? Or leukocytosis? Last thing, what is your ethnicity? Interesting thank you. Did you have elevated lymphocytes as well? And what is your ethnicity if you do not mind? I do not know the answer to that unfortunately.  I was sent home with no answers and simply mailed brochures with a broad range on information. \n\nI am Caucasian. DX 7 years ago at 46 yrs. Ibrutinib for about 3 years now. No high risk markers. Yes, my absolute lymphocytes are high, for sure, but not enough to alarm my doctors quite yet. WBC is high, absolute lymphocytes are getting up there, and hemoglobin finally dipped below 14.3 to 14 so we are seeing that start to drop for the first time. Platelets and neutrophils are well within normal range so far. It is a bit weird...  I had went for a CT for appendicitis in 2017 and the doc saw the splenomegaly and said something to the effect of \"you should see a hematologist if you want to get to the bottom of that mystery.  It is probably nothing\".   So I ignored it until 2019 when it started hurting.   The hematologist said I have cancer within about 2 minutes of talking to her, which was a bit of a shock.   \n\nMy lymphocytes were over 5k since 2012ish.   I was formally diagnosed at 14,000 around Aug 2019 but the biometrics had been going unrecognized by my pcp for years.  My CBC showed lymphocyte abs climbing steadily for years with no downward trend.\n\nIt was not until late 2019 that my WBC abs count became abnormal.  They saw smudge cells, clefted lymphocytes and giant platelets on the smudge and followed up with a flow cytometry.   The test took forever to get the results back for, but at that point it was clear that it was a lymphoma or leukemia.  I did another 2 months of tests (axillary dissection and bone marrow biopsy) and I. That time the lymphocyte count started growing rapidly and my symptoms made me pretty miserable.   The whole thing was very subtle until I needed treatment.\n\nMy ethnicity is mostly Polish and some Croatian.  I have some low single digits of Irish, Lithuanian, and Norwegian DNA.  Surprisingly I have an Irish surname. Very interesting story, I am sorry for it being quite unfortunate. The positive is you will most likely live a very normal life. I am surprised they did not pursue further testing since 2012 with the 5k lymphocytosis. Thanks again for sharing your story 55 yo M. Diagnosed four years ago at 51. Was not a major worry. But my WBC doubled twice in the past two years. It is up to 150K. Been having symptoms of night sweats and overall fatigue.

I am incredibly appreciative of everyone that has given me advice within this sub and also through private messages.\n\nIf anyone is willing, I would love to hear about yourselves and you or your loved one's \"journey,\" from when you first suspected something was not right to diagnosis to treatment, etc..., good or bad. \n\nI am not trying to apply all experiences towards my dad's situation, I know everyone is case is different.  I am just genuinely interested in your experiences.\n\nEveryone I have talked to here has been so amazing. I have been thinking about you all a ton, and I truly hope for continued success and growth in treatment for this disease I can give you a positive story. They will not all be like that.\n\nI got diagnosed with CLL in 2015, and it was dormant until last summer when I got pneumonia. The complications were pretty bad: kidney failure, sepsis, WBC from 50,000 to 100,000 and back in two hours, and I had an incident of diabetic ketoacidosis (blood glucose 897). So they air medevacced me to a bigger hospital.\n\nAfter I got out of the ICU a week later, Sept. 7 I think, my WBC went steadily up and through 100,000, and at the end of the year my oncologist said I should start treatment in January. But then I got Covid-19.\n\nI finally started treatment at the beginning of April with obinutuzumab. This is a typical first line therapy, usually with venetoclax. The obin monoclonal antibody is made from a chimera, an animal with two genotypes. Some lunatic figured out how to bioengineer a mouse with 4% human DNA and then use its cells to make a cancer medicine.\n\nI had a 146,000 WBC a few days before the first infusion. When I came back a week later, the WBC was down to 1,300, which is too low. I have had five infusions since then and may be done after the sixth next month.\n\nI had no side effects from this. Nothing.I do not know how they will treat your dad, but if it involves infusion, it is pretty much a glide. It hurts for about three seconds when they put the needle in, then you just chill in a comfy chair for four or five hours. You can bring a computer or phone, read a book. I bring my lunch, but you can have food delivered too at the clinic I go to..\n\nI have been very lucky. These drugs are very powerful. Originally the oncologist told me the regimen would take a year. Cancer pretty much already wrecked.\n\nI wish you and your father all the best in overcoming CLL. Thank you so, so much for your story and the detailed information. I truly appreciate you taking the time to write it all out.\nHoly cow, last summer was insane for you! What a whirlwind, I cannot even imagine how difficult it all was! I am so happy to hear you are doing well.\nI know everyone is treatments and responses are different, it is just interesting to see other people's experiences.\nMy father will be hopefully starting on Calquence as soon as he can figure out how to pay for it.\nAgain, I am so happy you are doing well at the moment. I truly wish you the best, and due to your username, I cannot help but keep FakeNickOfferman in my thoughts forever. Thank you again \ud83d\udc97 I went on too much about myself. I did have some good news when I talked to my on July 22.  I have one more infusion and that is it, at least for now.\n\nI would say CLL is kind of a shape shifter. Some people end up having lymph nodes in their neck surgically removed, which scares the living hell out of me. For some others some of the drugs just do not work.\n\nOn the other hand, you have idiots like me who dodged a bullet, at least for now. My doc tells me he has one patient who has maintained a 200,000 WBC for years, but it is been stable at that level and he has not needed treatment.\n\nThe Reddit CLL site is great for research.

I am 62m and had night sweats and WBC count of 179k in the fall of 2020.  Did 10 courses (5 months) of IV Gazyva as the first treatment.  Treatment was a breeze other than 5 hours in the infusion chair.

I am 32 had a WBC of 350k, other symptoms included enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged spleen, and other blood counts that were out of the normal range. I was in watch and wait for about 4 years. I started treatment (Venclexta + Gazyva) about 5 weeks ago. My count dropped down to 3.3 within the first few weeks. I am generally feeling better less fatigue, feeling more clear headed if that makes sense, and overall more energetic. My medicine does make me tired at times but otherwise I am feeling much better. I can also breathe better, I did not even realize my breathing was affected until treatment made it better. Still going through treatment for at least a year but it is nice to see some progress.

CLL is not easy to diagnose. Leave it to a specialist. Tlak to you doctor and go see a hematologist oncologist. What is your white blood cell count? It is fluctuated up and down the highest it is been was 19 then I took another blood test three days later and it went back down to 11 and my most recent was 9.5 but it is been up and down for about a year As in thousands, like 19,000?\n\nWhat my oncologist told me is that it is not the absolute number but how fast you get there.

About a month ago my dad was in the hospital for chest pain. He is had one heart attack so we are always cautious of this. While he was in there (dec 16th) apparently they found that his WBC was extremely high. (And Has been for the past year) They did a blood smear test and it showed abnormal cells. NONE of this was disclosed to us during that visit, and he was sent on his way w no follow ups or hematologist appts. Now, about a week ago my dad was having back pain. He is also had ruptured disks in the past so we brought him to the hospital again. This is when the Dr. tells us he looked at his blood work and his WBC is extremely high. This is when he mentions leukemia (CLL) he says that the blood work the last time he was admitted (dec16) showed extremely high counts and they did a blood smear and showed abnormal results. Mind you, he was sent home after that visit with NO FOLLOW UP or mentioning of this problem. This doctor is telling this to us and we are in COMPLETE disbelief that this info was not disclosed to us the last time he was admitted. They did the blood smear without telling us and it showed abnormal cells and they did not tell us. If my dad would have never gone to the ER for back pain this past week, we would have never figured this out until the next time he had blood work done and by then it could be too late. \n\nThe hematologist in the hospital is going to speaking with us soon, and helping w. Diagnosis. The doctor said the cells and blood work are consistent w CLL. \n\nIs this malpractice/negligence if he is diagnosed w CLL? \n\nI am extremely hurt stressed and worried \n\nThank you  Something very much like this happened to me. My dr did a blood test and the results were emailed to me, saying my results were consistent with a diagnosis of CLL. No dr call or anything. When I got my PCP on the phone she said yes you might have CLL, go see oncologist. After a week or so oncologist told me I have MBL, a sort of pre CLL which is surprisingly common, and not especially bad, as long as it doesnt turn into full blown CLL.  Yes, we have abnormal cells, but its in a quantity that is low enough that its not too harmful.  Hopefully that is what your Dad has too. Still sucks that they didnt say anything tho... Yes that is interesting but an e-mail or call was not sent to us to notify us of the first blood work they did that showed abnormalities. (Including blood smear) \n\nIf my dad had not been admitted this week for unrelated issues, we would have never found out about it  That is unfortunate, OP, and I am terribly sorry you had to experience this! They should have *definitely* called after the results of the smudge test. I had a similar experience to u/st3v3k4hn.\n\nYour father should have gotten a digital record of the test, and he very well may have within a day or two of his tests. I am not sure where you are located, but most hospitals in the US have some method of retrieving your test results online. It is possible he simply did not read it, email notification went to spam, or the smudge test in particular was lost in the flurry of dozens of other metrics. \n\nI was about as young as you get when it comes to a CLL diagnosis, so that probably makes me a bit more savvy in retrieving test results in a digital world. I went in to the doctor for an odd side pain, had my blood drawn, and checked my test results upon receiving an email notification within 24 hours. Quite frankly, I was mostly just curious about my cholesterol. There were dozens and dozens of tests, but the old \"smudge\" test stood out like a sore thumb amidst otherwise super-medical-sounding terms. Sure enough, I found out I had leukemia from an automatically generated email. It was a pretty shitty Friday, which also did not help in trying to get a hold of any doctors for about 4 or 5 days.\n\nMy experience is not the same as yours or your father's, but I bring it up because it is a prime example of what is in store for life with CLL. Basically, you have to be your own advocate. You have to be adamant about your tests, knowledgeable about what they mean, and continually be doing your own research on symptoms, trials, and treatments, because it is such a slow moving cancer that most doctors simply are not going to do that for you.\n\nThe word cancer is scary. The word leukemia is scary. I have a pretty good feeling on your emotions right now, but know this, more than likely nothing would have been done differently in that month of not knowing what should have been disclosed. Most with CLL are diagnosed after likely having it for *years.* \n\nIt is very possible I have had it for a long time, but have only known for one year. In that one year, my life has not changed that much outside of frequent doctor visits and screenings, but there is definitely a psychological impact. My doctor actually told me to try and forget about it, go on with my life, get married, have kids, etc. I cannot imagine this is possible for anyone with CLL. I literally think about it every single day, but time does help.\n\n( is a great resource and community if you have any questions or want to read up on other experiences. Unfortunately, the Reddit community is pretty slim on the CLL front, but that is most likely due to the average age of someone with CLL being 72. \n\n(Throwaway because I have not told my friends and family yet.)", "Novel Combination Therapy Shows Exciting Results in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Mantle Cell Lymphoma ", "Zandelisib/Zanubrutinib Produces Promising Safety, Efficacy in Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Malignancies ", "CAR T-Cell Therapy: High Response Rates, High Toxicity Rates ", "Leukemia Survival Improved From 1995 to 2009, but Racial Gaps Increased for Some Types ", "Ibrutinib: the home run for cure in CLL?

I am a grad student writing up some research on Imbruvica. We recently posted a survey but I also though this might be a good place to get real world insights. If you are comfortable, please leave a note on what your experience is like. Some things we want to know:   \n1) what is your general experience as a CLL patient?  \n2) what is your general experience with Imbruvica?  \n3) were you offered any other options as an alternative?  \n4) would you consider switching to a drug that you only had to take temporarily?  \n5) what are some common side effects you experience?  \n6) anything else you think we should know? I am 13q del, unmutated, I was diagnosed at age 34 so much younger than the typical cll patient. Before research showed traditional chemo did not give sustained remission, and before ighv testing existed, I did FR in 2012 and 2016 but did not get sustained remission. I was neutropenic and had multiple infections (mostly pneumonia) in 2017. I started ibrutinib in 2018 as well as ivig infusions after my ighv testing showed my mutation status. \n\nI developed a full-body rash a month after starting ibrutinib. My dosage was reduced, the rash subsided, the dosage was reintroduced. Generally I tolerated it quite well although it upset my stomach if taken in the morning (so I took it at night) and I would have random joint and muscle pain which would last 2-3 days which ranged from inconvenient to incredibly painful. \n\nI stopped in 2019 and had a stem cell transplant. I had a complicated medical history so had reduced-intensity conditioning (less chemo). I went back on ibrutinib to suppress my wbcs about 10 months post-transplant I think. After 14 months I stopped taking ibrutinib and started Venetoclax as ibrutinib did not put me in full remission following the transplant. \n\nIn addition to ibrutinib, my medical team considered idelalisib or a stem cell transplant but we tried ibrutinib first. \n\nIbrutinib was not that bad, I would do it again.

I really need some advice\n\nSo my mom noticed multiple enlarged lymph nodes on her neck, got a biopsy done which showed cancer. Doctors believed it was lymphoma and referred her to a specialist. Now that specialist is saying that it is CLL and she is probably not going to require treatment for several years. But I have read that patients go many years without any symptoms, yet my mom has multiple enlarged lymph nodes in her neck even though her lymphocyte count is only slightly high. A normal person's lymphocyte count is between  0.5-3.3, and hers is 4.6, so not very high, then why are her lymph nodes enlarged. Do you think there is something else going on, why is she already showing symptoms when her lymphocyte count is still not that high? Check out the CLL Society website and get a free second opinion. This is totally in line with my experience. I was diagnosed as I had an enlarged lymphnode under my chin. They did blood work, had slightly elevated WBC, after some other tests and biopsy of the lymphnode it was determined I had CLL. There are different types of CLL, the main 2 are B cell and T cell, with other subsets. I went 3 years before requiring FCR therapy. $ years after treatment my bloodwork is still perfect (knock on wood) What kind of doctor is she seeing that did the diagnosis? If she has not already, she should see a CLL specialist. MD Anderson will also do remote consultantions/second opinion with newly diagnosed patients. \n\nRE her bloodwork: the peripheral blood smear, are there smudge cells? What were the flow cytometry results? Those tests tell you if it is CLL.\n\nMany people with CLL have some one or more enlarged lymph nodes (the size can change on their own as can the number) and stay in watch and wait for years. I know a patient who was diagnosed 18 years ago and is just starting treatment this year. Get her (with you) to a CLL specialist, it will help with all your questions and making decisions and plans for her healthcare. When the CLL shows up in your lymph nodes, it is called SLL. It will not be reflected in your standard blood work, instead she probably had a FISH test or flow cytometry. She should ask for the results of that, as the CLL Society Expert Access second opinion will need the results from that test. \n\nMany patients with CLL are in watch and wait (worry and wait) and do not need treatment. If the lymph nodes in her abdomen get too large and create problems she may need a targeted treatment, not chemo.  I second the opinion to check out CLL Society for more information. I am very sorry to hear about your mother's diagnosis. I completely understand the mental roller coaster your family is going through right now, but rest assured, the future is likely not quite as bleak as the panic-inducing Google binge you have probably already experienced.\n\nI was diagnosed with CLL a bit over three years ago after routine bloodwork revealed a high white blood cell count. A follow-up smear revealed smudge cells and confirmed the CLL diagnosis. After a FISH test, we further discovered that I had an 11q deletion. These markers (11q, 17p, 13p, etc) help determine a CLL patient\u2019s treatment options. The reason I bring up mine is because folks with an 11q deletion tend to show symptoms of their CLL through enlarged lymph nodes rather quickly when compared to patients with other markers. I showed no symptoms until recently, but as predicted my lymph nodes are rapidly growing and for about the last 4 months I have gained what appears to be the neck of a linebacker with nodes the size of fists. This was expected. It is awkward, but not painful. Could be worse!\n\nThere are a few resources mentioned in the comments. I would like to reiterate these as well as emphasize the importance of two things: 1) it is imperative your mother has a CLL *specialist* or *expert* on her care team and 2) it is vital to be your own advocate with this disease. Advancement in novel treatments happens very rapidly; a general oncologist will simply not be able to keep up with the latest CLL treatment options. You need an expert on your team and you need to know how to find the latest developments yourself.\n\nStart with the ( They have great resources and an even better program called ( that will enable your family to get a free second opinion. I got mine from ( My path to treatment will be lead by ( in Houston, TX, who I discovered through the Society.\n\nSeek out a support group near you through the CLL Society. These can be vital in maintaining continued education in the advancement of treatment. You must be your own advocate!\n\nCheck out ( This popular forum has daily active discussions from people all over the world with CLL. It is an incredible spotlight on the latest treatment as well as regular conversations surrounding life with CLL. The form is generally positive and community is extremely supportive. \n\nThere are many articles out there that can paint you into doomsday or doldrums. Proceed with caution as you do your own research. The brunt force of this cancer is truly the psychological impact it lays upon you\u2014particularly in that first year since diagnosis. There will be stages of anger and denial. Heck, when I was diagnosed even my doctor friends were in denial and thought it *must be something else*. Understand that the pace of CLL treatment is so rapid, anything on the internet related to treatment that is older than six months is likely out-dated or irrelevant. \n\nThe future is getting brighter every day. If your mother was just diagnosed, she will likely be in what people refer to as \u201cWatch and Wait\u201d mode for years. Honestly though, fuck that term; it was clearly coined by doctors. I like to call it \u201cActive Observation\u201d or AO for something more positive and less akin to counting down to something terrible. Just observe and stay knowledgeable. There is a good chance your mother\u2019s best treatment option has not even been invented yet\u2014but it will be. Best of luck! Awesome response and great info! See you at a CLL Society support group! Hi!! thank you so much for your reply. She has been seeing an ENT, and he is the one who diagnosed her through a biopsy and a blood test. I am trying to find new doctors for her to see so that she can get a second opinion. Thank you so much for your kind words! And you have given me so much hope. I am going to do all the research I can and advocate for my mother's health. Thank you! she is seeing an ENT. I am trying to find CLL specialists and will be doing my research. This is a recent diagnosis, and she was not only diagnosed with CLL but also thyroid cancer. So we have been dealing with quite a lot. I will for sure take her to a CLL specialist after her thyroidectomy. Thanks for your advice! Did they do a flow cytometry with fish test or cll panel add on?  What were the results?  Specifically the light restriction and the CD markers present on the cell surface?\n\n4.6 is low for CLL. You can see some patients delay treatment and not see symptoms until 150k. \n\nAs far as lymph nodes, unless they are over 10 cm in diameter, it is not a trigger to start treatment for CLL.  How big are they?  Many cll patients live with some clusters of 1-2cm lymph nodes and it does not require treatment. 10 cm is 3.94 inches hi thanks for your reply. She has not had a  flow cytometry with fish test. Frankly, our dr did not use these terms and I am only learning about them just now. I will be looking into that. And yes, the lymph nodes are very small, 1-2 cm. Right now, I am just trying to find a new doctor, the one we go to is an ENT and maybe I should get a second opinion from someone else? 100% the appropriate kind of doctor is a hematologist-oncologist at a cancer center.   \n\nThe ones at satellite offices and hospital attached inpatient cancer centers are good enough for straightforward cases.  The ones at NCCN certified centers are for the hard cases.  A visit to either one will get you more information and a fully differentiated diagnosis.   \n\nThere are a lot of illnesses that look like CLL.  It is a good idea to get to the bottom of it and not wing the diagnosis as close enough.  It is also worth it to get the advice of somebody who treats this illness on a regular basis. &gt;she was not only diagnosed with CLL but also thyroid cancer\n\nAre they sure the thyoid cancer has not metastasized in the lymph nodes? vs it being CLL or SLL?

But living with CLL takes some compromises, you need to learn to live with them.Let me give some advice that was given to me that I tried really hard to listen to, but did not really understand at the time. Trust me please;\n\n1. You are not defined by this illness. It can be hard to explain a chronic cancer to people. Most everyone think that cancer means you beat it or you are done for. CLL is different. It is a monkey on your back you have at all times, even if you do not realize it. You feel like you have a loaded gun pointed at you, yet everyone thinks that its shooting blanks. If you find solace in community or information, there is no wrong answer. It is different going forward, but different is not \"bad\". Just understand that eventually, it becomes part of your life.\n2. I am part of the CLL study examining genetics. My grandma was diagnosed with CLL when she was 30. I just went to her 90th birthday party. She recently went on Ibrutinib in the last few months, but she spent her entire life without any medication. There are plenty of horror stories, but I believe that more people die from CLL without realizing it than dying from CLL. Actually, David Spivak Idk stats on people directly dying from CLL, I believe its more from other stuff in consequence to CLL, but whatever.\n3. Please go to a specialist. A general oncologist or the debate between whether CLL is a blood cancer or a leukemia is irrelevant. Get on a limited time trial clinical trial. Do not submit to chemo, or being on Ibrutinib for the rest of your life. Combos are doing wonders, I am MRD- after two years of Ibrutinib and Venetoclax in combo. That leads into my next point...\n4. Do your research. I do not know about anyone else, but I felt empowered in such a scary time in my life by learning as much as I could about my disease. It helps immensely, at least from my experience, to learn about how the disease operates, risks, new trials, etc.\n5. The best piece of advice I can give; How heavy is a glass of water? A normal glass of water. An ounce? What if you hold it for 2 minutes? What if you hold it for an hour? What if you hold it for 12 hours? Trust me, CLL is not worth holding onto more than 5 minutes at a time. Go and do your shit.

Is there a covid recommendation for mask wearing given that I am fully vaccinated? Thanks I am fully vaccinated and still wear mask most of the time.  I am just a bit worried about the variant. My doctor suggested that I keep masking and following the covid protocols, distancing and hand washing as well. When you start whatever treatments you will be doing ask your medical team for specifics. But until then, better safe than sorry. My dad has CLL and is vaccinated. Both his PCP and oncologist have told him to keep wearing his mask. His oncologist mentioned recent studies that have come out showing the vaccine might not be as effective for those with CLL. He is testing him for antibodies this week If you want the short answer, the vaccines are basically ineffective for people with CLL. There is a slight chance for t-cell immunity, but no great way to test for it. Few are showing antibodies and those that do likely do not have enough for protection. \n\nMask up, distance, and party like it is 2020 for another year. We are relying on heard immunity to have a life. I had my antibody test two weeks ago. The result showed no detectable antibodies. The research I found online said that people who were treated with Venclexta, as I was, are getting no benefit from the vaccine. I received the Pfizer vaccine. Is the antibody test to see if he was exposed to Covid-19 yet asymptomatic, or to see general immune strength, or what? What a completely false statement. It depends where you are at- what stage, treatment started or wait and watch, etc. I am stage 0 and still have a pretty good immune system the vax totally is helping me against covid. You have to keep in mind that we do not fully know what the antibody test means as far as protection. It is a best guess. There could be another level of protection that we do not know about (T cells, etc). But being careful and acting as though you do not have protection is a smart idea given all of the unknowns. In practice, I have heard remarks that they are not seeing huge levels of those with blood malignancies in the hospital. That tells me something we are doing is probably working. Maybe it is the caution,maybe it is the vaccine, maybe it is both. I think for us, the most vital thing is that those close to us, like family, are vaccinated to protect us more. Stay well! But please do get outside and enjoy life. I am trying to remind myself of that as much as I can. They are not entirely wrong. Study showed stage 0 vs other stages were just as at risk. It was one of the big surprises of the study done in Pittsburgh. You probably have protection of some sort but we do not know. But I agree, their statement is a little over the top doom and gloom. It looks like vaccines do not work well for us, even those of us who have never been treated, like me. FFP3 masks are now recommended to protect the wearer against Covid. It is to gage antibodies produced after the vaccine. Did you get the antibodies test through LLS? To see the immune strength thx Thanks for your entirely thoughtful, helpful and useful reply.

Also, we _don\u2019t_ know if we have great protection and there is _no_ definitive test.

I am grateful to have found this sub. My 65 year old father went to his doctor last week after feeling short of breath for a while, and ended up being very unexpectedly diagnosed with stage 4 CLL.  His doctors have not given a prognosis, as they need to see how he responds to treatment. We are so scared and full of anxiety. I am going through all the posts here to try to find resources as well as personal experiences. I am also worried about Covid. He is vaccinated, but from my brief readings so far, we likely need to continue being extra extra cautious? My mother has a very different type of cancer, so Leukemia is new to me. Sorry if I sound stupid, we are just so lost and stressed. Any advice or general information would be so appreciated. Advice is staging not comparable to staging in solid tumors at all. Stage IV lung cancer, breast, etc worrisome. You can be stage 4 CLL at one blood test and 3 months later stage 1 because of variation in platelet counts. With the current palette of drugs it is similar to high blood pressure for many people. Make sure your dad gets treatment at a good medical center.  If it means driving two or three hours away, it is worth it.  Secondly, there are good meds for leukemia now.  Since he is stage four, it might not be easy for him.  They have to kill the cancer and then get his levels back to normal.  However, it is doable.  I fully expected to die, yet here I sit.  And the meds are getting better.  Smarter.  Instead of a med killing everything in the body, some of them target the cancer directly.  It is a wonder.\n\nIn terms of eating, I consider that very important to survival.  During treatment there may be cravings for food, so let him eat what his body is telling him, or a good healthy version of it.  Mouth sores can be an issue.  If they get too bad, there are products that can completely numb the inside of the mouth and throat and will allow him to eat.  Tell him to eat as much as he can while his mouth is numb.  If he gets treatment in hospital, it is important to drink a lot of fluids.  I used to take a bottle of organic lemonade with me - I would add a little to my water to make flavor and I would drink a lot.\n\nWhen battling cancer, it is a bunch of little things that adds up to getting through it. You do not sound stupid. You are wonderful for being eager and I wish the very best for you and your family. I am still in the very early stages of learning. I hope the response to treatment brings everyone some comfort. Hang in there. Hello,\n\nI have CLL as well and first order of advice is despite how hard it is, *DONT Panic.* Second thing, dont consult Dr. Google! Please go here ( and join the cll group. You will find the best and most current information about latest treatments and the best support group anywhere. Next thing to do is go here ( and find a cll specialist in your area. In my opinion, having a cll specialist is paramount. Cll is a very slow growing disease and you will not be forced to make decisions immediately. These days cll is a very treatable disease. I wish you and your father well! Nothing stupid here.   Stay calm.  Ive been stage 2 for 4 yrs now.  Still in a watch and see mode.  Though i have not started any treatment as yet, my talks with my oncologist on the progression of treatments is very positive.  CLL is not a death sentence.  Dr has patients diagnosed 10 yrs ago and have seen omly a slight progression.  Keep the faith.  Stay off the internet  !!!!! Head over to healthunlocked.com and find the CLL support forum. It is not like other cancers and often is just monitored having been routinely picked up during routine blood tests. Personally I have not been staged (UK) but as others have said it is not like other cancers and people can carry it for years and not need treatment (I hope to do that). It is possible that your father will need treatment but this is something which often leads to regression for a time. I have learned recently, sadly, that my immune system is not fully functional. That unfortunately means the vaccines MAY not be so effective in CLL patients as the general population and also, indeed a common cause of death, is an inability to fight off an infection, be that from a cut or covid. Things will stabalise as you learn where your father is at physiologically, this is a chronic long term condition and not to be mistaken for acute forms of leukaemia (sorry UK here so I spell it right \ud83e\udd2d) which are much more concerning. Consider an antibody test, it is likely covid is the biggest risk to your father in the short term and it would be good to know he had antibodies following his vaccination. Do not be surprised to find none though. Best of luck. Advice: get multiple opinions if that is an option in your situation.  Dr.s are human and only know what they know.  Talk to a couple or more if you can.  \n\nAlso, after you are done worrying, try to stop worrying.  This is a manageable disease and there is never been more options for treatment.  Comparing treatment for CLL from even five years ago is like night and day compared to today's options.  I have talked to Dr.s in the field and they are excited to have so many arrows in the quiver.  They are just figuring out which combos work best in which situations. \n\nLastly, wear sunscreen.  Seriously. Thank you so much for this info, I was not yet able to find anything very clear about how staging works. This is really helpful and gives me a different perspective. I am trying to get them to go to a better hospital in the city, but they have crappy insurance and are already worrying about costs of treatment  :(   I 100% agree though. In my experience, no matter how much a local hospital acts like they can handle these serious and complex diseases, they in no way compare to the bigger hospitals in the city.\n\nThank you so much for the tips, I have added them to my notes. And I hope you are  doing well! Thank you, your kindness truly means so much. You and everyone else here have been so understanding and helpful and are really helping my mental state. I just made an account on healthunlocked thanks to you guys.\n\nThank you for the information, incredibly helpful! I am surprised his doctors have not mentioned any potential Covid issues at all. I am going to have him add covid/antibody testing to his ever-growing list of topics to discuss.\n\nAnd I am so sorry, but leukaemia just looks so troublesome to my small American brain \ud83d\ude43 Thanks again and I hope you are doing well! Ideally he will bring back a result which is positive for antibodies. Its very possible he will not though, or they will be low. You will then discover that the immune system is not so well understood, especially when it malfunctions. It is thought the t cell response may perform a protective function in CLL patients more so than regular folks. Perhaps the body is adapting to handle its weakness, but it is unknown. There certainly have been many CLLers that have got covid and survived, some with not a particularly rough time but it is still best avoided, but that goes for us all.\nYour father is 65 so can still have a good life ahead of him. Life is for living but just be cautious. Avoid crowds, go to shops at off peak times and mitigate risks where he can. Treatment is often necessary to manage the symptoms and it seems he has a few but consider carrying them as some treatments can further weaken the immune system. Your Dr will know all this of course, or should. Good luck. Doing okay.  Chemo changes your life but for the most part, I feel pretty okay now.  And I am alive, and maybe I will see my kids have kids someday, which would be nice.  I can honestly say I have quality of life.\n\nOh.  I forgot one thing - chemo can cause clinical depression, so be aware that if your parent is feeling terrible and they just feel like they want to die, that is the chemo talking.  Messes with the head, but it is manageable once you realize how it works.  Good nutrition offsets it some but chemo is a real hammer of a medicine. I am glad to hear you are doing ok! I get so bugged out over this stuff and how unfair it often is to so many people\n\nAnyways, thank you for the depression info. He actually has had serious depression issues in the past. Honestly until this diagnosis, I have never heard him talking about wanting to live so badly. He wants at least 10 more years, which is opposite of what he was feeling just a few years ago. Once treatment starts, I will definitely pay close attention to his mental state I just signed up for healthunlocked. I have never heard of this website, so thank you!\n\nThe site with specialists is so helpful. I agree, a specialist is often invaluable. Unfortunately they are really worried about money and I do not think I can convince him to leave his local hospital at this point. I am going to keep trying. Hoping he listens to me eventually, depending on how the next few months go.\n\nThank you for the resources and well wishes. It truly means so much. I am so glad to hear you are doing alright!  And I know you are right, but it is so very hard to stay off the internet lol.  I am mostly trying to connect with actual people with real experiences rather than googling statistics.  But... I am still doing too much googling lol.\n\nThank you a ton for the advice and well wishes! He is super stubborn and worried about cost, so I cannot get him to seek much outside of his local hospital at the moment. If things do not go well over the next few months, I am hoping he will reconsider.\n\nThank you, I really am trying not to worry too much. I know every person's case is different. I do tend to lean more towards realism/pessimistism because I just cannot take trying so hard to be optimistic, only to be devastated....   I am honestly feeling a lot better already thanks to you and everyone else who took the time to comment and give advice. Thank you again Quitting the internet is difficult,  but you will have your head spinning with all the \"information\" available.  Not to mention the anxiety you will give yourself.   Speak to your oncologist about sites you can research the disease.   There are reputable sites.  Understanding the disease with correct information will help you stay calm and educated. Okay, very good. One more thing I thought of in favor of a larger treatment facility: everything is in house.  When they test your blood, the results come back in an hour.  When you need a CT or PET scan, it is at the hospital in the facility.  Bone marrow transplant?  There.  And it is just one bill.  At the small places, they cannot do it all so they might ship off the blood draw, and it will take time to get it back.  They may have different places to send a person to, to get procedures done, and all of those places might send a bill.  Which means different bills from different places and you cannot combine them.\n\nAnyway, I know it is a lot.  I do know this.  At first I was terrified but my husband suggested the big place because we knew what our chances were locally.  It made a huge difference. \"These days cll is a very treatable disease.\" Is that really true? My mother has been diagnosed with it (based on smear test so far) and I have been very sad because google says there is no way to cure it. Any help and information would be really appreciated because we are very lost! Rule #1: DO NOT CONSULT DR. GOOGLE\n\nRule #2: Get a CLL specialist. cll specialists can be found at the cll society webpage at (\n\nRule#3: Sign up and join the **cll group** at ( There is not a better support group on the web. You will find the best information here.\n\nRule #4: Take a deep breath.\n\nI wish you and Mother all the best! I know you are not asking me, but I believe krell is very correct about not looking too deeply into whatever you find on Google. My mother was diagnosed with a much different, very rare cancer a few years ago, and internet searches and her first doctor (who was not a specialist) basically told me there was not much hope. I eventually learned there are so many different factors that need to be considered for each person's specific case, and a specialist makes SO much difference. My mother turned out to have one of the \"better\" pathologies and after intense surgeries and treatment by a highly-regarded specialist, she is considered NED (No Evidence of Disease) for now. We need to mostly pay attention to their specific test results and specialist opinions, though I know how hard that is.\n\nTruly wishing the best for your mother and your family Thank you so much for your continued advice, it really means the world to me. I have copied and pasted all of your comments into my erratic list of notes. Your advice is exactly what I was hoping to find, and I am truly grateful to you for taking the time to help me. \n\nYour earlier comment about expecting to die really made me feel \ud83d\ude29  I know I cannot even comprehend all the feelings you must have felt. So, so glad you are doing alright now. I really need to convince him to see a specialist. Thank you for using your experiences to help other clueless people like me \ud83d\udc97 I am really concerned about Covid for him, especially since the new variant seems to be growing in our area. Unfortunately I come from a family that largely thinks Covid is a political issue, and one of our close family members is convinced that the vaccine caused his CLL diagnosis. So I am super thankful for the advice from someone that actually has this disorder. You are welcome.  I mean, I made it through to the other side here, so the least I can do is hold out a hand to help someone cross the turbulent river.  It is rough, but it is, thanks to new technology in medicine, quite doable.

I am 45yo and was diagnosed with CLL 5 months ago and am currently under active surveillance. There is a lot in the news about the Covid vaccine and folks undergoing CLL treatment and there have been some instances of the Vaccine not being effective or not getting the immune response a no-immunocompromised individual would expect. \n\nI am actually pretty worried about getting the Vaccine and then when I do begin CLL treatment down the road, the CLL treatment would be ineffective due to the Vaccine.\n\nI did call my doctor for advice but the response was \"We do not know\". \n\nI had Covid back in early 2020 and had a mild symptoms, mostly fatigue.   \n\nWith all the hardline talk about passports, no Jab means no job, no travel, no life..  It feels like I am being forced to choose between being ostracized or death by CLL.  \n\nI am not really sure what to do... &gt; when I do begin CLL treatment down the road, the CLL treatment would be ineffective due to the vaccine\n\nI thought it was the other way round? When one's undergoing treatment for CLL then the vaccine would not be effective?\nI do not know much I am just lurking this sub because I have a relative with CLL. Hi! From what I know it is the other way around: the CLL treatment can affect the effectiveness of the vaccine, but not vice-versa.\n\nI was on watch and wait when Covid started, but then my lab values started deteriorating. My doc then insisted that I get vaccinated before talking treatment. \n\nI am now fully vaccinated, but decided to get tested for spike protein antibodies as well as neutralizing antibodies, and both tests were negative. So, basically, it is as if I had not been vaccinated at all. That does not necessarily mean that I am not protected at all, because there may be other protection mecahnisms, but fact is the vaccine did not have the effect it has in a healthy person.\n\nWe then proceeded to treatment: Because of covid, my doc ruled out any therapy option that includes Rituximab, because it destroys your B-cells and leaves you without a functioning immune system. That is just to risky during the pandemic. So I started Venetoclax last week, as a montherapy, i.e. without Rituximab, and I can already see in my labs that it is working.\n\nSo, do not worry about the vaccine compromising the treatment. Every expert I have heard so far advises their CLL patient to get vaccinated. It cannot cause any damage with regards to the CLL. It could only be ineffective, meaning that you would still have to isolate yourself. What he said! Yeah it is the other way around. Thank you for the thoughtful reply! \n\nYou are correct, there have been reports of the Vaccine rendered ineffective by CLL treatments. I only wonder if the reverse is also possible. \n\nMy Dr's nurse said the same thing \"We recommend getting the Vaccine\". I said \"I understand but, has anyone considered the vaccine making CLL treatments ineffective?\"\n\nHer reply was \"We do not know\"  \n\nI am not sure what would be the best course of action here... I have been living with CLL for 7 years and was just treated so I am following this closely. \n\nCheck out the some of the great science based resources at  and  \n\nBoth offer some excellent evolving information on CLL and Covid.  \n\nNet is you should get the vaccine as soon as you can. \n\nGood luck and stay safe. I understand your confusion, this nurse was sending you mixed signals! All I can say from my own experience as well as from the various webinars I have watched and articles I have read is that there is no reason to believe the vaccine affects the treatment. Like I said, I was vaccinated in June and started treatment last week and the treatment works perfectly. I am not your Dr. but as someone who reads a fair amount about this specific topic I can tell you the medical community is pretty in sync about someone in your position getting the shot.

Like the title says, we just found out my dad who is 55 has CLL, but we do not know too many details yet since he is only had an initial blood drawing where they found it. Overall he is super healthy, works out pretty intensely about 5 days a week and has nothing else that would be a negative factor for his health. \n\nI do not expect too exact of an answer since we do not know many details about it yet, but if anyone has some things that we could generally expect short term and long term that would be super helpful! Nothing much happens. He will eventually need to take pills. Depends on what DNA makeup of his particular flavor of CLL. Generally speaking CLL is a pretty slow moving disease.  There are currently a bunch of very effective treatments. Speaking only for myself, I have not had many side-effects and the ones I get are pretty tolerable. \nHopefully that will be his experience as well. Good luck to yo and your dad. That is good to hear, thanks!! Good luck to you too! Depends which CLL. \n\nNext step is an oncologist to determine next steps. He could have the typical CLL which can take decades to develop to the point where treatment might be considered. He might have a more aggressive form too. Fancy bloodwork should provide this detail--test likely will not be cheap. Routine bloodwork can show elevated WBC counts, and hemoglobin and platelet counts.\n\nWorkouts are a positive. I was just diagnosed at 61. Just make sure he has a cll specialist. Some more tests to determine it is stage and just a routine followup for a while, until it shows symptoms. Could take years, even 10, before any treatment. I got diagnosed in 2015. I am now 60 and did not need treatment until April. It was a monoclonal treatment that was supposedly to last a year, but I am out after five months. I will have to do it again.\n\nMy observation is that I wasted a lot of time being afraid since 2015 and lost some friends because of it.\n\nSorry for the clich\u00e9d reference. But fear is the enemy. Maybe. My oncologist told me he had a patient who been running a 200,000 WBC for years and did not treatment because it was stable.\n\nIt is not supposed to be a problem unless it doubles in six months. \n\nIn the local ER, mine doubled from 50K to  100K in two hours. They air medivacced me out because of complications. \n\nAs my mother used to say, fuck your luck. All true comments.   My cll diagnosis was Oct 2017.   I am still on a wait and see program.

I am Rolling.\n\nThe best thing is to make sure you have a competent oncologist and skilled staff. I was diagnosed in 2016 at 56 years of age and did not need treatment until this year.  I highly recommend your dad see a CLL specialist because there are a number of different genomic markers that can predict how the disease will evolve over the next few years.  For instance, I have an unmutated IgVH which will direct which treatments I should consider.\n\nHere is a listing of CLL Doctors from the Lukemia cociety \n\n", "Ublituximab Plus Umbralisib Granted BLA for CLL and SLL Treatment ", "New Data Demonstrate the Continued Clinical Benefit of Fixed-duration, Chemotherapy-free Venclexta-based Treatments in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ", "Promising Clinical Activity Seen in Single Agent and Combination TG-1701 in CLL and Other B-Cell Malignancies ", "Dr. Choi on the Utility of Duvelisib in CLL ", "High Response Rate Found in Heavily Pretreated, High-Risk CLL With Liso-Cel ", "Ibrutinib delays progression versus chemoimmunotherapy in older CLL patients ", "Benefit From MURANO Trial in CLL Sustained With Subsequent Therapy ", "Epigenetic Factors Determine the Characteristics of B-Cells | What is Epigenetics?

My Lymphocyte count has been up for the last year or more and my doctor referred me to a Hemotologist who looked at my blood work results from 10/23 and ordered her own set, which I had done on Friday morning. The results are now showing up in in my MyChart and it is Sunday, so I will not hear back from the doctor until at least tomorrow. My Lymphocyte count went from 61% to 70%,and my neutrophils went from 30% down to 22% in the last two weeks. Am I right to be extremely concerned? You are not going to get much response on this forum, unfortunately. It is mostly a place where research is shared about CLL. Nobody can really tell you whether or not you should be concerned. Percentages also do not say a whole lot, at least not for me. I think the fact that this disease is mostly an older adult disease makes it such that those folks do not tend to use Reddit. But if you have questions, I can try to answer. I would just chill until I talked to my doctor about it though. Hi, yes this is mainly the place to see any news related to CLL. But as a 53yo person who has CLL  will tell you one thing and that is do not over think it and cause yourself extreme worry. \nWaiting for results is a pain in itself, see what the numbers are when you get them and ask your doctor every thing you want and have them explain. I have been living with it for 2 years, numbers steadily going up, no treatment of any kind yet. Changed my diet. Trying to exercise more, fatigue is my biggest problem. \nWords that you will probably hear from your doc is to W&amp;W watch and wait. This disease is a cruel one imho, it will not kill me it just makes you feel miserable. I apologize if my post has not helped you ease your mind. I am always here so if you want send me  message and I can answer some of your questions. Also will post a forum that deals with CLL patients and is pretty great place for information. Thanks.

Anyone have any experience with it? My Dad was diagnosed with pretty early stage CLL a year ago. He is 67. He has had a cold that has been lingering for over a week so his doctor recommended receiving IVIG treatment to boost his immune system. Has anyone has any experience with the treatment? Side effects? I would be interested to hear about this as my husband is 69 with early CLL. Concerned about viral infections in the fall. Hope some members have some input. 69? Nice. \n\nI am a bot lol. Do they know how long he is had CLL? If they think he is had it since relatively close to the diagnosis, that seems early to need IVIG to me. \n\nObviously everyone is different. I have got somewhat bad markers and have had CLL for at least 6 or 7 years and never needed IVIG. I am also 30 years younger than your dad.\n\nI know others who do it during the fall and winter months every year and it seems to work well.  \n\nCheck with his insurance too. The cost can vary greatly. In the US, one treatment can easily be $8,000. \ud83d\ude14 They actually find out he had it by accident. They took a mole off his face and sent it in for biopsy and noticed something off with the white blood count. Further tests showed it was CLL. They said it was very early and most likely would not have to do anything serious for many many years. It seems that the IVIG is just precautionary to get him through this cold. Yes!  Just this year.  I kept getting sick and the doctor looked at my numbers and said, \u201cYou are really low\u201d.  I also then looked at the numbers because I will be honest with you, I did not know what the igG blood test meant.  So, my number was less than sixty, and normal range is above. 550.\n\nI had a sinus infection during my first infusion, and the antibodies swarmed to where I was infected and made my face puff up.  It was a terrible drive home.  (I had taken a nap in my car before the long drive back, and took a Benadryl to make the swelling go down).  Post nap was better, and I rested the next day.\n\nAfter that, the infusions were much better because I was no longer so sick from having lack of antibodies.  I am going in next week to get some more.  It is a life changer and it is nice not to have major sinus infections that will not go away.\n\nEdit:  the reason my doctor started the treatment was because I told her I had been sick for two solid months, January and February, and I had asked her for antibiotics.  She did not want to give them to me and scheduled the igG infusion.   In the days leading up to it, I had gone to Texas and while I was there I went to a minute clinic to make the infection go away, but it came right back when I got back from Texas.  Then, the first infusion of igG happened (I had one infusion a month for about four months) and I have been healthy ever since. I think it is probably relative to the person as to whether they need it or not.  Everyone is immune system and blood will handle things differently.  I did not remember getting igG infusions ever until this year.  But maybe I had and did not remember, before.

So I am male 23 years old I started having really bad headaches about 2 weeks ago so I decided to go to ER. They did a CT brain scan as well as CBC. Ct scan was fine I was told nothing abnormal, until I looked at my CBC I started to worry. I might have CLL. Anyone who knows how to tell or can give me any info please let me know. My blood showed smudge cells as well as Variant lymphocytes. My WBC is 11.4k, my mean platelet volume is 9.6, segmented neutrophils 44%. Lymphocytes 35% with 8% atypical lymphs. Everything else came in the NORMAL range. It also stated poikilocytosis and anisocytosis. The only person you should get a diagnosis from is a doctor,  and a specialist at that. If you or your doctor is concerned, ask for a referral to an oncologist/hematologist. Do not take internet advice or just start googling symptoms. \nDiagnosing CLL is not something you can do on your own. I will have additional test this upcoming week. I just wanted to know if anyone had an idea or information since I get anxious easily I definitely understand, but do yourself a favor and do not get ahead of yourself. I have seen what incorrect over diagnosis can do to a person. It will drive you crazy. \nTake things as they come, one at a time. Do not worry until it is time to worry. This disease (as well as others) are complex and nuanced. I was first diagnosed 20 years ago. I was cancer free for 19 years after treatment. It is back and my treatment options are even better than the first time.\nGood luck to you. I sent you a message, if you can help out by replying if not thanks for your time! I agree with others that you need an assessment from an oncologist. \n\n11.4k is close to the high end of normal \n\n\nI hit 146k this year before. I had to start chemo.. Which has been very effective with no side effects. \n\nBut yes you need analysis from an oncologist.. Not your GP. \n\nWishing you well. \n\nOne good source of info is the cll section of Health unblocked website. I will second the others. Definitely do not start googling and diagnosing yourself. Just keep doing your tests and take it day by day.\n\nYour WBC is still close to normal. I am sitting around 200k right now and still have not had treatment. \n\nPing the subreddit when you find out more and we can surely point you toward some resources if you need them. So I am a 43 year old male that was diagnosed with CLL 7 months ago. I went to the doctor because I have a lump in my throat. The primary care physician I was seeing at the time insisted that I googled what could be wrong with me after my first round of blood work came back off. So I did, let me tell you it was the worst thing I could have done. The last appointment I had with that doctor she had me convinced I had a stage 4 cancer and basically told me good luck. Point of the story is that primary care physicians are not oncologists. Only trust what a oncologist has to say and always get a second opinion. I know what you are going through sucks, but trusting anyone aside from a expert will only cause you unnecessary stress and pain. That is great for you. I just went through the same thing at the ER. I am 30 and a tad scared right now. I will be going to my doctor next week to get more bloodwork. I had my last bloodwork 3 months ago and everything was normal but now WBC count and smudge cells and lymphocytes are all elevated. Did you have blood work at the hospital or was it referred from your doctor? The elevated bloodwork was from the ER yesterday. 3 months ago was at my primary doctor\u2019s when everything was normal You said you are 30? How elevated are the results?

Hello all,\n\nThanks for taking the time to read. My Aunt was recently diagnosed with CLL and is incredibly anxious more so to the cost of treatment than the treatment itself. They are saying they are going to start her on Imbruvica - Her insurance does not have pharmacy coverage it just rolls into her deductible that is part of her medical benefits. I was able to find a place for her to apply for support from the PAN foundation, but thought I would ask her if anyone else has other sites she can visit for support. \n\nI am trying to help find mental support for her to with groups and things of that nature. CLLSociety.org has been extremely helpful with information as well. \n\nAgain, thank you and keep fighting the fight. Yeah I was going to say CLL society and patient power. CLL society is such a strong support group and when my mother was diagnosed they really came through for us. Not really much of a support group on reddit, id push her to CLL society and have her engage in the conversations, she will find so many helpful people eager to guide her in the right direction from all over the world and they know a ton about insurance coverage and all the loops. Also CLL Forum Thank you so much. I hope things are going well for your mom. Ok, thank you! Been living with this disease for 13+ years with no treatment.  Has not been entirely a walk in the park but best to your aunt. Having a specialist who does nothing but CLL is really quite important. So whatever has to be done to achieve that is key. And it seems being extra cautious with other cancers is huge too. (No smoking, sunscreen, etc) we are very successive to second primary malignancies, up to 36% more than the general population in some studies. I hope hers is as uneventful as mine. Your welcome and yes things are great thank you. I know the feeling of the newly diagnosed, but try to be optimistic because the treatment for CLL in particular has really progressed in the past 5 years and your aunt has some amazing options available to her. I truly believe that we are less than 2 years away from a cure with these combo therapies. Make sure your mother is keeping up with her vaccinations like shingles and pneumonia. Have her load up on EGCG and tumeric, in lab rats they are natural CLL cell killers at a higher dose, it probably will not cure but it will help keep the numbers in line. Exercise is also one of the most proactive things you can do to put you at the best odds for success in your treatment stage. Also, do not settle for a hematologist/oncologist, go and seek a reputable CLL specialist. I really hope this helps a little I am just trying to convey to you what I found helpful from the support group and our specialist. Feel free to reach out anytime. Oh man, that is inspiring to hear. Thank you. Her neck is incredibly swollen so they are looking to start treatment ASAP.

Do I get tested in Nashville and take my records to Moffitt or do I go straight to Moffitt to avoid having to repeat tests. It is a lot to absorb at first. The CLL Society covers everything, but one of their support groups will help you get a grasp of it in time. Go to a CLL expert! General oncologists do not have a grasp of the intricacies of CLL or the latest treatment options. An expert can also get you into clinical trials. I am having success with a treatment that I would not have gotten from my first oncologist...actually I would be in terrible shape now if I had stayed with that doctor. I switched to a CLL expert and that gave me my life back, possibly saved my life. The CLL Society has the list for you to find your CLL expert. You are going to get some more involved tests. I have had 3 bone marrow biopsies (necessary before treatment for sure) and the first one, with the general oncologist, was really unpleasant but the next two, with the CLL expert at a major cancer center, were a breeze.

I just got my CBC results back and lymphocytes shows 48 but doctor said it is normal.\nLooking at your post, did you also have a high lymphocytes reading of 48 on your first lab? I did. Do the lab results have a H next to the result? Hi, it is actually right on the boarder line so it is does not have a High marked. Anything above 48 would be high. Overall I just had a lot of results that are boarderline okay so I am kind of freaked out. Hope you are doing okay and stay healthy! Ok my 48 was a % on a differential diagnosis and it was critically high Sorry but I thought 48% is just at the high limit. Normal range was 22-48 I think.

Hi everyone. I am just looking for some advice, I am UK based and my dad has had CLL for about 15 years roughly.\n\nUsual blood tests were conducted regularly but a few weeks ago he was told his spleen was now enlarged and they wanted him to start treatment.\n\nThe treatment they want him to start is Obinutuzumab &amp; Venetoclax. I am just wondering if anyone has had any experience or these? How were you on them? \n\nHe is 65 always been healthy apart from this, active with work (gardener) so he wants to push it down the road by the way he is talking and from me doing my reading that does not really seem like an option anymore. His spleen being enlarged puts him into the Stage C category and life expectancy seem to max out at 3 years. \n\nWould it be worth being bed bound for 12 months with no social life (he is extremely social) for the sake of a wasted year and a couple max okay ones? \n\nWould there be any questions you would ask the consultant because I am currently writing some down, my mum and dad get dazed in the moment when they are just sitting there having jargon thrown at them. \n\nAny help or advice would be appreciated :) Hi! I live in Germany and I started Venetoclax six weeks ago.\n\nI am surprised your father was offered the option of taking it with the antibody Obinutuzumab. My docs refused to combine Venetoclax with an antibody, because the antibody treatment leaves you immunosuppressed and according to latest findings it also reduces the effectiveness of the Covid-vaccine. They considered it just too risky during the pandemic.\n\nSo I am just taking Venetoclax, without an antibody. This option is said to be very effective too, but the difference is that with the antibody, you take the pills for two years. While without it you take them for an indefinite period of time, basically until they stop working.\n\nRegarding the Venetoclax pills, they are very tolerable, not comparable to chemo at all. So far, I have only felt a little nauseous from time to time, and that was only during the first 2-3 weeks. Really not a big deal, no vomiting or anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Would it be worth being bed bound for 12 months with no social life (he is extremely social) for the sake of a wasted year and a couple max okay ones?\n\nI am not sure I understand what you mean by this. Why bed bound for 12 months? He should not be bed bound with Venetoclax. It is a pill you take once a day. And I do not believe Obinutuzumab will affect him that much either. As far as I know it is one perfusion per month over the course of six months.\n\nRegarding questions for your doc, I would ask about the antibody situation I mentioned above. Is it really safe to get Obinutuzumb during the pandemic?\n\nI hope what I wrote makes sense :-) If not, feel free to ask! Hi thanks for your reply!!\n\nWhen I say bed bound I mean he cannot leave the house due to risk of infection.\n\nHe is a very sociable person along with my mum so I do not think he would want to be sat inside for 12 months \u2018not living\u2019 when he could be out and about. \n\nI think he was offered something I regards to tablets he could take forever (must be like you said until they stop working), but on the medical release form the options they have put down are the ones I have described in my opening post.\n\nThey have put both options down (I do not know whether they are taken at the same time or after one course has finished) so I assume this is their preferred method of treatment.\n\nIn regards to covid I know in the UK he will be having his 3rd vaccine soon due to being on the shielding list. He is had pneumonia before so covid was obviously a great concern!\n\nWould there be any questions that you had wish you would asked your consultant that you never did? Just trueing the scope out options.\n\nThank you for your reply though it made perfect sense! Oh, ok, I see. Well, yes, his immune system will most probably be weakened, but I think there is no telling to what extent and for how long.  Every patient is different. I for example am at high risk because my neutrophils count has dropped since I started Venetoclax, but according to my doc this is not typical. In my case, they were very low to begin with (which is one of the reasons I started therapy).\n\nSo it all depends on your Dad\u2019s current condition and how he responds to the medication. Is he not isolated right now? Is his immune system okay and has he responded to the vaccine? Keep in mind that if he starts Obinutuzumab before getting his 3rd shot, the shot may not be effective.\n\nSo I guess the two options he was offered are the following, right?\n\n* Venetoclax (tablets for two years) + Obinutuzumab (monthly perfusion for six months). Any vaccine he would get within 12 months after Obinutuzumab may be ineffective, and he would probably be isolated for a long time.\n* Venetoclax (tablets until they do not work any more). Depending on his condition his immune system may not be critically affected or stabilize itself after a while.\n\nI cannot think of any questions I wanted to ask...\n\nDo you know ( though? They have several webinars where they answer questions that are truly asked from a patient's perspective. The next one is on Sept 13th. I love how they break down things for you and I have really learned a lot. I highly recommend them!\n\nEDIT: You can also watch past events on their page. I did this exact regime here in the US. I am 56 years old, had an enlarged spleen, yadda yadda yadda. My doc recommended the obinutuzimab for 6 months and venetoclax for a year or two. I traveled to MD Anderson for a second opinion. They have a cll team that helped develop many of the modern treatments currently in use. They agreed with that protocol and said one year of venetoclax is enough. I am coming up on the last month of my treatment and it is been a success. I am in remission and expect to stay this way for many years (back to watch and wait). \n\nI cannot answer about being home bound. I am most certainly not. I mask and take precautions, I am vaccinated (just had third shot), and everyone in my house is vaccinated. Whether or not I have an immune response is unclear. I think I read in this thread somewhere that it was 36 percent of those treated for cll havd no immune response to vaccines. BUT, untreated cll itself is 25% resistant. So I say do the treatment! Be careful with exposure. Go out safely and do not drive yourself crazy. Get vaccinated anyway. Hope for the best case scenario. I wanted to add my side effects in case that helps. We did a slow ramp up on the obinutuzimab to avoid tumor lysis syndrome at the recommendation of MD Anderson because my wbc was crazy high like 350k. So for my first infusion it was spread out over 3 days. The first day I threw up during the infusion. The next couple of days they gave me anti nausea stuff in the iv which helped. I was dead tired for about a week after those first three infusions. The rest went very smoothly. Just tired the day after bug not like the first. \n\nThe venetoclax has been easy peasy. Personally I have had some annoying diarrhea with it, but that is just my sensitive guts probably. No other side effects other than having to take four giant horse pills every day.", "Dr. Fakhri on Selecting the Optimal Treatment in CLL ", "Second Hematologic Malignancy Deemed a \u201cRare\u201d Event in CLL - Cancer Therapy Advisor ", "Chemo-Sparing Tx Doubles Response in Medically Fit CLL ", "Safety Profile of Obinutuzumab for CLL Confirmed in Final Analysis of GREEN Study - Cancer Therapy Advisor ", "Acalabrutinib Monotherapy Safe, Significantly Improves PFS in Relapsed/Refractory CLL ", "How Social Distancing Helped Create a Sense of Community Among Some Patients with CLL ", "Real-World Treatment Patterns, Adverse Events, and Health Care Costs for Patients With CLL - Cancer Therapy Advisor ", "New cancer treatment method cuts time from hours to minutes ", "100% ORR in Frontline CLL/SLL Seen With High-Frequency Low-Dose Acalabrutinib/Rituximab Combo ", "Acalabrutinib Demonstrates Activity in Frontline CLL ", "Leukemia Rates Falling, but AML, CLL Are Exceptions ", "Venetoclax for CLL After Progression on 1 Prior Therapy ", "Gene mutations linked with death from infection in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ", "CAR-T Cell Therapy Liso-Cel Deemed Safe and Active in CLL and SLL - Cancer Therapy Advisor ", "93% of cancer patients respond to souped-up immune cells ", "Conditioning Chemotherapy Preceding CAR T-Cell Therapy Appears to Be Safe in Relapsed/Refractory CLL - Hematology Advisor ", "Dr. Mato Discusses the Safety and Efficacy of Umbralisib in CLL ", "Cost Analysis of Biosimilar vs Reference Rituximab for Treating CLL and Other Diseases ", "Zanubrutinib-Gazyva Leads to Strong Responses in CLL ", "ASCO: AstraZeneca details Calquence's heart safety edge over Imbruvica as both brace for BeiGene's rival Brukinsa ", "T Cell Therapy Shows Persistent Benefits in Young Leukemia Patients ", "Ibrutinib Plus Venetoclax in Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia: The CLARITY Study ", "CLL at ASH 2020: The CAPTIVATE trial \u2014 Episode one ", "Acalabrutinib Effective, Safe for Patients With CLL Who Are Intolerant to Ibrutinib ", "Undetectable MRD Status Associated With Long-Term Survival in CLL ", "Dr. Eradat on the CAPTIVATE Trial in CLL ", "CAR-T Cell Therapy Side Effects: Know What to Look Out For ", "\"Potentially Curative\" New Drug Could Help Thousands Of People With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia | SurvivorNet ", "What is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia?

My mom was diagnosed with CLL last week. Her white cell count is 25,600. All the other counts are normal. When I asked the doctor on what to do next, he basically prescribed a few multivitamin and nothing else. He said wait and watch. \n\nWhat confused me was that, he explained that there is a test to detect the level of risk of CLL. He advised not to get it done. His logic being whatever the outcome of test, treatment would only be started once symptoms are visible, so there is no need to get the risk test done yet.\n\nThe above does not feel right. Can anyone suggest if this is ok ?\n\nAlso, what are the lifestyle changes that my mom may need to make and what are the things to watch out for.\n\nMany thanks. I would suggest the genetic test right away as some patients (~10%) are at higher risk and need to start treatment right away, especially if you are not seeing the doctor every month to monitor condition. For the majority of folks with CLL they wait about 2-3 years before their first treatment. Any treatment comes with side effects and if your mom have no symptoms you are better off waiting. This is fairly unique to CLL. \n\nSome things your mom should do is maintain her weight w/good diet and exercise and avoid social isolation if possible. Take it one day at a time CLL is a long battle Thanks for replying. The doctor has suggested monthly visits first. Given that should I still insist on the genetic test ? If she is getting seen once a month, I can see why the doctor is not concerned about the test. If further treatment is going to be needed, is going to be because of her lab #s and not the test. My dad was diagnosed in early 2018 and he just started to need treatment starting in June of this year. Before that is was just visits either every 3 or 6 months. 25,000 is fairy low for CLL, some patients can go as high as 200k or more so it seems she is in the early stages. Anemia is very common with this cancer so make sure she starts eating healthy, different color vegetables and non process foods are the best. The most important thing you can do is see a CLL expert. Visit the CLL Society website. (cllsociety.org) They have a list of experts in all states, plus support groups which you can now join from anywhere on zoom. They even have a free service where you can consult an expert for several minutes. But you will need some tests for them to interpret: Flow Cytometry and FISH being the commonly done tests to diagnose and define CLL. Bone Marrow biopsy might also be done, but some doctors only do it if treatment is indicated (easy if you get knocked out, takes some personal fortitude to have it done with just a local.) The second most important thing to do is maintain overall good health: sleep, destress, healthy eating, exercise, reduce toxic exposures, have a good social network. CLL is often a \"watch and wait\" situation but the experience is definitely more like \"watch and worry\". Try not to worry! I am an otherwise healthy CLL patient just wrapping up successful treatment. I have loads of tests done, information is important but a doctor who knows what the tests imply is crucial! My first doctor at Kaiser looked at my genetic markers which were favorable and my overall health which was good. But the bone marrow biopsy told a different story that they did not interpret correctly. I was really compromised in insidious ways by my CLL (and we are all very different patients) and when I switched to an expert and started treatment, I really was saved from some organ damage and physical decline. Unusual situation. Many CLL patients never need treatment. My treatment has been easy on me, but I have had to do it for a long time. I am seen at the City of Hope, in Duarte, California. Diagnosed 2017, symptoms 2018, treatment 2019 and 2020. Hi, 54yo here. Have her get seen by a CLL specialist. Its never too early to have the Symetry and FSH panel done. I have been diagnosed since 2018. Also on the W/W. Recent WBC is at 40,000+. No treatment since the only thing I am experiencing has been night sweats (not to frequent) and exhaustion. Basically always tired. Also have Hypertension, Cholesterorol,so on meds for all that and they dont help with exhaustion. Last year I had 2 pneumonias and a staph infection, so I was hosptalized for all 3 for a couple days each time. Main thing i can advise you to do is to make sure she doesnt get ill with a cold, flu etc. Any kind of infection is not a CLL patients friend in any way. Not to mention this evil thing Covid-19. This CLL is a bothersome pain in the buttocks, and it will be for a long time. Main thing to do is see a CLL Specialist and go from there. Def. get any and all tests they reccomend. Bottom line is to Watch and Wait not wait and worry. She will be OK. As others have mentioned I would see a CLL specialist. These tests will determine risk based on genetic markers. I am 31 with CLL and a WBC of 300,000. My only other symptoms at this time are enlarged lymph nodes. I see a local doctor regularly and also just saw a specialist at Moffit Cancer Center in Tampa, FL. One thing to note, cells can mutate and your genetic markers can change over time. I have had the tests suggested by other people here twice now. I have not had to have any treatment yet. They estimate that it will be another 6-12 months before treatment is needed based on my labs. But it could be longer. Everyone is different. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.  300,000 sounds insane. \n\nI was diagnosed five years ago and only recently got to around 60,000. Now my doctor is talking about genetic testing to determine the best treatment.\n\nGood luck with this! Thanks, you too. I was at 100,000 when first diagnosed 04/2018. Thanks for your response and time Thanks for your response and time. Flow cytometry was done confirming the CLL. The doctor has told not to get the FISH done and see him monthly at start. Thanks for your reply and time. Covid really scares me for her. Thanks for your time. I will remember and message you as we go along. The best thing to do is to educate myself and that education would come most easily from the people themselves.\n\nAlso people keep saying CLL specialist. We went to Haemetologist Oncologist. Is there someone else we should be seeing ? My local doc is a hematologist oncologist. She did the testing right off the bat. You really kneed to do it to know 100% that it is CLL and to know your risks. She has been great. That being said, she treats many things. I recently went to someone who specializes in CLL. They basically confirmed everything my local doc told me including the recommended treatment for me. It was nice to get that reassurance. I continue to see my local doc and plan to get treated by her. I also recently found out how CLL interacts with pneumonia. Had two different pneumonia vaccinations too. CLL specialist. I live in India. Would have to check if they exist here. I have been on the \"wait and watch\" for over three years.  My Dr has explained the pros of my opting to wait and watch.   Watch for fatigue, night sweats etc ...\nTreatment for bloodborne cancers are improving every day.   Waiting to become symptomatic before i opt for treatment will give me the latest and greatest treatment available.

No clue. You could try ask an expert on the CLL society website. Great idea! Thanks! As a patient who has recieved rituximab, here is what I have gathered when wondering why they were not going straight for the obinutuzumab in my case.\n\nRituximab is a little older but works great for most cd20 positive use cases, and it is cheaper.  Most insurance readily covers it.  Non-NCCN cancer centers who practice standard of care vs state of the art will tend to favor the older, well-proven meds like Rituximab.\n\nObinutuzumab works better in cases where prior rituxan administration broke off a chunk of the cd20 protein like a snapped hair, leaving cd20 stubble behind on an essentially immortal cell.   It also does better with clefted cells where the cd20 is tucked / hiding in the cleft.  \n\nThe side effects of Rituxian are well understood including how to identify and counteract them.   I do not know about obinutuzumab in they regard.  In my case, I needed 2 shots of medrol to throttle how fast it was working. \n\nEven in cases where cd20 expression is lower, or where spontaneous mutations have occurred, both have been proven to be beneficial because they can cause upregulation of additional communication paths to trigger cell self-destruct messages.\n\nI will echo the CLL society recommendation.  Mr. Koffman and his team are good people, on the cutting edge. I think of Obinutuzumab as the 2nd generation of Retuximab. Not like it is clearly better, but it is the next step in Roche's monoclonal antibody line targeting CD20.

It is present in the lymph nodes, blood, spleen, and bone marrow at a minimum.  It can also move into the liver, skin, and mucous membranes.\n\nRadiation therapy can be very helpful to shrink an enlarged spleen or swollen lymph nodes and relieve certain symptoms, but it is never used to induce remission.\n\nThis article should be removed for being factually untrue.

This has been progressing for the better part of a year and I have had CBC done which have been relatively normal so getting the hematologist/oncologist to do more investigating is like pulling teeth Sounds familiar  ....   i was diagnosed 4 yrs ago with CLL.  Started with the lymph nodes.  Did the whole routine.  They might be clogged\n  Then maybe an infection. Take antibiotics for a few weeks.  Go see an ear nose throat dr.  Get a ct scan.  Get an mri.  Get an ultrasound.  Go get a biopsy.   \nBingo !!   You have lymphoma.   \nBut, stay calm.  Im into year 4 and still on a wait and see program.   \nAdvances in bloodborne cancers is jumping leaps and bounds.   Yes, it stinks the insurance companies dictate treatment.  \nGet second opinion.  Listen to your oncologist.  Ask questions.  Stay off the internet.   Ask your oncologist what sites he recommends to get informed.   (Read that last paragraph..  its important!!!  )\nWish you all the best  !!  Stay chill.  Ask dr questions.  There is no stupid question  !!!! How long did you have symptoms if you do not mind me asking? My first symptom was my lymph nodes swollen.  Thought first i was getting sick.  That was August of 2017.   By the time i went through a battery of tests and scans, ending with needle biopsies, my diagnosis was confirmed on October 11th of 2017.   At my first oncologist appointment, i was given 3 options of treatment.   6 months of chemo, a daily pill that i would remain on and third, wait and see how fast it would advance.   I decided to wait and see.   It will be 4 years this October. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a    i see my oncologist every 3-4 months and have blood drawn.  Besides having swelling in my neck lymph nodes, i feel fine.   Symptoms i look for are night sweats, lack of energy and loss of weight.   This is not a death sentence for me.   It is a big mental hurdle to get over to have a cancer and do nothing, but its actually my best option.  Given every medication has a window of effectiveness, the farther i can push any medication out, better the chance something even better than current medications may be discovered.    \nStay positive.  Eat a balanced diet.   Exercise.  Stay off the internet. I have been climbing to the top of mountains for the past year trying to figure out what is wrong with me the thing I am most afraid of is that it is already too late as I have many symptoms. I try to stay off google as much as I can but not knowing has taken a huge toll on me mentally ITS NEVER TOO LATE !!!!!!\nRemember, you are not a doctor.   Let the professionals do a diagnosis.   Stay chill.  A blood borne cancer, if that is what you have, is not a death sentence.   Every ache and pain you have may not be related.   Ive got plenty of aches and pains.  None are related to my cll.
