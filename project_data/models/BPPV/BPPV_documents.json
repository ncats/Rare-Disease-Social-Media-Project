["Hi I am new to this\u2026I need help This started 2 days ago. Called an ontology doc and he did the maneuver. And said I have to keep head straight for 48 hours. \n\nI am on hour 31 and I have had my back almost straight and my head straight all this time.\nMy back, neck, shoulders are killing me. Plus I am getting light headed. \nIs this crazy instruction correct??? I do not question doctors but come on!!! This is barbaric torture. \nAm I at least cured after this??!!! \nHelp. So the whole having to stay upright after the epley maneuver is old and outdated information. Recent studies have shown that it does not make a difference in outcome. This is what my vestibular PT told me and she is someone who is very knowledgeable on the subject. Even found the studies she referred to on google. \n\nI would stop torturing yourself and go back to normal movement. I put in a valiant effort. 31 hours with no recline. I am going to stop here and get rest. That is quite impressive. Enjoy your well deserved rest!! Thanks. I managed another hour. Lol. I am in pain but I am scared to lie down now \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I have found sleeping with a few pillows under my head and shoulders seems to help me for 2 or 3 nights after the maneuver.  I also do not lay on the side that was the problem.  I have read the research but have had my bppv recur in a coupke days if I do not do this before.  Could just be chance, who knows.  I have never heard of anyone staying fully upright, just the inclined head when sleeping. Never heard of this.. I am so new to this. My doc told me to keep head straight but I am now reading online that the treatment is outdated. I am with /u/ovansan : You do not need to keep your head straight, but you should be very aware of your movements and positions. Do not bend over or whip your head to one side quickly. Do not sleep on your \"bad\" side for a while. After a bad episode I usually sleep on the couch semi up-right and wedged in so I cannot really move my head.\n\nSorry you are experiencing it. I know exactly what you are going through. As many have said the positioning after the maneuver is not important. The most important thing is how do you feel? Do you have residual dizziness? Have you triggered any vertigo with movements?", "Do flights bring BPPV symptoms back? Hey fellows,\n\nI had my first BPPV episode on last July (around 10 months ago). Visited a lot of doctors and did many tests, and turned out it was BPPV on my right side. Had a few more more vertigo episodes (while laying down) and also some lingering dizziness between July and January \n\nSince Jan, I started to feel better because of my vestibular therapy sessions and also because of using a high pillow and not laying on my right side ever again. Since Jan, I had no more vertigo episodes, and almost no more dizziness, except some small lightheadedness episodes that lasted a few minutes during some random days. \n\nI have a pretty long (13-hour) international flight in two weeks, and I am super scared and worried that the vertigo and lightheadedness might come back during the flight. Any experiences or suggestions? I would appreciate anything. Thanks. I have flown several times without issue. I would also look into taking Vitamin D, and an allergy pill, if you do not already! I think it varies by person. I take a bunch of valium with me that always comes in handy in case something gets triggered. Also, Meclizine helps in case you get nauseous. Have a back up plan and explore slowly. Most likely you might be fine since it is been a while back. But if you feel dizzy pop those pills to be safe. All the best! My most recent BPPV  was triggered on a flight - but not because of ear pressure or anything- it was from looking down for long periods (reading a book or watching TV on my phone) and then suddenly looking up when someone walked by. The jerking head motion is what did it in for me. Thanks. Yeah I take daily vitamin d (2000UI) pills, and will continue doing so. Have not taken allergy pills, but thanks for your response. Thanks, yeah I was using Dramamine a few months ago, but I stopped taking them because I was feeling better. But yeah, I will bring my Dramamine pills with me. Thanks. Thanks for the tip. I will prevent quick head motions.", "BPPV cured but still \u201cspinning\u201d in my dreams... Hi there, so I was diagnosed with BPPV about two weeks ago after a week of vertigo.  After one session of PT, the vertigo stopped but I continued to feel \u201coff\u201d and feel like the room was waving or off-balance.  This resolved within a few days with one notable exception.  Every night, at some point, I dream that I am spinning.  Sometimes I just spin and that is it.  On New Year\u2019s eve, I dreamed that the fireworks made me spin.\n\nLast night, I dreamed that the spinning cane back and I was doing the maneuvers over and over, falling asleep in between, trying to make the spinning stop.  \n\nEvery time, I wake up very disoriented and unclear as to whether or not I am spinning.  Once I fully wake up, I realize that I am okay, but I have to test every sleeping/head position before I can relax again.\n\nNote: I have become very anxious and depressed about this coming back.  Does this sound like I am having some kind of panic attack in my sleep or could it be something else? I think that many people who get BPPV suffer from  PTSD afterwards. BPPV is scary as hell, particularly before you have any clue of what is happening. And the spinning can be very violent. I think you are having a kind of depression or panic attack about it coming back. The bad news is that it can come back. The good news is that now you know what it is, and if you get it, you know exactly what steps to take and that it will probably clear right up just as it did the last time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour anxiety may resolve in time. But if it does not, you might want to see a psychologist about it. I have dreams with vertigo here as well. You are not alone :( I was the same for a few months. Sometimes I close my eyes to fall asleep and it feels like I am spinning again. But I open my eyes and nothing is happening. Try relaxation techniques to calm yourself. \nYou are not alone and it gets better. I do not get them as often anymore.  Well, I am sorry you deal with it too, but I am glad I am not the only one.\ud83d\ude22\ud83e\udd17 It is so bizarre and unsettling.  See, this is where the Valium actually helps.  It did not help with the real vertigo, but it does help with these night time panic attacks.  Unfortunately, I only have a few more pills left and have been using them sparingly. Thanks for the response.  This might be PTSD as you said.  Yes, my PT said my vertigo was one of the most severe she had ever seen.  I do feel somewhat better that I know what to do next time, but I have a lot of worries of what will happen if this does end up being frequent for me.  Will I be able to to work?  Will I have to go on disability?  How will I care for my children, etc?\n\nIt seems like a lot of people experience this for a while after an attack, so maybe it will settle down.  I will definitely talk to someone if it does not calm down in the next few weeks. Having your whole world spinning, floor rocking, cannot focus on anything, nauseau, etc..... Is friggin TERRIFIYING. I have had episodes my whole life,and they are INTENSE...but only for two to five minutes after waking on random days, usually once a month. So not a constant thing by any means, and I still FREAK when I feel it might be coming on, or if I have had more than normal. Allow yourself to be freaked awhile and seek extrA support and be extra kind to yourself...it is normal and will pass in time . Thanks.  Yes, I have had episodes my whole life as well.  Usually, it is a couple of hours in the night and then I am fine in the morning.  This was nearly 10 days of vertigo (although I was improving after about day 6-7 when I had my first treatment).  I also have vestibular migraines, which cause a different kind of vertigo.  It was terrifying.  I will just allow myself to be scared for now, but talk to someone if the panic continues for more than a few weeks.\ud83e\udd17 Did you find out what caused the BPPV? Your story is very similar to mine and I have ruled out inner ear issues and neurological (through an MRI). I believe it is neck/tension related...but I cannot afford to keep going from appt to appt... Interesting.  You say they ruled out inner ear.  Does that mean you had a negative dix-halpike test and/or did not respond to the Epley maneuver?\n\nIn my case, again, I have struggled with different sorts of vertigo (vestibular migraines that occur when running and basilar migraines), also extreme motion sickness, my whole life.  This particular case, definitely seemed to be the ear crystal thing since it responded to the Epley maneuver, but I do not know for sure what caused it.  My theory is that it was the two airplane flights I took a week before.\n\nI flew out to see my Grandmother on 12/13.  That night I had 8 hours of vertigo, but I seemed okay a couple of hours after getting up and was fine the following night.  I flew home on 12/15 and also wore my brother\u2019s noise cancelling headphones on the plane.  The rest of the day and the next, I felt like I could not hear out of one ear.  The never ending vertigo started on Friday, 12/21, so a few days later.\n\nI already had a migraine before I got on the plane and maybe already had a little something, but I think the airplane flights might have been what pushed me over the edge.\n\nIf it is the airplane flights, I hope that means this will not come back... So I took a Valium last night and, no spinning in my dreams.  I guess that confirms what I already knew that it is not true spinning (meds never touched that), but anxiety.\nI still do not want to rely on meds too much, so I think I will limit myself to just taking a Valium the night before lifting days, so that I am rested.  Once I am having good nights on the other nights, I will stop taking it completely.\n\nI appreciate the support I have received here so much.  It feels so good to know I am not alone in this.\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f Granted, I do not know exactly how your specific experience has been, but have had BPPV episodes on and off for 12 years now. So based on that:\n\n\n&gt;Will I be able to to work?\n\nYes\n\n&gt;Will I have to go on disability?\n\nNo (for true BPPV, I do not think you could anyway)\n\n&gt;How will I care for my children, etc?\n\nNormally, just with perhaps some modifications depending on what triggers the movements. For instance instead of looking up, I stand further back from where I need to look up at so I am not having to to my head so far back.  Interesting.  I am actually doing pretty good right now, starting to sleep a little better.  I am hoping that it was the airplane that triggered this, so this maybe will not be a common occurrence.\nI was completely debilitated during those 10 days though.  I could not move without vomiting and had to have my parents come stay to help with the kids (all three of my children have disabilities).\n\nIt sounds like regular BPPV is not normally that intense.  I have migraines on top of that and had a severe migraine during the whole time as well, which may have made it worse.\n\nI am so sorry you have had to deal with this for 12 years.  How often do you get attack\u2019s and how long do they last?  I have had vertigo attack\u2019s before, but never anything that lasted more than a few hours at night.  I was always fine the next morning.  I have no idea if those episodes were even the same thing; this was so much more intense.\n\nDo you do the maneuvers on yourself or do you have to go to physical therapy every time you have an episode?  Last night I literally had a dream I had an episode &amp; I woke up so disoriented this morning I have felt nauseous all day.. it is seriously the worst.  They are so scary, are not they?  I am actually doing better with the dreams.  I had them every night for the first week after I stopped having true vertigo, then it went down to a few times a week, now maybe once a week, I will have a dream.  I have been really challenging myself to put myself in positions that might have triggered vertigo (yoga, bench press, Pilates, etc).  The more I do them, the more confident I get in my ability to do them and the less anxiety I get in general. I am two weeks to the day from my first bppv-upon-waking experience, and in the last 14 days I have thought a lot about this feeling and realized that for maybe six months, maybe a year, I have been having dizzy spells as I sleep, or drift between being awake and asleep. I chalked it up when it happened to exhaustion, because I frequently sleep very poorly for days on end and often feel totally spaced out. Now I believe that as I was sleeping, I leaned my head to the right, which is my bad side, while lying on my back, which is how I habitually sleep. I think that if you know which side is your bad one, you can alleviate symptoms by sleeping on your other side.", "27 y/o M. Need help please. Continuous vertigo for 6 straight days. Could it be benign positional vertigo? So on day 1 I woke up feeling very dizzy like the room was spinning. I ignored it but the dizziness got worse until I was extremely nauseous. I then proceeded to vomit multiple times per hour for 24 hours straight. Day 2 I was still extremely dizzy (room spinning) but I only vomited twice. I could walk if I moved slowly but the dizziness continued. I went to an immediate care where I was told it might be benign positional vertigo. I was prescribed meclizine and sent on my way. \n\nThe next day (day 3) the room was still spinning and with no sign of improvement after three doses of meclizine so I went to a different hospital Urgent Care where I was given fluid/ativan/epley maneuver with no relief. I was told this is likely bpv and advised that it might take a few days to clear up. ON day 5 I developed tinnitus in my right ear. It is not extreme but it is hard to ignore in a quiet room. This is day 6 and the room spinning sensation has been continuous. It is made worse by changing position and by moving my head. I just want to see if my symptoms are in line with what others have experience that have been diagnosed with BPPV. Any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. If you are completely still and still feeling dizzy it is not BPPV. Your symptoms sound more in line with a neuritis (inflammation of the vestibular nerve) or a labrynrhitis (do you have any hearing loss as well as the tinnitus?) For most people their symptoms resolve within 6 weeks, though some do not. You can see a vestibular therapist who can do an assessment and give you exercises to help. Try not to avoid moving too much as long as you do not feel too yuck- even doing bits of walking is good. do not take any motion sickness medication (bonine) for more than (two days? i dont remember) because it interferes with signal from ear to brain and your brain will need to recalibrate, causing continued dizziness. yes I feel dizzy even when completely still. Reading and focusing on things is challenging. I have no hearing loss. I will ask the doctor about some of these other conditions the next time that I go. It does not sound like BPPV, I found this link that describes a few conditions that sounds more like what you have going on. ", "Advice? A few weeks ago I had my second bppv episode and it came with veritigo. I went to a balance center they put me in the epley maneuver gave me a few exercises and sent me on my way. All of this really help me and I feel 100 percent normal again. I have been doing my exercises like my paper said, not skipping or missing a day. BUT when I lie flat, (no elevation no pillows, nothing) I cannot turn my head, in either directions, without getting super dizzy and the room spinning. However I am never in this position. I sleep with 2 or more pillows that slightly elevate my head ever since my first episode of bppv. It does not effect my everyday life at all. And like I said, other than being in that position, I feel perfectly good. Should I go back and bring to the balance center and bring this up to them? Or should I just wait this out? I know with bppv can eventually sort itself out. What should I do? Call your doctor/therapist and ask. Yes, I think you should let them know. Despite you never being in this position, if they tried to trigger your BPPV, they could. see an ENT or Vestibular therapist and they will watch your eyes as you get dizzy and make a diagnosis. Sounds like they should do the roll test. U MAY have lateral canal BPPV. Again this is not a diagnosis. They will see the eye movement direction and treat you. A good ENT will test you themselves. Funny thing about that. My eyes do not twitch when I experience bppv. They said it makes it harder but it is more than likely cause of my young age Same here. I am going back for a follow up tomorrow. I am hoping they can figure something out. I only experience a weird feeling when my head is moving, not when my head is stationary like when they are doing the Dix-Hallpike test. Good luck with you test tomorrow! I have decided to call and make an appointment for hopefully sometime this week That is good. Try and make as many notes as you can going into the appointment about what motions bug you and what problems you are having. I have been making a bunch of notes since my first appointment as to what gives me motion sickness and what does not to help them narrow it down.", "So I think I have bppv... Sorry for the long post... \nYesterday i woke up then rolled in my bed to change position then everything started spinning around,at the beginning I did not mind it,but i rolled multiple times and had the exact same thing happened,the when I finally woke up sit on my bed and I felt this weird sensation,I felt weak and dizzy with very slightly nausea trough the course of the day I started feeling \"better\" I was finally able to stand up but I felt lightheaded and weird,today was the same except I DO NOT really feel nausea,I still feel very dizzy in moments and when I walk I feel like I am moving like when you are drunk,the day before it all started I had a weird pain in the chest when I did a sudden movement then the pain lasted for some hours and it was triggered by movement,days before all this I was picking my ear because it felt obstructed,I hurt myself a little while doing this,this past Tuesday I was having a lot of anxiety for other reasons and I was feeling my head weird like pressured and my eyes were feeling off (idk how to explain the sensation)\nNow Idk what to do...I live on a small town and I really doubt there is any specialist I could consult,any comment would be appreciated,thanks to anyone that dares to read my fucking long Bible. Try to see an ENT (Ears Nose Throat) Specialist! It sounds like BPPV because it mostly has to do with positioning (not a medical doctor). I am on day 23 of struggling with my inner ear infection, so the vertigo (visual spinning)feeling i get daily. But with bppv you can see an ent and 85% you can get your symptoms treated with a maneuver, even Physical Therapists can do them!! Sorry about what you are going through ugh this is just so horrible right?,I will definitely find professional help but since I have no way of doing this in the next few days I guess I have to wait a little :/\nthank you Also YOURE NOT ALONE. first days struggling with what i had, i was in fear and anxious, i know its easier said then done, but this too shall pass! Reading the multiple experiences in this sub and your comment definitely makes me feel less alone in this shitty situation,so again thank you very much &lt;3 Heyo im always here to try and help!! Anytime if you are feeling suckier then the day before I would also be here to try. Just remember try and physical therapist or an ENT or you can tell your primary doctor to try a DIX - HALLPIKE TEST and from that test you they would be able to tell IF you have vertigo and possibly treat it, or if you want to try and do it yourself. PLEASE IF POSSIBLE DO WITH SOMEONE because i know it can make you super dizzy. On youtube they also try and explain how to do the test and the maneuver! just search up Epley Maneuver at Home meant to say BPPV instead of vertigo! Sorry I will try to see an specialist when I get the chance,also i already tried the maneuver and helped me just a little\nanyway I hope you can also recover from your problem :( thank you very much for your words KEEP ME UPDATED. ik im a stranger but I would love to hear about your progression", "Maneuver depending on BPPV type? I can to understand there are several canals that could be source of the problem. Is there a way to find which one is involved and adapt the maneuver?", "Residual dizziness question Hi everyone. I had BPPV a week and a half ago (last Sunday) and when I lay flat on my back after about 10 seconds my face (mainly under my eyes in my sinuses) starts to feel funny and I feel dizzy but the world is not spinning at all. Is this just residual dizziness and anxiety from my last attack? It is almost like the change in position causes my body to hit panic mode and makes me think I am dizzy. Also it is annoying when I am trying to go to sleep because it keeps waking me up because paranoid.\n\nThoughts? Anyone else have this? I also forgot to mention I work at a desk job so I stare at a screen almost all day. The dizziness feeling is definitely worse after work. Not really at all when I first wake up. I have been having exactly this on and off for a few nights but I have not had a full on dizziness attack in about a week. I came to this subreddit to actually look and see if anyone had recommended pillows for this issue! You could try sleeping with two pillows and be more raised while sleeping, that is all I have found lately to help me without taking medications I think staring at a screen all day definitely affects things. I had bppv two weeks ago and still struggling with what you describe but to a lesser extent now but it is clearing very slowly. Still when I stare at a computer for any length of time I still feel a bit off, but it will clear up eventually. 2 things\n\n1) when you experience BPPV and anxiety you will find that your body will naturally find sensations that will \u201cfeel not quite right\u201d which in turn will cause more anxiety. If you do not know how to handle the anxiety ie to use the DARE response then you will develop quite quickly a trigger that will help your brain keep the residual aftermath of BPPV causing a cycle of paranoia. If you leave this for too long your brain through neuroplasticity will make this your new normal and it can become quite a problem. \n\n2) see a PT and start balance rehab. As above, once your brain learns this new norm you will develop anxiety with a dash of balance disorder ie you do not have BPPV but as you move a particular way your brain / neurons have learnt that it should generate that horrible dizzy / off balance / rocking feeling which then feeds anxiety / panic again. \n\nIt truly is a horrible cycle and one that you can read over and over and over in this sub.\n\nIf you are new to BPPV and anxiety I would suggest you jump on to a good PT and start working on balance exercises. \n\nI would also Google PPPD; While it is used to describe someone with chronic / long lasting dizziness it is a great resource for treating what it sounds like you have before it develops into PPPD. -  Unless you experience vertigo with nystagmus you do not have BBPV. \n\nThere are so many things that can trigger vertigo, dizziness, that off feeling, etc that I have found people look for answers and latch on to BPPV hoping a quick rotation on the bed ie the Epley move will solve all when it can only help the mechanical issue of rocks / crystals / whatever you want to call them from your posterior canal.\n\nHaving had BPPV a handful of times and dealing with anxiety with dizziness for 7 years I have experienced it all... what I have found as a key trigger for dizziness for me was posture related and to your question on pillows, I have found huge relief by changing my pillow and becoming a back sleeper. This simple change improved my neck support where I remember initially thinking... wow I feel so up right, I cannot sleep like this!!! However after a few months I was blown away by how my neck, shoulders, etc felt and how the tension through my body eased and surprisingly the dizziness settled. I do have nystagmus with it &amp; my doctor suggested this is what I am dealing with Over the years I have seen a number of doctors and ENTs, all of which were very unhelpful. \n\nNow that you have a BPPV diagnoses I would suggest seeing a PT that specialises in vestibular disorders. They will help move the crystal(s) and then help with balance rehab. \n\nRoad to recovery differs for everyone but you will find in this sub most people are left with residual dizziness which a PT will help you with. So basically anxiety of the BPPV coming back triggers that response? That is annoying. I had BPPV three years ago and fixed with Epley. Then I had it twice in a week a couple weeks ago. On opposite ears. Agitating much? Force myself to lay in provoking positions? It is only BPPV when I sleep and I have never had it happen elsewhere 100% triggers the response. \n\nDARE works for me - \n\nMindfulness works also. \n\nIt was only once I could understand what my body was doing, why it was doing it while also doing balance exercises with my PT that I could move forward with my life. Thank you for the insight. I will work on pushing the limit with the weird feeling. What a stupid disorder. BPPV is dumb. Maybe someday they will figure out a cure. On the positive sides I can fix it with Epley pretty quick! I am going to continue living my life. Running. Roller coasters. Snowboarding. I will not change my life because this crap. Why live in fear? During my last episode of BPPV (it was my 4th in the past 3 years) - I was able to continue with my daily very active life. The BPPV was active for over 2 months and I was seeing a vestibular therapist weekly to help with the Epley and to give me other exercises to do at home. And although each and every day was a nasty struggle, I never missed work. I continued to run/train, snowmobiled, ran my dog in agility and did all hobbies and daily tasks. My therapist was amazed that I could do it all - but also said it was the quickest way to get my body back to normal. On the flip side, I had BPPV for so long, my body also adapted to being off balance, therefore it took me way longer to recover. Best wishes to you! I am glad you are able to continue with life as well. Hopefully that helps you recover quicker. Also - after my BPPV was resolved, I still felt like crap. Possibly PPPD. Or residual dizziness. I made my therapist continue to test all 6 ear canals weekly, as I almost felt worse than when I had BPPV (but in a different way - I no longer had the brief violent vertigo with nystagmus, but rather a swaying, woozy dizziness).  It is been a bit over a year now since my last episode, and I still get random mild dizziness.", "Scared and confused? (Vertical nystagmus?) So I have a history of migraines but they have recently resolved and now I am only left with weird, quick headaches every few days (knock on wood that it stays that way). However, I went to see my neuro for a new onset of vertigo and tinnitus, that now occurred with or without headaches. \n\nHe performed the Dix-Halpike test on me in the office and said I rang true for BPPV so he sent me to a vertigo/head trauma specialist to have the Epley maneuver performed. \n\nButttttt\u2026 when I went to the head trauma specialist, she did another test on me and although I presented with weak positional, upbeat nystagmus through the goggles, she said she did not think that I had BPPV based on my description of my symptoms (I was super new to vertigo at the time and did not really know what I was experiencing). She did say, however, that she was not worried at all. \n\nI called my neuro back and told him that I was concerned and confused and he said that he did not see upbeat but saw tell-tale signs of BPPV and to perform the Epley from home until I can get an appointment with him again. But I will be honest, I am still freaking out. \n\nI had 5deg upbeat positional nystagmus on both sides on the Dix-Halpike test with the trauma specialist who used the goggles, so I do not even know how to go about treating this with the Epley maneuver. I have been freaking myself out by googling things and some say that vertical is BAD but others say that vertical nystagmus can be just as common with BPPV, too. \n\nThis is so new to me and I am trying to stay optimistic and not worry, but I am supposed to be moving to another country soon and I cannot decide if it is best to push for more answers or tests or if I really could have BPPV? I really appreciate any answers in advance. It is not going to hurt to do the epley. Just look up how to figure out which ear and go from there. \n\nI had BPPV for months after a TBI and never knew it because I never once got vertigo, never tested positive for nystagmus. But the epley helped me once someone put two and two together. It works every time. \n\nIt comes back every now and then- and now I do get vertigo. Cannot function. I actually got it this morning, did the epley twice and went on to work. \n\nGive it a try and see what happens. Or go see a vestibular therapist. I was diagnosed and treated at a physical therapy office\u2026 Are you getting the vertigo when your head goes straight back without turning it side to side ?", "When will BPPV go? I *think* I have BPPV. \n\nThis all began on the Wednesday 4th December 2019 when I woke up and got out of bed and I remember feeling a crazy off-balance spinning sensation. Went to college and I could not even look at my work because every slight head movement would cause me to feel as though I am spinning. I was ok whilst my head was level. \n\nThe next day (Thursday) I went to the doctors and he told me he thinks it is labyrinthitis and gave me some anti-sickness meds as the spinning made me feel sick. The same day, in the evening I began to come down with cold-like symptoms which lasted from about 24 hours. Then on Saturday I was throwing up but I do not know whether this is to do with the dizziness. \n\nBy Monday, my symptoms were virtually gone and I was completely clear of it for about 2 weeks. Then two weeks later, I wake up and get out of bed and everything is spinning again. It was not as bad as last time and I did not feel sick either. \n\nUntil now, I still have the dizziness when I get into and out of bed and sometimes when I turn my head. When I lie my head back hanging down the end of the bed, I get so dizzy and cannot stand up without feeling like I am going to fall. I am almost on week 7 of this and it is not getting a ton better, the only improvement over 7 whole weeks is that I do not feel as dizzy when turning my head. \n\nDoes anybody have any experience or any idea how long this will last? Look up Brandt-Daroff exercises on YouTube and do them 5x each side 5x a day. The crystals are obviously having a hard time getting someplace they cannot bother you. I would recommend finding a PT that specializes in Vestibular rehabilitation or a balance center. There are videos online that show you how to do the Epley and other repositioning exercises, but I found that it was extremely difficult to do them on my own correctly. But that may just be my personal experience. I initially had a ENT give me a \u201cprint out\u201d of instructions and did not bother to show me how to do it so all I did was spin them crystals around all over the place. \n\nThe exercises that can be done reposition the crystals into a part of the ear that will not cause you vertigo. It is important to follow the post Epley instructions like sleeping semi-recumbent for a few days after and avoiding movement that triggers the dizziness/vertigo. failure to do so can cause the otoliths to come back out and all that not so fun stuff. \n\nOnce you know how to do the reposition exercises it is easy to do then on your own when bppv starts to flare up. The sooner you reposition the otoliths the shorter the amount of time the \u201cresidual dizziness\u201d stays if any residual dizziness happens. The residual dizziness for me was a floaty/drunkish dizzy feeling that lasted for weeks after I had treatment but that was because I waited a month before treating my bppv bc I was honestly hoping it would go away on its own. It did not. Ugh. So definitely get it properly treated. Hope it clears up soon and good luck on all your studies in college! xx I still get it and going on 10 years but typically it only flares up after a night imbibing or if I sleep with my head in a bad position.  What fixes it?  The Bacon Roll.  I do that about two or three times and then a day or two later I am fine.  Good luck! Hope they find a cure someday.", "Does anyone have nonstop vertigo? I am on day 14ish of non stop sudden vertigo. It is improving but I am still walking around like a drunk person. Days 3-7 were the worst but I only had one day of nausea and sobbing. My ENT told me that it sounded like migraine related vertigo as I have had a ton of migraines this month, but my headaches have subsided while the vertigo has not. Listening to others who have experienced vertigo makes me think it is still an ENT issue. That being said, no one I have talked to has had it 24/7. They get small bouts of it here and there. Mine is non stop. It is incredibly frustrating and debilitating. I am on leave from work due to it, which has its own set of issues. \n\nI am lights sensitive and cannot look at blue light screens for very long, if at all. I do not seem to have a better side, and I do not have nausea at this point. If I am lying in bed I feel totally normal until I move. (This is new. I used to spin if I was not perfectly aligned). \n\nI realize most of the posts here are simply folks like me looking for some advice but this is all new to me and I feel like I am living in this hopeless, moving void.  Could be vestibular migraines...\n\nVestibular rehab is supposed to help. Look for a physio in your area that specializes in vertigo and ask if they treat vestibular migraines. Have you seen a neurologist re: your migraines ? I have an appointment but the soonest any neurologist can see me is mid December I am in a similar boat, I will occasionally get bouts of vertigo that last a week or longer - where I am having a constant state of imbalance though not necessarily spinning all the time. (Walking poorly, feeling weird/bouncy, foggy headed, vision issues).  \n\n\nI would go ahead and find a physiotherapist or osteopath in your area that deals with vertigo to get started on vertigo habituation/adaptation exercises, those are supposed to help even vestibular migraines and your neurologist will probably recommend that regardless.   \n\n\nDo you suffer from any panic/anxiety disorder? Anxiety is deeply linked to vertigo and can take a small issue and AMPLIFY it to the point where it is affecting you daily. Might be another avenue if this fits your profile. I kind of disregarded the anxiety piece because I did not really think that was the issue, my BPPV felt positional to me, however I am beginning to see how I may have misunderstood the link between vertigo &amp; anxiety now (anxiety not being the cause, but rather an amplifier).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAsk your doctor for a referral to a dizziness clinic in your area so they can rule out positional vertigo and maybe re-affirm the migraine diagnosis? This stuff is a guessing game, but if you can get some intensive testing done you will have a bit more validation of what is going wrong and how to move forward. I regret not doing this as soon as I got vertigo to be honest. ENTs deal with a lot of cray stuff and they do not necessarily know to treat vertigo specifically.  \n\n\nHopefully with some of these things you will start feeling better soon! Vertigo is a very self-directed illness, you need to research and advocate for yourself and keep pushing until you get some relief from this. \n\n&amp;#x200B; Thank you so much! I was actually referred to a vestibular therapist today, I am hoping it is a step in the right direction. ", "Eyes jitter when closed post vertigo I had my second vertigo episode 3 months after my first. The first time I had it, after several epleys and somersaults I got it to stop, however for a about a week I noticed whenever I laid down with my eyes closed they would periodically jitter after about a minute. This stopped after about 7 days and I felt totally back to normal.\n\nThen I got vertigo again 3 months later, same deal. However this time the 'off' feeling and head discomfort lasted about 10 days. It is been about 4 weeks and my eyes will still do the jittery thing when I close them at night trying to sleep. Have not had any balance or dizziness since the vertigo itself weeks ago. Anyone else have an experience like this? Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* As far as I know it is just a symptom for the vertigo.I remember when I had my first one years ago the doctor who examined me did this test where she would sit me on the side of the bed and then turn me sideways to my side. She kept a constant eye contact with me to see if my eyes do the jitter thing. My eyes actually did not do it but she told me that it is one way to tell if a person is suffering from BPPV.\n\nPlease enlighten me about these 'somersaults' you have done. I am only aware of Epleys so far. What are they? =) Sorry I wasnt specific enough. I am not referring to nystagmus associated with BPPV. This is more of an 'ocular flutter' if you Google that, but mine is not nearly as severe and only happens when I lay down with my eyes closed post vertigo. It does not happen every night but it is something I have been noticing more often.\n\nThe sideways maneuver you are talking about is called the Semont. The somersault I am referring to is called the Foster Half Somersault and is used to treat posterior canal BPPV just like the epley.. Oooh. Ok, I mixed things up then.\nI will look into these since I was only aware of the Epley manouver which in some cases does not help enough.\nThank you! ", "How often should you do the Epley Maneuver? I am 29 y/o female. My first episode of vertigo happened two years ago after stepping off of a 3-day cruise where I had some sea sickness. I thought it was land sickness and rode it out for 3 weeks and it went away. I actually felt worse when sitting still and better if I were moving, on a car or even on a plane.\n\nThe second time I got it was over a year ago. I started feeling dizzy when I smelled some cleaning chemicals coming in from the apartment hallway. Again it lasted longer than the normal dizziness so I made an appointment with a nurse practitioner who did a test and me and saw nystagmus. He did the epley maneuver for me and told me I can do it myself at home once a day. My partner helped, and also saw nystagmus. Again it went away after three weeks.\n\nNow it is happening again, and it all started when I was staring at a slight downward angle. I thought I was low on iron. After a couple of episodes (that lasted longer than the 30 seconds folks on this sub say it lasts) over the course of a few days, the dizziness became consistent, similar to the last two times. I have done the epley maneuver several times now. I do not really feel dizzy during any of those positions as suggested in this ( On the other hand, it actually helps with the dizziness a lot once I am finished. But the dizziness slowly starts coming back after half an hour, even though I keep my head upright which theoretically should prevent the deposits from going back into the canal.\n\nMy question is, my dizziness seems to be more consistent (though I triggered a really bad episode when I laid on my right side once and feel more dizzy than not if I have been looking even slightly down at my laptop) and not the short bursts of time that is suggested here - does anyone else have similar experiences? Does the fact that I am still feeling dizzy shortly afterward mean that I have done this wrong? Or is that expected?\n\nI am really sad realizing that this will be life long and can happen this frequently. :( vertigo is a symptom which can be brought on by many disorders and you need a BPPV diagnosis before trying manoeuvres.\n\nIf you strongly believe it is BPPV, I would highly recommend seeking a PT that specialises in balance disorders where they can determine which ear, which canal and help with residual dizziness. I did not go to a specialist but as mentioned I was diagnosed by a nurse practitioner who saw the nystagmus. I will look into a specialist also. Hopefully I can get in quickly...even with annual check ups I am always scheduled so far out.\n\nDo you see a PT every time you have a new episode? Yep. - I have had a number of episodes over the past 6 years that range in severity and duration. I feel lightheaded (what most people describe as dizzy) all the time but I have learnt to live with it while also doing balance exercises which my PT has helped me with. \n\nIf I have an episode that does not resolve after 24 hours I will see my PT and have them diagnose the canal to help me. \n\nMy last episode went on for 3 weeks... there is no way I could have coped trying to figure out what was going on by self. Thank you. You are right, a specialist should be able to help. I have just been conditioned to give up after seeing family doctors/NPs. Sometimes you just have to get a second and third opinion. Good to know that people specialize in this elusive illness. I called around for an appointment with an ENT/PT. I called a few places and they cannot schedule me in until at least Feb 10th. I went with a center that specializes in dizziness.\n\nJust wanted to vent how incredibly frustrated I have always been with getting scheduled in for any type of illness. The availabilities are always so far out that by then my illness would have resolved itself. I am not able to get immediately relief for so much discomfort. What I have found is that sometimes after 24 hours my BPPV will resolve it self ie no more vertigo and nystagmus but I am left with horrible lightheadedness and a sensation of being off that historically I would just push through. \n\nAfter 6 years of just \u201cliving with it\u201d I have learnt from seeking help even tho it is taken weeks to see someone is that they will teach you balance exercises to help recover from the residual balance problems from BPPV. \n\nWithout doing the recovery work that off feeling will never improve and may lead to PPPD ( which is where I am now... constant crappy feelings of off balance with some good days, some bad... all because I did not seek help Hi u/Strict-Muscle,\n\nHope you are feeling better. I agree that a professional will be able to provide you with treatment options that are specific to your case.\n\nHave a look at our ( in case that is helpful, too! Hi yes I am a 28 yo female and this just happened to me. I was doubting it was a BPPV episode because it was just -constant- for days. I talked to my primary doc and she said nothing I was telling her (almost exactly what you have described) made her think it is not vestibular. She sent me to a vestibular PT who checked out my nystagmus, did an Epley (apparently I had not been doing the head positions exactly right), and I felt yucko for the rest of the night, but loads better the next day, and it kept getting better after that. I also think it was the timing of that specific Epley, on day 9 of this episode; my ear was just finally ready to move those crystals. While I was waiting for that appt, I managed to find a safe space on the right-lower side of my field of vision that was not spinny and put my laptop there, and just did not move lol. \n\nAnyway, after day 4 of my episode, I gave up doing the maneuvers because they just were not helping and only made me feel sicker. Get some Zofran (highly recommend Teledoc for scripts and stuff like that) and meclazine. Both my doc and the PT said that sometimes the crystals can get stuck because inflammation can cause the viscosity of the semi-circular canal fluid to turn the consistency of molasses! And then the canal hairs are being constantly stimulated by the stuck crystals, hence the constant spins. \n\nIt can take a bunch of maneuvers to make them go, but in my case I think the timing of the maneuver in the duration of the episode made a difference, when the fluid had started to return to normal and the crystals could finally go back where they belonged. I noticed you said it has happened once a year for the past few years--same. My doc thinks the thickening of the canal fluid is related to an immune response from viral infections/live vaccines. It has happened one month after my flu shot each year, and also during a 24 hour stomach bug. Have you had a virus or a flu shot recently?\n\nWhew this got long. I hope it helps! \n\nPs. The anti-nausea meds helped sooo much--the difference between not keeping water down and eating a meal. I agree that it is incredibly frustrating to have an urgent debilitating health issue that no one can treat until it is pointless! \n\nI would recommend seeing a naturopathic doctor because they are great listeners (trying to solve the holistic mystery of your ailments!) and tend to be quick to refer you to specialists. Even if it is not for primary care, just to have an ND on deck if you need a quick referral has been especially helpful during my BPPV issues. Omg, thank you so much for your reply. It helps to have more explanations for why the constant dizziness. It sounds like your PT was super helpful giving more peace of mind about the potential causes. Originally I was scheduled a whole two weeks out but luckily they have a last minute opening to let me in on Wednesday. And luckily the constant dizziness is less intense now. It may be what you described with the thickening of the canal fluid, or it may be the BBBP the other user described. Even though I feel like I am recovering, I am looking forward to talking to a specialist to help be learn some maneuvers and exercises for helping to rebalance again.\n\nI had not had any viral infections or shots recently. In fact I did not even think I was stressed (which I was before a previous episode and what I assume caused inflammation, if there was any). I did however have a few nights leading right up to the vertigo episode where I had feelings similar to sleep apnea and did not have deep sleep. There are theories out there about it relating to low quality sleep as well.\n\nAnd I will keep those meds in mind and ask the PT about that. The nausea never got out of hand but it was there and I am deathly afraid of vomiting. Thank you, friend! Hello, thank you for checking up. I have had two days of feeling a lot better but still woozy. I had seen your guide before, it was super helpful. Although I think everyone is case is slightly different, and I wanted a little consolation and insight as to why I might still be feel so consistently dizzy! I luckily got slotted in earlier so I am looking forward to seeing the vestibular PT this week! Hello, thank you so much for linking BBBP. My symptoms seem to reflect the article. Does everyone feel that inbalanced/residual dizzy feeling after vertigo episodes and are those considered BBBP even if it does not last three months? If you do not mind, may I ask you how long you have dealt with BBBP, had it ever gone away previously? That is actually a great recommendation. My lifestyle has improved drastically in the last year but even so, lifestyle choices, diet, sleep, stress still seem to come back and cause some awfully weird illnesses. I had to look up what a naturopath does and they might just be the resource I did not know I needed- on top of being on hand for the referrals. Thanks again! A lot of people will complain about residual dizziness after BPPV and I believe the longer the BPPV or the residual dizziness is left untreated that you are less likely to recovery 100%. \n\nVestibular rehabilitation is key for recovery and I have been doing it on and off for years with great success. My apologies for the somewhat impersonal comment; I generally try to link to the reference guide in most recent posts because I am never sure whether people scroll down that far! I am trying to get the post stickied to the top of the subreddit to save some trouble in the future.\n\nI absolutely get wanting to hear other people's experiences--and, thankfully, people in this sub are really generous in that regard. I scroll through posts and comments every once in a while to collect more info to add to the reference post, so thank you for asking your question. I am glad you were able to book an appointment with a vestibular PT and are hopefully heading toward some closure with this issue. It is the worst to feel like your life's on hold on account of such a small organ! \u2639\ufe0f Oh please no need to apologize! It is a very good guide. Having it stickied or in the sub menu would be fantastic.\n\n&gt;\tIt is the worst to feel like your life\u2019s on hold on account of such a small organ!\n\nYes, everything about this statement rings true. I think, once that task is done, I will be able to relax and enjoy conversing more with people. \ud83d\ude04 It is been frustrating not being able to get the post stickied because (a) I remember how difficult it was to find pertinent information on this sub while I was in the throes of BPPV and (b) a lot of the people in this sub who are offering their time and effort to supporting newcomers are becoming fatigued from rewriting the same information, so I want to do something before it is too late.\n\nI really hope your dizziness gets resolved. I remember feeling really hopeless as I wrestled with the fear that I might have this for the rest of my life.", "First time doing Epley ", "Symptoms Hello, I have recently been going to the doctor for fluid in my ears. They believe i have BPPV and i am being treated with antibiotics. Although i am having weird symptoms that I do not hear many people talk about. For example, when I get dizzy i can feel it in my face and my tongue. My face and tongue feel like they are vibrating for a split second. My tongue almost feels like it is numb and I do not feel disoriented, I get dizzy but i do not feel like i am spinning. It is very hard to explain but I do not hear people defining vertigo this way often. I was wondering if anyone else has this experience? Thank you I experience similar feelings. Just not in the tongue. Mostly my head. Really bad at night when I lay on my sides. I also get a lot of fluid I am sorry to hear that but thank you for your reply, it is such a weird and concerning feeling \nI guess i cannot be too surprised, i have always had ear infections since i was younger so i have a feeling i have had this fluid for a very long time It is god awful. I have been dealing with it for like a year. Noise canceling headphones can make me feel like shit. I get triggered from sitting down in restaurants a lot for some reason, no idea why. Might be the lighting. But it is like feeling dizzy and having a panic attack like feeling. Shallow breaths and impending doom. Vibration jolts in my head. Weird shit", "BPPV PTSD - Trouble sleeping Hello all.  First post!\n\nI will try to keep this brief.  I work in law enforcement and about 6 years ago I took a really hard hit to my head at work.  Did not lose consciousness, but I ended up with BPPV.  Thing is, I did not know what BPPV was at the time.  All I knew was that I would wake up at night falling out of the bed, room spinning, panicking, not knowing what was going on.\n\nEventually my wife convinced me to go to the hospital.  Cue a littany of tests by doctors who were not sure what was going on but wanted to protect themselves from liability in case it was neurological.  CT scan, transfer to a bigger hospital, MRI, visit by a bunch of neurologists and specialists who seemed to just want to put their name on the bill.  Finally they discharged me and just told me to see my primary care physician.  Luckily, he had had BPPV before, performed the Epley maneuver and I have not had an episode since.\n\nProblem is...now I cannot sleep.  I have panic attacks trying to go to sleep without the assistance of a Zzquil and bourbon cocktail.  It is as though the BPPV has made me afraid of going to sleep.  Anyone else had this issue?  Did anything like therapy or counseling help?\n\n**TLDR:  Had BPPV.  Epley maneuver fixed it.  But 6 years on and I cannot sleep.**\n\nThanks! Thank you for your service! And really sorry to hear about the panic attacks. \n\nI had the same situation, BPPV &amp; noise related PTSD (long story).\n\nLuckily I have a background in psychology &amp; could help myself. In this case I would say this is completely normal. I would consult a psychologist or therapist to wane you off the panic attacks, with some therapeutic intervention. \n\nThe short version is that your mind has learnt from your experiences and uses panic attacks as a defense. To erase you will have to write some new experiences - like sleeping in a different place, different surroundings, etc. and re-train your mind to not panic when you sleep. It can be done, so that is the good news! Thanks for the advice.  I started by sleeping on a different side of the bed (always slept on the \"passenger's\" side, switched to the \"driver's\" side.  That is helped some.  Also was prescribed Lexapro, though I regret that.  I think that was a case of attacking the symptoms and not the cause, and that is a difficult drug to wean off of.\n\nI think you are right about how my mind is using panic attacks as a defense.  The entire reason I was able to make that connection was because a coworker was suffering from BPPV recently and his physician did not know the cause.  I clued him into it and told him to have his physician do the Epley maneuver and it got him fixed, but he was having the same trouble sleeping as I am.\n\nIt is comforting to know that this is not rare.  I will ask my PCP to refer me to a psychologist or therapist. Yep. Go for it. Just go there with an open mind and it should decently help. I developed somewhat hypochondria after my first nasty episode. I had to do at least half an year of counseling to get my head straight (and not because of the occasional spinnings).\n\nBPPV or other type of ear/back vertigos are not rare but sometimes they are just mild and go away in some weeks/months. Other times, you need help. Awesome! Glad to hear about the positive direction. \nYeah BPPV is super weird, in my situation my doc w/ 30+ years of experience straight up told me he does not know what is going on w/ me lol..so I have just been monitoring and finding small solutions along the way. It is been almost a year and i have had dizziness / phantom motion basically every single day. But things are better than they were before.\n\nHopefully with some good therapist's help you will be back to sleeping normally! All the best. Let me know if I can help in any other way! I came to this subreddit to talk specifically about this, too. I had BPPV twice last year, persisting for months at a time, with a few months of normalcy in between. Now it is been a little over a year since I have had a full on episode,  but I still cannot sleep right. I have been using two pillows since the last instance, and when I try to wean myself off of it and go back to sleeping on one (which feels so much better for my back and neck) my heart starts racing and I start to imagine that I am having vertigo, even though I know I am not. I cannot relax enough to sleep and sometimes the anxiety is so bad that I have to get up and sit in a chair for awhile. I have clonazepam but I do not want to rely on it. It sucks, sleep is such a comfort, and I feel like it is been permanently ruined for me. All of my BPPV attacks have happened in bed with no apparent cause. Now I am always worried when I lay down and close my eyes that I will wake up to everything spinning again. Ugh. \n\nI wish I had something positive to contribute, but I just want to say thanks for sharing your experience. It helps to know there are other people out there living through this as well. I am sorry you have had this happen to you, though, and I hope you find a treatment that brings you relief.  The more I look into it the more I find it is not uncommon.  Sleep is a weird animal.  One doc I talked to who has personal experience with BPPV put it like this:  When you are awake, and you can process and contextualize experiences, is one thing.  But when you are in REM or any of the other sleep states, the same experiences can be more permanently traumatic.  Moreover, the position in which you fall asleep in the first stages of sleep is different than the position you are in when you are in the deeper stages of sleep.  So if you BPPV is triggered by the position of the deeper stages of sleep, that can mess you up.\n\nI have not talked to an actual therapist yet, but from what I have researched the solution is a \"sleep reset\" where you basically re-learn how to sleep.  I will update once I have worked with a therapist.", "4/5 - Second therapist visit - Not BPPV So after going off of the meclizine for about a week and having plateaued, I went back for my second appointment with the therapist and they did the Dix-Hallpike test again with the goggles and could not detect any noticeable nystagmus. Their conclusion is that it probably was/is vestibular neuritis. Looking through the symptoms, it fits my experience perfectly.\n\n\n\nOn one hand I am kind of disappointed that it cannot be solved by some head maneuvering but on the other hand I am glad I have a diagnosis it should clear up in the 4-6 weeks and hopefully I will be back to normal.\n\nIn the meantime I have a bunch of exercises to do each day to help me adapt to what I am feeling. They are a mix of balance, gait, and head movement exercises. On the upside, vestibular neuritis does not tend to randomly reoccur if you turn over in bed wrong \ud83d\ude11 Yeah that is certainly an upside. I had been trying all weekend to find a position that caused the dizziness I felt early on but I could not. I am glad you were able to get a diagnosis! keep us updated on your recovery. interested to hear if your symptoms are resolved in a couple months. Yeah I will. I am sure I am not going to be the only one that thinks they have BPPV only to find out they do not. Hey, hope you get well soon! VN sucks for a bit. Wanted to ask what exercises you were doing?", "Questions about BPPV I asked around for what is going on and people are telling me I might have BPPV. My question is just to ask what does it feel like for you.\n\nI had this happen for 2 days now, only when laying in bed, its feels like a sudden lightheadedness and burning up. It last for 10-20 secs and then I feel perfectly fine and im able to sleep. I get up as soon as I feel it and walk around until it goes away.\n\nDoes that sound like bppv? Also I just got over a ear infection in my right ear. With head movements i feel and see the room spinning because there are loose crystals in my ear canal. Thanks for your reply, I only seem to get like this when I am laying down for a little bit. How did you find out you had bppv? I was diagnosed by my doctor.  There are cranial head movements you can try called the home epley maneuver.  You can find instructions on youtube Feels kind of like I am on a boat sometimes when I am lying in bed.  I feel movement when there is none.  Once in awhile it feels for a few seconds like I am in a diving plane when I am lying down.  That is quite unpleasant. Typcally BPPV is associated when the room starts to spin violently after a head movement.  For me - most of the BPPV episodes have happened when I have rolled over on to my right side as the BPPV is in my right ear.  A few times it is happened when I spun around quickly while standing up \\.\n\nGive half somersault manuver a try at home which may take a few tries.  If BPPV does not triger after 5 tr\n\n(\n\nWhen you say \"burning up\" - do you mean your body temperature increases/and you start sweating?  I would guess that the recent ear infection may still be causing havoc that requires more time to get over. Burning up like only in my head and I try cooling down by breathing. Can it be triggered only when laying down? It seemed to be only after laying down for a bit. I also sit down a lot , almost all day due to school being online for me so maybe the transition is causing it. Sitting down all day to laying down Hello. First time I had BPPV it was really violent and the room was spining to the right. I also had burning/hot flashes when I first ever had my BPPV. But yes you can have a burning feeling from stress due to the BPPV. But is not cause derectly BPPV. I would not recommend the home epley maneuvers, I dislodged the crystals in my ear once when I tried doing them and had to go back to my specialist sadly. I am sure they can work, but it was not worth the risk afterwards. My case was a bit severe though. Hrm - you might want to go to a doctor to verify if it is BPPV or something else.  Since you sit down all day that is not good for your body/mental health\nWhat helps me is to stand up and go do something else for ~10-15 minutes  Yeah I am going to try that. I use to do mild exercises but covid just made me lazy lol. I will try to get back on it. I honestly do not feel like it is anything serious just makes me worry. I have a doc appointment teladoc on the 18th for my follow up for h pylori, I plan to bring this up to him I also think I am getting bloodwork again", "BPPV symptoms have evolved Just wondering if anyone else has experienced different 'phases' of their BPPV/Vertigo troubles over time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Phase 1**: For the first 6 months of getting vertigo (fall/winter 2017), I would get it once a month and be completely unable to walk/stand for 6-8 hours due to the intense SPIN. I would have to pop a Gravol, go to bed for the day and wait until it was over the next morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Phase 2:** In the spring/summer, I started getting hazy days for a week at time where I would feel off balance and funky, a little nauseous but not terribly spinny every time. Lots of general imbalance where I could not walk straight, and vision was a little tricky sometimes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Phase 3:** Fall/winter 2018, frequency has returned to once a month but definitely not as bad as it used to be. Moreso just feeling off, a slight spin. Definitely not put out for 8 hours at a time.  \n\n\nNot sure what it all means... are my crystals rolling around in there and slowly going back to where they are supposed to go? Is the weather a factor? Who knows amirite? You did not mention anything about getting any kind of treatment or doing Epley. Do you do any of this? True!\n\nI wanted to keep this post short... if I had explained everything that has happened over the past year it would take a few pages. But yes, it is relevant that at the end of phase two my osteo deduced I had cupulolithiasis and performed the BBQ roll on me which led me to stage 3. So I suspect that maneuvre has helped, though she is unsure why I am still getting episodes. It is very similar to my case. The first year i had it, my vertigos were often (once a week) and feeling dizzy almost all the time. Then the vertigos got better and seldom. Now, after almost 3 years, i still ger them once a 4-5 months and they are only 15 seconds max. Sometimes i feel a bit dizzy but it passes in a day or two. Mmmm that sounds great to be honest! Maybe it is settling for me too. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc That is the thing, still getting episodes, why, that is what we all want to figure out, so frustrating. I am 43 and have similar issues. I get bppv, but also have to have chiro do occipital lift, because I also get that off tilt feeling from my occipital nerve, the chiro fixes that. \n\nBut yeah the bppv is a pain, I know tons about it, but I swear getting it on track sometimes is hell. Yes my vertigo has evolved. I have times if more spinning and times exactly like you have described. My spinning bouts are short - 30 seconds maybe max - as I can force the spin to stop. The off-kilter and nauseous feeling is worse cause I am just stuck with that till it goes away.\n\nI have only ever been to a doc once about all this so I do not know what it all means. Had it off and on for about 15 years now. I have months with nothing then months with regular bouts.\n\nBut yes, mine has evolved. Even the direction in which the world spins has changed.\n\nGood luck. ", "36/m - near life long BPPV Now this is the first time I have ever heard of BPPV - I have experienced symptoms of it since I was young, now 36 - the first time I experienced it I was probably around 9 or 10 playing baseball. \n\nMy whole family has it - I get it the least severe but mine will last for hours usually, I can still somewhat walk (not up and down stairs just in a straight line). My cousin has gotten it since he was a baby and gets it to the point he cannot drive and sometimes throws up - my uncle gets it the most severe and he will be bed ridden and throwing up for days.\n\nWe have never been diagnosed because the doctors we went to when we were younger did not know what was wrong ..I guess...However, recently my cousin came to me suggesting this is what we may have. \n\nUp until now we have just been living and dealing with it but he will be seeking treatment at an ENT for the first time since he was younger.  I told him to let me know what they say - as, I do not have health insurance right now but will have in June so I want to cut out some steps if possible.\n\nAny suggestions on my path to diagnosis or treatment, what has worked for everyone else?\n\n  \nThanks! Find a vestibular therapist or someone that specializes in dizzy disorders. They will do tons of tests to pinpoint what is going on. And then they will guide you in treatment.  Many with BPPV have found that an ENT, regular doctor, or neurologist do not always know much about dizziness.  SOME do - but not all of them.  So, to cut out some steps - go straight to someone that specialized in dizziness.  I saw many doctors before I found a vestibular therapist that was able to help me. oh wow i have never even heard of that I will look into it and also let me cousin know about this,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for the input :) - yeah my cousin has seen a lot of doctors and they basically just tell him to deal with it - clearly not knowing how much is affects the people who have it.\n\nMy mom thought I was a hypochondriac when I was younger so I never even had the chance to go to the doctor for it. My vestibular therapist was actually in the Physical Therapy department.  She was truly a godsend.  And I ended up being treated for TWO different dizzy conditions.  The first was BPPV and secondary to that was Gaze Instability (which was created from BPPV and my lack of head movements).  They put goggles on to watch your eyes and the nystagmus (the way your eyes twitch during the intense brief vertigo sessions help indicate which ear canal is effected).  And there are many other types of testing done as well, to rule out or find other dizzy conditions.  As I mentioned, most doctors are not specialized enough to know any of this stuff and just call it 'vertigo' and send you out the door with some meds to help lessen the symptoms and tell you to live with it or wait it out.  There truly are also specialized dizzy clinics as well. No one should have to suffer and live with dizziness. There is treatment to help! wow that is so interesting, my issue is I heard about them doing these tests when you are having an episode, but what if it does not happen? some times Ill go a month without an episode - some times Ill have 3 in a week. BPPV is positional. So, if you place your head in a position where the crystal moves around the ear canal, you will have the brief intense vertigo with nystagmus.  You could easily keep your head upright in a position where you would not get that intense vertigo for days (I learned how to avoid it).  The best test for the most common form of BPPV is the Dix Hallpike test (and it is the first step to the Epley).  Google it.  If you lay back doing the Dix Hallpike and it is positive, then it can be treated. If nothing happens, you likely are not having issues in that particular ear canal.  But there are 6 ear canals total that could be effected. And there are different tests for each ear canal. There are also other conditions. Knowing how to trigger it is key. And if it is not BPPV, a dizzy specialist can help pinpoint what is actually going on. It could be migraines or vestibular neuritis, or a bunch of other conditions.  That is why it is best to find a specialist that can help test for all these things. They can ask the right questions and help pinpoint things. If you can at least get in for an initial exam....and even if you are not having symptoms at the time, then when it DOES happen, they likely will get you in right away.", "Epley - vertigo worst in second position? Hey everyone\u2014I have had BPPV off and on for about 6 years (lucky me!). This latest bout is dragging on and I cannot seem to shake it (it is been about two months). My doctor just tells me to continue doing the Epley. The weird thing is my vertigo seems the worst at an odd time. When I quickly lay back looking to the left, I get no vertigo even after waiting up to a minute. Still laying on my back, I move into the second position and turn my head to the right\u2026.and that is when the world goes crazy. That leads me to believe my right ear is affected. But when I do the Epley for the right ear and start the exercise looking to the right, I cannot induce vertigo and when I move into position two, I get very slight vertigo. It only seems to happen during Epley with the motion of turning my head from the left to the right. Maybe is my head not far enough back? Has anyone else had a similar experience. I would like to break out of this spell! You are treating the wrong side. Sounds like right sided bppv to me. It is not uncommon to have bad vertigo with one side only, be fixed with treatment and then find out the other ear was involved the whole time too. Your eyes can only move in one direction at a time so whichever side was worse will have the nystagmus to match, clear that side and you will see the other nystagmus show up. Try a right sided epley. Thanks for the advice!! No problem. I do vestibular physical therapy and I see this happen all the time. You could have a horizontal canal affected and not posterior.  You could try the log roll instead of the epley and see.  That could explain the dizziness when you turn your head.  For awhile my pt had me do the epleh and the log roll every night.  You can even do the log roll for 1 ear for a few nights and then switch and do it for the other ear.  Sorry to hear about your issues!  I can relate as I keep getting episodes every week or so for the past 2 months.  Good luck! I will give it a try! It is awful, is not it? In the past, I have only had it maybe once a year and it only lasts about a day each time. This time around it is been about two months, and like you describe, I have a few good days or a week, and then some minor movement sets it off again. Today, it was holding up a glass measuring cup above my eyes and tilting my head back to check the measurement. Other times it is looking up to hang up a jacket, rolling over in bed, bending down to pick something up off the floor. I am pretty sick of it. Wishing you good luck with your symptoms as well! My ENT did an epley manuever and made my BPPV so much worst. He did give me an order script to see a vertibular PT after I told him that it gotten worst since I saw hime. My VPT gave me some home exercises to do and we start rhis wednesday. Cant wait, I have been dizzy, lightheaded, brain fog and unbalance for the last four weeks. How are you doing now ? Me too. Do you feel anybetter? Please share :'( Yes, I am 100% better now and you can too. I did develop anxity during the challenging time so I am looking for help on that. Did it go completely like an AHA moment or gradually? I felt like I have stop spinning but I still have this floaty and off balance feeling. Sometimes I felt better sometimes I felt worse after epley. If you dont mind please share how the exercise \ud83e\udd72 I hve gone to PT also... Yes completly went away after 6 weeks of theraphy and steroids. I had a vistibular neurities according to my neuro.", "Is it really just BPPV? Hey you all, long story short, 23M here and just recently had my first episode of BPPV. Been about 4 months now, I finally got in with a vestibular therapist. She did the Dix-Hallpike, diagnosed BPPV in my left horizontal canal. I just had week 2 of vestibular therapy session. Between session 1 and now I have felt pretty awful in terms of nausea &amp; abdominal pain, but very little dizziness.\nI have found that it really seems like acidic or acid-forming foods (and especially coffee and alcohol) make the nausea &amp; abdominal pain worse. The abdominal pain is like cramps basically, which could be from BPPV if my body is off balance. I am getting checked out by a gastroenterologist in parallel, so I also had a barium swallow test today. Do not have the results yet but they might find nothing at all\n\nAfter today\u2019s therapy session, I feel particularly fatigued and a tiny bit lightheaded. The therapist mentioned that while I do feel good during the exercises and during the therapy, it is normal to feel pretty awful for a little while after. Last week it persisted for almost the whole week after the session. \nSo, I wanted to ask, is this normal? Is it all just BPPV and I have to go through the therapy to be free of nausea and abdominal pain? I have been a vestibular therapist for 7 years now, never heard of abdominal pain from BPPV. However, if what that person is doing changes your symptoms, for better or worse there is a link. Systemic abdominal pain from some other causes should not be effected by rolling around on a bed, especially for over a few minutes/hours... but BPPV does have lasting effects on nausea. The horizontal canals are more commonly linked to off balance sensations and nausea than posterior or anterior canal based bppv. Trust your therapist... but also you could ask about other techniques, like gufoni/Casani maneuvers rather than just barrel rolls like most commonly used. I typically do not feel the nausea and abdominal pain at the same time as the dizziness, which my gastroenterologist thinks means they are not fully related and/or there could be something else in addition to BPPV going on for that.\n\nAs for symptoms worsening, I thought it might be the case that I adapted to the canalith being in the wrong position and now that it seems to be back in place, am having to readapt again? At least, that was my understanding from what the therapist told me That could be, but a \u201crecalculating\u201d process should not take longer than a week or two at most.", "Bppv not getting better HELP Hey guy started getting an bppv attack yesturday around 4 am. Figured it was my left year and proceeded to do the epsey manuver 3-5 times with all the dizzy and throwing up. After I felt better and went to sleep sitting up in the living room thinkig I fixed it. During the day I still felt unsteady and assumed it was the bppv hangover and later in the evening went to do the manuver again only find the room was still crazy spinning???? Did the manuver 3 more times with the spinning continuing then propped myself on my back and tried to sleep. I wake up this morning feeling again off balence but okay and start doing my normal morning stuff and try to do the epsey maneuver again to make sure its fixed but once i started extreme spinning and dizziness??? Anyways i did it another three times and now im sitting upright on the sofa? Does anyone know why this is happening? I also feel like a have a mildly blocked ear. Would go see my specialist but you know quarintine \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude43 someone please help me. There are three different tubes in your inner ear, and different exercises to try besides Epley.\n\nTry the Somersault one:  Hmm i will try that one thanks!! Poor thing. Maybe get some anti nausea meds. You can go to urgent care. I did when I had my first bout but I was not throwing up. But you got to get it diagnosed first. The maneuvers could not be working because it is something else. But the maneuvers and time are the only (somewhat of a) cure. Yeah :( i have been diagnosed with bppv before usually the epsey manuver works", "15 days, and I count myself as one of the lucky ones. Just out of nowhere, I woke up with my head spinning like a rinse cycle. \nI have been here before, a few years back, after moving a few thousand miles from home to a much different (dryer) environment that I was accustomed to) \nI had specialized testing done, an E.N.T, a neurologist, and an allergist, and it was the latter that seemed to have the best solution, was time and antihistamines (figuring it was allergies).\nI have talked to a few people that have had it for over a year and longer, with bouts on and off, lasting weeks on end.\nSkip forward a few years and a move back to my home town and here we go again.\nMy new Dr was quite familiar with BPPV. He was going to give me 3 weeks first and a rx for betahystamines before going that extra mile just yet.\nAfter the first week, things were well enough that I could try a few different exercises to see if it would help, none of which did. I just stayed semi-horizontal on my recliner and only moved when necessary.\n15 days fast forward and today all is well and I hope it is all done with.\nYesterday was my first whole day without any head tilting spins, and just a couple random eye spins from watching an action film.\nToday is even better as I could walk a straight line and my wife let me drive the car while we were out doing errands. Tomorrow I will go for a check up and hopefully back to work before the weeks end. \nI do not know if this helps anyone, but I thought I would share. Glad to hear you are feeling better. I am not sure what why antihistamines would help BPPV.  I mentioned that because, back then, the ent and neurologists testing was inconclusive, but the allergist found I was affected by local contaminants so the antihistamines worked great.\nThis time around, my Dr gave me betahystamines.\n\nI do not think there is a direct link between what I went through back then and now other then that both experiences had the same symptoms.. Days on end of uncontrollable head spinning. There is another possibility. Not all ENTs or Neurologists are specialized in vestibular disorders. It may be that if you went to a balance center they might be able to diagnose you better.", "Why does BPPV keep coming back? I usually wake up with it in the morning and it passes by the end of the day (without treatment) or it all of a sudden comes on at night, after I\u2018ve had a headache all day. I perform the epley maneuver and it helps but I get BPPV at least once a month if not more. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? Have you been to a doctor about it? Your description sounds like you are not fully treating the BPPV. You need to see a trained physiotherapist that can detect which ear canal is affected. \n\nIt is likely passing by the end of the day because the crystal is settling out to the bottom of a canal while you are upright all day. Then at night the crystal rolls out as you are on your side.", "Bppv or muscle issue?? So, I posted here 2 months ago. I woke up with vertigo one morning and for about a month I would continue to get it when I tried to lay down, Or lay on either of my sides. I would also get it when I moved my head from looking straight up to down (chin to chest).\n\nI have gone to ENT\u2019s, Physical Therapists, Chiropractors, and primary care doctors and they all say it is BPPV but others say it is a neck issue (Myofascial pain syndrome, Cervical Vertigo, etc)... \n\nFor the past month I have not gotten the vertigo but also have not laid flat on my back or on my sides. I sleep slightly elevated on my back. The constant dizziness has subsided a lot but I still have the worst neck stiffness and pain. I actually have knots on the base of my skull right on my occipital nerve. Ever since the beginning I would get electric shocking pain from my neck down to my back. This has also subsided this month since I have been taking muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories but still have the feeling that the vertigo is about to happen....but it does not. It is random, like when I move my head fast. Which I cannot do....my neck muscles on the left side are so tight I cannot turn to the left without pain and dizziness.\n\nI was treated for BPPV by the Pts and I would feel slight relief of the vertigo but it never went away. The constant headache and dizzy/off feeling stayed constant for about 6 weeks.\n\nI am just curious to know if this is normal BPPV behavior? Or if I am indeed dealing with a neck issue. It is so confusing and frustrating. \n\nI am going to a neurosurgeon in a few weeks for an MRI to see what is going on in there. Just looking for more incite on BPPV since sometimes I think that is the problem then some days I do not. All my PT\u2019s think it is not BPPV... I should note that I was in a serious car accident about 2 years ago and injured my neck...my pt thinks I injured it again and time will heal it. \n\nI just do not know anymore, and I am tired of feeling down and not being able to do anything. :(", "Need more information about BPPV, doctor barely informed me I was diagnosed with BPPV, my right ear is the bad side according to the doctor. I have this condition for one week now. I do the eppley maneuvers 3 times a day, could do them infinite times, but I saw a recommendation of 3 times per day on the internet(do not know if I should do more). My primary question is, do symptoms go away with the help of maneuvers gradually or should it be an instant fix? I am confused because I am on medication, so the symptoms are lesser, do not know if eppley is working, or if its just medication lessening the symptoms. Second question, if eppley maneuvers are not working, should I just try experimenting with other types of movements, maybe even switch sides to which is do the movement. Any tips welcome. Have a legit physical therapist help with the Eppleys. If done right, you feel A LOT better pretty quickly. Not 100%, but 90% maybe. Then have the pro do them again later that day or the next day and it feels even better yet. There is some \u201cfocusing\u201d tricks they can help you do too that help. \nIt was explained to me that our brains are (afraid?) it will happen again, so they are not adjusting back to normal, to protect us/itself. By practicing the focus therapies 3-4 x a day, for a few days, plus the PT doing the eppley made it nearly completely back to normal in 4-5 days. I felt \u201chungover\u201d for a few weeks after, but it helped so much. \nMy husband tried to help me do Eppleys at home, but we were not doing it right. Epley did jack shit for me and I felt the same way. Got like no information at all from doctors other than \u201cyou have a weak right ear\u201d after all sorts of tests. Was miserable and could function for a few weeks and had to sleep nearly upright on a couch for a week. I changed a few things and it went away within almost two days for good and has stayed away. I had one mini episode where I got crazy dizzy for maybe 10 seconds and was fine again.\n\nWhat I changed was I did the half somersault maneuver a few times for two days straight which can be seen here:\n\n\n\nAlso, I started taking vitami  c and d at the same time.\n\nIdk if it was all a coincidence or what but it is worth a shot that is for sure.\n\nGood luck! Epley and half somersault both use the same mechanism for treatment. Epley can be hard to get into on your own though, better when done by a professional. Vit D is linked to helping with BPPV in cases or recurrence or resistance. Not sure what the c does\u2026 for bppv anyway. I had three different professionals do the epley on me a s unfortunately it did not help Bummer, glad something did the trick though. Gold standard is Epley, but there are plenty of instances where I need to switch to a different tech. Half somersault is the newest one making waves, but there are others. May I know how long you had BPPV? I had gone to two neurologist, and countless vertigo medicine, and PT as well. Some days are better but some days still floaty. I really dont know how to cope with this \ud83d\ude2d it is already over two weeks\nI dont even know how I got into this A little over a month but have not had any symptoms in over a year I feel frustrated because my wedding is around the corner and I suddenly got this all feeling. Really rough. If you have any tips or whatever please tell me. I tried all somersault epleys brad daroft. Some days it makes me feel better somedays it makes me feel dizzy. So confused and depressed Def try the vitamin c and d too and just chill and try to watch tv and do not move around. I was locked to a couch for well over a week it sucked big time. Sleep upright on a 45 degree angle.\n\nKeep doing the somersault like ten or more times daily. Between that and the increase in vitamin c and d it cleared up pretty quickly after that. Idk if it was all a coincidence or not but it certainly does not hurt. \n\nIt def seemed hopeless I know that feeling it was fucking awful but it will go away and it will be long forgotten", "What triggers your BPPV? I can say that dentist chairs, and when I start getting into music a lot and start bobbing my head a lot it tends to trigger it randomly. You? Rolling over in bed at night and a really weird one, if I sit down with my legs straight and my head pressed against something, goes crazy. Bizarre. Moving the wrong way in bed is the biggest. Always early morning after sleeping at night. Once it was riding in the car on a winding drive that went upward. Also, physically handling my ears (Q-Tips and tugging) and swollen lymph nodes, apparently.\n\nEdited to add dentist chairs and salon chairs are my biggest fear. I do not want this to become something that happens in public. I am terrified of both now to the point where I will actually have small dizzy spells in them. I think it is more anxiety than actual BPPV which is frustrating. Luckily, I am usually able to talk myself down from them by telling myself I am safe. \n\nIt also happens when I lay on my back at the gym to do certain exercises. I had to give myself the epley on a massage/stretching table once. Good question, I will like to read everyone is answers. \n\nI am a few months in and trying to narrow down what causes it\u2014 it took me a while to accept I might deal with this long term and get to this point.\n\nWalking my dogs is one issue- moving quick when the leash is pulled around a lot, and also when I have to pick up after I cannot bend down to do it easily. Another thing I think is a problem is working at a very small desk with a bad desk chair- moving side to side for paperwork in a small space and then slouching, too\u2014  my neck and associated neck tension might not necessarily cause it, but I think it makes it worse. This dizziness being provoked by anxiety is also confusing and terrifying to me. I have never experienced that in 21 years of BPPV, either. I do not want that and feel for anyone that has such a problem caused by psychosomatics. I mean, how do you even treat that? It is terrifying to think about. As a person that has health anxiety that sounds like hell. When I do high aerobic activity in a hot bootcamp class or certain inversions in my hot yoga class. Really throws off my workout lol Are you asking what triggers BPPV while you currently have it? Or what makes BPPV occur once again after it is been resolved/corrected?  While I have active BPPV, it is any random quick head movement (making the crystal rotate and move around the inner ear canal).  And I wish I knew what causes it to happen again after it is been fixed.  All 4 or 5 episodes of mine have just happened during the night when I rolled over.  Each episode has been tested and resolved.  So far I have not been able to pin point WHY another crystal has suddenly dislodged in the middle of the night. It is random. I do not drink, do not smoke, am not on any medications, I am active and healthy (no health issues). No past head trauma. Vitamin D levels are good. Salt levels are good.  So, I just WISH I knew what caused it - so I could fix/avoid it! I was asking individuals if they notice things they do that tends to bring on their BPPV. As far as asking a general health question about BPPV as a health issue I was not asking about that. OK - I was not sure how to answer - but I kind of answered both ways!  As in what triggers the vertigo/nystagmus while having active BPPV, versus what triggers a whole new episode of BPPV.  I just added in the health issues as an extra, since it seems to come up often. It is all good. Thank you for your reply. It was very informative! It is nice to read all the different answers. Every bit of info helps with this nasty yucky dizziness crap!  Best wishes to you! so which are your main bppv symptoms? cuz you mentioned the swollen lymph nodes and I was wondering if you have both bppv and swollen lymph nodes at the same time The swollen lymph nodes were a rare event that triggered my most recent BPPV episode. I had recently gotten the 2nd dose of Pfizer vaccine and it trigger swelling in my lymph nodes that was out of this world and without thinking about it I tried to lessen the pain from those near my ear by massaging and rubbing the area. Which when combined with the swelling moved my ear in the wrong way and triggered the BPPV.\n\nIt is not something that happens every time or even most times that I have episodes of BPPV. After this most recent episode I kind of thought to my self, \"Huh. That was unexpected. I wonder if at other times in my life when I was sick my nausea was caused because my lymph nodes were screwing with my ears.\"\n\nBut the majority of my BPPV happens because I move wrong while I am half asleep in bed in the early morning. I literally feel it kind of switch on as I turn in bed. The symptoms are standard room spinning, nausea, vomiting and sweating caused by elevated body temperature. Not sure what triggers my episodes besides sleep positions. However, I can tell a new episode is coming because balance becomes a little off, but the tests are negative. Then in the morning, as soon as I get up, the tests trigger actual spinning attacks and nystagmus.", "Do I actually have to get a CT Scan or/and MRI or can I skip it? I know the main purpose behind getting those tests done is to rule out anything else that can be causing the symptoms but since I highly suspect it may be BPPV would not it be quicker and less expensive to just forgo those tests and just request a referral to a physical therapist that specializes in vestibular issues. More likely than not the physical therapist would have the necessary tests and tools to diagnose BPPV more quickly and accurately rather than go through the process of going to the doctor, then getting the MRI/CT scan , then ENT, etc. \nI just want to get this dealt with as quickly as possible since I have been dealing with this for a year now and to say that my day to day life has not been effected would be an understatement. Cannot really enjoy much, I dread going to bed and due to that my sleep has been suffering. Same with taking showers, etc.\n\nI have been already struggling with anxiety and depression for quite some time now and this has made me break down in tears a couple of times (yes, I am that sensitive lol) because it triggers my anxiety even more which does not help the dizziness/unsteadiness. If I did not have mental illness I probably will be handling this a lot more calmly and smoothly but that is just is not the case. I just wish there was a support group for sufferers with this condition and similar to help with the emotional and mental havoc these conditions cause.\nAnyway thanks for reading. Yes. A therapist can perform the Epley which is diagnostic for BPPV. If positive, they will most likely be able to treat it. If negative, then they might suggest other testing or scans. It seems like working backwards to start with an MRI.", "Is it okay? I have been having possible bbpv for the past week, it happens when I move my head quickly. I am wondering is it okay if I still play video games while having this? Ive noticed when I play the symptoms subside until I move my head then it comes back. My therapist recommended that I stay as active as possible while trying to treat my BPPV. Playing video games should be just fine. I found as many things as possible to do - that would make me forget about my vertigo.  Running was one of those things! So keep playing! Thanks for the response, yeah I agree just finding any distractions help. It is like I went for a walk yesterday which completely forgot about vertigo then as soon as I sat down it all started again so I will take your advice. I know that I stayed very still for the first few weeks, so as to NOT provoke any dizziness. This is before I saw a vestibular therapist.  My inactivity caused gaze instability. So I was constantly dizzy (when I moved my head I would get the BPPV vertigo - and then while just watching TV and NOT moving - I would get a milder dizziness).  So the best advice was to keep moving. Stay active.  And sometimes just the anxiety of knowing you have BPPV when you feel the waves of dizziness, can make it worse. So I kept myself distracted as much as possible.\n\nAlso, if you are sure you have BPPV and do not want to let it just go away on it is own, see a therapist that can help with correcting the BPPV. I let mine go for so long, it then took forever to correct - and left months of residual dizziness. Some people are fortunate and it resolves on it is own within a few days or weeks.  I had to perform the Epley MANY times and had active BPPV for over two months. It sucked. Dang I am sorry to hear, sounds like that sucked. Yeah I have not been wanting to move because of the defat but I forced myself to walk the other day then the dizziness came later that night. I want to see someone but due to covid I am unsure if its worth it right now.", "25 year old possible bppv. Hello Reddit.  \n\nLike the title says I am a 25 year old suffering from vertigo and it appears to be caused by bppv.  I have been told my entire family on my dad's side has symptoms.  Father, uncle, grandma and great grandma.  \n\nI had an occurrence a two years ago that lasted a  week and went away.  Now I am back in the same boat and its been about ten days.  I work with heavy machinery so I cannot be at work unless I am sure I am free of symptoms.  \n\nThe way I experience symptoms is constant mild dizzyness with periods of more intense off balance feeling.  Sudden head position changes seem to make it slightly worse but bending down and standing back up make it much worse.  \n\nI guess the reason for my post is that I am not sure what is happening to me and what to do about it.  I feel like a moron sitting at home for days at a time because \"I am kind of dizzy\" I am not positive my symptoms match bppv and sometimes I am not certain there is anything wrong with me at all until I get a \"break\" where the dizzyness goes away from a moment.  \n\nI do smoke pot and that does seem to help if only for the fact that the nasea is less prominent and pot kind of rules.  The Betahistine dihydrochloride or \"serc\" they put me on does not help. I have tried about every epley manouver to zero effect.  \n\nI guess maybe just getting my thoughts down somewhere has made me feel better but if anybody can relate feel free to comment or pm me.  \n\nSorry for the great Wall of text.  \n Hey, sorry to hear about your symptoms. I am 23 years old and had a severe case of bppv where I could not stand without falling over for a week. Made me very nauseous and almost to the point of being depressed because I could not move or sleep well.. I had bppv in both my ears. I had anterior in my left ear, and posterior in my right. \n\nI had to go to physical therapy to get my self corrected. They do maneuvers to reset those damn crystals in your ears. It is miserable, but you got to have to get worse before you can get better sometimes. I suggest talking with a doctor so they can refer you to the physical therapist and they can show you how to correct, which nystagmus you have, which canal, etc. You can also research on your own, it is not that hard to do it yourself, but it takes patience sometimes. It is always nice to be with a trained professional in my opinion.\n\nIt does sound stupid to \"be dizzy\" at home. But I do not think people grasp the idea of someone with severe bppv. I missed work because of it too, I mean I could not stand soo..\n\nI get vertigo all the time still, but just in flashes. I hate it but it is something we have to live with unfortunately. I am okay with it as long as I do not get the full on bppv again.\n\nAnyway, wish you luck. Like I said, physical therapy! Let me know if you have any questions! I am actually a medical professional too and I did my homework on this stuff since I basically thought I stroked out when it happened. My world literally flipped. ( After having no luck with the epley maneuver which I tried a number of times, I tried this thing, and it has since gone away! Might be worth looking into. Good luck, I wish you luck, I know how miserable it can be.", "Recently diagnosed. Residual dizziness driving me crazy. Hey all, just was diagnosed around ten days ago after my second bout of vertigo by my doctor. After the first one I did research and (correctly) diagnosed myself with BPPV so I started the Epley right away. After about a week I thought I was better. \n\nI went to do an active workout and got my second bout. This is when I contacted my doctor and he told me I have bppv. Since, I have done the Epley again and again and no longer have had any vertigo symptoms for almost two weeks but I have lingering dizziness. Is this something that I will just have now? The only time I get very dizzy is when laying down so I have been propping up the last few nights hoping to speed the process up but its starting to feel like I am just going to be this way forever. Currently going through Vestibular Neuritis myself.\n\nI was incorrectly diagnosed with BPPV.\n\nHowever both my issues, and BPPV does eventually go away, and you will be back to normal.\n\nFor some people it takes days, weeks, or even a couple of months for the after-dizzyness, lagging feeling to subside. Thanks for the response. I am also wondering if I need to continue to sleep upright until this feeling goes away? I know for BPPV when you lay down, they suggest you prop your head up above your shoulders, so yes, I would continue to do so. My doctor recommended 7-10 days of upright sleep post epley Also, anyone know if I still be doing the Epley maneuver every day as a precaution?  Or can that start to have negative effects once my vertigo has subsided? I have found everyone is story is a bit different, and the info they get from their doctor or therapist is different as well.  I will share with you what I have experienced. My last episode was my 4th episode in a bit over 2 years. The first 3 were milder (although the first sent me to the ER, as I had no clue what was going on).  I will focus on this last episode, as it was the worst and I finally sought help. My regular doc, the neurologist, and ENT did not offer much help. It was the Vestibular Therapist (physical therapist that specializes in all types of dizziness) that TRULY helped me. The info I will share, came directly from her, and she continues to study BPPV.\n\nI had active BPPV for over 2 months. I went for therapy weekly, which included the Epley maneuver twice each time. I also did the Epley at home in between sessions, along with the Half Summersault.  Each Epley maneuver triggered severe vertigo and nystagmus TWICE (the first step, which is the Dix Hallpike that tests for BPPV with watching the direction of the nystagmus) triggered it, and the last step of sitting back up.  It took 20 Epley maneuvers over the course of two months to finally get a negative Dix Hallpike (no vertigo or nystagmus when being laid back). It was horrible. I wore these goggles that videoed my eye nystagmus so she could accurately diagnose which canal the crystal was in. She also did many other tests to check for other conditions.\n\nThe residual dizziness is still with me 3 months later. It improves slightly weekly. Not daily. It takes a whole week for me to notice a slight improvement. I also developed gaze instability during my active BPPV.  So, I had dizziness while moving, while sitting still, and even while closing my eyes. I was given many exercises to help with this.\n\nThe main reason for the exercises, is to get your balance system back in sync after the crystal is back where it belongs. For me, I had BPPV for over 2 months, so my system had gotten somewhat used to being 'off.'  Now I had to retrain it.  This started with looking up and down 15 times, 3 times a day.  And moving my head side to side 15 times, 3 times a day. Then focus on an object (like your thumb, held right in front of you), and move your head those same directions. Then I would do this while walking, then while running (I am a runner - so do not do this if you typically do not run!) The goal is to challenge your system to once again become balanced.\n\nOne week, I would have residual dizziness looking up and down (wooziness or floating).  So I would walk around looking up and down. A week later, that was better, but I would be dizzy looking sideways. So I would challenge that. It slowly gets better - but for me, it changes weekly.\n\nMy therapist told me to get back to sleeping flat as soon as I can. She said the restrictions of sleeping with your head propped up is old news. Studies indicate that is not necessary. I am slowly getting back to sleeping flatter....but sometimes, I just am more comfortable propped up a bit. Perhaps it is the fear of vertigo returning. I do not know. She has encouraged me to be as active as possible and keep moving my head as much a possible.\n\nIt is frustrating.  It is a slow process.  Studies are all over the board on what is right and wrong. I am trusting my therapist, as she is had BPPV herself. I also know I want this to be over and I never want to have it again. So I am doing everything in my power to help fix it and hope it never comes back (which I know it will). I never had an 'ah ha' moment of knowing exactly when the crystal finally got back where it needed to be. I remember the last Epley I did. And I know that weekend I went snowmobiling and rode HARD. Then back in to my appointment still feeling really crummy. She laid me back - and no symptoms. I have tested myself often right after BPPV was better.  Still negative, even though I felt so dizzy yet. But I am trusting time and therapy will help.\n\nSome people do the Epley once and are miraculously cured. That was not my case. And now, 3 months of residual dizziness, and I feel like by the time I am finally all the way better, BPPV will strike again.  Yet, I am WAY better today than I was a few months ago. So there is hope! Hang in there! My best advice is to find a good therapist to help guide you. I got so worried that anxiety hit pretty hard too.  My therapist even helped take the fear away.  The dizziness feeds off anxiety as well.\n\nKeep us posted on your progress. This forum is good for people to read other's experiences and learn from them, or find hope, and know they are not alone. Sorry to hear that. I had my first BPPV episode back in September of last year. I had residual dizziness for almost 2 months. Not sure if mine was longer because I took longer to treat the vertigo but I just wanted to let you know that it does go away. Doing vestibular rehabilitation exercises help a lot and continuing daily motions help sync your inner ear and brain back to normal. Hope you feel your normal self soon! xx I have wondered this myself. I was told it would not have negative effects. But, it would not really act as a precaution either. One study has shown that sometimes you have very tiny crystals floating around, that are too small to cause discomfort or vertigo. But that eventually they will clump together and then cause BPPV. Thoughts of doing the Epley often would keep those tiny crystals out of the canal were somewhat shot down, as they are so tiny, that the force of gravity would not really flush them out of your canal (versus the larger crystal that causes full blown BPPV).  Because truly, if doing the Epley 20 times a day would keep this from ever happening again, I think we would all do it!!!! If anyone has info or studies to show anything differently, I would be excited to hear them. I would think you do not need to do the Epley anymore since the vertigo has gone away. Once my vertigo went away, I just kept sleeping slightly elevated and kept doing my normal routine. Eventually the residual dizziness went away and I went back to sleeping like normal. I agree. I continued to sleep slightly elevated (getting flatter and flatter as the weeks when on) until my residual dizziness went away completely. I now sleep normal. But I have adapted to sleeping on my back, I guess just over time it just got more comfortable. Hm interesting. I sure the heck hope those little crystals are not floating around in there! Lol I believe there is a a cause that is making those crystals come out. The inner ear is designed to keep them in place so something has to be causing them to come out. Whether it is from a nutritional deficiency like Vit D, increased intercrainial pressure from medications or trauma. Obviously with age...skin, tissue , bone etc become weaker and thinner naturally thus allowing the otoliths to come out but why younger folks get it is a mystery. I am pretty convinced my episode was from increased intercranial pressure from an medication I was given...but like I said I do not really know. Right now, all we can do is keep up a healthy lifestyle, watch what we put into our bodies and hope we do not get another episode because I tell you what, I NEVER want to have another BPPV episode. Geez....worst experience ever. 0/5 stars. Would not recommend. I wish I knew why has been happening to me. I am on no medications. Have had no past head trauma. I eat healthy &amp; am very active with tons of different sports &amp; hobbies. Blood tests have come back excellent. The docs say I am the perfect example of what everyone strives for. Yet.... BPPV left me feeling near death fur months. And no one gets it.... Because I look healthy. And 'dizziness is no big deal.' Ugh. I sure hope more research continues to be done. We need to know why, how to prevent, how to better treat, etc. It is truly horrible. I do not take days that I feel good for granted any more! Yes, this! Exactly what you said! \u2764\ufe0f Same me too! I am an athlete and took some medication briefly for a skin issue and had bppv a week after finishing that medication. Wish we had the answers. Weird how some are plagued with it for years on and off and some will have it once in a lifetime. This is what I am doing as well (and have in the past). My therapist told me to not be afraid to get back to sleeping flat and on my bad side. But.... It is taking time to get there. That residual dizziness is yucky &amp; can still create anxiety that it is going to return. I understand. I am still not comfortable laying on my bad side. I get anxiety doing sit ups and such still because I worry about loosing those crystals but I just have to remind myself that I have to live my life at least if it happens again I will know what I need to do, but I can only hope that it never does and do my best to take better care of myself. I wonder if my neck issues were a possible cause too. Who knows. I have not fully rolled over onto my bad side yet either! I will try to slowly go part way at least once during the night. But you are right.... The anxiety certain things cause. Not ready to tackle it yet! 3 months of residual dizziness (/ lightheadedness) checking in. I could initially trigger vertigo thru dix hallpike, but no one around to observe nystagmus.  Teledoc supposed BPPV, and suggested looking up and performing Epley maneuver.  After that, I could not trigger vertigo via dix hallpike anymore, but lightheadedness has not subsided more than a little.  Otoneurologist ruled out vestibular disease, and also disbelieves BPPV due to absence of nystagmus. He does not have any suggestions now other than migraine, which seems both wrong and stupid IMO.  \ud83d\ude43\n\nLike others in this thread, I also suspect finer particles in the canals. I wonder whether vestibular PT exercises actually do anything useful to \"retrain\" the brain, or if the movements are actually just moving the fluids around and allowing finer particles to deposit back onto larger otoconia where they should be. \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af\n\nWould super love to be rid of it and back to normal soon.", "Third attack in six months The first one I fixed pretty readily with the Epley. The second one was much worse, and left me with about 48 hours of intense symptoms afterward. Nausea, lightheadedness, floaty feeling. This week I started PT for a different issue, but one of the movements causes BPPV by the end of the set. I have been able to reliably fix it quickly, but it is frustrating. I am going to talk to my therapist to see if we can change the exercises when I see him next.\n\nI do not need anything in particular, I am just complaining.  I would like to be able to enjoy life without fearing another attack.  When it first starts I get incredibly anxious and snippy. My family is understanding, but I feel guilty regardless. I hear you! My friend's three year old threw a ball high over my shoulder and I whipped my head around tracking it... Instant bppv. That sounds awful, it is typically a few years or more between attacks for me. That would definitely increase my anxiety. Look into your vitamin D levels. Low vitamin D has been linked to reoccurrence rates.", "I was doing really well with vestibular therapy today. For starters, I may not have BPPV but I was recommended to do vestibular therapy by my ENT. And I thought it would be this smooth linear progress. I started getting 24/7 dizziness a year and a half ago\u2014kind of like a shifting, rocking, spinning or just moving of the floor, the chair, the bed, sometimes the whole room feels like I am at the bottom of a hamster ball. Today, I was walking straight, looking up down, to the side\u2014the floor swelled and twisted only a little. I did the Epley exercises every night for a month. Things were going well. Then I stood on a cushion and I could see the floor shifting and rocking as I tried to stand on a cushion and felt a little seasick and had to stop. And then the vestibular therapist said I did better with this exercise a year and a half ago when I first started the exercises.  Just feeling defeated and lost with no idea what causes this or makes this worse. Thanks for reading. I have similar progress and regression.  Be hopeful that you are getting better.  Your brain was processing well and improving so you know that it is possible and you are getting better.  One bad testing day with your VT may just mean you were tired, stressed, or even hormonal fluctuations.   No one really knows why we feel better one day and then worse for no apparent reason, but overall you are having more good than bad so do not let their analysis of 1 testing day bring you down!  You will get better! Do not get discouraged. I also take one step forward, two steps back.  Sadly - for some of us, it is a LONG process.  As /u/ovansan mentioned - sometimes being tired, stressed, or other things....can make dizziness worse. It is as if your body just does not have enough strength to try to fight the dizziness.  And although keeping busy helps me through this - I also have to sometimes take a step back when I have a bad day and realize that my body is telling me I just need to rest, to regain strength to fight the dizziness. Hang in there! I appreciate the support. I have never dealt with anything physical longer than 10 days in my life so to go 19 months gets rough sometimes. The adage practice makes perfect does not always work for dizziness and testing vestibular limits. I did the therapy exercises and got more nauseous when the floor started tilting and even at bedtime I could not get the bed to stop rocking. Keeping busy helps, but physical exertion makes me dizzy. Good to find a problem, I guess. Yeah, today it felt like every motion got to me, but I think it was just the therapy shakin things up, hehe. I like the taking steps back and letting go of expectations. Thanks for this. Thanks so much! Yes, this was the first \u201chad to stop\u201d session I have had of the four sessions I have had. At least it is proof I am not making this all up. Yeah, I do not know what started it, but when I saw the floor rocking yesterday, it reminded me of how I felt when I saw the floor rocking at work two months ago and almost fell when it twisted under me. Just out of the blue. I feel like this is improving, but like walking on a healing leg, is going to be uncomfortable sometimes. Thanks for your encouragement.", "I am absolutely scared to death Hello all. \nI did not even know BPPV was a thing until I googled \u201cdizziness when lying down\u201d. It started yesterday for me. I woke up this morning (I am in Europe) and felt like everything was spinning, it was awful because I also feel nauseous. I drank some water and sat on my bed for at least 30 minutes. \n\nI tried to go to sleep again, on my right side. It came back after 10 or so seconds and now I am here writing this and shaking because I do not feel normal. I cannot even sleep without feeling dizzy and nauseous. It feels worse every time. I feel like I did not throw up because I have no food on my stomach.\n\nWhy does it happen? How can I make it go away? \n\nI am a healthy female, not overweight, do not smoke, always exercise, diet low in added sugars, eat mostly in a Mediterranean diet. I take vitamin pills.\n\nPlease help! I am reading this whole sub. Google \u2018half somersault\u2019 and give it a shot. If this is BPPV, this may help. Thank you! I was reading about the difference between dizziness and vertigo and what I have is definitely vertigo. It is something I cannot explain and the feeling is terrifying. \n\nShould I take Dramamine before doing this maneuver? Should I keep my eyes open or closed? I have vertigo does not matter if they are closed or not. first, if you do have bppv its not supposed to be a serious ailment. its not fun but unless youre falling and potentially hitting your head youre going to be ok.\n\ni had bppv for a month (long story) before i got to an ent (ear nose and throat) dr. my ent dr had a specialist who knew how to perform the dix-hallpike maneuver (figures our which side youre affected) and the epley maneuver (repositions that crystal in your ear). those maneuvers solved my problem. whew!\n\nyou can try these maneuvers yourself but i couldnt do them correctly so they didnt work for me.\n\ni highly recommend getting to an ent dr or someone similar who is familiar with diagnosing and resolving bppv. It does not matter. I do not find that Dramamine helps at all. And eyes opened or closed does not matter either. Hi. My right ear is affected. I slept on my left side after writing this post and while it left my head spinning  a little bit, I was fine. It is not fun at all mostly because of nausea and the vertigo. Just be forewarned, that if you truly DO have BPPV and attempt the Epley, it WILL provoke the 20ish seconds of violent vertigo.  The first step of the Epley (laying back with your head turned to the side) is actually also called the Dix Hallpike, and that is used to help determine which side is effected.  If you think it is your right ear.....you could first try laying back with your head tilted to the left. If there are no symptoms upon laying back, sit back up and try the right side. If that is the side with problems, you will get that nasty brief period of vertigo. Then you can move into the last steps of the Epley.  For me - I would experience the intense vertigo during the first and last step always (until the crystal was cleared).  Or - as suggested, you can try the Half Somersault. I never got symptoms while doing that - but it is a bit easier to try on your own.\n\nI am similar to you - healthy, exercise, not overweight, not on medications, good diet, very active.....and I have had 4 bouts of BPPV within the last 3 years.  It truly sucks not knowing what causes it and how to prevent it. My last episode was super tricky and took forever to fix....leaving me with months of residual dizziness.  Kudos to you for taking care of it right away!  Fingers crossed you find relief quickly.\n\nAlso - finding a dizzy specialist (vestibular therapist) will help TONS if you find you need additional support and help. I had a recent episode Wednesday morning. The ENT performing the Epley was better for me vs me trying it by myself. My third BPPV attack in 2 yrs. I felt much worse shortly after giving me the Epley maneuver. It felt weird them celebrating I was \u201ccured\u201d while I was still puking and bound to a wheelchair to enter and leave the place. lol. However, my second night this go around has been MUCH better than the 2nd night from my previous attacks. The Epley works, but it does not make you feel 100% better after performing it. It actually makes you feel worse in the short term. Good luck. I am still recovering from my recent episode. You are going to be ok! Try to relax, I know its completely hard to do when everything is spinning. Vertigo is very common, a lot of people I know have it. Go see an ENT, they will prescribe medication and physical therapy. The first time I went for vertigo I was a little dizzy and they claimed I did not have it. A year later, I sat up in my bed completely dizzy, I had to lay back down. It felt like my body was being dragged to lay down. I went to PT and we did the epley on my left side first, nothing, we did it on my right side and I literally screamed because the dizziness was so bad. We did it again and it was not as bad the more we did it. Some people it takes weeks or months to get over it. A couple months later I got it on my left side, but not as violent. Whenever I feel residual dizziness I do the epley myself and it works. Just make sure to have someone with you. Feel better!! I have had it twice. Do not worry at all. It looks like a very scary thing, but it is not serious whatsoever. My first BPPV got resolved by itself after a day or two. My second one was more stubborn, and I had to see a vestibular therapist for that. She did Epley maneuver on me, and on my right side, the world spun. But after that, I was fine, and the BPPV was gone.\n\nJust schedule an appt with a vestibular therapist or an ENT doc. Yeppp I had this same reaction. 27 year old non smoker do not drink all the beautiful works. I had to see a Phsyical therapist to make it go away but now I am three weeks with no dizziness. Good luck and go see a doctor please! It is usually easy to diagnose 5000iu/day vitamin d3 gel caps", "Question about Bppv Hi guys thank you for taking the time to read my post. About 4 weeks ago I developed a sickness which caused dizziness, headache, lack of strength, and a little vomiting. At first I thought I had a cold so I just stayed home to rest, but a week later the dizziness still remained. I went to the emergency room and the doctor give me a CT scan for my brain, blood test, covid test , and etc. The all came back negative so the doctor said I might be too stressed so  just go back home to rest. It is been almost a month now, all the other symptoms have been cured except for the dizziness. This dizziness only occurs when I change in position, usually normal when I am lying down and sitting. But when I am standing up I feel really heavy in the head and light on the body. The dizzy feeling does not go away when I am standing up unless I sit back down. The dizzy feeling is not that significant, it just feels really uncomfortable and it gets worst if I start running. I was wondering if anyone encountered similar situation as I did, and is this a sign of bppv? probably doesnt hurt to try the self diagnosis to see if the left or right side triggers it...if so, perhaps try to epley maneuver and see if it fixes the issue You could ask Dr for a script to pt so they could do the dix hallpike and see.  Sometimes being sick seems to trigger crystals going into the ear canals. ohhh, so a PT can also diagnose if I have Bppv or not? Because my doctor told me only the specialist can. Most pts are trained in doing the diagnosis and maneuvers.  Do you have a fyzical location near you?  They definitely do.  Just call your local pt companies and ask them if they help with dizziness and balance.  If it is straightforward bppv you will only need a couple sessions. ok thank you so much for your help! You could do the dix hallpike maneuver right now and figure it out on your own. I tried to do it but idk if I am doing it correctly, do you know what symptoms shows I have bppv when I am performing the dix Hall Pike maneuver? I saw the video online, does it have to do with your eyes? When you turn your head to the left or right and then lay down with your head hanging off the bed/table you should immediately get vertigo within seconds and your eyes will have a nystagmus.", "3 weeks, 3 doctors and still no relief. I have had vertigo for a 3 weeks now. It is awful, I can barely do normal activities or work. I cannot drive at all. All day my head is dizzy and it gets worse when I lay down. I have seen 2 doctors and went to the ER, they said everything is good with my blood test and physically (I am 29). They prescribed meclizine (did not help). I tried epley maneuver but I get super dizzy doing it and most likely did not do it properly. Please help. Just FYI when you do the Epley you do get dizzy at first. At least I do. It sucks but after about 30-45 seconds it goes away for me. I find it helpful after doing the Epley not to resume my normal sleeping posture for like 48 hours. I sleep propped up like at a 45 degree angle. Exercising will also help with the recovery process even just brisk walks. Yes I do get dizzy but after completion I still have the symptoms. That happens to me too sometimes. I was told to do it 3 times a day until it resolves and eventually it does. You should look up someone that specializes specifically in treating these type of dizziness/balance issues.  Thanks I did find a dizziness specialist near me. Hopefully that helps. I hate feeling like this. I have been dealing with it for a few months and it comes and goes but lately I have more better days. So you probably will recover if it is BPPV, but might take time. My doctor said many people bounce back on their own in a few weeks but a lot do not and it is not abnormal to fall into the group that takes a while. Can you get to a physical therapist or ENT? It took me several Epley maneuvers with the right practitioner before I even started to feel relief but then finally did (once it was done correctly- and that is key, to make sure it done right) and it is only gotten better with the rest  I have done. Thanks for the reply. What is a Ent? I found a dizziness and balance specialist that I am going to see tomorrow. I have not been able to pull off the maneuvers at home myself. Also this does not seem to be getting better by itself. So I am definitely going to need a professionals help. I hope there able to resolve it. I have done a ton off googling and people are saying when it is done right, the problem instantly goes away. Yes all 3 doctors said it is vertigo but there were specialists just general physicians.  I hate feeling like that too. I have had attacks a few months apart but i also didnt have any attacks for like five years. You learn to adapt and it does get better. Mine has been constant for two weeks. Going to see a ENT tomorrow. Praying that solves it. Do you have constant vertigo in any position? Yes and it is really bad if I am in a car. Also bad laying down sometimes. I have had it all day for 3 weeks now. Walking seems to help slightly. Have you gone to a physical therapist?  I had debilitating BPPV for weeks and PT was the most helpful. He performed the Epley a few times and so sympathetic when a sat on the edge of the table heaving into a vomit bucket. I am so sorry, it is the worst! No I am going tomorrow.  Thank for the reply. ent = ear nose &amp; throat dr.\n\ni saw an ent for my bppv. resolved it with the epley. most ent's are very familiar with bppv and are experienced with resolving your issue. i highly recommend seeing one. good luck. I hope you get answers with seeing the specialist. They are able to test for many types of dizzy conditions.  Vertigo is a symptom (whereas BPPV is a diagnosis of a specific kind of vertigo).  And there are MANY different things that could be causing your vertigo.  The Epley is not going to work if you have not determined which ear canal is effected and which side to treat. There are 6 inner ear canals that could be effected, and different maneuvers to help each ear canal. So hopefully the specialist gets things figured out for you and you can get on the road to recovery! Please report back and let us know what you find out.  It took me two months of working with an awesome vestibular therapist, and over 20 Epley.  As mentioned, for SOME, it is an easy fix. For others, it takes a while.  So hang in there! I am glad you made an appointment with a specialist, general practitioners are hit and miss when it comes to having any experience at all with BPPV, and the bigger issue is that the loose crystal is not always in the canal that the Epley works on. The specialist will be able to tell what canal is affected and what procedure to try. Please be aware that it still will not necessarily go away instantly (sometimes those crystals are stubborn!), hopefully it does for you though. Thanks going to see one today Thank you going to see a ent today. Thank you, I\u2019n going to see a ent today. I hope you feel better soon! The epley made me feel worse too. I wish I could help but literally nothing has ever made my vertigo feel better Thanks I did epley maneuver at home and it did help the next day. I had to do it multiple times to get it right. Also seeing a ent this week. It sounds like they gave you anti nausea meds, but the only thing that actually gets rid of it for me (I get BPPV every 1-3 years randomly) is a steroid shot and z-pack. I will usually wait 2-3 days before I give in and go get the shot. (I am on day 1 right now, haha.)\n\n**Disclaimer**: I have no idea if this is a standard/proper treatment. I go to urgent care and that is what they do after Dix Hallpike test. Each time, it is been a huge relief within mere hours. I am scared for the day it does not work because I will probably lose my mind.\n\nI really hope you feel better soon, I could not endure weeks of this. Thank you for the reply. It is awful, I went to the ER and they just gave me an IV and ran a cat scan. Everything was good. They did not try dix hallpike test. I am going to make an appointment with a ENT to get that test done and the the epley maneuver done. I am generally seeing many people who found relief through that. Yeah i had bad vertigo despite seeing a few therapists (multiple epleys -  did not work). \n\nWhere are you? If you are anywhere near Southern California, go see Dr. Mango in Newport: \n\nI had severe vertigo. Went to see Dr. Mango and they fixed it after going through a day of diagnostic testing. Yeah. It is indescribably awful. You need to see a specialist. I am in New Jersey and I tried to make an appointment today but was not able to reach them. Im going to try again tomorrow. I will this week, Thanks. Oh, I will add that the Epley manuever does absolutely nothing for me. I still try it several times per day, because why not, but it is never actually helped.\n\nSteroids on the other hand, consistently have me nearly 100% within 24 hours. I do not really like to take meds but after 2-3 days of this I will probably take anything... Well I have read that doing at home you might not be preforming it accurately so still I will try the maneuver with a doctor before pill or injections. I am not a medication taking type unless I absolutely have to. Also I appreciate the help. Hopefully soon I will be back to normal. Yeah, they show me each time how to do the maneuver. They have you do it a few times - with help and then without. I think you have to do it a certain way depending on which side is the issue.\n\nI hear you though. You are a stronger human than me if you can live like this for weeks and not be like \"I will take anything!!\" Haha Lol believe me I thought I was strong until this happened. This kicked my ass. There have been days we are I thought I was going to just collapse. Just an update - I have been practicing the epley maneuver for a few days (I got my sister to help me do it) and today I woke up and I was 90% better. My dizziness is almost gone. Thank god, I am going to keep doing it with her helping me. Thank you to everyone that tried to help me. I really appreciate it. The symptoms were unbearable and now I am almost back to normal.", "Vestibular Migraines (MAV) I just learned that this is a thing:\n\n(  \n\n\nDoctors often talk about BPPV vs Meniere's disease, but MAV is a third option to look into.  \n\n\n\\&gt; Most people associate migraine with severe head pain and a period of incapacitation. However, a large portion of people with migraine often have no accompanying pain, their predominant symptom instead being vertigo (a spinning sensation) or dizziness/ disequilibrium (balance loss), mental confusion, disorientation, dysarthria, visual distortion or altered visual clarity, or extremity paresis.  \n\n\nAs someone who appears to have vertigo episodes during weather/temperature shifts, this really struck a cord with me! My neuro thought it was migraine related too. She put me on Amitriptyline and although the vertigo and general dizziness did not go away completely, it is made things a lot better. I am just thankful I do not get the associated pain. Very interesting! I do not yet have a neuro, but thinking of exploring this direction now. I just cannot believe that my doctor, three physios and an ENT did not even mention MAV. I am waiting to see a doctor. I am pretty confident I have bppv cause eppley maneuver helps, but I am having other symptoms too. Great article, insightful, something to talk to the doctor about. Nice! If epley helps, that is promising. What is your go-to-guide for Epley? (Specific youtube video?)  \nI keep watching random youtube videos with the instructions. It will feel like it is working (spinning will subside after waiting for a few minutes on each side) but when I get up it is never resolved. I cannot tell if I am doing it wrong or if my vertigo is just not BPPV related. Sad! I have been diagnosed with MAV, but I am still not 100% if it is. It certainly feels like I am dying sometimes. Ocassionally during severe episodes I kind of get this \"I am on an acid trip\" feeling. I take Klonopin to help with it, and have used benzos since the start of issues so I do wonder since they also treat seizure disorders if I am possibly running into something else. My episodes certainly last longer than seizures though so, I assume a 'migraine' is probably the best way to put it. I believe I have bppv and developed MAV as a result (or something) and can relate to feeling like I am on drugs when I get the fuzzy/hazy head feeling. Mostly feel like I am stoned/really dumb because I cannot really focus or read properly.\n\nMigraines are pretty wacky! \n\nI have been seeing an osteopath for the hazy head feeling, to be determined if that will fix me up. Feel free to share your neuro info! I have not seen a neurologist yet, I am curious what they tell you.  There is varying degrees of what you are saying. When my initial symptoms show up it is confusion/visual disturbances/disoriented, but this shit is no joke like I took a tab of acid or someone did without me knowing. It is only happened a few times, and the times it has I have usually gone to the hospital and no one gives a shit so I stopped going. Just really hoping I can get whatever the fuck is going on figured out.  Ah, I read Neurotologist as Neurologist in your last post. My bad! Still interesting...!  \nDid your MD just associate your acid-esque visuals with migraine aura? I *have* heard that \"aura\" can get pretty weird, visually. I have had aura in the past (15 years ago) but it moreso just gave me blockers in my vision.  \n\n\nYeah, my trajectory so far has been:\n\n1. See physician (Refers me to ENT)\n2. See vestibular physiotherapist (Cannot detect Nystagmus, suspects it is **Meniere's**)\n3. See ENT (Rules out Meniere's, suspects it is **BPPV**)\n4. See Osteopath (Suspects it is lateral **BPPV** and probably **MAV**)\n5. See physician to catch up (Does not seem to think I have **MAV**, kind of thinks it is ALL anxiety induced, now sending me for an *MRI*)  \n\n\nCan confirm I feel like shit all of a sudden and get visual &amp; focusing issues, but I will sometimes get a slight spin WITH that. OR I will get a plain old vertigo spin without any other of the shitty migraine-esque symptoms.  \n\n\nThis boat sucks.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B; My PA was 100% about BPPV. The neurologist was instantly set on it being MAV. After the vestibular therapist (which is interesting they could not get you to show signs of BPPV yet everyone after you saw them thinks its BPPV). I certainly have ear issues and have had them for a long time. I do not know if it is something that caught up with me, or not. I am honestly going to be surprised if any adjustments to my ears will fix anything. But I will follow up tomorrow after my neurotologist visit.  Well to follow up. I saw the ear brain guy today he thinks my neurologist is right and it is MAV. Basically just talks about changing medicine up, no real progress unfortunately. Hope you get your situation figured out. Cool! Not that I know a ton about it yet, but osteopaths at least know how to deal with some of the MAV symptoms so that might be another route for you at least! \n\nMy MRI got scheduled in 6 days so I guess imma do that Monday \ud83d\udc40 not looking forward to that. ", "How can you tell if crystals are in the horizontal or anterior canals? I have done the Epley Maneuver multiple times ever since getting vertigo last summer but nothing ever completely got rid of it. \n\nHalf a year back, I did the Epley myself at home but I think I did it at the wrong angle as my head was hanging too low and I also did it on both sides when apparently only my right was affected. Things got better for a while, but I have been to the hair salon and had to lay flat to get my hair washed, I have been to the dentist, and gotten my eyebrows threaded. All of these things gave me vertigo lying down on my back. \n\nLast week I saw a PT who helped me with the Epley (she said my right ear is affected). Since then I have been having residual dizziness which is normal, but last night got woken up by spinning. \n\nHow would I know I do not have any crystals in multiple areas such as the horizontal and/or anterior canal?", "First experience with BPPV I have a lot of rambling to do, I havent had anyone to really talk to about this aside from medical people. TL;DR at the end if you want to skip the play by play, however last paragraph has most of my questions in ramble form. \n\n\n\nThis was absolute hell. It started back in end of May early June. At first I just felt nauseated and out off whenever I would go outside to smoke and then I would feel a little off after. Then one day I woke up and moved my head and everything moved with me. I started throwing up and couldnt stop. The whole room would spin and the only way I got relief was to lay on my left side. I ended up going to hospital after a week of being unable to keep anything down where they did some blood work, xrays on my stomach because apparently me saying my stomach doesnt hurt was not believable and put me on fluids and gave me an IV with meds to help stop the vomiting. The Doctor there said it was vertigo gave me a 2 week prescription and sent me on my way with no other advice on what to do. \n\nI had to send my son to stay with family because I couldnt take care of him. And when I filled the prescription the pharmacist told me what to do so I called my family doctor and made an appointment with a physiotherapist. \n\nFast forward Eply(sp?) Maneuver was done at multiple visits. I was constantly asked if I hit my head or if I was in an accident and I wasnt this happened out of no where. \nI went to the PT 4 times and was given exercises to do. \n\nTowards the end of July I was able to start sleeping on my right side again. Moving more. Feeling better. Made an appointment for in person with my family doctor who said there is still some vibration in my eyes but how well I am doing is really promising. \n\nI have gone a week now without the pills or gravol. I am having a hard time getting up and moving again after being bed bound for 2 months. It takes me a lot of time to do anything, and then I am super sore the next day like I did a full body work out. I also still get a bit dizzy when I bend over or do too much or do stuff for too long. \n\nThe only upside to all this is I quit smoking because I was too sick to do so. \n\nSo my son has since come home and life is starting to get back a to normal a bit. However I am constantly scared. I am a single mom and being away from my son for so long was awful. I put on weight because once I was taking gravol every day I was able to eat but was too dizzy to cook so ordered in every day for 2 months. Im also petrified that this is going to come back because we dont know why or how it happened. I have a referral to an ENT that I am waiting for an appointment so now it is just a waiting game. \n\nSo what do I do now? How do I stop this from happening again? Is there anything else I should be doing to make sure I am see everyone I should? How do I get back to normal as in doing things like i used to? I think I am afraid to set it off because I dont know what caused it to begin with... I just.. I dont know what to do or how to progress from here... I am constantly scared... I dont know how to move forward. I really dont want to go through this again... I really dont some days I even had suicidal ideation to make it stop...(I am bipolar 2 so this really pushed me off my routine and being alone so sick with no answers really pushed me into a low) anyone who is been through this... any advice.. I am just scared... \n\n\nTL;DR : recovering from BPPV, need advice on how to not be scared anymore and on what steps I should be taking to ensure recovery sticks as well as how to not be scared to get back to normal life because I dont want to cause symptoms again and we dont know what caused it to begin with as I didnt hit my head or have an accident. \n\nIf you read the whole thing, you the real MVP. Thank you to anyone who had any advice for me. &gt; The Doctor there said it was vertigo gave me a 2 week prescription and sent me on my way with no other advice on what to do\n\nThis pisses me off so much. The Drs who do this have clearly never had BPPV and do not know how debilitating and demoralizing it is! \"Oh yeah, I have been drunk and the room has been spinning but it is not so bad\". NOPE! BPPV is a whole 'nother level. And this does just happen out of nowhere: My first episode was then I turned my head from one side to the other when I was sleeping! It happens more frequently as people age and when you start asking around you will find that lots of people have had it but may not have recognized what was going on, or have had a mild attack.\n\nEveryone on here knows what you are going through. The fear of it coming back, the concern that you will not be able to function again. There is not much you can really do to prevent it. Sure, there are some easy things: stay hydrated, take vitamin D (there may be a connection to low levels), and be careful and deliberate in your movements. For instance, do not bend over but instead bend at your knees, no fast head movements, roller coasters are out! You should also read up on the Epley, Semont, Foster, and Brandt-Daroff meanuevers. Some seem to work better than others for folks. The most important thing you need to do is have a PT who is good with balance issues on speed dial!\n\nIt is super scary and what made it worse for you is that you had to deal with it for so long. That is so demoralizing and it took it out of you physically. You are doing better now and for a while you will be living in dread of this (PTSD) but over time you will start to forget how bad it is, and you will start living again. That is fantastic! \n\nI am sorry to say that it will come back but when it does you will be prepared. No going to a Dr, but instead straight to the PT to get it knocked out.\n\nI hope this helps. Reach out to us anytime. Thanks for this. I really hope it doesnt come back, I didnt know about the dehydration/vitamin D thing I will be sure to follow up with that. I still have to get the blood work my dr ordered to check things like my sugars, thyroid, iron levels and some other stuff but other than that I am just waiting for everything to fall into place. I wouldnt wish this on anyone, not even the worst person in the world. I am tired of constantly being afraid and I hate how easily exhausted I get after spending 2 months in bed. Hopefully I will be more normal soon. I am hoping to go back to work the end of this month finally so fingers crossed on that :)", "Do I need a second opinion? Sorry for the length, but I need to get my life back to normal.    :(\n\nExperienced vertigo (with horrific vomiting- the worst) about 8 weeks ago; it was a couple of hours initially of the most uncomfortable symptoms and took a week to go to urgent care because I was not feeling well enough until then\u2014 for two days after the initial attack I needed help just walking to the bathroom. And then another two weeks to get into a ENT\u2014 so altogether, from attack to ENT it was 3 weeks. The ENT said it must have been BPPV and checked my ears, then said come back in four weeks to check in but there is nothing to do but take some allergy meds and it will probably resolve by the follow-up.\n\nFour weeks comes and goes and while the spinning and vomiting are gone I am feeling like I am on a tiny boat in the middle of a hurricane most of the day, nauseous all the time but forcing myself to eat. At the follow-up appointment my ears are checked again, a discussion of lingering symptoms, and I inquire about the Epley (after much Googling, probably like many of you). He says he can do it, and then proceeds to have me turn over while he taps on the back of that bone behind your ears on both sides, and has me look to one side for a minute, then the other side. Then sends me home with a list of \u201cnot-to-do\u2019s\u201d for following the Epley; in addition, he gives me a page that says to do the Brandt-Daroff with directions, but the page itself literally reads that it has a low success rate most of the time and includes a full explanation that the Brandt-Daroff is for when you do not know what canal is affected, but he saw with my second appointment (when he finally checked for nystagmus that I have been complaing about and still have\u2014 he never checked at the first appointment) that it was my left ear. \n\nI am trying my best to have faith in whatever treatment he is experienced with and I am no healthcare practitioner\u2014 but after looking up \u201call\u201d the different maneuvers I have NO clue what he did. Has anyone had someone tap on the bones behind their ears? Is this a variation of the Epley\u2014 or ANY of the maneuvers??\n\nI am wondering if I should get a second opinion. \n\nI have followed his directions to a \u201ct\u201d though... taking allergy meds and started doing the Brandt-Daroff, in hopes that there is a reason he would have me do those instead of at-home Epley? Or something else?\n\nThanks for listening if you made it this far.\n\nTLDR; Vertigo and residual dizziness from BPPV now for several weeks... Are there variations of the Epley? Does tapping behind ears an anything with any of the BPPV treatments? I have Googled and cannot find a thing. I am truly sorry this is happening to you, it must be truly horrible to be suffering like this with no real end in sight.  \n\n\nI would say a second opinion is always helpful if you feel as though your medical care is not working to your standards. But, can I also ask one thing? Do you take any other medications that could potentially be causing this? Just a shot in the dark as I did not see that mentioned and was curious. Thanks for replying. I am on a medicine for seizures but it is been 20 years on it already and I have never had a problem with it. I actually read online a few days ago that sometimes people with vertigo get the medicine I am on because it helps them. I started wondering if it is medication related, but it seems like it would not be; I do not know.\n\nI was on an antidepressant too but came off of that a couple of weeks before this happened. I do not drink, do not smoke, no other drugs.\n\n(Edited for autocorrect error) Hmm, okay, the reason why I asked is because I know that coming off of antidepressants can cause flu/vertigo like symptoms if cold turkey. But seeing as how it had been a couple of week prior, there goes my guess. I am sure you have done extensive research into this as well, but I will keep trying! &gt;Does tapping behind ears an anything with any of the BPPV treatments?\n\nThat would actually make me have an attack. Maybe he was trying to provoke one? Is that a thing? I really do not know what is common with regard to what doctors do or how BPPV is treated outside of home remedies and OTC medicine and supplements. I did not know that those meds could do that but started reading about it last night after seeing this reply. Now that I know, I will ask the doctor that prescribed them if it could be connected- it is close enough in time that maybe my system was readjusting? \n\nI also had a controversial vaccine 6 days before this attack that anti-vaxxers (I AM NOT ONE\u2014 I believe in vaccinations! Lol) hype up negativity about, and at one point a few weeks ago in an attack of anxiety I even started questioning my own beliefs (and promptly talked myself out of that)...

Woke up on Tuesday and my world spun for 5-10 seconds. I def thought it was low blood sugar. Went about my day and was a little zonked but no spins. \n\nWednesday I could not move, so I started googling (looking at screens also was a trigger so that was fun!) and landed on what I had was probably BPPV. I did the self test, did a telehealth session and called a PT friend of mine. \n\nDid Epley twice and the spins were totally gone. So thankful I acted quickly! \n\nWas then feeling some after affects and residual dizziness and wow the fatigue! I thought: why not reddit.

The last week I have been experiencing dizziness which I have not had in a while. I kept it to myself until my mom mentioned she was having similar symptoms. We both have a history of intermittent vertigo. The only big change I have noticed is the weather suddenly dropping from 90 and humid to cool 50 degree nights with no humidity. We have not been running the air conditioning as much. I had it really bad like 2 weeks ago. Lasted about a week, too. Me. I have had it really bad this week. I am wondering if part of it could be the wildfires? It is weird though because it really started once the air started to get a better. I have been dealing with a month long episode starting right before the heat wave. I also went surfing a couple of times before that though, which might have shaken up my head a bit. Yes! My current episode (right ear) began today, and it was approximately 20 degrees cooler than normal. I fully believe it is the temperature drop \u2014 my first experience with BPPV was after a long swim last year (prolonged head under water), but I have not done anything water related in quite some time \u2014 I am convinced it is the weather. Trying to be patient and do various exercises now.\n\nEdited to add - I am on the Southeast coast Yeah. Mine is related to Eustachian tube pressure and being able to clear my tubes in general, so a change in atmospheric pressure can do it. Same... I thought that only happened to me?!? I have been experiencing this for years with on and off good and bad days. It is only this week after I had a serious BPPV event with proper vertigo that lasts 30 seconds that I am thinking I have probably had problems with these crystals for years and yet it is been undiagnosed?!?", "Hi, please help, struggling. Both ears? Hello!\n\nI have had a couple episodes of BPPV in the past but the past couple months have been really uncomfortable. I started noticing dizziness when I would lean forward or sideways, change head position etc. I did Epley as I have done in the past but the residual has been really annoying and it keeps coming back. Last time was a few weeks ago and I determined that it was in my right ear with dix hallpike. Did Epley and improved, was feeling better, then today I was messing with a malfunctioning window (head tilted back looking up high) and then moments later guiding my toddler on the stairs (leaning forward over him) when I felt it kick in again. This time I did Dix hallpike and felt like it was on the LEFT side. I called my husband in and asked him to observe my eyes, there was some nystagmus on the left side only as I suspected. So it switched ears?\n\nPCP was not too interested. She said I do have fluid in my left ear but does not look infected. I can hear fluid click in both ears when I change my head position (ie lie down on one side, several seconds later \u201cclick\u201d goes the ear).\n\nI have also been having mild pulsatile tinnitus in left ear intermittently at night, though it is been better lately (I had it for a few months in my 20\u2019s too and it went away on its own). \n\nI am a healthy 37yo woman with three kids, I do get migraines, I am under a lot of stress parenting during the pandemic. \n\nI am really anxious and upset about this honestly. So I could really use any words of support or comfort. Also does the nystagmus during dix hallpike indicate that it is indeed BPPV? I am clinging onto that because the last thing I need right now is to worry about something more serious. It is definitely positional, always brought on by a change in my head position. \n\nI plan to call an ENT on Monday but any advice... reassurance... anything is appreciated. Thank you!! BPPV is always distressing when it happens, and it is normal to be stressed. However, it is overwhelmingly benign, with nothing serious behind it.\n\nHave you seen your doctor to eliminate any other issues? The first thing mine tried to do do was the head manipulation to trigger nystagmus. If it can be made to happen, it is almost guaranteed it is 'just' BPPV.  A qualified PT (many say they know what they are doing and have experience, but really do not - find one with verifiable recommendation for BPPV specifically, if possible) could also greatly help and speed up the recovery.\n\nOther than that, if this keeps happening regularly, consider what has changed in your life that could be triggering this - diet sensitivities, hydration, allergies, ear or any head-related infection recently, etc.  Weirdest things can be contributing to BPPV. For example, I keep linking ( because it is not something you would suspect, gluten sensitivity. Of course, correlation does not imply causation, but it is still fascinating.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you feel stressed and want to chat. I have been dealing with a bunch of issues, most distressing of which is persistent dizziness, for over a year and I know how stressful it can be. I did tons of research and reading, and will have more suggestions and information (mostly encouraging) than anyone really needs.\n\nI hope you feel better really soon, I am sure you will! Hi and thank you so much for this. I am heading to bed right now, but my doctor seems to be fairly sure it is BPPV/my ears. She did not manipulate my head, but I did it myself and I know I am doing it correctly, and it definitely triggers nystagmus \u2014 I can feel my eyes doing it and my husband could see it when I asked him to observe.\n\nWhat has changed \u2014 so much! Most notably, we moved to a new house and I have had months of post nasal drip. \n\nI am going to respond again more properly in the morning to all your helpful suggestions and insight. And I would love to chat more. Thank you!! How do you clean your ears? Have you tried one of those wax removal sprays? I also had BPPV this summer and in the past few weeks I noticed some pain in my ear, occasional tinnitus, and headaches. Sure enough, I started to panic, but it all disappeared short after I began to use an over the counter ear spray twice a day. (To my shame, I never used one before this...) That ear spray was the only idea I came up with, the only thing I could try at home before going to a specialist, in case the situation got out of control. 33F with three kids here, so I kind of get you. Wish you all the best, I hope you feel better soon!", "Is this BPPV? Hello all, I have a Dr. appointment next week but wanted to see if my symptoms match BPPV. So I have been dealing with this for about a year ever since I had an episode of vestibular neuronitis that the Dr. treated. Usually about once a month I will get a 1 minute episode of vertigo, followed by nausea for a few hours and a headache that lasts until the end of the day. These spells almost always happen when I am standing, but not necessarily exercising or doing anything strenuous. Every now and then I will get one when I go from sitting to standing, never when I am sitting or lying down. Usually just sitting down for a few minutes helps it resolve. This week I have had 4 episodes, 2 back to back. Does this sound like BPPV? Do you have blood pressure issues? BPPV is caused by specific head movements, typically looking up or down will trigger the spinning sensation, turning from one side to another in bed, laying back in bed. I do not think this sounds like BPPV but I am not a doctor. An easy test for BPPV is to sit on the edge of your bed, turn your head halfway to one side and fall back on the bed, hold for a couple minutes, look straight up, hold a couple minutes, sit up quickly, hold a couple minutes then repeat while looking towards the other side. If it is BPPV looking towards one side will trigger vertigo but the other side will not. My blood pressure does not seem to change when I get an episode, but my Dr. and I did notice an increase in my general blood pressure when all this started. Go to your gp and ask them to test you for orthostatic hyper/hypo-tension. Ok I will try that when I get home. I have not noticed any specific head movement causing it so maybe not. Ok I will. It does seem like that would connect both issues. If you try this try your head hanging straight backwards as well. I have anterior BPPV which affects me when simply sitting still as well. No other head movements make it worse. Yeah, it does not sound like to me after having it for 15 years.\n\nIf OP closes his eyes, moves his head, and does not feel like he is going to fall over in some way... not BPPV. I have it on almost every side besides \u201cdown\u201d so just for reference so I am not 100% sure of that being a limiting factor. Episodes usually last 3-4 hours for me with 1-2 being really bad. The more I move around the better it usually gets. 3-4 hours!? That sounds awful!", "BPPV dental work??? I have porcelain veneers that need extensive work. I am so worried this will cause Crystal to move and create an episode. Any advice?", "Anyone here with PPPD? And.. has anyone recovered? Feels like it is going to be a long battle and I am really looking for some hope No but I see a lot of people with it. You want to make sure you have a good doctor, vestibular therapist and psychologist. Each have their own important role to play. Important to remember that it is your brain that needs a little help finding the right path again, and do not be confused with \u201cit is all in your head\u201d. Give it time and patience. Sometimes the road to recovery is not a straight shot up and you can dip a little on the way, there may be set backs, but keep persevering. You can do it! Can you explain your daily symptoms etc? I have PPPD. My situation has greatly improved since being on Sertraline. It still pops up from time to time but overall I am much better. I am not a doctor so not one to comment on the prevalence of this ailment or your particular case. \n\nHowever, I can share my story and also what I learnt through a ridiculous amount of research. \n\nHad BPPV, then \u2018diagnosed with PPPD\u2019 - did not get better after a lot of vestibular rehab, no desensitisation etc. I insisted smth was still physiologically wrong. Went to a different specialist - I was also unilateral hypofunction. So had to treat that with targeted physio. Then I still had some problems, with my eyes in particular. Yes, visual vertigo, but again, of the sort that also caused eye strain, trouble with reading etc - turns out it was also a problem with eyes, one that was turned down by 6 optometrists.\n\nMy point is not to say that you should go on a wild chase of all possible causes - but I do remember reading that a lot of physicians consider this diagnosis a sort of include all category, often glossing over other issues or dismissing them as unimportant.\n\nSo I would say be curious (without obsessing, if that is possible), also do your own research and question things. I found this informative:\n\n\n\nPS: I know a lot of people will disagree in that we should generally trust the advice/diagnosis of all docs. However, information is empowering - only you know your symptoms and only you have the determination to get to the bottom of this. It is sometimes the case that doctors are not accustomed enough with some conditions. Best of luck! OMG, I had never seen the term PPPD before but after reading a little about it this seems like EXACTLY what I have been experience for months. If what I am going through is anything like yours, it will indeed be a long battle. I woke up from a dream at 2AM with dizziness back in Sept 2019 and I still do not feel like myself. \n\nI still feel like shit, but I am so glad to have stumbled onto this post so that I can start finding doctors that can help with this specific issue, Thank you for posting. I second this. Had a case of \u201cvestibular neuritis\u201d and a year later was diagnosed with PPPD. I refused medication for quite a while until I could not function. Started sertraline and I have improved a lot in the past few months. Hope you figure yours out! What was the final diagnosis on your situation and are you better now? Not sure what you mean by final diagnosis? think they mean what was wrong wth your eyes? Yes that is what I meant and sorry for not being more clear I am still kind of midway on that path (corona, cries) - I will update you when I receive 100% confirmation of my diagnosis.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to know more about this, you could read about 'sensory mismatch theory' and 'somatosensory/proprioceptive loops', Have you found anything that helps? I have PPPD and it has been very difficult. I started an Ssri and am praying it works. No I have not. I have been dealing with this for eight months and I am really starting to lose faith and hope it is going to go away. I am not handling it well and depression/anxiety are starting to really hurt me. The worst part is I cannot see or find the doctors I need because of this fucking virus. I did not do well in the Lexapro, it made me more depressed, anxious, and made my insomnia worse. Also made my body hurt like hell. Do you think all this shit could be caused by something called digital dizziness. Like from computers and phones and tv\u2019s. Do you spend a lot of time on these? I read that maybe the blue light, or animation, or blinking from led lights or the new cfl light bulbs might fuck up your brain. I mean I spend literally ALL day on my laptop and phone and TV. I am a software engineer so my job is just being on a laptop all day. When I am not working one of my only hobbies is video games so I am always doing that. And when I wake up and go to bed I am on my phone.\n\nHowever, I have been like this my entire life. I am 26 now but I have been starting at screens all my life and its NEVER been an issue in the past. So I do not understand why it would have come on in my sleep on a random tuesday last september, ya know? Have you gone through the diagnosis yet? Hope it is nothing important Confirmed binocular vision dysfunction - with a vertical component. Still waiting on my glasses because of corona but will update", "I finally figured out my primary trigger!!! Today is the first day I have had with no dizziness at all in months. It feels incredible. Because I finally got it.\n\nIts when I lean over a certain way (of course). I will share in case it helps someone. \n\nThe thing is that its not positional. I can lean over the same way 10 times, but if I do something else, that is when the dizziness shows up.\n\nYears of weightlifting have basically gotten me to brace my core when I lean over. Its just sort of habit. If I lean over, I brace my core to take the strain off my lower back.\n\nIts the times that I hinge at the waist, my head ends up parallel to the deck, and I brace my core like I am about to lift something heavy before coming back up that I give myself vertigo. This bracing action coupled with the head not being straight up are what does it. Leaning over in general will not do it, but this will.\n\nI noticed it after getting my worst vertigo spell that I have had in a long time over this last weekend. I was wearing a backpack, carrying a couple grocery bags, and my daughter asked me to pick her up too. I leaned over, lifted with my back, scooped her up, and really had to brace with the hip hinge and about 100 extra pounds between the luggage and the kiddo. It was not until about 2 minutes later when I sat down in the car that I realized... oh crap... I am REALLY dizzy.\n\nI confirmed this with another more minor one of the same movement on Sunday. \n\nSo yeah. Head parallel to the ground, brace my core, sends my ears spinning. interesting. i had one bout of bppv about a year ago for a month. it came on after i got up from a chair about a minute later. i dont remember what position my head was in when i got up but it could have been parallel.\n\nwhen my ent dr finally relieved me of my symptoms (using the epley maneuver) i asked what brings on bppv and my ent dr answered...\"drs arent really sure\". I have been tracking all of my episodes and noting down the things that I had done right before I started experiencing BPPV. This is in a hope to see if I see any common patterns. Last year, I had 2 episodes, once in August, the other in October. This year, pretty much the same time.\n\nLast year, when I first I experienced my first episode right after a heavy workout, which included push-ups.\n\nThis year, I had the same thing in common. I did push-ups last weekend and the very next day, started experiencing BPPV.\n\nAll 3 episodes (Last August, last October, and this August) had one thing in common. Exercising. I think maybe I should avoid Push-ups and see how it goes.\n\nSide note: I have been working on an app for Tracking BPPV for iOS. The app helps tracking suspected triggers, daily experiences, and a bunch of other things I have found useful. I will release it on the iOS AppStore for free, and no Ad non-sense either. I do not care about making money off of it. My goal is to see if it helps people figure out what triggered it for them, ultimately leading to a better life. Please let us know when you release it \ud83d\ude0a absolutely will do \ud83d\ude42", "BPPV &amp; sweating/chills Just had my 4th or 5th episode of BPPV last night and I was absolutely dripping sweat from onset at 8pm. I realize that being nauseous can cause sweating but this was off the charts. When the sweating subsides, I am freezing until sweating ramps up again. This cycle has persisted for 24 hours now. \n\nI have meds from the first episode in Feb of 2018 which landed me in the ER and they took effect a few hours after taking them (meclizine, ondansetron, and sudogest). I spent hours sitting absolutely still on the cold tile floor in my bathroom next to the toilet, waiting to not feel like I wanted to die. I took a second round of meds this morning at 9. \n\nMy episodes are terrifying; I thought I was having a stroke the first time.  The vertigo &amp; nausea is severe and relentless, and I cannot function at all. I cannot perform the maneuvers when in the grip of debilitating nausea and vomiting but did a round this afternoon when I felt a little better. \n\nIs impaired thermal regulation (sweats/chills) another part of BPPV or just a side effect of being nauseous and vomiting? My episodes are random but I have noted that napping on the couch seems to be associated? The episodes are severe but generally resolve with the medications in a day or so.\n\nI saw my PCP and was referred to an ENT doc and he was not a lot of help. I want to find a PT who works on balance/vestibular issues to see if they can help. \n\nI have read about vit D issues &amp; possible dietary concerns associated with BPPV. I eat lazy keto &amp; take supplements including calcium with vit D &amp; iron (taken 2 or more hours apart). \n\nWhat else should I be doing? Go see a vestibular specialist. I had BPPV from May up until a week and a half ago (knock on wood). \n\nThe PT I saw did the Epley, but the BPPV persisted. It was not until I visited a clinic that mainly specialized in balance disorders did I get it treated successfully. Thank you. I am searching for a balance disorder/vestibular therapist in my area. Glad to hear they helped you! \n\nThat Is the chair that seemed to fix it. See if there is one in your area. My latest episode this month was like this, spinning a lot, constant vomiting, the sensation of being really cold(needed bed covers to warm down), it becomes hard for me speak as well.back in March of this year the episode was similar to this one and lately that is how my episodes have been, it seems they are getting worse. Closing my eyes and trying to sleep was hard too, my eyes keep wanting to move and I would feel as if I was falling into an episode so I would open my eyes and rub my head.  \n\nOh and I do suffer from tinnitus in my right ear, it sucks so much, i believe it has something to do with my Vertigo, it might not but idk, my left ear has a little tinnitus but it does not compare to my right ear. \n\nI do not think napping is associated with it, unless you sleep on the wrong side and the crystals move around. Meclinze does not work for me last time I was prescribed it in 2015, where the episode I had was weird, i felt very weak and had no strength in my arms. \n\nWhat I would do is the half sommerault exercise (you can find it on YouTube by Carol Foster at Colorado University I believe), \u0130 try to do this every morning and night or when I feel an episode coming on, or the sensation of feeling off, i try to sleep propped up using a sofa cushion, i bend at the knees and not the waist, drink ginger tea for nausea, that's all I can think of right now, I've tried ginkgo biloba capsules(120mg) and i can't really say they've helped me much. \u0130t took me a little over a week to feel much better, it was bad. Hope you get better and find something that helps you. Thank you for sharing your experiences. I found a physical therapist who specializes in vestibular and balance and have my first appointment in a few days. Just knowing I am doing something positive to correct or alleviate this condition has helped my mental state. I hope you find help, too. Update: I saw a physical therapist who specializes in vestibular and balance issues. Ran me through a variety of positions and maneuvers to test for the symptoms of BPPV. It had been a week since my last episode of vertigo and vomiting so I was already feeling a lot better although still sweating with the mildest exertion. I could do everything and none of it made me dizzy or nauseous.\n\nPT said Meniere's might be my problem due to the severe but short duration of the episodes (it generally passes within 4-8 hours with medications). ENT had my hearing tested and no significant hearing loss was noted. I don't have tinnitus, either, both of which are kind of standard symptoms of Meniere's. \n\nSo I still don't have a definitive diagnosis. PT requested I come back as soon as possible if/when I have another episode for more testing. holy shit i broke out in a cold sweat looking at that spinning chair lol. that's supposed to help?? Yes. It's specifically designed to maneuver your body with enough force to address the oliths in your canals. I had Bppv for about 6 months until I went in this chair. Now it's gone. I cannot stress how much relief i feel. Do it. Will definitely look into this. Thanks for posting! Seriously if you have BPPV you can find relief. I know what you're going through and you don't have to suffer quietly through it!", "Help help Okay so when I was in high school one day I woke up and when I drank coffee my ears popped. Then later that year I got tinnitus. I went to doctors and they said my ears were fine and that I needed an MRI but I never got it because my insurance would not cover it. \n\nYears later I still have tinnitus and my ears still  pop when I swallow however, now when I go to sleep I get dizzy as soon as I am about to sleep. Or I will fall asleep and then wake up with dizzy and everything seems to shake when I open my eyes but it only shakes for a bit until my eyes adjust it. It is gotten really hard to get a good nights sleep :(\n\nCould this be Bppv or has anyone gotten anything similar  p.s I only get dizzy when I try to sleep and some days my head feels heavy Does not sound like BPPV. the typical symptoms are vertigo and uncontrollable eye movement from head movement ie leaning forward, rolling to a side, etc. \n\nI would strongly advise seeing a doctor / ENT and as much as the cost of a MRI will not be fun, living with the unknown I have found is much worse. When I sleep and wake up dizzy I always have rapid eye movement but it usually lasts a couple of seconds What does \u201cdizzy\u201d mean to you? Room moving? Head feels light? When you walk, you feel like you are being pulled to the left or right? Or is it, \u201cI just do not feel right\u201d\n\nEveryone has their own definition of \u201cdizzy\u201d and until you can find the right words to explain the sensation, I found it very hard to get any help from anyone. \n\nI personally wake up and feel \u201cclumsy\u201d and my eyes feel like the beginning of vertigo as they start to focus in the room. However, that could be normal and I have just become extra sensitive to the sensation now that I know / have felt what vertigo and nystagmus is.\n\nThis is the joy of these disorders... And probably why it leads to anxiety as we do not want balance / dizzy / vertigo to problems to come back, but once you have them, it is hard to forget! My definition is like\nMy eyes will move a lot, everything in my room will shake because my eyes shake and then usually I feel lightheaded but at the same time I feel pressure in the back of my head and if I do not open my eyes and let myself adjust I will start getting stomach upset I have been living with anxiety and balance / dizzyness for 6+ years and what you have described i have not experienced. \n\nNystagmus, is not eye shaking, it is beating or twisting. \n\nShaking is something else and I would strongly advice talking to the GP and being referred to a specalist as it does not sound like BPPV.", "BPPV and Covid-19? Hey guys, so I had BPPV January 2021, lasted roughly about one week, I was bed ridden and it pretty much traumatized me. Since then I have developed terrible anxiety. It went away on its own for me, but I would still get vertigo if I slept on my right side. Then that stopped all together. Well \u2026 I was diagnosed with covid-19 about a week ago and I just experienced my first bout of vertigo again this morning. I usually sleep on my left, as I go to turn to my right side it hits me\u2026again. I quickly repositioned myself and it went away. I have not had any issues with vertigo in months. I am currently stressed that It can return due to this viral infection.

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* The covid vaccine is what triggered my vertigo. Never had it before, now Ive had it for 2 months.. I am sorry to hear that. :( I have heard many new BPPV cases related to covid-19, and vaccinations. How have you been holding up? Came here to say the same thing, had first dose Moderna last week and vertigo is still an issue. Same. Got Moderna and started having vertigo a week later and have been getting episodes every month or two. Awesome. Never had a health issue in my life. From a dr friend \u201cCovid can cause orthostatic hypotension, so where your blood pressure gets low when you stand up\u201d Unfortunately the reoccurrence rate for bppv is pretty high. Something like 30% within a year and up to 50% within 5 years. Sounds like you could have it on your right side again. Shit. I had not really thought about this intentionally until now. When I first started getting BPPV, it was about a month after I had the 2nd Pfizer shot. This is interesting. Ever since I got my vaccine I have experienced some mild dizziness and \u201cspinning\u201d. It comes and goes but it is lasted for a few months now. It is crazy. Well I am okay, just scared that it will never get better. I regret getting the vaccine so bad. And when Biden says it is time to get a booster I will be forced to do it again or lose my job. I also developed vertigo once I got covid. I did not get the vaccine, but still developed vertigo a week after testing positive.", "Anyone had their residual dizziness end abruptly? I have had residual dizziness since my first BPPV episode 6 weeks ago. This weekend I went to visit The Big City (I live in a village).\n\n\nI took the train and that in itself made me dizzier. Then all the noises, lights, and crowds increased my dizziness and made it hard to focus. On the next day however, I was 50% better and walked 40,000 steps, and on the day after I was 99%  better. \n\n\nOn this last day I was walking around moving my head in all directions while visiting museums and churches and I was not dizzy at all.\n\n\nTook the train back on Monday morning, no symptoms. I got dizzy again in the afternoon after being in a car.\n\n\nToday (Tuesday), I experienced no dizziness at all even after riding my bike. Vibrations from riding my bike would usually make it worse.\n\n\nHas anyone else experienced such an abrupt improvement? I was fine for about a week.  I went out on a boat fishing then I felt a little wonky after that.   So yeah I was feeling some residual after feeling ok.  I tilted my head back after feeling a little wonky and I did not get dizzy.   So maybe things are just recalibrating", "Had my first BPPV episode, really confused and do not know what to do. When I woke up today, everything felt normal. When I got out of bed, it felt like the whole world was spinning and it was really hard to walk over to the bathroom. For a couple of hours after, whenever I would lie down it would get dizzy again. This also happened when I would keep my head in a different position for a while. I am really confused because I have never had anything like this happen before. Right now, I feel fine, but I do not want this to happen again. Is this even BPPV or something else? If it is then what should I do? Yes. Sounds like BPPv. Might happen again tomorrow., same way. You can try doing self epley maneuvers, I would take some extra vitamin d and if it is back again the next day, call your dr... I will report back if it happens tomorrow morning yea that feeling sucks. Had a period of a month with the bppv, until I did the epley maneuvre. Anyway try lying down on both sides, see which side will cause the vertigo. i had bppv back in march. not fun. tried doing the epley myself and didnt work. once i saw an ent (ear nose &amp; throat) dr and the specialist did the epley on me i was cured after a couple days.\n\nbppv is not supposed to be a serious ailment and usually wont cause other medical issues as long as you get it taken care of by a dr asap.\n\ni recommend seeing an ent dr who is experienced with bppv. Dizzy? Or vertigo? What is your definition? \n\nVertigo is when the room spins like you are tumbling in a washing machine that causes your eyes to beat if it is BPPV and leaves you nauseated. \n\nDizzy ness is when you feel off balance, lightheaded and nauseated. \n\nIf it is vertigo with head movement, it was probably BPPV.", "Questions.... Hiya,  \nWent on a bike ride last week and later that night, when I lay down I felt like the whole room was sliding away from me. Genuinely thought the bed had somehow flipped over. Since then I have had that feeling lots and have managed to narrow it down to (generally) happening when I get up from a lying down position. Doctor was pretty clueless and said I may have vertigo and then kind of shrugged and offered me some travel sickness tablets.  \nAnyway, been reading up on it and I think I have BPPV. I tried the Dix-Hallpike test and it went absolutely crazy for my right ear. Then did the Epley a couple of times and whilst it stopped the lurching sensation when I got up off the bed (which was great!), I still had a light-headed feeling for the rest of the day. D-H test did not give any wild sensations so thought I would healed myself, apart from general light heatedness.  \nThing is, I went to bed last night (after a bit of wine) and when I woke up this morning, the full-on room-sliding-away sensation was back and the D-H was like before I did the Epley.\n\nSo, I would like to ask...\n\n  \n1. Is it usual for the Epley to sort the BPPV out but for it to return the next morning/ soon after? Am I doing it wrong?\n\n2. Is general light-headedness to be expected, I guess a bit like a cough after flu?\n\n3. Is it generally acceptable to have time off work for this?\n\n4. Could my bike ride have caused the BPPV? I remember going over a really mad cobbled bit and it was really rattly.   \n\n\nTIA 1. It can be. I find I have to do the Epley and later the half somersault a few times when it hits me and even then it makes a big difference how you lie afterwards.\n2. Again, it can happen, I threw up for hours during my episodes then just felt like crap, not sure if it was dehydration or the bppv directly. \n3. Depends on where you are, your job etc. I had to take the day off because I was vomiting and could not possibly drive (second time I was on holiday thank God), and my work were ok with it, but here in the UK we have not-terrible worker protections, especially if you have been at a job for a while. YMMV. \n4. Who knows, it sounds like it. I would imagine anything that could move crystals suddenly and in a way they are not supposed to could cause it. For me it was flipping over in bed which is a million times lamer. If you were bumped a lot or had to turn your head sharply while getting bumped I would imagine that could trigger it.\n\nDisclaimer- I am not a doctor and have only had a couple of really bad episodes. I would say it is normal to have to do the maneuvers multiple times.  I had a recurrence last Sunday, sis the epley.  Did the epley the following couple nights.  Was feeling pretty good and then had a recurrence yesterday morning again.  Also I usually do feel pretty significant residual dizziness after an episode.  The time depends.  Sometimes a couple weeks, sometimes a couple months.  I will usually do the dh when I am having an off day just to make sure.  Of it seems to make me dizzy I do the epley.  You can go to pt to help speed up your recovery if you dont feel better in a week or so.  Dont worry!  This is a pain, but you will feel better!  Thanks very much for that, much appreciated. I am in the UK too and was signed off work for a week but felt bad and have logged on this morning a couple of days earlier. I have to cycle to do visits as I do not drive but 'luckily' there are train engineering works on for a fortnight so I can use the tram.  \nAre the dizzy spells considered a side-effect of the main BPPV? Will these go away on their own? I have just woken up this morning and whilst I am not getting anything from the Dix-Hallpike test, my head is swimming.\n\nThanks again. Thanks very much. Are the dizzy spells considered a side-effect of the main BPPV? Will these go away on their own? I have just woken up this morning and whilst I am not getting anything from the Dix-Hallpike test, my head is swimming. Would you recommend seeing a professional? Thinking of seeing if any physios in the area can help. I find the dizziness and subsequent vomiting the main thing, not sure if there are other things other people have. I would say that if your head is swimming it might be worth a half somersault to see if that helps. I also find sleeping on the affected side (mine is my left) makes it much worse. I have always found the dizzy spells go away after a few hours but I feel off and that they might come back for a while afterwards. I have got some hearing loss in the affected ear as well so I think there is something else and the bppv is just an extra side effect of it. Thankfully I have got an appointment in a couple of weeks to get it looked into. I saw a vestibular therapist due to that.  I feel like I am going to get vertigo much of the time, but its actually your brain adjusting to the different feedback it is getting from your ears now.  You may have even had crystals for awhile and only triggered the noticeable vertigo recently so if you then move the crystal it can take awhile for your eyes, ears, and brain to readjust to not having the crystal.", "Vertigo I only get vertigo when I am laying flat and my head is neutral (looking up). If I am laying down and turn my head, it is slows down or stops. Anyone else ever have this? My VNG was normal but it noted some left and up-beating nystagmus and my right ear was \u201cweaker\u201d than my left. My hearing test was normal as well. I cannot find anything else like this and it feels almost violent. My ENT is sending me to someone else because he does not know either. HELP please. Sounds like BPPV. The nystagmus and it happening whilst horizontal are the giveaways. Find yourself a Vestibular Physical Therapist to do the maneuvers on you. They work! /u/ExtensionSell is right, this does sound like BPPV although a less common form: most of us have problems when the head is turned, not neutral. \n\nThe PT will use the Dix-Hallpike test to clarify the problem canal, then one of the classic exercises (Epley, Semont, Foster, or Brandt-Daroff) to treat it. \n\nA warning: The treatment sucks, but you really need to do it. Done correctly the results will be like night and day. I do the same thing So I had a VNG and a Dix-Hallpike done, both negative. That is confusing to me and I am sorry you are going through this. Glad you are going to see others. Wishing you the very best. I am assuming they dx you with BPPV? No. I have shit insurance. Absolute shit with shit clinics. Half the time I only see a medical assistant (not physicians assistant) for most things. I rarely have the privledge of seeing one. And when I do, they do not care and do not send me anywhere. That is unfortunate, I am sorry. Well, if I find out what I have, I will tell you the rest of my symptoms and we can see if we have something similar going on?", "Experience with residual dizziness after BPPV and VNG test Hey fellows. I am 30M living in PA, USA. I have been dealing with lightheadedness for two months now, and my ENT doctor ordered me a VNG test. My VNG appointment is in two weeks from now, but from what I read about VNG experiences here, I am super scared of the test, as it can make me super dizzy afterward. Is it true?\n\nA little background that you do not have to read, but please do if you have time:\n\nI got three vertigo attacks on a Monday around two months ago, for the first time in my life. After that, no vertigo, but I have been lightheaded (with brain fog) almost all the time. The lightheadedness is not super bad and on a scale of 10, it is between 0-3 most of the time. Some days it gets better and I think yeah it is gone, but again a few days later, it hits me back, and I get super nervous. At first, I thought it might be residual dizziness after BPPV (which many people experience), but it is been two months now, and I think it is not related to BPPV anymore. I got tested by a PT (Dix-hallpike test and I had no nystagmus), by two ENT docs, and by an audiologist (who tested my hearing and said my hearing is 100% functional on both ears). I have heard that the VNG test is usually to diagnose Meniere's disease, but I am not really sure if I have it as I have no hearing loss and no buzzing sound in my ears. That is why I want to prevent taking the test if possible. I cannot speak for VNG test, but as a side note: I think I am in a similar situation. I also had a few BPPV episodes and then this residual dizziness (quite severe, now getting somewhat better) with a side of lightheadedness (which seems to be getting worse as dizziness is abating slowly), headaches and other stuff. Just like you, I have a good day or three and think, wow, I am getting better, only for it to slam me full force the next day.\n\nI saw a neurologist today and he ran a bunch of tests neurologists do (tested for BPPV and no nystagmus was present), and said that while we wait for MRI (been waiting for them to schedule me for 2.5 months now), his working assumption is PPPD. Sometimes, for unknown reasons, it just happens after BPPV episodes.\n\nMaybe ask your doctor how  Meniere's is diagnosed. My ENT said this was not Meniere's, the family physician said my symptoms seemed to be 'cervical dizziness' but when I mentioned it to the neurologist he said nop, it is most likely PPPD. Even tho I do get dizzier with certain head positions (not moves, so no BPPV).\n\nBest of luck! So the last time I saw my ENT doc, he said it is likely BPPV and I should wait for 2-3 weeks to see if the dizziness goes away, if not, then we will start testing. I waited for one month and since I was still dizzy, I called his office and asked to start testing. I was kind of hoping that he refers me to MRI so that we can rule out all serious neurological issues, but he referred me for a VNG test. Not sure why! Maybe because since he is ENT specialist (and not neurologist) he is not allowed to order brain MRI, or maybe because he thought it is not a neurological issue and seems more like a vestibular one. Not sure. But I wish I could do an MRI. I am very scared that this might be tumor, MS or some other bad thing. I was sent for an MRI of the auditory nerve/area (this one by ENT) as well as the entire brain (my family physician). Maybe talk to your primary care physician and ask for the brain/auditory area MRI before going for VNG, especially because you are nervous about it. And ask to see a neurologist/neurotologist, also before VNG, if possible? My neurologist today said we will wait for MRI, and only then send me for further testing.\n\nNAD but I would think you would experience other symptoms if it was something serious. The fact that it comes and goes is hopefully an indication of that. Still, the best thing is to do the imaging asap, so you can eliminate that and the worry that comes with it.\n\nDid your ENT suggest any manouvers or PT for BPPV? Those can make a huge difference, and often you get significant relief quickly. And sometimes this kind of thing is \"just\" BPPV-echo.\n\nAs alarming as these things feel, especially when they last for weeks and months, there are tons of examples where all tests come back okay for people. Last month a family friend who is going through stressful things in his life (terminally ill brother) started feeling dizzy to the point he could not work or drive any more, and all results and scans came back okay (he is in Switzerland so they did \\*everything\\* right away).\n\nDo you have any pain in the neck/shoulders or headaches? I visited a PT before visiting the ENT doc. The PT said it is probably not BPPV (but I am unsure of his diagnosis because honestly he did not look like a knowledgeable therapist as he did not even know that people with BPPV experience residual dizziness. He just did a dix hillpike test on me and I had no nystagmus. Then he said this constant lightheadedness does not look like BPPV, and it might be some allergy!). Anyways, yeah. \n\nRegarding PCP and brain MRI, unfortunately, I do not have a PCP. I scheduled a visit with a doctor to be my PCP, and that appointment is for one month from now (which is in fact after my VNG appointment). \n\nBtw, I remember you had a post about how applying heat pads on your neck could help your dizziness. What is up with that? Still doing the heating? I am still doing it, even tho I get careless on 'better' days. It resolves my headaches almost completely (they are pretty bad and constant really), as well as general dizziness (sometimes helps lightheadedness but not sure it is always effective, or not coincidental rather than causal) for a period of time after for sure (sometimes a whole day). I do have a ton of other issues with very bad neck posture which I am trying to correct, and muscle tension and painful/trigger spots all over my heck, shoulders and head. There are some spots on suboccipitals, SCM, forehead and masseters which, when pressed, cause my eyes to water from pain. It  seems my headaches and other stuff is at least partially related to tense muscles. What gives me hope is that a lot of symptoms I have could be ( as crazy as that still sounds to me.  I am yet to move beyond heating pads, since I am terrified of laying down on a massage table at this point. Vestibular rehabilitation does not seem to be doing much for me at this point. I was also doing heat pads on my neck for about 1 hr per day. Then I got better (not sure because of heating or just randomly) and I got lazy and did not do heating for a week or so. Then the dizziness came back. \ud83d\ude22\nI am doing the heating again, but not sure if it helps again. Similar to you, I have had an extremely bad neck posture for a long time, and I think this dizziness might be neck-related (although I do not have serious neck pain, just some mild neck pain some days). I also might see an upper cervical chiropractor in future. Not sure if it helps, but I will definitely try it if I see nothing else improves my situation. Lol, you sound just like me - as soon as I feel better, the damn heating pads and exercises go out of the window.\n\nI had a pretty bad week and two nights ago put an electric pad around my head and somehow managed to fall asleep all crooked on the sofa. Woke about 1.5h. later, super warm and feeling great - dizziness was a faint memory. I am pretty sure it was not the nap on the sofa that helped. Have been on a downhill since then, so pads are coming out tonight again. There is definitely something there, especially since it totally reduces my terrible headache.\n\nI am also seeing an TMJ physio and she gave me a bunch of head massages to do every day. They all hurt like hell, of course. She claims TMJ (or problems with muscles around) can also cause dizziness because,  apparently, ligaments tying those muscles with the inner ear get inflamed, plus something about inner ear nerves, and therefore dizziness. Who knows.\n\nI went to see a NUCCA chiro last night. He explained his theory and took some x-rays, and I am seeing him on Thursday for the \"adjustment\" (( they sent, explaining what it is). TBH I am very skeptical about the whole chiro thing, but at this point I would try anything really. He seemed pretty honest and said that I will know if it helps in 3 or so sessions.   Can let you know if a miracle happens and his treatment does something.\n\nI saw another chiro back in February and he was doing this hand hovering over the spine with super light touching here and there, which of course did nothing for me. I think that method is aimed at people who need a placebo effect. Haha yeah sure, please let me know if the chiropractor helps. One more question - When does your dizziness trigger more harsh? I mean for me, when I lay down or walk, I feel almost no lightheadedness, but the highest level of dizziness hits me when I sit down. I cannot understand why I should not be too much dizzy when I walk and super dizzy when I sit still somewhere. Just wanted to see if it is the same for you. For me it is the worst when I go for a walk, which I used to do a lot  (like walking from work 45 minutes every day). It just gets progressively worse, no matter how much I try to 'walk through it'.  I had a few evening walks where I was so-so, until a car with high beams came towards me and that was it, wobbly dizzy. Also sudden moves of my head (mostly sideways, to the right, sometimes up too).  It always gets better when I lay back (not down), half propped with a pillow in a very specific position, and do not move, or when I position my head upright like something is pulling it to the ceiling and raise my shoulders slightly (for real, even tho it sounds crazy).\n\nIt is interesting that laying down does not, but sitting down creates an issue for you. Does sitting down always make you dizzy, regardless of whether it is sofa or dining or computer chair? Any connection with the body/shoulders/neck/head position you sit in, or angles, or the wobbliness of  the chair (for computer chair specifically)? Is dizziness connected to what you are doing - looking at your screen, or looking down at laptop or phone, or TV?\n\nOne thing maybe to try is: stand with your feet touching, arms in front of you, and close your eyes. Keep it like that for 20-30 seconds and see if you get dizzy at all. Then try this with rotating your head 45 degrees to the left/right, and hold to see if something happens on either side. I am always more dizzy when I turn to left this way. I had active BPPV for over 2 months. I was working with a vestibular therapist during that time to resolve it.  Together we performed the Epley MANY times. She often retested me to see if the crystal moved to a different canal.  Other maneuvers were attempted, as I had a stubborn case. After it was resolved - my residual dizziness lasted 6 or 7 months. It is now been 8 months and I am finally to the point where I can go for half a day without any mild dizziness. It took a LONG time. And I was doing certain exercises during this time to help my balance system relearn correct balance. Mostly challenging the dizziness (like if I turned my head to the right and got that wave of mild dizziness, I would keep doing that movement up to 15 times - then do it again later that day).\n\nThe process was SO slow. I would never notice any difference in a day - but weekly, I noticed mild improvement. Then I would get hit with it worse again. Somehow, anxiety plays a huge role in this as well. I mean - who is not going to get freaked out when you get hit with that woozy dizziness, that BPPV is going to rear it is ugly head again? And the worry that you are never going to escape the dizziness.  I worked hard at keeping anxiety at bay. And for me - activity helps so much! So I try to keep busy.  Running, horseback riding, snowmobiling, dog agility. It all keeps my mind off it - and is also helping my body reset itself.\n\nI was tested for many things and am healthy as a horse. The residual dizziness is common.  Mine may be lasting longer than most, because I had active BPPV for so long - and continued with daily life, which encouraged my vestibular system to adapt to being off balance.\n\nThe best advice I can give, is to find someone that is experienced in dizzy conditions.  My therapist was amazing.  She helped the anxiety and helped me learn so much about the condition. She continues to study dizzy conditions, so was up to date on the latest info and studies. A Dizzy specialist can help guide you and monitor you. They can give you exercises to help speed up your healing. Best wishes to you! It sucks - but there is a light at the end of the tunnel! Thanks. The issue is that I do not know if this is residual dizziness after BPPV or it is something else. \n\nFor sure, my first symptoms sounded like BPPV. Two months ago, I had vertigo three times (two times when rolling over in bed quickly, and one time when tried to get up quickly from bed) in a single day. The thing is that after that, I had no vertigo (without doing any maneuvers or so!).\n\nMy PT did dix-hallpike test and some others and since I had no nystagmus, he said this is not BPPV. Now I do not know if my BPPV was resolved by itself before I get to my PT appointment, or if it was not BPPV from the beginning at all. \n\nSo I guess I have one of these cases now:\n\n1. It was BPPV, and I am still dealing with residual dizziness after it.\n2. It was BPPV, but BPPV got resolved and it triggered some other thing, and I am dealing with some other disease right now.\n3. It was not BPPV, and It was some other disease from day 1 that brought those vertigo attacks and the constant lightheadedness after that.\n\nSo my main issue is that I do not even know what the hell is this :( Yeah, walking is pretty much fine for me. In fact, I walk almost every night for about 1-2 hours now.\n\nLaying down is OK. I get dizzy a little bit sometimes, but overall I can say almost no dizziness.\n\nBut sitting down (or laying back as you said) makes me dizzy especially when my neck and head are not supported (I mean when I cannot lay my head back on something). It does not matter if I look at laptop, tv, phone, or nothing, or if I look up or down or directly. It makes me dizzy anyways :( I totally get your frustrations. I was fortunate that I was still working with my therapist after my BPPV was fixed. I would go to my appointment and tell her that I still felt horrible. So, she would perform all the tests again - and would reassure me it was just residual. Before I started therapy with her, I had been to an ENT, neurologist, and regular doctor to be tested for other things.\n\nOn a side note - my first 3 BPPV episodes cleared on their own too (had gone to the ER with the very first episode and was treated with Meclizine and Zofran and told to just wait it out). This last episode is when I finally got some serious help.  I had many days with the residual dizziness that I feared it was something else too. So I understand your fear and frustrations. 3 months of residual dizziness (lightheaded w/ brain fog), I initially worried I would have to change careers, as mine requires a brain.\n\nfwiw I had the VNG test and did not have any discomfort. Ah yeah, same here. The first month, I could not look at my laptop because it was making me way more dizzy for some reason. I am a data scientist and all I do to get paid is to work with my laptop. So similar to you, I also thought I would have to change my job. But, thanks to God, that feeling is gone now and I can work with my laptop with no difficulty. By the way, did VNG test indicate any disease for you? No, it came back normal.", "Real struggle I Had head spin in 2017 and immediately checked with neuro and ENT. No ear imbalance and nothing wrong in MRI. For the past two days, I had been having a head spin which is like a showstopper. Earlier it was controllable. Today it was not. I have a 5 months baby who EBFs. Really I am struggling with this fuck. Tried Epley exercises. No use!! I first got hit with this in 2016 when my second was a few months old (also EBF, and co-slept).  Had it mentioned to me that me being on my side in one position all night was a possible contributor (when my kids are little babies I find I do not really move around at all when they are in bed with me). The Epley will only help if there is a loose crystal in the posterior canal &amp; you have determined which side is effected. If it is on a horizontal canal, a different maneuver is needed. The Dix Hallpike is a simple test you can do to check left &amp; right posterior canals. If you can get in to see a vestibular therapist or dizzy specialist.... They can perform more tests to check many other things that could be causing the dizziness. I hope you can find some answers &amp; relief soon. Try eliminating excess (or uneven) salt and sugar intake and make sure you hydrate regularly. Some mineral or vitamin deficiencies could also contribute to this, check if supplementation might help (magnesium, specifically) or things like ginger.\n\nIn case you have not seen this: (\n\nReally sorry you are dealing with this, and crossing fingers you feel well quickly. Also, and this is coming from someone who is had both BPPV and non-BPPV dizziness long term, it helps differentiate room-spinning vertigo from just general dizziness (which is no less distressing, when intense). If you (also) experience non-vertigo dizziness, it is something that can be caused or significantly worsened by muscles (shoulders/neck) tension as well as anxiety and water retention. One physio I saw said: with dizziness it is never one thing, multiple things have to go wrong for it to take over. This is by far the best advice I have read from my own experience in that when your talking to doctors, you really need to be clear on what the dizziness feels like. It was not however until I felt real vertigo from BPPV that I could find the words to describe what I was feeling. Prior to BPPV I did not even know vertigo and dizziness would feel different. ...", "BPPV or Cervical Vertigo I am 26, Female, 5'4'', 135lbs, on no meds, pot smoker, and my world has been spinning for about 9 months now. \n\nFor some background, back in February of this year, I was under a great deal of stress to say the least. I had recently moved into a new home, quit my job to start my own business, and entered into the spring semester of school. I am unsure if my level of stress could have been related to my vertigo.\n\nI awoke one morning feeling like my eyes had rolled back in my sleep. When I opened my eyes, I experienced the worst spinning imaginable. It felt like I had to grip the bed to keep myself from falling out of it! The rest of the day I was extremely nauseous, my eyes ached, and everything just felt \"off.\" The residual dizziness stuck around until about a month later when I was hit with another episode after waking up in the middle of the night. Google is leading me to believe this is classic BPPV, but I feel like I am slightly dizzy all the time and have been having recurring episodes for months with little to no relief. I thought this was supposed to clear up in a few weeks!\n\nI have made certain adjustments that have seemed to prevent the full-blown spins from happening during the night like sleeping on my right side with my head elevated, however the residual dizziness has still continued. \n\nI have been experiencing these short and intense \"bursts\" of dizziness if I tilt my head down to take notes in class or while bending over. I have to bring a clipboard to my exams to keep my head in an upright position. Although it is been almost two months since I have had the spins, these short bursts of dizziness have gotten more intense with changes in head position. Laying on my back and tilting my head back will easily trigger a spinning episode. I even sometimes feel dizzy just by seeing other people in those positions. \n\nI have always been a pretty uptight person and carry a lot of tension in my neck and shoulders. I run my business from my cell phone so I would imagine that I am always a little hunched over. In addition, I have a terrible habit of clenching my jaw that sometimes will leave my face feeling tight and sore. This makes me wonder if I am actually suffering from cervical vertigo rather than BPPV. I am terrified of the Epley, I have tried it at home and it is made me insanely sick. I do not want to have to suffer through these exercises if it is not going to help in the end. \n\nVertigo destroying me. I am afraid to leave the house, exercise, or travel. I am depressed and I feel helpless. I worry that this is forever and I do not know how I will cope if it is. I just want my life back. I would not wish this on my worst enemy.  \n\nI am seeing a doctor this next week in hopes of getting a referral to an ENT. If anyone has experienced anything similar or has any idea of what might be happening to me, I would really appreciate hearing from you! I just need help, lol. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story.  \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nTL;DR: \n\n* OP is a stress case :(\n* Suffering from episodes of vertigo upon waking for 9 months.\n* Residual dizziness is constant\n* Experiencing short \"bursts\" of dizziness with changes in head position\n* Tension in neck, shoulders, cell phone use, and TMJ symptoms are leading me to wonder if it may be cervical vertigo rather than BPPV, need advice. Hmm.\n\nHonestly read my last comment in my post history, it applies to anyone who is experiencing bppv shiftiness. \n\nObviously we cannot diagnose you here, but we can tell you what sort of help to seek based on our own experiences.\n\nScrew waiting to see an ENT \u2014 in the meantime, find a physiotherapist that knows how to treat vertigo and get a few opinions immediately imo ! \n\nDo not let any doctor run you into a dead end \u2014 if the ENT cannot see anything, ask for a referral to a local dizziness clinic (for intensive testing) or even a neurologist. \n\nG\u2019luck! Have faith. You have your whole life ahead of you!\n\nI have been affected by bppv related illness for 2 years now. Absolutely the worst thing I have ever experienced.  But through it I have grown stronger - what does not kill you makes you stronger!\n\nFind the best ENT in your area and get a diagnosis. They might suggest epley or omniax, you gotto just do it! Cant get any worse.\n\nI have advice against home remedies - they have bitten in the back pretty rough.\n\nAll the best! Epley has worked for me every time.  See the doctor, but be prepared for this sort of thing.  My first episode this is the first thing they tried on me.  I know it sucks hard, and I have had to do it multiple times on my own in the past, but ever time it is resolved entirely that day for a year or more.  This is my experience anyway. DONT make an appointment with a generic ENT. Make an appointment with a balance center or a therapist who has tons of experience treating Vertigo. Lots of ENTs do not have much experience with BPPV. If you tell me the closest BIG city (NY, Miami, LA, London), I might make suggestions. If you live in the middle of nowhere you might have to travel to find someone who knows what they are doing. I second this. Or skip the ENT and just start with a balance center. I agree with others - skip the ENT if you can  and go see a Physical Therapist that knows how to treat BPPV or facility for balance disorders.  I made the mistake of waiting  2 months only to have an ENT not find anything wrong and really did not seem interested in helping.  When I mentioned to the ENT that I felt more dizziness when turning my head side to side - he suggested it could be Cervical Vertigo and referred me to a Physical Therapist that specializes in treating Vestibular issues. After about 3 weeks so far - they have helped reduce the residual dizziness and treated an episode of Vertigo using the Epley Maneuver I had while at the Phsyio's office last week.  Thank you for your very helpful replies! I will definitely look into seeing a physical therapist or visiting a local dizzy clinic if I can. I just want this to be over! \n\nFWIW, I was seen at an urgent care clinic today after what seems to be a pretty nasty case of strep throat. \n\nThey also looked at my ears, told that they are both completely clogged, and referred me to an ENT. \n\nWho knows? I am hopeful that this could just be a case of needing my ears cleaned. I am sure crazier things have happened.. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb Let us know how you end up.  I am experiencing very similar things like OP. You can read a previous post. Do you know what a good option for me would be? I have tried a little vrt and seen a neurologist. I am near Billings mt, are their any places to recommend for around here It was a lot more difficult to find someone in your area than I thought. I would generally suggest an ENT with a focus on vestibular disorders. Maybe they are there, but I could not find one. But I did find a guy in Missoula with a LOT of experience. Maybe it is too far away for you, but you might want to have a look.  His name is Neil Shepard, Ph.D \n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a practice in Billings called  Rehder *Balance* &amp; Hearing *Clinic.*  \n\nBut after reading the profiles of the people involved,  I would probably suggest Shepard if it is not too far to travel.  Wow. Thank you so much for putting so much effort into the reply. I truly appreciate it. I do have to agree with the ENTs up here are not very well \"trained\" in vestibular disorders. I have seen two and both basically said I do not know and said see you later. (one said she did not think it was inner ear, but ALOT of my symptoms are related to that) So I am kind of at a loss on where to go next. \n\nRehder hearing clinic basically just took my money and said I do not know as well. I will for sure  make a trip to Missoula to see that Neil.  I think Sheppard looks interesting. But if he can not help you ping me again. We will find you a specialized ENT, but be prepared to travel. :)", "BPPV without spinning sensation? \n\nEar problem or BPPV? 24M, 5\u20197 165lbs. No smoking. Zyrtec for allergies\n\nI have been having some ear issues. I had ear fullness for months and it was not going away so I went to my doctor and they said I have an ear infection. Was on antibiotics and it did not seem to go away. Decided to see an ENT and they said there is no ear infection anymore but it is a little irritated. Ran me through the hearing tests as well and that came back fine. I am also starting to experience a lightheaded (but not spinning) feeling. It is hard to explain. Almost like a drunk/uneasy feeling but only when I do certain movements. Has been going on for 12 days now. Would get some headaches that lasted maybe a couple seconds but not constant throughout the day. A shooting ear pain comes sometimes and my ears click and pop all the time. I also deal with anxiety and teeth grinding at night which might make things worse. Anybody experience this before ? This does not sound like BPPV to me, although I am not an expert. BPPV is usually associated with spinning (vertigo) in certain positions. Doing the dix-hallpike can help distinguish this. I also do not think BPPV is typically associated with ear pain, fullness, popping and clicking as you describe. It sounds like maybe something else going on. Vestibular physical therapists seem to be some of the most knowledgable for these types of issues. I would highly suggest seeing one if you are able. I hear ya. I always get worried it could be something with my head and with covid-19 going around , my anxiety is through the roof right now lol Yeah for sure! Like I said I am no expert but since you recently had an ear infection and you are prone to allergies, I am inclined to say maybe your ears are just having some fluid/drainage issues at the moment. I think there are some exercises you can try for this too, but I would still see a vestibular specialist just for peace of mind and to hopefully help whatever you have! Hope you feel better soon. I agree with this.  Does not sound like BPPV. I agree that this sounds more like an ear problem than BPPV.  Perhaps allergies, sinus infection, inner ear infection.  BPPV does not effect the ears much in the way you describe.  Your recent ear infection could just be taking longer to heal up - even if the infection is 'gone.'  I had some similar ear problems (not related to BPPV), and I even saw a specialist.  They did not detect anything, and eventually my ears cleared up. It returns occasionally - but then goes away on it is own. The teeth grinding at night could be adding to it as well.  And....anxiety makes dizziness worse.  So, all this working together to make you feel pretty yucky.  Sorry. Hope you are feeling better soon! I also agree with u/Colmanson1.\n\nI do not think it is BPPV. It sounds more like post infection irritation. \nI would also look into Vestibular Neuritis as that sometimes follows inner ear infections due to virus and bacteria. Just throwing that out there as a possibility. Maybe ask your ENT for more information on it.\nFeel better soon! xx", "Vertigo I have had a vitamin D3 deficiency I suspect since April 2019 or so. I went to a neurologist after starting D3 in August 2020 (new doctor, test came back at 15ng/mL) and still deal with getting vertigo on various drugs such as Carafate, Zyrtec, Miralax, etc. I tried to get a brain MRI on Wednesday and got worse vertigo then ever before. It was not anxiety because that causes dissociation, this was feeling like I was free falling but under water or some odd thing. With all this vertigo and stuff can it be a D3 problem? They all sit there and say my thyroid, iron, B12, etc is normal and to get a brain MRI but even the MRI makes my brain feel odd. I am wondering if the D3 5k IU daily (been on since August 2020) will help the vertigo or if it can be a different problem entirely. It started after getting taken off of Levothyroxine in August 2019 but my thyroid remains normal off of meds so they told me to see a neurologist to rule out other problems. I have an arachnoid cyst on my brain (have had them before, no symptoms) as seen from the incomplete MRI. The vertigo is medication induced and as I learned on Wednesday, most certainly MRI induced too. Could it be calcium crystals in my inner ears in part? I still feel odd like I am a log that is stuck in a wave ot something. I feel most the time when this vertigo that drugs causes like I am a buoy bobbing up and down in the water. As I said this was not a problem on thyroid pills (except standing or sitting) and I could take Zyrtec, Carafate, Miralax, etc with no side effects. I did not know what subreddit to put this into. D3 5k IU is not resolving the medication induced vertigo, tried to take Miralax the other day and was very screwed up from the bobbing up and down sense of movement. If it is helpful at all I have a history of a grand mal seizure and ever since then sometimes my eyes go back and forth rapidly and I lose my vision for up to 10 seconds. I think upping my D3 has helped my vertigo. But also, how you take it matters to some of us too. Liquid or gel caps are better digested. It is taken me a while to get my levels up but they have gone up and I feel better. I take it with lunch, a fatty meal. I take the gel capsules 5k IU daily. I will talk to my neurologist tomorrow and see what they have to say. Hope I can play the music I like in the MRI. Ya also try a pre/probiotic. Maybe your not digesting it well. But I also think inflammation does not help it. So many reasons and none definite. Good luck tomorrow I take a 10 billion probiotic, helps keep me regular. have you seen an ent (ear nose and throat) dr to rule out bppv? if not i suggest it.\n\nwhen i had bppv and before it was diagnosed i thought i had heart problems, brain issues, etc... nope none of those, simple as bppv. once diagnosed by a ent and they did the epley on me i was cured. No. My insurance does not cover ents that is why I am seeing a neurologist. Moving my head quickly back and forth causes no issues. ok, be sure the neurologist youre seeing is familiar with diagnosing bppv and knows the maneuvers that will resolve your issue...assuming you have bppv.", "It is been almost 6 weeks, this is getting tiresome! I just feel like bitching. BPPV started the beginning of January, treated a few different times with Epley. Then the crystal moved to the horizontal canal, so it is being treated with a different maneuver, which does not really seem to help because I still have it. Two weeks ago I was told I am a \u201cstubborn case\u201d. It seems like it is gradually getting less intense, or maybe I am just getting used to it, and the last couple of days I actually thought maybe it was gone. Last night I was sleeping on my left shoulder like I was told to and without thinking glanced back at the clock over my right shoulder - immediate vertigo. Since I got up today it is the worst it is been for a while, the vertigo is not really intense but I feel off balance any time I try to walk, and even when I am just sitting I feel a little off. I thought maybe I moved the crystal back into the original canal, but looking up does not bring on the vertigo. So I guess I will be calling to get another appointment on Monday. Ugh! Maybe ask your doctors for Compazine? It took the edge off the last time i could not shake a bad case. I will ask next time I go in, thanks. It is not quite as bad today, but I stayed in bed a while afraid to get up because I did not want to find out how shitty I was going to feel. BBPV is feeding my panic attacks, which is just great. Go to a professional who can do the epley maneuver on you. Takes a few times (I hear) and it might not be fun at first but supposed to help. I tried it but was so dizzy when doing it I had to stop. I have been going to a Dizzy/Balance Center, first the crystal was in the canal the Epley works on, then it moved to the horizontal canal so they are doing a different maneuver and I also do it at home. It is frustrating because it seems like it is getting better for a few days then it get bad again. Last time I went they told me that I am a stubborn case and there are other things they can do, when I go back this week I am going to press about that. I have had it twice now and it takes 2 weeks to fully go away. But I am always wondering why it happened in the first place. The second bout happened after an allergy/sneeze attack and my acupuncturist said sneezing can dislodge the crystals. Someone also told me it is osteoporosis of the brain. I am doing things to address the allergies but also seeing an ENT ASAP. Keep us posted! It will subside. I am sorry! My last episode lasted weeks too. I had a residual dizziness all the time that was not vertigo but an off feeling. Honestly it took about 2 months for all of that to VERY gradually go away for me. I assumed it was because I waited a long time to get to a pt/balance center and do the Epley but it may just take some time to go away. \n\nI would continue sleeping semi-recumbent (slightly elevated) and avoid any movements that may induces the vertigo like bending over, rolling on your sides etc. until your symptoms subside. That is what I did and I feel like it helped keep the crystal from coming out again until my body absorbed it I guess. Lol \n\nI hope you feel better soon! Keep up with the dizzy clinic and just know that it will pass. \ud83d\udc95 Thanks for sharing, it is good to know someone else had similar symptoms. I have an appointment today, fingers crossed that I find out it is residual. I will definitely avoid rolling onto the affected side at night for more than a few days, learned my lesson! Mine started while doing yoga, I guess inversion poses are not the best idea. I have an appointment today, hopefully that will get me some answers. Good luck! My ENT cannot see me til March! \ud83d\ude2b Oh my gosh that sucks! Hope you do okay until then, I tried less drowsy Dramamine yesterday and it helped a little. Just do not take it on an appointment day, meclizine can affect the eye movements. I had vertigo first time and it is been 5 days and still feel the off feeeling / after effects. My doctor did the dicks test but nothing happened he said either it is gone or mclazine I got from my urgent care is covering it. Says it will go away after a week or so but it is annoying because I still feel off when I shake my head or walk. Any one feel the same way ? Any advice ? I was told that meclizine can have an affect on the tests they use to check eye movements to make sure it is BPPV. If you were taking it the day you were tested maybe it masked the vertigo? I think my vertigo is gone but I still feel like I am off balance and kind of queasy some days.", "can viagra induce bppv or make symptoms worse? i use viagra like once a week and noticed that it can trigger dizziness and vertigo afterwards may be in an few hours. any similar experiences? This is an interesting question. I have no experience with viagra, but google tells me one of the symptoms could be dizziness. Which would possibly make sense since viagra affects blood flow? It does not seem like it would affect BPPV symptoms though. Then again, people report all sorts of things that trigger their vertigo. (For me, it is light sensitivity!) Are we all just having anxiety induced vertigo and associating it with everyday things? Maybe that is part to blame. I cannot help but think that there is validity to a lot of our concerns though. The body is a weird thing, man. thx for your comment, i am 65, divorced, dating, may be i could find some natural substitute for viagra with no side efects, having these bppv symptoms is the worst. you are right anxiety is a big trigger , of course  sex and exercise are always good practice to relax now a days. I agree with the other poster. My BPPV gets worse with allergies and TMJ. Assume there is some swelling near my Eustachian tube and inner ear. \n\nWould make sense to me that since viagra relaxes blood vessel walls to increase swelling that it could be related. \n\nTalk to your doc.", "Help I am 21 years old. I see my perpheral vision moving as if I have oscillopsia? My eyes do have a left beat horizontal nystagmus. I see an ent next Monday. I was getting nausea, but it is really not there anymore. I am just confused because the eye doctor says my eyes are healthy. The doctor and physical therapist do not think it is neurological. The physical therapist said I am negative for BPPV. I am so lost. I am terrified it is central vertigo. My fellow dizzy homie - I am sending you the biggest of hugs because I know that fear and uncertainty all too well. I do not know if this will help you at all... but just know, that whatever it is... you will probably be just fine. Vertigo sucks. There is no two ways about it. However, once you come to peace with it, it is just a disturbance. It is not a death note. You will hopefully find ways to help your balance and cope mentally. And life will be all good again. In the meantime, watch YouTube videos of dogs and cats with cerebellar hypoplasia. Look at how happy and at peace they are! I hope you find this someday too :) How is your dizziness like?? It is alarming, but try to rest; perhaps the rest will help. We both have an eye problem, and my eye doctor claimed it was just a dry eye, and my general doctor stated she did not think it was neurological and rest cant help so try it. \nSee your ENT doctor; he or she might be enlighten you on everything.  ", "23 year old - Had severe BPPV for over a week. Hello, i thought I would just share my recent experience with BPPV in case anyone is looking for help, relief, or anything in general.\n\nI have had episodes of vertigo to start off with, but they lasted on a few seconds, they were just dizzy spells. I have never had this thing called \"BPPV\". So anyway, I wake up on Saturday morning. It was a different feelings, for some reason I woke up 5 times, each filling super dizzy like the world was spinning. I immediately sat up and it was fine. Like I said, I did this about 4-5 times and the last time I did it the world world flipped. And I struggled to the reach the door, calling for my brother to help me. I thought I had a stroke, I had no idea what happened.\n\nI finally laid on my back and it settled a bit, but I could not look any direction or the vertigo came back. I had to call the ambulance and have them take me to the ER. The anxiety left me numb and tingling, and over stressed. I spent a while in the ER while they did some tests, Dix Hallpike, MRI, etc.\n\nI was released that day still not being able to stand, and had to be carried/wheel chaired out. I had an appointment on Tuesday, which was three days later, for my physical therapist. I went to my physical therapist appointment and they did their black goggles/ eye nystagmus test. I ended up having an anterior canal problem in my left ear, and a posterior canal problem in the right ear. Anterior canal only has approx. 1% incident rate. While 90-95% people get the posterior canal. We ended up fixing my anterior side, but It made my posterior right canal a lot worse.\n\nSkip to Saturday, I am still feeling almost no relief. Constantly dizzy, sick to my stomach, and bed ridden. I ate maybe a piece of toast, or banana a day. My back constantly hurt from laying in bed all day. I attempted the epley maneuver that following Saturday, and completely botched it but somehow fixed it. I felt relief! It was amazing. I was obviously still really sick, but it did not feel quite as bad. I had my second appointment that following Monday and we confirmed I fixed my vertigo.\n\nAll in all, worst week of my entire life. If anyone has questions about BPPV. Feel free to hit me up! \n\nEdit: spelling and stuff Thank you for posting this. I am awake in the middle of the night dealing with what I am guessing is BPPV based on my symptoms. I have never experienced anything like this before. I am going to visit the doc. It is miserable! Yeah go to the doctor. They going to do some eye tests and hopefully the fix hallpike. I know the dizzyness is very rough, I resisted them even touching me and making me do any sort of head tests. Do not resist because knowing what I do now, I would have let them. But mine was so bad, Idk I was just scared. Good luck to you! I was just diagnosed this week. I tried the exercise and it just makes me feel like I am going to pass out and vomit. It is also causing me extreme anxiety.  Oh it is going to cause extreme anxiety trust me... I have anxiety issues on a regular basis. After 3 days though it got less anxious, just miserable.... I highly recommend seeing a physical therapist for this, one that actually knows what to do with the googles etc.. that is my opinion. It was nice being with a professional to help me with the maneuvers. PM me if you need to. I literally sat in bed for a week and a half because it was so baddddd. I got up every once in a while to stretch but I was falling all over the place. Thanks so much for the quick response. The dr said to do the moves myself and go to physio if it does not improve, but I think I will try and get a physio appt asap.  Yeah In the end like my post said I did do it myself.. but I messed up and fixed it some how. But with such a new scary, thought I was going to die that way lol, feeling I wanted to see a professional haha", "BPPV experience Has anyone had BPPV where movements of the head do not trigger vertigo?  I was diagnosed with BPPV but my vertigo was never triggered when expected.  I have always had it happen when either driving or working at the computer after long periods of looking straight ahead with very little or no movement of my head.  Just curious since I do not trust the hearing institute that I was sent to for evaluation. I have not had this exact experience, but my condition was rare as well and took a while to get a handle on it. The way I see it is you gotto find the right doctor, someone who is old enough to have seen all sorts of weird cases. The young ones are overconfident and not very understanding. \n\nOnce you find a wise doctor, the diagnosis and recovery are much faster! So do not give up on the medical professionals! Try to find a good one! This is how I first got it. Two days of 12+ hours driving and I was wrecked. I learned to do the Epley maneuver myself and was able to finish out the road trip. Still to this day a long road trip or a day spent playing video games without much other activity can cause an episode. I have found it is necessary to move around quite a lot when I can, tipping or tilting my head frequently and not having a day where I barely move can hold off an episode.  My latest dizziness spell was triggered working on the computer yesterday. It sucks. A friend of mine who has a desk job started getting vertigo too and all she was told by doctors was to keep taking breaks and look around, let your eyes adjust.  My trigger is certainly sleep deprivation.\n\nI am a firefighter and have noticed my spells come in after working for 24 hrs with little to no sleep", "Do I have BPPV? I have high blood pressure and a few days ago I have started taking some beta blockers/nebivolol (with doctor's prescription) to control it. Exactly a day after I took the beta blocker, I started feeling this strange sensation whenever I am walking or standing. It is as if I am in a boat/plane, I would feel the floor moving up and down in a wave like pattern. I also had a bad flu for the past few days and earlier today I visited an ENT specialist. The doctor told me that my ears are fine, no infections, but lately I feel like I became somewhat sensitive to loud sounds (no ringings in ear though). \n\nI do not really know what is happening, is this BPPV? Can something like this be caused by the side effects of taking beta blockers? Lately I became quite paranoid too, I really hope this is not brain tumor or some shit like that,  I am kind of scared. Usually BPPV is positional. (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is triggered by certain changes in head position, such as tipping the head up or down or rolling over/laying down in bed)\n\nIt also does not sound like you are having vertigo, which is the feeling the whole room is spinning or tilting. \n\nI am not sure about blood pressure medications but I would think most prescriptions have the possibility of certain side effects which could include dizziness. \n\nI would definitely go back to your doctor that prescribed the new medication and talk to them about your new symptoms. An ENT or GP(if trained in Dix-Hallpike) can test you for bppv. They will put you in certain positions to see if they can induce the vertigo and identify which ear is affected if it is BPPV based off of eye nystagmus.\n\nI hope you find out what is causing you your issues and you feel better soon. :) Had this for 4 months now, yeah I took something and now I am constantly on a boat... yeah I am literally fucking swaying. I am swaying man, I thought I had a brain tumor, but no. I am just swaying, when I walk the floor bounces, some days are better than others, it is worse when I am sitting down or on the bed, benedryl used to help, but now it does not anymore so I am going to take promethazine now, I really hope yours goes away, i pray, you do not want to have this shit, but I bet it is from the medicine, low blood pressure can cause vertigo from what I have heard? Correct me if I am wrong, try the epley maneuver, it works for me but it comes back within a few hours. Thanks for the reply!! I think I will give myself a few days to see if the dizziness goes away. As of now, I have stopped taking the beta blockers, I just want to see if stopping makes a difference, and I might go to the doctor next week to get a medicine that is more suitable for my hypertension. \n\nAgain, thank you for encouragement! Wow, your symptoms seem pretty similar to mine, I am also swaying all the time. I felt really annoyed by this constant wave like motion. Even when I am lying down, I would still feel some swaying. I tried doing the epley maneuver too, but it does not seem to help me much. \n\nI think I am just not suitable with the beta blockers that my doctor gave me. My blood pressure is not low, but it has been lower than my usual for the past few days. I have stopped taking them yesterday to see if anything changes. As of now my heart rate and blood pressure is still somewhat lower than usual.\n\nI hope we both get through this.", "Feels like I am constantly on a boat, plane, or roller coaster Hello! Thank you, everyone, for sharing your experiences with BPPV. They have really helped me put things into perspective because this condition is so terrifying!  Although I think my BPPV is \"cured\" -- as in the crystals are out of wrong place-- I am still feeling quite nauseated and I feel like I am constantly on a boat, plane, or roller coaster. \n\nHere is my experience with BPPV. I had my first bout on July 7, 2018; I woke up at 4 am and turned my head towards my husband and suddenly everything was spinning uncontrollably and had to vomit. I stumbled to the bathroom, in total fear, and did not have the confident that I would make it there at all. After that, I tried turning my head again and the spinning came back. I was so scared so I went to the ER. The doctors did the Epley and the spinning would happen again and I needed to vomit so I do not think it was successful. I did not move my head much after that, but I could feel that turning my head left or right would trigger the spinning sensation again. I went to two ENT doctors, the first one did not do much for me except give me anti-dizziness medicine and said I need to wait it out. The second one took video recordings of my eye movements and said I had horizontal BPPV because the spinning occurred when I moved my head both sides. The nurses there taught me to do the BBQ roll and that made me feel much better. I went back to the ENT two days later and did the hallpike test, and there were no longer eye movements no matter which side my head tilted. \n\nBut now I believe I have residual dizziness (probably?), and it is really bad when I am sitting still or laying down flat and looking straight up or when I close my eyes. It feels particularly bad at night or when I am trying to sleep. I constantly feel like I am on a boat or a ride at the amusement park (which I do not think I will ever go on anymore...) When I am walking or on a train, I feel much better, though. Being tat work has been difficult as I cannot concentrate at all in meetings or at my desk when I am sitting down and not moving.  I am hoping it will go away soon but it makes me feel completely helpless. I want to get off this ride of terror! Did anyone else experience residual dizziness, and what did it feel like?\n\nIt is horrible living like this. I hope everyone with it feels better soon! \n\nTLDR: BPPV, cured by maneuvers, but now constantly feel like I am moving/floating, feel nauseated.  Hang in there, I had residual dizziness that did not go away for almost a year. It was bad for 10 weeks, then slowly got better but BPPV came back so it is taken a year to get back to almost normal. I still feel like I am on a boat when I sleep but ive gotten used to it so it does not bother me too much. Try stress relieving methods like yoga or meditation or going for a walk. Good luck!  How did this turn out for you? All settled or still dizzy?\n\n  \nI would say if you are feeling residual dizziness, the crystals are not in fact back in place, no?  \nThat being said, I am not an expert.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "Anyone else have bppv recurrences often? Just curious if others have experienced recurrent bppv.  I have had brief episodes in the past and then had an episode July 2020 that had residual dizziness for 3 months.  I then had another episode in January that had similar longterm dizziness for 5 months.  Then had an episode 5 weeks ago, 4 weeks ago, and again yesterday.  I have a vestibular therapist and do the epley, etc to get rid of the acute symptoms but then continue to feel really off and dizzy after.  I keep doing the epley daily when I am feeling really off.  It just seems odd that I would have so many episodes so close together.  My episodes are the traditional vertigo that lasts for a minute or less and it triggers with the epley, etc.  I have had mri and have seen an ent.  I also have fluid in my affected ear, but not sure if that can re-trigger bppv.  Trying to stay positive, but each time I have a recurrence it is so frustrating. I have no advice to share but I want to let you know that I have had BPPV for more than 20 years. \n\nAt first it would happen every 3 months (give or take) and last a few hours/a day. Then and I would have little tiny moments where brushing my hair or picking up something I dropped and I would feel just the tiniest bit dizzy. Years when on with just these tiny moments and 5 or 6 years ago I had an 11-day spell and the I would notice a lot more times where I would be dizzy for a day or so. In December 2020 I had a full on episode that lasted 5 weeks and since I have had 4 more episodes that have been stressful and caused me to have to drop everything and basically wait out the dizziness. \n\nFor me that is the hardest part, it is not the dizziness or the nausea, the vomiting,  or even needing help it is the sudden disruption to my life and the worrying of when I will be okay enough to resume it and not being able to do all the things I want. Which is oddly funny because I have always been disabled and I have always had limits and been unable to do everything I want but this with BPPV is different. It is the very sudden and unpredictable loss of being able to participate in life that is so upsetting. I had 4 episodes within 2 years. The first 3 episodes, I really was not treated and did not know what was going on. But the last episode was nasty. I saw all the specialists and ended up with a vestibular therapist that helped me a TON.  I had active BPPV for over 2 months. I went to therapy once a week where the Epley was performed twice during the appointment. I was give exercises to do at home.  I also did the Epley and half summersault at home mid week.  We did well over 20 Epley before the BPPV was finally resolved. But then came months of horrible residual dizziness.  In fact, it was close to a year later that I finally started to feel better. It is not been almost 2 years since that last horrible episode.\n\nI am healthy as a horse. My diet is good. I am very physically active. I am not on any medications.  I remained active during BPPV as well (which shocked my therapist - but I was training for a running trail race).  I cannot even tell you the exact moment that fixed my BPPV - as I still felt so yucky.  I learned not to move in certain positions to trigger the brief violent vertigo as the crystals moved around. But the lack of head movement caused 'gaze instability.'  So I had waves of dizziness all the time as well. There are exercises to do, to recalibrate your brain for this as well.\n\nI also had strange ear popping, gurgling, fluttering.  The ENT said my ears were fine. I was also told that it had nothing to do with BPPV. I still question that.\n\nI am hoping that somehow, during this last episode, the fact that I was helped/treated by a professional - that we got rid of it for good. I still fear EVERY day that it will come back. But so far, it has not. It is no fun.  And it sucks that there is nothing you can do to help make you feel better. Medications do not help. I could not sleep, as when I shut my eyes, I would have waves of dizziness. Darkness was not my friend (and it was during the winter when we had way less hours of daylight).\n\nMy best advice is to keep up with professional therapy. Stay positive. Try super hard to keep stress free and keep the anxiety away.  The anxiety seemed to really trigger the residual dizziness. It can sometimes take a long time to get rid of the residual stuff. I also wish they knew WHY BPPV happens, so that we can try to stay away from triggers. I feel you man :( I had an attack in March, last year - not too bad and handled it with a Half-Sommersault, went back to normal, was hit again in April that year - a major episode, got rid of it with Epley and went to get checked at the ENT twice to be on the safe side - besides RD, no new attack for almost a year and a half, then boom woke up in July and it was back.    Epley it is, thought I got rid of it, then it hit August 8th and again, only 10 days after, on August 18th. I managed to visit a dizziness clinic last Monday were they put me in a TRV-chair and monitored my eyes. They concluded that my BPPV is gone, no nystagmus, but boy do I still feel so weird and constantly scared that it is not gone after all. It is a a complete different RD than last year too :( So I really feel you and am sitting with the exact same questions as you - you have all my warm thoughts. I am so scared it is going to be a monthly problem... so anxious man. Crossing my fingers it will be a long while until you have another attack, if it comes back at all!!! Cheers from here :)  Wow!  Sounds similar to my story.  I cannot figure out anything special that triggers mine.  I usually notice the vertigo either when I roll over in bed or am doing something like situps.  It is so frustrating to think that you are on the road to feeling better only to have it hit again!  I sure hope you feel better soon.  The RD is so anxiety provoking too. Thank you so much for your kind words.  It helps some to know that others have had similar struggles, as so.etimes I feel like I am the only one. Yes I agree.  I hate it when I get up in the morning and feel off and start worrying about whether I will get to work on time and if I should do the epley before I leave or if that will make it worse, etc.  I hope you feel better soon!  Closing the eyes and getting the waves/eye movement is the worst when trying to sleep. Every time I would feel it start I would open my eyes and I would be fine, but now I am awake. Last time the residual effects lasted a full 7 days before I felt better, I am on day 5 now of my second episode. It is crazy how long the after effects last because the vertigo I experienced only lasted about 5 seconds from sitting up in bed, followed by the epley maneuver 5 minutes later. No advice have 20+ episodes a day for 20 years. No diagnosis", "How often should I do the epley maneuver? Hi sorry if this has been asked before. My vertigo is back and I am wondering how often I should do the epley maneuver per day +how many days (until it goes away?)\n\nAlso, another (random) question, will drinking a lot of water help?\n\nThanks. If you are 200% certain that you have BPPV and that it is in the canal that Epley will help move the crystal, then you should look at doing it only once per day as you can overdo it and make things worse. \n\nI am not one to advise people to self treat as vertigo can be caused by so many things. If you do have BPPV it can be caused by one or both ears and you have 3 seperate canals that in each side the crystal(s) can dislodge in to\u2026\n\nHighly recommend you see a specalist such as a PT that specialises in balance and have them help you. I recommend a PT as well, but if this is a reoccurrence and you feel confident in its location then I typically will do 2-3 in a row with a patient. I also will have them do it every other day to give your body rest from the trauma of it. i was going to give my advice since ive had bppv but then i came to the conclusion that personally i think the question is best answered by an ear nose and throat (ent) dr or a vestibular specialist, since im not a dr. Thanks, I see my GP soon, so I will definitely inquire about seeing a specialist. Gotcha, I will try to schedule with one soon. I mean I did the Epley continuously until I resolved it. It was not fun and I threw up like twice but it was totally worth it. I would not want to go to bed and wake up knowing I still had that issue. I look at it the same way I view a splinter or an eyelash. Get out of my body and back where you came from NOW \ud83d\ude02", "Feeling like falling through the floor? I have recently been diagnosed with BPPV which I put in quotes because lately I have been feeling symptoms that do not seem to line up with it. The newest and honestly the most scary symptom is that when I walk barefoot it sometimes feels like I am falling through the floor or that the ground is super uneven even when it is not. It is bad when I am wearing shoes and even worse when I am barefoot. I cannot seem to stand in one place for more than 30 seconds without feeling like I am going to fall over. I do not really get the typical vertigo spells, it is almost like I am just having vertigo all day constantly.I have also detected some changes my vision, and it almost feels like everything is in some weird first person view, or like my vision is delayed. My head still feels foggy but I feel like I am having less vertigo symptoms. My whole body feels weak and I am wondering if there is something else going on. I have not had too much trouble driving but I do find myself having to focus a lot more than I usually do (which sounds bad to say about driving, I know). Any advice?", "Second day room spinning \ud83d\ude22 27F\u2014\u2014  woke up one day with weak/heavy legs (now struggling with dizziness) \nMedicine: diclofenac and cyclobenzaprine \n\nHey guys sorry to post again but I woke up again and the room was spinning. I also feel as if I am on a boat rocking back and forth. I just emailed my doctor to let her know and she usually responds or calls same day- especially since I am a complicated case with my legs. \n\nIs there anything I can do as I wait to help? I am laying down about to turn on Netflix and I have a wash cloth on my head.  I feel sick and I am just hoping and praying it is a side effect of my medicine. I honestly have been through hell and back with my legs being weak all of a sudden and have seen so many doctors and have had so many tests. I will list everything at the bottom just in case someone has a friend who has been like this - I just never know.... I am sorry if you have bppv but man I do not need anything else \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nDoctors I have seen(before dizziness started): neurologist , ER, primary, rheumatologist, Phsyical therapist \n\nTests I have had done: MRI throatic and lumbar, X-ray, ABI, EMG, over 10 different blood tests, catscan adomen pelvis and legs with contrast. I am sorry love, Are you getting the vertigo when you move positions? Like laying down, rolling over etc?\n\nHave you gone to a physical therapist or dizzy clinic to test for BPPV? \n\nIn the meantime, I would just rest and try not to invoke the vertigo and take some Dramamine or Bonine (meclizine). Both brands usually sell a non-drowsy as well. This should help the nausea. Check to make sure that they do not interact with the other medications you are taking first. If you are worried about that, raw ginger mixed with honey in a tea always helps my nausea immediately. \n\nHopefully they can figure out what is causing the vertigo and treat it. BPPV is relatively easy to treat so hopefully you will be feeling better soon. xx Thank you so much for the response. My first occurrence of room spinning was yesterday morning and I saw my physical therapist on Monday so my next appt with her is tomorrow. But again that is for my leg issues not for dizziness but I bet she could help with that also. \n\nI have honey I guess I can use that. Oh thank you so much for saying that! I hope it is an easy fix or just a side effect. I am so dizzy and rolling to either side makes it worse! The only way I can lay down is flat Most physical therapists have experience in vestibular rehabilitation and yes if it is BPPV it is a relatively easy fix. \n\nThey will test you by using the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. This is basically putting you in a triggering position and watching for eye nystagmus. Which is an eye jerking motion when you are having the spins. (I prefer them using the goggles to watch for this) This allows them to figure out which ear and canal has the loose otolith. They will then do whichever maneuver (Epley, BBQ roll, etc) to replace the crystal by putting it in a area of the inner ear where it does not cause balance issues and the body will absorb it. Once they do this sleep semi-recumbent and avoid rolling on your side or moving your head into triggering positions for the next couple days to keep the otolith from coming back out. Sometimes it is a one time treatment and for some people it is a couple more treatments but it should resolve soon. You may have lingering residual dizziness but that is normal and should go away on its own after a few weeks. A physical therapist can work through vestibular rehabilitation exercises with you to speed this along. I just let mine go away on its own. \n\nSome people never get it again.. some get it occasionally it really depends. Unfortunately researchers and doctors do not know the exact cause for why it happens in younger individuals since it is more common in elder individuals or from trauma. I believe I had my bought last year from a medication side effect but I do not know. It has not come back since. But I also have neck issues and it could have been caused by that too but I do not know lol\n\nJust get some rest and see physical therapist that has vestibular rehab training (most do, or most pt facilities have a therapist that treats this). \n\nI know it can be a stressful thing, being that dizzy and nauseous sucks. Feel better and I hope your legs get better soon too! xx\n\nEdit: forgot to add, when you do the maneuvers to treat the BPPV the vertigo will happen and feel worse bc the crystal is moving again but once it gets to where it needs to go you should feel some relief immediately. At least I did. Thank you so much for your knowledge on this subject. It definitely is helping me stay calm if there is help out there. I am just worried I have an autoimmune disease from the legs going weak and now this is another part of that disease. But who knows.\n\nI believe my eyes are moving because I have a hard time focusing especially when the walls are moving. I feel like I am drunk when in reality I have not had a drink in like 5 months due to medicine for my legs. You are very welcome. It freaked me out when I had it and talking to people who had it before really helped me feel better. \n\nI also have been having auto immune issues. I am actually seeing a rheumatologist this Friday lol but I do not think it contributed to me having BPPV a year ago. All I can say is that the body is a powerful thing. Do not stress about what you do not know yet. :) just get lots of sleep and take care of yourself. Physically and mentally \ud83d\udc95 Thank you so much! I feel much less stressed. Just going to let go and let my doctor figure it out. Yes I am drinking tons of water today and sleeping. About to take some Tylenol on top of my other meds to hopefully get rid of the dizziness ", "Question About Residual Dizziness I had terrible vertigo for 3-4 days before going to Urgent Care and being diagnosed with BPPV. I did the Epley as instructed and now when I do it no Nystagmus eye movement occurs at all. However I still feel dizzy. Is this just residual dizziness that will fade or is it something else? Thanks. I get this, usually when I look to the left. I think there are eye gaze exercises you can do which can help with the residual dizziness. E.g. look at an object and turn your head left to right \u00d7 10 and then up and down \u00d7 10 and diagonally \u00d7 10, still keeping your gaze on the object. Just like heart said.

It does not even give me much anxiety now as I can quickly do the Epley maneuver and it works like a charm.  \n\nThis time, however, is different.  I was inside inhaling a lot of second hand smoke the previous night.  Not sure if this is a trigger or correlate.  I had not been on much caffeine lately but was drinking more.  Letting my good habits slip.  The next day, I woke up with mild spins, did the maneuver.  It kind of fixed it, but not entirely as I felt \"off\".  Lately, that \"off\" feeling has been getting more worse.  \n\nI tried the Epley both sides again.  Still felt a little off but wanted to \"test\" if it worked.\n\nI tried to find what was triggering it.  I tried turning my head in different directions, balancing, spinning.  This was a mistake.  But I learned, any amount of turning to the left caused the vertigo.\n\nMost violently it happens when I lay down on my left ear or I turn over in bed to the left side.  \n\nI now just feel kind of drunk all the time and I try to avoid turning left when walking whenever I can (I prefer turning 270 deg to the right and look like an idiot).  \n\nIt sure seems like vertigo, but I bizarre manifestation.  I cannot even tell if the Epley helps it or not.  The nystagmus is not even *that* bad, from what I can tell.  \n\nI kind of just want to give it time and see if it will go away on its own, but I wonder if it is a good idea to head in to a medical professional for them to properly to the Epley and rule anything else out.\n\nThoughts? Have you ever tried the half somersault method? There is a video out there. It is helped me WAY more than the Epley and is much easier to do (for me). Also consider vestibular migraine. I have developed these, without the typical headache pain normally associated with migraine. Triggers for me are too much alcohol, dehydration and I recently learned that getting fluid in my ears either with an infection of some type or snorkeling! These things make me feel \u201coff\u201d and actually nauseated. It is worth a shot to check yourself for these things. Lots of water and some excedrin tends to help. \n\nAlso, it sounds like you BPPV related to your left ear. Mine is as well and I avoid my left side at all costs. I do not sleep on that side, do not do side planks, and always make sure I lean to my right when I need to lean over to look in my lower kitchen cabinets. This has prevented me from a recurrence for almost a year! Good luck! Most likely its BPPV, I would suggest doing the half Summersault maneuver as well (worked for me), as for the constant dizziness, you can take over the counter anti vertigo medicine for few days, until you start feeling normal.\n\nOne more thing, do you have any issues with cervical pain? Poor neck posture along with degeneration of cervical spine can also cause this. Do not really have issues with cervical pain.  I will definitely give the half summersault maneuver a try, thanks!\n\nIs the OTC anti-vertigo medicine Dramamine?  I have taken that for having to get on flights hungover, lol Gave the half sommersault a try, seemed to help!  Not totally gone, but it sounds like I should repeat attempts every 15 minutes or so.   I must have a lot of crystals lodged in.  Thanks so much! It sounds like BPPV, and the feeling drunk all the time kind of sounds like how I felt when the crystal had moved to a different canal. I felt like I was moving when I was sitting still. The bbq roll made me feel worse, so my PT used the Gufoni maneuver. Might be worth a try. If you can have someone watch your eyes and see which direction they vibrate in that can help you figure out which canal the crystal is stuck in. If no cervical issue then most likely BPPV, yes my doc had prescribed me Dramamine for BPPV, gave me relief with the dizziness that lasted for few days after vertigo. \n\nThings had stopped rotating next day, but while getting up or at slight head movement while walking, I still felt like you would feel after being drunk. Glad it helped you, I recommend doing it for few days daily. Also avoid sudden head movements and do not sleep on the side where you feel your symptoms of vertigo.", "New to BPPV: Is constant dizziness common? Hello everyone,\n\nI have the symptoms of BPPV for the second time in a year now. The first time, I could not go to the doctor, but over the phone, I got the diagnose that it is \"probably\" BPPV (only symptoms were spinning sensations and nausea, caused by the constant spinning).  \nThe symptoms were quite extreme, I was tied to the bed and felt really nauseated, the spinning almost never really stopped. I could not sleep because of it. I did some of the maneuvers, and after 1,5 weeks, the symptoms just sort of faded away.   \nNow, a few months later, I just woke up feeling dizzy once again. I went to the doctor this time, again the diagnosis of \"probably\" BPPV. Even though I keep telling him that the dizziness occurs no matter the position - if I sit, walk, lie down... it is just there. Granted, it usually gets worse when I sit for a while, then get up to do something, and sit down again. So it is definitely better, and sometimes barely noticeable if I am still for some time, and it worsens if I move, but it is never completely gone.\n\nAll my sources say I should only feel dizzy when I move my head a certain way. I also did some of these maneuvres to test which ear is the one that is causing the problem, and usually, I feel dizzy on both sides, just one slightly more. Are there other people experiencing the same with BPPV?\n\nI am not looking for a different diagnosis, just asking if this is normal amongst fellow BPPV-people, and perhaps you know of are other things I could try? :) \n\nThanks a bunchies! Go to a Vestibular Therapist! You are in the exact opposite situation I am in. My dizziness only occurs with certain motions that are difficult to replicate. BPPV is positional, it does not make you continuously dizzy. Plus you will have eye movement (nystagmus) during the spinning, you can have someone check your eyes or record yourself and check it. Sounds like you need a vestibular specialist or at least a different doctor who is more familiar with BPPV. I experienced that too. Still not sure if mine was bppv or vestibular migraines. You may benefit from looking at that option as well, it may not be bppv. &gt; BPPV is positional, it does not make you continuously dizzy.\n\nWhen you find the position that makes you dizzy and hold it, does it make you continuously dizzy? Have not heard of vestibular migraines yet.. will look into that, thanks! Usually, for example if I turn from one side to another in bed, it gets worse but it will \u201cstabilize\u201d. Sometimes I will not feel dizzy at all after a minute or so, sometimes it is still slightly spinning. It should not, typically the dizziness lasts a few seconds to a minute or something like that. Keep in mind this is my personal experience only, I am not a doctor. Yeah I am just trying to figure out what other people experience so I can compare to myself. I had my first appointment with a therapist today and although she was able to confirm a balance issue, she never detected any nystagmus so I have been moving my head around on my own now trying to see if I can find a position where I feel noticeably bad. However, so far all I have been able to find is that sudden movement in certain directions triggers this weird feeling like I am losing my balance. Interesting, did they say what they thought the problem was? As far as I know nystagmus should be present with the dizziness if it is BPPV, I did have one occasion where it was really subtle and it did not start right away when the therapist was testing me, I had to tell her when I could feel it starting up before she could see it. I was wearing the goggle things where they can see your eyes on a screen. I came down with dizziness and vomiting for a week early last year. Decided I was in it for the long haul when I still felt very off kilter three to four weeks after. I stock shelves in retail and there were many times I felt I was going to have to find a new occupation (low shelves were very challenging for me, ladders too). I saw an audiologist several months later who diagnosed the nystagmus and pointed me to BPPV.\n\nNausea/Nystagmus was always there no matter what position my head was in. It worsened considerably when I was engaged in physical activity, lying down or had my head tilted in a certain orientation. I suspect that BPPV is a spectrum, and while some with mild cases may not perceive problems all the time, some may have a baseline level of discomfort that is worse than the average BPPV individual's worst episode.\n\nI posted in this sub a few months ago that I was concerned my condition was not responding to treatment as quickly as I hoped. I am happy to report that after several weekly at-home Epley maneuvers, I am finally feeling 98% like myself!\n\nThe subtle nystagmus seems to always be there (even while sitting still), but I feel very relieved that I was able to get through this thing without missing too much of life. Indeed, that is what I was curious about too - to see just how different BPPV can be for everyone. Very glad to hear you are feeling better! Hope you will get to 100% yourself very quickly now! :) She was not sure. Like I said, she knows I have a balance issue but was not able to determine where it is coming from. Hopefully after a few days off of the meclizine it will be more apparent to them. Same for me. I actually started having ear clicking (which are the ears crystals inside our ears that change position and are the cause of bppv) without dizziness in Summer 2018. The ear clicking is present until today. I also started having dizziness when I woke up one morning on September 2020, all of the sudden, until today. The dizziness-lightheadedness is mostly located on my left side of head, on my left temple. The thing is that I am feeling this all day dizziness every day, but what is more interesting, I also feel like room spinning and nausea some times, especially when I turn my head suddenly in the morning or just rotated my head suddenly to any position. How strange! Have you tried any of the movements yet or talked to your doctor? If you did, did any of that help you? If you feel dizzy since 2020.. that is damn long, sorry about that!  :/ \nI also get the ear clicking, but only when I am already experiencing BPPV. But the dizziness you describe, it is the same as well. Constantly dizzy, and sometimes just way worse with nausea. When I mentioned that to my doctor he did not say anything about it though... yeah, I tried the Eppley Maneuvers (I think that is how they are called), I talked to my dad as well, who is a doctor, did not say it is sth worrying, but like, it is just the think that I know I have BPPV, I have the \"room spinning\" sensation (which is the most characteristic symptom of BPPV) from time to time, when I turn my head, but I also have the constant lightheadedness, would not say it is 100% dizziness, like, it is mostly lightheadedness which is focused on my left side of the head (in the temple) and a little dizziness, especially when rotating my head suddenly and when I wake up in the morning. Oh, forgot to ask you, do you also feel extremely dizzy when you wake up in the morning and also when you got to bed, all the lights are closed, and you are about to sleep, do not you feel dizzy this time? It varies but whenever my BPPV starts, it is way worse the first three, four days. And on those days I cannot sleep at night because the spinning sensation is still there when I lay down and try to sleep. The darkness seems to make it worse because when I close my eyes I sometimes get anxiety because it feels so surreal, as I am still spinning. This improves once my BPPV starts to fade in general, so far mine lasted for about a week, but it is super annoying... so even if people tell me it is nothing to worry about, yea, well, it sucks anyways. same for me mate, if u want, text me to talk more", "Who else hates washing their hair because of BPPV? I have had BPPV for almost 5 years now and it is becoming more difficult than ever to wash my hair. I wash my hair 1-2 times a week and  every time I do, it triggers my vertigo. Even brushing my hair gives me vertigo. It is not severe vertigo, actually it is just mild dizziness most of the time but I still feel like shit. Showering should be a relaxing experience. I remember when I was younger, I would shower because it made me feel clean and relaxed but now that I am an adult, it feels like a task. BPPV always gets in the way and ruins daily things I used to enjoy doing. Sorry for making it a little rant-y. I feel the pain! Even tipping my head the slightest makes me feel the wave of dizzy come on, I enjoyed showers as well, now it seems like a chore and depressing in ways. Yeah BPPV can really get in the way of your daily activities. Especially the activities that are supposed to make you feel better or relaxed. Ranting is good, got to express your frustrations with an unfortunate situation you are experiencing. Do you have the option of visiting a place where they have an eply maneuver chair? They can set your crystals back into place, and with proper care it will help a lot with vertigo. I would not try the \"at home\" eply maneuvers where you roll around and try to adjust your crystals by yourself, I basically knocked them out of place by doing so. \n\nI have had BPPV for almost two years now, and I can say that neuroplasticity will help you regain a lot of your balance through practice and training. Keep a positive mentality and try to find some activities that will help retrain your balance. I took up juggling and my hand-eye coordination has become excellent as well as my balance. (I am capable of standing on one leg and begin rotating in a circle while I juggle, which seemed impossible at the beginning of all of this)\n\nHope any of this helps out. Have a great day and stay safe out there. I am sorry to hear that. I hope it gets better for you. \ud83d\ude25 OMG  - YES!!!!!  And I am one that often tips my head upside down in the kitchen sink to wash my hair.  Imagine THAT?!?!?  So I had to resort to strictly washing my hair in the shower for a few months.  And even that - tipping my head back, was gross.  Dry shampoo was my friend.  I would wash my hair twice a week (if I was lucky). And luckily, I have long hair, so ponytails, buns, up-dos, braids.....I could get by. But the anxiety of getting my hair washed was horrible.\n\nThe good thing is - once BPPV is cleared it is much better!  Is your BPPV cleared?  Is it residual dizziness you are dealing with?  I promise, it DOES get better!  I had active BPPV for over 2 months and now am on month 4 or so of residual dizziness.  And I can happily say I can get my hair washed BOTH ways with no problems now! My therapist gave me a lot of dizziness exercises to help get my system back in sync quicker to make the residual dizziness go away.\n\nI think that even the mild dizziness makes you feel like crap, because it triggers the anxiety of full blown BPPV coming back. It is a vicious circle!\n\nI probably did many of the same exercises that /u/Flubuska did - except I did not get to the point of juggling.  That is awesome!  Imagine the coordination involved to do that - even if you were not dizzy! But I am able to be very active with sports and hobbies now. Thank you for giving me some hope. I saw an ENT about 2 years ago. He did a test but  I did not show any sign on BPPV.  I think he asked me if I was really experiencing vertigo. When he did the test, I did not feel dizzy. But that does not mean I do not have it.  I cannot even do ab workouts because as soon as I lay down on the floor, my head starts spinning. My symptoms are not severe but it is  still debilitating. I was sent home with an epley maneuver guide. I have done the eply maneuver before but I  do not think it helps. I agree, I think I should just see the ent to have an eply maneuver done.  Do you find that your vertigo gets worse at night or when it is dark?  I do not think there is any place in my town that does the eply maneuver. \n\nI remember my first episode. It was almost 5 years ago. I was watching a CCTV footage and I had to look up because the TV mounted an inch below  the ceiling.  It was so bad that it last for almost a week. Ever since then, I have been extremely careful to not look up or down for too long. \n\nIt sucks because people do not understand how horrible it is to suffer from vertigo everyday. My sister is the only one who understands, the rest of my family thinks I am just making a big deal. Sadly, it only matters when they go through something like this, when others do, they tell you that you are overreacting. Haha. I used to wash my hair in the bathroom sink until I started experiencing vertigo. I need to start using dry shampoo again. \n\nI am not sure what residual dizziness means. I was never treated for BPPV.  These last 5 years,  I avoided positions that would trigger my vertigo. When I am washing my hair, I do not lean my head back anymore because I know it is going to make me feel horrible. I have had severe attacks before but now I know what triggers my vertigo so I have not had a severe episode in really long. But mild dizziness is affecting my life. I have to think before I do anything. I cannot do ab workouts on the floor because looking at ceiling will make me so disoriented. I do not think I have active BPPV right now. I think it just comes and goes but there is no warning. Usually it gets worse at night for me. I am glad yours is improving. I hope someday, mine will get better. I always thought that there was no hope for this. I am only 24 and I have been suffering since I was 19. But I am also at fault for not taking action quickly.  I gave up on trying to find a solution and living in a small town makes it hard to find someone who specializes in vertigo. Here is a quick low down of the active BPPV versus residual dizziness (all info straight from my vestibular therapist).  Mind you - before I start the explanation, I had 3 episodes of vertigo prior to this last (4th) time.  All seemingly resolved on their own, and I really did not know much about it, other than the ER doc saying I had BPPV, and him giving me meds. This last time, I sought help and am hoping since the BPPV was truly cleared, it perhaps will not happen again and the residual dizziness will go away.\n\nActive BPPV is when the crystal is still floating loose in your inner ear canal. The most frequent way that is used to test for it (the most common version), is to do the Dix Hallpike test. This essentially is laying you back quickly with your head tipped to the left or right, head extended past your shoulders.  If it triggers the BAD vertigo, meaning an intense less than 30 seconds of severe dizziness with nystagmus (eye twitching), that means the crystal is in THAT ear canal floating loose.  To cure it, you must do a series of maneuvers, called the Epley maneuver, to rotate that crystal back around the ear canal, so that the dizziness goes away.  There are 6 inner ear canals, and if others are the problem, there are other tests and maneuvers to fix it.\n\nSo after getting the crystal back in place, some people are left with residual dizziness. It is a more mild form of dizziness that one experiences on a daily basis. Not as crippling as the vertigo, but still very annoying. My active BPPV lasted over 2 months and it took weekly trips to the vestibular therapist and over 20 Epley maneuvers (that make you VERY sick as it provokes the vertigo as the crystal moves around the ear canal).  Because it lasted so long with me - my body adapted to being unbalanced. Therefore, it is taking a long time for me to get rid of the residual dizziness (over 4 months now).\n\nBPPV can also resolve on it is own - as the crystal can dissolve or be reabsorbed.  I am hoping since I got help this time and properly cured it and have done tons of vestibular/balance exercises, it will never come back. \n\nI wish you could find a dizzy specialist or a PT that deals with dizziness. You should not have to live with it! My therapist tested me for a lot of stuff - as there are many other dizzy diagnoses that I do not know as much about. You talking about learning how to avoid it - I did the same thing. And my lack of moving my head certain ways then caused something called gaze instability. I would be dizzy while sitting still, when I closed my eyes, and just doing any small movements. Oddly enough, when I was exercising (running) I felt fine. But being still was nasty. There are exercises to help the daily dizziness as well, if your BPPV is cured. A lot of it is challenging the dizziness by repeating the action that caused the dizziness so that your body adapts to 'normal' again.\n\nI hope you can some day (SOON) get some answers and get rid of your dizziness!  And....YES, get some dry shampoo!!!! Yeah it is unfortunate people do not understand how debilitating vertigo can be. And like you said, the dark and closing your eyes makes the vertigo much worse. This is because your sight helps immensely with your sense of balance. Once you close your eyes or have limited vision, your body begins to utilize the vestibular organs in your ears to help you balance. And because your crystals are loose, or your vestibular organs are damaged like mine, your body will lose its sense of balance. \n\nA portion of physical therapy I went through made me practice closing my eyes to help get used to the feeling of being unbalanced.\n\nThe main focus of physical therapy for vertigo/BPPV was to challenge the vertigo. Practicing your balance is key, your brain will begin to adapt for your damaged sense of balance.\n\nI have 30% permanent damage to my left ears vestibular organs, but nowadays I rarely am struggling with vertigo. Although there are random bouts and episodes. \n\nI believe in you and you can get through this.\n\nIt is definitely tough, but this is the hand we have been dealt. \n\nI am thankful it is not a life threatening condition, but it is pretty brutal to go through.\n\nIf you ever need any advice or want to message someone about what you are going through my discord is Flubuska#4507. Having someone who understands what you are going through is helpful, I never had anyone who understood so I came to this subreddit. Although there is not many posts here. Again thank you for all the info. This is ny second day of doing the epley manauver at home but I am still considering about seeing a vestibular therapist. I did some research and there are a few llaces in my town specialize in vestibular related problems. I am so sorry you had to go through this. Your case seems very severe but I am glad you are feeling better!!\n\nOh boy I have way too many dry shampoo bottles but my sister ends up using them because I rarely used them lol. I am sorry love, I had that when I had active BPPV last year. Honestly I just did not wash it and stuck with co washing. Since it is cleared, I can wash my hair normal. I think a lot of it is anxiety. I shampoo and condition my hair bent over in the shower and slowly come back up. I have long hair, so I rely on leave in conditioners to keep everything soft since I cannot stay bent over all the time to let conditioner sit.", "Diagnosed with BPPV but still Skeptical Hello All!\n\nLong story short. Got pneumonia in 2017. Ever since then I get super lightheaded/imbalanced once a month up until two weeks ago. Now I am in a constant brain fog where I feel like I have to physically touch or squeeze something to regain my positioning. Never fainted or fallen or anything of that nature. I am at the point now where I feel pretty much a constant buzz/high 60% of the day.\n\nWent to a doctor and he diagnosed me with BPPV but when he did the Epley Maneuver, I did not feel necessary dizzy in either ear. He told me to wait a couple months and come back if it worsens or lasts after that. Now my hypochondria mentality has kicked in and I am worried it is something completely separate from my ears. Can one of you please speak to this/advise me if I am being ridiculous? As in, should I just wait the two months or should I go to a neurologist/ENT?\n\nNote: feeling dizzy but absolutely functional to drive/go to work. Almost feeling constantly high or buzzed. Never have lost sight or anything. Cannot narrow it down to one ear over the other. I had horrible BPPV for two weeks with complete spinning of my world and as it subsided I had very bad brain fog. I even described it to my husband as a \u201cbuzz/high\u201d feeling. I noticed it more with different lighting (dim lights or walking in the evening). My BPPV started by me doing yoga when I had a virus. I am young and very healthy otherwise but I completely understand the buzzed and high feeling. It freaks me out a little too so I love into a space with better lighting and try not to move my eyes or head too much until it goes away. I am so sorry, BPPV is scary and sometimes so unpredictable. Thanks for your reply. My only concern is that I never had that spinning feeling (non spinning vertigo as if I am imbalanced) which makes me think it may possibly not be BPPV?\n\nRegardless, it is good to hear you seem to be recovering from it!

It is so unpleasant but my experience has been that it eventually goes way completely. Thank you so much for your reply ! I really hope it is going away.\n\nBut Actually from just yesterday ( after about 3 weeks of the initial vertigo episode ) I have been having fullness in one ear. But that is it. A little pain maybe. But no hearing loss. No ringing. But it is been happening since yesterday only. Awe sounds awful but sounds like residual dizziness which is awful as well but should fade gradually. I find that if I do the epsey manuver the moment I wake up with an episode and force through it the less the residual dizziness lasts for. And try to get back to your normal routine as quick as possible, if you start avoiding movements it can cause balance issues longer :( and i find the longer I avoid things the worst my anxiety gets over the dizzy feeling. Good luck and do not worry the residual dizzyness is not a forever thing!!! Fullness can be normal and sometimes I find I over notice ear things with vertigo even if they are not actually related. I once went to a specialist because i was convinced my ear was blocked and crackling along  with vertigo and when they checked they said i was just being hyper aware of things because of my vertigo and the two were not connected!

I got a lot of great tips that seem to have helped a lot. What I tried was the Epley maneuver and then the half somersault which actually seemed to help even more but it depends on your particular case. There are also other maneuvers that help as well. Also I cut out caffeine, which was difficult, and took large amounts of vitamin d. (3000 u compared to the suggested amount of 600 u). Also reduced sodium intake. It is hard to say which of these helped the most but try all of them. Also that is great that cbd helps. Maybe try thc for appetite.

At times I have felt the dizzy after effects for months.  But for the last 6 years it was basically gone.  Then last September I slept in an unusual position because of a bad cough keeping me awake.  I woke up with a terrible vertigo episode.  I had convinced myself that the vertigo I had before was all caused by anxiety, which I have also recovered from.  But nope, apparently it is an actual physical issue.  \n\nAfter the first spin I had a day of feeling on the verge of it happening again anytime I looked up or down, but after 2-3 days it went away.  Then I woke up with spinning again 6 weeks later, had a day of residual, then fine again for another 6 weeks and repeat.  \n\nAfter the most recent bout I have been afraid to sleep flat at all. I have returned to my old system of sleeping almost straight up and using a travel pillow to keep my neck straight.  Then yesterday after 2 weeks with no issues, I tilted my head back in a meeting and had a couple seconds of vertigo and still feel the after effects a day later.  \n\nMy issue is that I have never had a spin last more than 20-30 seconds and once it happens I have never had it happen again for at least a few days and usually weeks to months.  So I am not sure if it is worth trying the Epley when the descriptions I have read sound terrifying and I do not want to give myself a panic attack or PTSD.  \n\nBut at the same time I do not want to have to keep sleeping upright, and having trouble getting to sleep out of the fear of waking up with vertigo in the morning.  It has always resolved with an Epley in the past, but I have never before had so many spinning episodes, with the frequency seeming to increase from every 6 weeks to every couple weeks now.  \n\nI really just do not know what to do. I have never had vertigo episodes last more than a few seconds and I have always been able to stop them simply by standing up, legs wide apart and staying mostly still for a minute or two.  So would the Epley be more effective really? If you have never done the Epley before, I would recommend making an appointment to do it with a medical professional first. Its not so bad... and most people respond quite well to treatment. There is nothing to be afraid of. Even the vertigo itself is nothing to fear; it is unpleasant but it is not dangerous. The Epley's purpose is to knock the loose crystals into a position where they are stable. I recommend doing it, then following it with Brandt\\_Daroff exercises on both sides 5x, 5x a day for two weeks. This happened to me and this is how I solved it. I am not afraid of the vertigo causing some other problem, I am terrified of the vertigo itself. I have experienced it plenty of times and it is the absolute worst sensation I can ever imagine having, it has given me panic attacks in the past.  And I have never, ever let an episode just play out, I always leap out of bed, out of my seat, whatever I am doing to make it stop, and I have always had it stop within seconds. The idea of holding still and letting myself have the worst attack of my life is what scares the hell out of me. They say the maneuvers are the best at helping. There are other maneuvers and you can try doing them yourself. To help your fear, when I had the epley maneuvers done by a Vestibular PT, it was awful, just awful.

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* I would not do it.\n\nMy left side is also the issue and I begrudgingly trained myself to sleep on the right\u2026 Maybe use a pillow to prop it behind you so you do not roll to the left side? Has your BPPV been resolved? Most cannot sleep on the effected side because it provokes the vertigo as the crystal moves around the ear canal. If it is been a few days since your BPPV has been resolved... If you can tolerate it, you can sleep on your bad side. If the BPPV has been corrected &amp; the crystal has had time to settle in the proper spot, you should not get vertigo when you lay on that side. This is current info I got directly from my vestibular therapist. She said to get back to all normal activities as soon as tolerated. Best wishes to you! (I had residual dizziness &amp; it took months before I could lay on the effected side without waves of dizziness.) I am not sure. I still have a lot of nystagmus and dizziness that never really goes away, but the spinning vertigo is gone for now.\nSo maybe it is residual dizziness?\n\nThank you so much.\nI am glad to hear what your vestibular therapist said. It made me sad to think I could never do yoga again or always be conscious about the positions I turn my head Thanks. I will try :) Was not able to sleep on my right side for months because it triggers the vertigo. I also needed to be propped up on 2 pillows. Maybe try elevating your head a bit? I am now able to sleep on my right side after 6 mos, so that is some good news for you!", "How often do you perform a self Epley? Hi everyone.\n\nI recently had my first ever bout of vertigo two days ago, noticed when I was sitting in bed and tilted my head back and to the right. I am in my late 20s, very healthy and never had this sort of problem before. Went to see my doctor and was prescribed meclizine and told I could possibly have BPPV.\n\nMy question is, for those who are long lasting sufferers: Do you perform a self Epley maneuver, and if so, how many times do you do it? My doctor said I can do it daily, however I have seen conflicting information regarding it being done once, twice, or three times a day.\n\nAny info helps.\n\nThanks! Edit: My vertigo is only brought on when I lay down. Otherwise I have no balance issues walking, running, standing etc. I have possibly  concluded it is on my right side since when I lay down and turn my head to the right it is exacerbated; yet when I turn my head to the left I feel no dizziness. Never.  I did it once and got much sicker.  I found out later that a lot of people do it wrong so for me I would rather just take meclizine and take it easy. Does the meclizine you take help long term? And are you able to exercise, work, etc? I am starting my prescription today. The meclizine is the only thing that helps, which is weird because all the BPPV advice seems to be drugs do not work.  The more active I am the better I feel (lying in bed all day during an attack makes things worse), so a combination of lots of walking and the meclizine seems to help abate things quickly. I was in therapy with a vestibular therapist (dizzy specialist) for close to 3 months. She performed the Epley on me once a week, but would perform it twice while I was there (about 5 or 10 minutes apart). Since I was a stubborn case, I was allowed to do it myself mid week. And I would do it 2 or 3 times about 5 or 10 minutes apart. It took 20 times to clear. She feels you need a few days to recover &amp; let the crystal settle if it actually worked.\n\nIt is not hard to do, but it is helpful to have someone experienced coach you through it a few times. There is also the half somersault. It does not provoke symptoms as severely. But it is not as well proven or studied either. I always did a few of those as well.\n\nSone people do it daily. As you mentioned, there are a lot of different opinions. I trusted my therapist.... As she is continually attending the latest dizzy seminars &amp; keeping current on her education. I went to a dizzy and balance center weekly, they said I could do it about three days after my appointment if I wanted to, at most 3 times in a row. It made me horribly dizzy to the point of having a panic attack so I stopped doing it. After that they had me do the Semont Maneuver.   Then the crystal migrated to a different canal and they had to use a different move anyway. I feel it is better when a trained professional does it with you. I just recently had my first episode of Bppv which lasted about 5 weeks. I am about 90% better and I have my physiotherapist to thank for that. It takes a while to fully recover and you most likely will have some residual dizziness like I have. I can finally turn my head on the left side without feeling intense and volatile. The whole point of the Epley is to resolve the BPPV. I have never understood this recommendation of doing it as a daily practice. Once the BPPV is resolved, the Epley will not serve any purpose. ive had it twice in my life (few years apart). I did the maneuvers 3 times a day until I got better. Usually just once is good enough, but you need to ensure your head stays vertical for the rest of the day.\n\nI do not really think drugs do much. I mean, you physically have a dislodged crystal just floating around screwing with your balance. I am a young guy and pretty athletic. It seems like it can happen to anyone yep same for me, i was stuck with it for almost a week last week and sunday i finally had a good nights sleep. staying at home has not helped with moving things around the right way. \n\ni think it is good to sit upright as much as possible and just watch TV and get some food in you to make it pass as fast as possible\n\ni have probably had 500+ episodes and every time they have gone away fastest is when i made myself get up and shower/go to work. I only did it twice. After the second time the otolith was repositioned and I just slept in a recliner for a week and was good to go.\n\nFrom my understanding, you only need to do the Epley or other repositioning exercises while the bppv is active . Once the crystal is no longer out of place there is no reason to do it. Daily Epley has not been proven to prevent bppv episodes from reoccurring.\n\nalso, doing it with a professional is going to be more beneficial. On your own is hard and will most likely be done incorrectly. Thanks for the info! When you performed the exercises at home, how did you know you were \u201cfixed\u201d? Was it a gradual comeback or did you feel immediate relief after a certain period? Hmm..  \n\n\nOk so for example, I would be doing stuff and moving my head forward/tilted. i.e. kneel down and look for stuff below the kitchen sink or cupboards, etc. Would get that BPPV sickness. So I would then do the epley maneuever on the affected side. I would be pretty reasonable on my time waits (1min or 2 per step). I would get up and stay vertically. I would feel better.\n\nThis was not the case everytime though. Sometimes it would make it worse (even with waiting in between). My doctor (and numerous health sites) say this can happen. Unfortunately there is not much you can do. The manuevers are not a silver bullet trick, but they will help in the long run from my experience. If it the nausea/disorientation is too much from the manuever, you might be doing them wrong. Ask a relative/etc to check out the procedure on YouTube with you and see if you are doing it properly. A few doctors and balance specialists have posted the maneuver online and go in thorough detail.", "Floor feels uneven/Boat-Like Feeling - Residual Dizziness?? Hi,\n\nI got diagnosed with BPPV by a PT back in November 2020, where I noticed I get a vertigo sensation (not spinning but dizziness) when looking down. I have been following the vestibular exercises and i have been seeing some improvements. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, this past few weeks I have been noticing more residual dizziness symptoms namely:\n\n\\-Uneven floor/boat feeling on my right side when walk or turn my head toward my right side, it only lasts a few seconds \n\n\\-Also when I am talking I tend to move my head and this also creates this sudden dizziness feeling\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am wondering if this is just residual dizziness or if I still have stones left. I did exercises and was able to fix the dizziness that came from turning my head to the right and looking up. There is still some residual dizziness more than a day after but it seems to be improving. You can always do the Dix Hallpike to check to see if you still have loose crystals in your inner ear canal.  I worked with a therapist and I was checked weekly (active BPPV for about 8 weeks).  Even after the crystal was located back where it needed to be, I felt awful, in a different way.  The residual dizziness was horrible - and each week I made her retest me, as I was positive I still have crystals floating around. I continued to test negative. So - for about a year now, I have had symptoms similar to what you describe.  Certain positions trigger a wave of that milder dizziness. And it gets better and worse for no apparent reason.  No amount of activity or exercises seem to resolve it. I am learning to live with it - and just thankful it is not near as horrible as it was initially.\n\nIf it will ease anxiety by going back to your PT and having them test all 6 inner ear canals again to see if it is active BPPV, do it.  Or, if you are comfortable testing yourself at home with the Dix Hallpike, do it. You will know right away if that brief feeling of violent vertigo hits with nystagmus.\n\nIt was just brought to my attention that my residual dizziness is likely PPPD (you can google that). Thank you so much for sharing this! Thanks, I figure I need to be a little more persistent in doing the excercises. Hi u/slakster,\n\nI like the ideas others have offered in the comments.\n\nFeel free to also check out our our ( in case there is something there that is helpful.", "Vertigo- I do not which ear is the affected. Hi. For the first time I was diagnosed with BPPV vertigo. I went yesterday to urgent care and the doctor gave me a document with instructions on how to perform the Epley Maneuver for both ears. However, I do not know which ear is the affected. I read online the advice to  turn my head to the right and lie back quickly. If after a minute I felt dizzy, then that was the affected side. I did that for both ears and did not feel dizzy in either of them. What would you recommend me? To do the maneuver for both ears? Thank you in advance for your help.", "Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) ", "Could this be vertigo? Potentially going to make me lose my new job. Symptoms while working a cash register at CVS: I was extremely dizzy, confused, disoriented, unable to think clearly, had a hard time communicating, standing was challenging, dissociation (dpdr), etc.\n\nTriggers upon rapid movement (like working the register or cooking), standing up after laying down, staring at a monitor for extended periods of time and then moving, or laying my head backwards.\n\nAlthough, this is persistent. Not episodic in origin. It has always happened for as long as I can remember. I tried doing the ( and there was no room spinning or anything. Though, incredible pain, dizziness as described above, and disorientation. I deal with this too! I was told it is vertigo when I told the doctor I felt dizzy and confused, but like you the room does not spin but my vision gets weird and I get disoriented too. Hopefully someone on here can answer this for us. Because It is really made me anxious. An easy way to see if it is BPPV is to have someone watch your eyes while you test for vertigo (google the Epley maneuver), if it is BPPV your eyes will make involuntary movements back and forth (nystagmus). Have you seen a doctor? You could also be having anxiety, blood pressure problems...it is worth getting checked by a professional. Sounds like a blood pressure/ heart rate type of problem. Such as Vasovagal syncope- where with certain triggers your blood pressure may drop and either make you faint or close to it, often accompanied by an increased heart rate to counteract the low bp. Could also be POTS- which is usually with posture change, but is also blood pressure. The test for POTS is simple, they check your blood pressure when you are laying down, sitting, then standing and compare. Who would you see for something like this? I have been trying to find a physical therapist but there are none around me, unfortunately. If you do not have a Dizzy/balance center near you your best bet might be an ENT. But a general practitioner would be good to check overall symptoms, maybe you can ask your clinic if anyone has experience with BPPV , it seems like some do and some do not. Edit to add I needed a referral from my go to go to the Dizzy/balance center. never heard of POTS previously but after some reading im starting to wonder if this is what is been sscrewing me up for the last 5 months. going to try to see a doctor about it. thanks for bringing this up", "Could I possibly have BPPV Am I ever going to feel normal?\n\nI am currently 3 going on 4 months postpartum. Since I was a couple weeks postpartum I have felt terrible. I have head pressure,ringing in my ears, very bad dizziness(standing/sitting/even laying down sometimes) it is like I have very bad brain fog and it feels hard to concentrate at times. My vision also gets funny and I see lots of what I guess you could call \u201cfloaters\u201d in my eyes. I have been to the OB who said I just had anxiety and started me on zoloft. I took Zoloft for a little over a month and it did not help my symptoms if anything it seemed to make them worse so I weaned myself off very slowly. I have now been off of it for about 3 weeks and my symptoms are the same. I do not feel anxious about my baby and I have plenty of support and time for myself. My baby also sleeps 8 hours a night so I am getting decent sleep whenever I am done cleaning/doing other things after he is in bed.  I went to the chiropractor, which was no help. I then when to my primary care physician several times  who referred me to an ENT. The ENT said my ears looked fine but has me scheduled for balance/vertigo testing but I am so tired of going to doctors I am thinking about canceling the appointment. I am wondering if this is just my body still adjusting and balancing my hormones but I feel horrible and I am starting to lose hope that I am ever going to feel normal  again. I enjoy my baby so much and I am constantly sad that I cannot feel my best and my symptoms sometimes even give me anxiety to go places because I do not know how I will feel. Has anyone ever experienced this? I am at a loss. I wanted another child eventually but If I am going to feel this way forever there is no way I can handle another baby which makes me sad.( I posted this in a postpartum group then I found this community.. I need opinions. Does this sound like BPPV?) It sounds like you have not actually been tested for BPPV yet? In that case I would definitely keep the appointment, it sounds similar to when I had lateral canal BPPV , but I did not have the head pressure. Either way a vertigo test should give you more answers. Good luck and congratulations on the baby! Do not cancel your appointment. There are a lot of reasons anyone could feel vertigo or dizzieness- anxiety, head pressure, etc. are all par for the course when dealing with those symtoms. Your ENT will test you for BPPV and determine if that is the case. If it is not, ask about vestibular neuritis and migraines as possible causes as well. Make sure you get a CT/MRI and bloodwork done to rule out anything more serious. I agree with the others - do not cancel your appointment!  If nothing else, it will be peace of mind to get thoroughly checked.  Hopefully they can diagnose you and help you start to feel better. Keep us posted as to what you find out. Have you had any testing done for BPPV? Was it a bad experience? My doctor said the test could last up to two hours and the only doctor that offers it is far from me. It is hard to have that kind of time with my baby and my husband working 50 hour weeks. I guess it would be worth it if I could get to feeling better I just feel almost guilty for having to take time away from my baby and spending money for something that may not even be the problem. I am pretty sure my husband thinks I am a crazy person at this point.. he is taking it all well I just feel a lot of guilt. I have had testing done.  And if you truly do have BPPV, it is not pleasant, as it provokes the bad violent 30ish seconds of vertigo.  They will put goggles on you to video your eyes, as when the vertigo hits, your eyes will twitch.  Watching that helps determine which ear canal is effected.  You can actually do some of this at home.  Google Dix Hallpike (this is the most common test to test for the most common form of BPPV). I am not as familiar with vestibular neuritis or any of the other forms of vertigo. My therapist did a lot of different tests though to check for many different things.  Mine was clearly left sided BPPV.  Just remember - if you do have the test done (which you should), try to relax.  Know that the wave of bad vertigo will only last less than 30 seconds (mine were usually around 26 seconds). Once the crystal settles, you will feel better.  And from that point, if it is BPPV, they will continue with the Epley maneuver and if you are lucky, it will clear the crystal and you can heal up!  I waited WAY too long to get help, and mine was super stubborn.\n\nMy husband got really frustrated with me as well, as you cannot SEE that we are sick. And yet, it is the most horrible form of sickness I have ever had.  I had active BPPV for over 2 months.  And now I am on month 4 or 5 of residual dizziness. It is much better. But that is why I am telling you to get on top of it right away. Then you will heal up quicker!\n\nAnd also - the testing will hopefully rule out anything more serious - so that can help your anxiety as well. Please - go see the specialist and get testing done. Do not cancel the appointment. A physical therapist that specializes in vertigo is your best chance at feeling better.\n\nNot sure if you have read the previous posts on this sub, but myself and others experience the same problems. In my opinion the only person that can actually do anything helpful is a physical therapist. They can do maneuvers and exercises to help you get through this. It definitely sounds like BPPV. But I am not a doctor or anywhere close, but speaking because I have the same symptoms.\n\nJust know you are not alone!\n\nI often see floaters, usually when it is only bright. If the physical therapist is unable to help, your next bet would be to go to a neurologist or neuro-ophthalmologist that specializes in eyes. I have read floaters are common but it depends on your age. My ENT referred me to an audiologist to get some testing done. How was your BPPV diagnosed? Will the audiologist be able to diagnose it? I have convinced myself I have some terrible stuff like brain tumors or too much fluid in my brain and all sorts of stuff! I hope I can find some relief soon! Also I have heard of people doing the exercises at home on themselves.... do you think it is worth a try? Audiologist will test your hearing, to make sure you dont have any hearing loss. My audiologist did the epley maneuver on me, so they have some type of knowledge. Your ENT or physical therapist will most likely be able to diagnose you. If movement or head position trigger your dizziness then yes most likely BPPV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was diagnosed by my emergency physician when i went to the ER. I had a head CT scan, blood work, the whole 9 yards. nothing wrong with me that was going to hurt or kill me. My physical therapist, and two ENT's confirmed it sounded like BPPV. Actually i read in most cases involving dizziness a CT scan is not needed. You probably dont have a brain tumor, however your ENT or physical therapist could indeed ask you to get one if they think its needed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would 100% say to do exercises at home, however you might want to wait until you meet with your physical therapist to understand what exercises you need to do to help you get better. In my opinion the hearing test is just another way for them to make money, im sure others could agree as well. Most places around me charge $50 for a hearing test but im sure it varies. Bottom line is i would get what they recommend done, it help with the diagnosis.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry not to worry, i know its hard trust me. I have bad anxiety cause of it, but there is only so much you can control. There probably isnt nothing wrong with you that is going to harm you. I saw a balance physiotherapist that performed the tests to confirm if I had BPPV- I had to wear goggles with a camera attached to them while my head was moved at different angles. It didnt take very long at all. I also understand how you feel, my first first few trips to doctors I was hand waved away because on the outside, I am a healthy 20-something year old so my symptoms were not taken seriously. Do no feel guilty for prioritizing your health and pushing for answers!

You are going to have to do a manuver to try and get those annoying crystals moving. :( I have been there before and totally understand those feelings of anxiety. The best thing you can do is seek professional help from a physical therapist that specialises in BPPV. \n\nMy PT was an absolute life saver and even tho it was scary as hell as the vertigo was intense with a sense of \u201cthis will never end\u201d; I found just having her there, holding my hand, going through it with me, pushed me along.\n\nIf you do have BPPV those drugs will help with the nausea but will not help the vertigo. Only way to fix it, is to move the crystal. Gosh, your description brought me back to how I felt in the moment of my BPPV!\n\nHave a look at our ( in case that holds any useful information for you. I agree with slash5k1, though; if it is BPPV, remove the crystal, endure the residual effects for a while, and then hopefully recover from there!", "can BPPV be avoided? so, last year around may-june i experienced vertigo. ever since then i have had on and off anxiety about getting dizzy again. i have been experiencing mild lightheadedness (i have been taking vitamins and i am trying B12 and iron to see if that helps, drinking a lot of water and eating as well as i can) since february and i am worried this will be another attack soon. \n\nwould balance exercises help? it usually happens when i move too fast suddenly. my blood pressure is normal, but i decided to book a blood test to see if im missing something. i just want to avoid another attack, because it was, in my opinion, traumatic for me. thankfully i do not roll around in my sleep very often, so i try to lay on two pillows, and sleep on my back as much as possible. if i need to roll over, i will roll slowly and usually i will not get very lightheaded. i just have to take it slow but im very scared i will wake up one day and get dizzy again. \n\nis thinking about it too much going to make it worse? i have been thinking about it non stop but thankfully i read manga on my phone and it distracts me a bit and i usually end up on my side at that point and do not notice. \n\nTLDR; experiencing mild lightheadedness, trying to avoid another vertigo attack like last may-june. wondering if i can avoid this in any way? and is anxiety/thinking about it too much making it worse? Usually you can mostly avoid BPPV, but there is an element of luck involved. Sometimes you can feel great for ages, even years, other times you get a rough deal despite all the preventative measures or lifestyle changes you make. That said, it does get easier to manage and less severe with time. (My absolute 'worst' days are much easier to handle now than they were around 5-10 years ago, for example. Still pretty gross, but less intense. Your brain learns to compensate the junk balance signals to an extent, which is interesting.) \n\nAs for practical advice: anxiety and stress does play a big part of it. The main 4 factors to consider (based on my own experience at least) to reduce chances of a rough vertigo episode are: \n1. Staying as healthy, fit and well-rested as you can to avoid getting run-down,\n2. Avoiding overwork and stress where possible\n3. Making a list of potential external physical/environmental triggers you may observe, and ways to avoid or compensate them. (some may find diet/lifestyle changes help for them, but I have not found any that have made a difference myself yet)\n4. An element of luck (unfortunately).\n\nIf you are not sure where to start with external triggers, try starting with common migraine triggers: strong sensory things like perfumes, certain foods, stress, noisy environments and sudden weather/pressure changes. (if you have any aura-like symptoms along with your vertigo episodes, it might be worth asking a doctor/neurologist if you are also experiencing vestibular migraines.) \n\nAs for luck: You may only get it once and never again, you may get it multiple times/struggle all your life with it. Try to remind yourself that BPPV is a lingering result of physical damage to a delicate sensory organ in your ear (usually from an ear infection or head trauma) and it is really important not to blame yourself or stress too much (easier said than done) about feeling unwell, as you are not fully in control of how the dice fall. \n\nIn regards to stress, anxiety and difficulty with sleep:  It sounds like you have got a few strategies already, and it is great that reading helps you! If you find you are really stuck in an anxiety feedback loop and cannot focus enough to read, I recommend simple puzzles that keep your focus long enough to break out of the cycle. I have found relief with things like algebra worksheets (simple ones you just need a pen for), puzzles like sudoku, picross, crosswords etc. Basically a puzzle that requires focus for more a few minutes, but is not so hard that you get frustrated and loose focus. If you have a smart phone or handheld console like a Switch or 3Ds there is plenty of decent puzzle games and apps (if you would like recommendations, I have a few.). Music, audiobooks and podcasts are good options as well, if moving your eyes makes you feel worse. \n\nBut beyond that, if you find yourself dealing with BPPV long-term, I wholeheartedly recommend talking to a psychologist about stress management. Even if you are not really an anxious person under normal circumstances, long term chronic illness can really mess with you in ways you would not expect. It is a tough situation, as the stress is a natural protective/survival response to a pretty awful sensation. \n\nThe length of this response really got away from me, hoe it is somewhat helpful at least. \ud83d\ude05 Sorry you are suffering with BPPV and I wish you the best of luck managing it and finding solutions that work well for you. curious as to where you get your information from?\n\nsince doctors dont know for sure how bppv is brought on how can anyone say bppv can be avoided? disclaimer - im not a doctor. i had bppv last year but it was resolved by a ent dr. Vestibular physiotherapy. Vestiotherapy.\n\n***\n\n^(Bleep-bloop, I am a bot. This )^( ^( was created from the phrase 'Vestibular physiotherapy.' | )^( ^(|) ^( ^(|) ^( Ah of course, sorry, I forgot to include that part for context: I am not a doctor, and I am drawing from personal experience and what has worked for me when it comes to managing my own recurring BPPV episodes. (In my mid 20s, diagnosed with BPPV approx. 15 years ago. I still take perscribed medication and perform menuvers like epley with assistance when experiencing symptoms severe enough to empede day-to-day life.)\n\nI also would not say BPPV can be avoided, but I assume OP was asking about stress and strategies for reducing the likelihood of experiencing repeat episodes when someone has already had BPPV before, rather than medical treatment for the condition itself. Generally speaking from anecdotal/personal experience, episodes usually occur more frequently and insensly at times whe I am feeling tired, run down or under intense or prolonged stress. Sometimes it happens out of the blue and there is not much anyone can do to avoid it. Realistically with the knowledge doctors/ENTs have now, there is not much else that can be practically done, at least as far as I am aware. I have never heard of a relationship between ear infections and BPPV. Do you by any chance have more information on that?", "Dizzy for a whole week now Hi, so as of now i have been dizzy for a whole week. The worst day was the second day where I had to vomit atleast 4 times of how dizzy it was. After doing the Epley maneuver daily i am doing much and much better than that day, still not able to work, study or lift but i am seeing slow improvements.\n\nBut I have a question.. The internet states that the dizzyness attacks only last 1 minute. While that is not the case with me. I am dizzy 24/7. As I said, I am seeing improvements in small moments where I am not dizzy. But still, most of my day goes by dizzy. \n\nIs it the same with you?? Need to get some definitions right as dizziness can mean anything. \n\nFor me - dizziness is that nausea / light headed feeling while vertigo is the world spinning uncontrollably. \n\nBPPV brings on vertigo by positional changes of your head and can leave you dizzy when the vertigo stops. \n\nResolution manoeuvres will set off vertigo with nystagmus until the crystals in your ears have been repositioned. \n\nSuccessful repositioning will stop vertigo but your body can be left with residual dizziness. \n\nTo help resolve the dizziness left after BPPV you should seek a PT that specialises in balance disorders that can give you a program to help retain your ears, eyes and brain. Agree with last comment.  Dont get discouraged.  General dizziness, floating feeling may go on for sometime. Yes, I had a new onset on Wednesday and the spinning is momentary but the dizzy/floating feeling is almost constant unless I am laying down. Indeed, unless i am laying down. The moment I move my head it feels like the world is turning again. When does that go away? I wish I could say! It is pretty new to me. The Epley maneuver worked well for me, but a couple days later it came back. I am going to talk to a chiropractor next week and see what they know/can do. After that, a dizziness specialist or ENT. \n\nGood luck! I hope you start feeling better, it is pretty miserable.", "Possible BPPV This is new to me as I have never had vertigo before. I had two episodes of vertigo about a week and a half ago, one night when rolling over in bed and then a day later when I leaned my head over.  Ever since then I have just felt really off but I have not had any more episodes of vertigo. When I am walking around I feel like I am on a boat that is rocking back and forth and everything is moving, almost like spinning is going to start but it does not, although my balance seems to be ok. I feel it a little bit when sitting but if I am in front of the TV long enough I feel pretty normal and then it starts all over again when I get up and walk around. I have been having a fair amount of anxiety about this which I do not normally have, and it has really affected my eating and sleeping. I have an appointment with an ENT next Monday because that is the soonest I could get in. I guess my question is, if in other people's experience, this seems like after effects of BPPV or if I am probably dealing with something else? Sounds like BPPV to me. You can try the Epley maneuver if you are up for it (YouTube has instructional videos) but keep it mind it can make you feel pretty awful until it actually works, which can be several attempts. I often feel off balance and vaguely nauseous when I am not having the acute BPPV symptoms. I would suggest trying the Epley and following up with the ENT.( Start with the Dix Hallpike so you can determine which side to treat. Also - that will help determine if you DO have BPPV.  If you are positive for BPPV, doing the Dix Hallpike (which is also the first step of the Epley) WILL provoke that 20ish seconds of severe vertigo.  If it happens, just wait it out and move to the next step of the Epley (so study the Epley maneuvers beforehand). The Dix Hallpike will determine if you are experiencing the most common form of BPPV.  What a specialist can do - is test all 6 different ear canals for loose crystals.  They will likely put goggles on and watch for eye nystagmus. The direction of the twitching can help determine which canal is effected (as there are different maneuvers to do to help correct the condition).  They will also test for other conditions.  As mentioned, if you do have BPPV - the Epley (and Dix Hallpike) WILL provoke symptoms. Be patient with each move and wait it out. It will only last 20ish seconds until the crystal has settled again. Alas - the anxiety you are having is fueling the dizziness feelings and making you think at any given moment BPPV will appear and cause your world to spin. \\. \n\nGood you managed to get an appt so soon with the ENT.  Mine was booked up and I couldnt' see him for a few months.  When you are at the ENT, make sure you have him/her perform the manuver at least 3-5 times.  The ENT I saw performed a manuver only 1 time, shrugged it off, and sent me to a Physical Therapist that specialized in balance issues.  \n\nPhys Therapist spent more time with me and tried the manuvery a couple of times until BPPV finally appeared after the 3rd try.  They then performed the manuvary 3 more times and then sent me on my way home to rest.  It took about a week for my brain/body to adjust but it did help as the next time \\ during my phys therapy appt BPPV did not appear. After my last episode I had such anxiety about going through the Epley that I waited and suffered needlessly for a week. Once I finally got a bucket just in case and faced it everything calmed down almost immediately. Now every time I am starting to feel off I do it straight away, just in case, I do not suppose it can do any damage \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Good luck, your case sounds like classic BPPV, you have got this!!", "Does anyone else suffer from pressure at the top of their head?

Look up cervical vertigo it can be caused through instability of the kneck and compression of the nerves When you bend your head down or look up, do you experience spinning that goes away after a little bit? As far as I know, the vertigo from BPPV only lasts as long as crystals are rolling around inside.

Hey guys, \nJust found this sub and thought I would post my story (where is my couch?). \nFor the past 2 years I have had ringing in 1 ear and then started getting vertigo at certain times of loudness. 1.5 years of inner ear Dr visitations gave me a Meniere's disease diagnosis, 4 steroid shots in my ear drum, and a RX for diuretics with a no salt/caffeine/alcohol diet. I get dizzy spells at random but usually have something to hold onto. Well fast forward to the other day and I am picking up my kid at school. I am a little stressed due to work and repeating myself to my kid and the next thing I know it felt like a baseball bat hit the back of my head. I had fallen backwards without realizing and hit my head on the concrete. It was a real scary scene with everyone asking if I was OK. I blacked out for a second but was immediately apologizing to the parents around me for some reason. Anyway I call my Dr. who said she wants to schedule a visit and thinks there are crystals in my ear. This is the first time she is ever mentioned crystals, which brought me here. Is it just me or should I see another Dr? Does anyone else with BPPV have ringing? Is there a remedy outside of the maneuvers if it is BPPV? Your help is appreciated. I have had bouts of BPPV recently, but thankfully no ringing in my ears.  The \"crystals\" your doctor is referring to is known  as otoconia.  Supposedly they come loose from your inner ear and enter the semi-circular canals, disrupting the fluid in there and thus causing the false sense of motion.\n\nI have done one or more of the exercises in the link below and they have helped me immensely. \n\n\n\nBesides that, I am not sure what else can help. Have you tried making changes to your diet (less sodium, drinking more water, etc.)? \n\nAlso, getting a second opinion, particularly from an ENT physician, does not hurt. \n\nBest of luck!  The worse part is that it happens at times where I cannot perform this maneuver. I guess I am fortunate enough to have both. I will try eating less sodium. Thanks for that link and for taking the time to reply!  If I may ask, which exercices did you find the most effective? Home Epley? I am getting to a point where I am going to try them soon because my BPPV is getting unbearable. Just wondering which one worked for you.\n\nAlso, how horrible does it feel when performing the exercices? I am guessing it is the kind of thing where it needs to feel worse before it can feel better. Out of all the exercises listed in the link, the Brandt-Daroff exercises worked best for me.  The worst was the \"Foster\" or half-somersault maneuver because it literally made me vomit from those particular head movements.   I felt no difference from the Home Epley maneuver, which they list as the best, so it is definitely boils down to the individual. \n\nAlso, doing any of those exercises will certainly exacerbate the vertigo, so yes, be prepared for that.\n\nI hope they work for you because I know how debilitating vertigo can be.  Good luck.  Thank you so much for your reply. Feels good to know others are going through or went through the same thing as you.\n\nHow many times did you have to repeat the exercise for it to feel better? Were you not worried that doing the exercises would move the crystals somewhere else and worsen your condition?

I do 3 sets of the Brandt-Daroff exercise.\n\nI started feeling better a couple hours later and noticed the symptoms were almost completely gone within a day.  And with the way I was feeling, I did not think it could get any worse, so I was willing to try almost anything.  That is great! Just to confirm, you keep doing them 3 times a day permanently/even now or do you only do them when symptoms reappear?  I only do them when the symptoms appear.  I am actually afraid that if I do them when I do not have any symptoms, I might cause the vertigo again.  Now, there is no scientific or medical evidence (that I know of) that supports that fear, but still. Lol\n\nI want to reiterate that what works for me may not work for you, but do not let it discourage you.

I have had vertigo before, but after doing a few maneuvers in the past, it is settled down and gone away.\n\nNow I am three months in with this current episode, and although my dizziness has let up significantly from doing a variety of different maneuvers, I am still bothered by one lingering symptom--an almost constant nystagmus.\n\nI went to an ENT who practically did nothing to help me.

My eyes tend to jut horizontally, back and forth, and somewhat upward--as if on a boat. I do not know what to do or even pursue anymore. Any help would be appreciated. I cannot keep doing this. Very strange to me that you have nastagmus without dizzyness. Usually the nastagmus is the eyes trying to correct the spinning. I am just saying that for others...........so now, in my case the only other thing that causes or messes with my eyes is when my occipital nerve gets pinched or tight. At the base of my skull upper neck right side. Chiropractor does occipital lift adjustment and fixes it.  Sounds and such would make my eyes jerk and make me slightly dizzy.\n\nOtherwise, I would get with a professional who actually watches the nastagmus while they are having you do maneuvers.  \n\nNeurologist might end up being the key, but rule the other stuff out too. \n\nI have not heard of this happening with out dizzyness, sry man, keep us posted and I will ask around.

Hopefully it is not too hard to understand.\nI got Vertigo back in April and I think it is all gone now in September which takes approximately 5 months. I just want to share my experiences of what i have been though and what I did.\nI worked in a restaurant as a chef, one day I felt a massive tiredness and dizzy i thought it will not last. But it got to a point when i had my lunch I cannot eat anything, i feel so dizzy and nauseous. I have to use one hand to put on my head and try to eat something but I still end up vomiting it all. \nLong story short, i fainted at work, got into the ambulance, they did the X-Ray, MRI and finally they said i got BPPV.\nI do not know what is BPPV is so i look it up, it is been really hard every single day coming to work feeling like you are drunk, like your head is spinning. When i am back at home, if i lie down, my heart beats so much, i shake and feel so scared, probably anxiety attack. I am not sure which side of my ear is the cause because when i look left and right it is spinning exactly the same.\nThere is one time, I cannot stand it anymore, i decided to run into the public toilet and vomit. Then I google, i found the Half Somersault Maneuver. I did it, in the last bathroom of the toilet so no one thinks that i am a creep trying to stare at the next toilet room but all i am trying is to get rid of it. It got better right away.\nWhat helps me is Half Somersault, I think whoever created this Maneuver is brilliant and she saved me. I did it so many times at work.\nSecond is Epley, but I do not think it is quite helping.\nAfter I did quite 10 times with the Somersault Maneuver, i think Vertigo is quite gone, i think if it is gone why the \u201coff balance\u201d feeling still exists so i still did it again sometimes. I still can talk to my customers but the feeling of being on a boat, shaking nonstop whenever i am standing doing anything.\nAfter that one day, the residue feeling is all gone. So if vertigo is gone, the residue effect lasts 3 months and apparently it is normal.\nI am so so happy, it must be the worst spinning I have experienced. I feel for anyone in this group. I hope you will recover soon out of this nightmare. This is great news! \n\nMy BPPV lasted several months as well; my ENT said I was an outlier, in that most people it clears up in a few weeks. But I am happy that I know what to do now, and that he knows for me it might last months\u2026 because he does not give up.\n\nDo you feel better knowing that if it happens again, you can (hopefully just) do the maneuver and start feeling better? Once I realized I could do maneuvers to help I think almost half my anxiety went away about having it. I think so too, like now i know what it is probably i will know what to do instead of being anxious about it Exactly!\n\nMy only lingering anxiety is if it happens when I am driving- now and then that crosses my mind. But for the most part it is gone.\n\nI am glad you feel better. I also had my first attack in april, and the actual vertigo went away after a couple of weeks of epley, although I still have residual diziness 5 months later. I have been doing some VRT but I am not sure if it is helping or what to do now. i hope it fixes itself eventually. What is a half somersault maneuver? and BBQ roll? You can google it, it is both home exercises for vertigo Oh my God. I felt this too. I even doing ask &amp; questions on IG because I felt so desperate. No one with vertigo before really knows how I feel. I took so many vertigo madications and change so many brand,  I got to doctor to another doctor. I cried almost everyday because I dont know what happened w myself and no one understand the dizziness feels that you are drunk all the time.\nMy doc suggested epley but sometimes I felt better and I felt worse so I am kind of afraid it would be a step back. I will try more often with half sommersault\nThankyou for posting this. It gives me hope. My wedding is around the corner it pressured me so much on how if I am not recover etc\nPraying for us all No worries we are on the same boat. After doing the half Somersault you should sleep the pillow higher for a week to let the ear cannel stable. I did so many half Sommersault whenever i feel it happens again.

I apologize in advance for the long post, but I am hoping that there is somebody out there who has experienced the same as me or has some input/advice on what I should do.. \n\nI have always been a healthy adult. Back in March/April I started getting feelings of my ears being full. Almost as if they were full of water. This would not happen all the time, but often enough for me to feel a bit uncomfortable. I resorted to cleaning my ears out, ear cleaning kits, etc. which seemed to help. My symptoms were so minor that I did not really see a need to go to the doctor. \n\nFast forward to September - I get a super intense UTI. I had never had a UTI before.. lots of pain, lower back pain, fever, headache, chills. The first round of medications were not clearing up the infection and my doctor placed me on another antibiotic which is actually used for kidney infections (which was a concern because of my high fever). I finally got over the UTI. About a month or so later, I started experiencing the ear fullness feeling again. I felt like I was under water, balance was off, I felt like I could not pop my ears. My equilibrium was just totally off. \n\nI went to the doctor last month because my symptoms were starting to affect my day to day. They found that I had severe fluid build up in my ears, which explained the ear fullness and feeling of my balance being off. I was put on a prescription nasal spray. No luck. Still had discomfort in my ears and the vertigo I was experiencing was out of this world, sometimes lasting days. I felt like I had a constant hangover. When I would sit at my desk at work, I felt like my surroundings were moving so much to the point that I have to grip the sides of my chair to keep me balanced. \n\nObviously not feeling better, I went back to the doctor almost two weeks ago now. She said that I had clear fluid in my ears and ended up putting me on pseudophedrine to try to help dry up the fluid. After explaining to her my vertigo symptoms, she put me on meclizine, which does help but temporary and put through a referral for PT, although she basically ruled out BPPV. \n\nI was never actually diagnosed with an ear infection. I am wondering if somebody the infection from my UTI is related? My symptoms of vertigo are so bad to the point where I am afraid to drive. I cannot work without feeling like I am going to fall over. Since then, I have also noticed night driving really bothers me and flashing lights (ie. camera flash) trigger my vertigo. My first PT appointment is tomorrow and I am praying for relief but I am nervous that they are going to brush it under the rug because it is not diagnosed as BPPV. Since my symptoms have gotten so bad, I cry out of frustration from not being able to do things that I normally would do. I have multiple breakdowns a week. I feel like I am having panic attacks and anxiety. I have a follow up with my doctor next Tuesday and she said if my symptoms are not better that she wants to refer me to an ENT. My Mom is a retired nurse and she said that I have the worst case of vertigo she has ever seen. \n\nHas anybody experienced anything like this? Has PT helped you? I am just so tired of feeling this way.", "How long does this last without the maneuvers My doctor diagnosed me with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo yesterday, and said that it would last 2-7 days, but never even mentioned the maneuvers to me. I am frustrated because this is so debilitating that I cannot work or do any of my hobbies anymore. I am going to go insane. I am not sure how long it lasts. I will say though that I taught myself the Epley Maneuver and it worked. Just make sure you hold each position for a minute and a half. That is what I did and now there is no more vertigo. \n\nThis is a crazy condition. I am sorry you are going through it. Really bothered me too. I hope it gets better. So dix hallpike then Epley.

TLDR at the bottom, this is a long one \n\nIt all started July last year. I got a cold that was not anything special, but I was stuffed up and did not really take any meds for it. It went away just like every cold does, but two weeks later I started getting really bad headaches in my sinuses, so I was pretty sure I had a sinus infection. Again, did not do anything about it and it went away. Then one day, I woke up and I felt like I was going to have nystagmus. It never happened, but it felt like it. The next few days I started feeling kind of dizzy and floaty, so I went to an ENT. He said he believed I had a inner ear infection (which I was prone to as a child) and prescribed me antiviral medication and anti inflammatory as well. The next day, I was in for one of the most difficult weeks of my life. \n\nI was sitting at my computer playing video games and I suddenly felt the dizziness and lightheadedness and  floaty. I got pretty tripped out and took 6mg of Valium (I was prescribed 2mg of Valium to help rescue Incase it got bad), when the recommended dose was only 2-4mg twice a day. I felt horrible after, and I tried to make myself sick but it did not work. I just went to bed and felt like I was on a violently rocking ship. \n\nThe next few days I was bedridden, rocking and stoned from the anti viral. I could hardly walk, (probably from the meds) and the only time I got up was to use the bathroom. The next few days got better and on day 5 or 6, I was able to get up and return to my office. The next month of August I still had the rocking feeling. Each day got better. At the end of August, it was gone. \n\nMid September I got a strange feeling in the back of my head like the rocking would happen again, so I tripped out and asked the doctor for more treatment. I got prescribed another anti inflammatory, which is now one of my biggest regrets. \n\nAfter a few days of using the anti inflammatory, I noticed when I turned my head I felt like it was dragging and made me dizzy, and was quite uncomfortable. I figured this would go away, but it is now March and has been five months of feeling that and movement/lightheadeness/floating, and I am so fucking over it. I had a VNG last week, and I called my doctor to schedule an appointment to talk about  the findings. I never felt spinning like classic BPPV has, but at night time when I lay down sometimes I do feel my body rotating and that can cause nystagmus. \n\nWhat do you guys think? I had a breakdown today about it, I just want to feel normal again. \n\nTLDR: Had a ear infection last year that caused vertigo that wore off in a month, was not fully gone so took new meds that threw everything off since October  \n\n Hard to say, I am not sure what \"dizziness and lightheadedness and  floaty\" means. With BPPV, when you are in a certain position, such as lying down, and you move your head the room spins like hell for about 5-10 seconds. At the same time you have nystagmus. I am not sure about \"floaty  or rocky\", the room spins violently like you are on some horrible amusement park ride.  When the spinning stops, you feel generally \"normal\" again until the next episode. The main feeling you have after the spinning has stopped is fear about what just happened and fear that it will happen again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Yeah when I turn my head I will feel kind of dizzy but I do not get spinning/nystagmus. I mean that I feel like I am rocking on a boat, or floating on water. I had a VNG test and had vertigo induced, which was my first time experiencing that horror. It definitely caused some fear and I actually dreamt it the other night.  Did your doctor suggest an MRI or do you have back problems?\nThere can be multiple possibilities for BPPV. Moreover, the dizzy spell and vertigo is different for each person.\nFor me it was a horrible vertigo and after that one i still got some of them and had a dizzy spell for almost a month. I felt strange. Sometime i think that even the medicine i was taking was inducing my dizziness. No i still get vertigo (spinning image) but it is very seldom (once a few months) and lasts no more than 10 sec. I have had a MRI as well, nothing was there.

BPPV has so many variables - yet the main symptoms/diagnosis are pretty much the same.  I read through this entire sub when I was researching my own BPPV before I posted anything. Many questions were answered by reading/searching. I often assume most everyone does the same research and uses the 'search' bar to find similar questions/answers. I am finding that often is not the case.  I have offered up a lot of advice, that came straight from my own treatment/experience with professionals.  But I often get tired of typing the same exact thing over and over.\n\nI want more than anything to help, give advice, reassure, ease anxiety.....but much of that is already covered in this sub in previous posts. I often do not have time to cut and paste my previous answers or retype the entire thing.  I value this community a TON....and I know when BPPV hits me again, I will be the one asking for guidance/help/reassurance. So - thank you to those that continue to contribute! Same here. It somewhat bothers me how lazy people are when they post in this sub. How do we get more mods in here... ? Is there a way to pin a post to the top with (links to posts with or websites about) the following information:\n\n- introduction (e.g., breakdown of disorder name, mechanism of disorder in inner ear)\n- symptoms (e.g., list of possibilities)\n- causes/prevention (e.g., list of possibilities--dehydration, keeping head in one position for too long, head trauma, etc.)\n- treatment (e.g., Dix-Hallpike maneuver to diagnose side, Epley maneuver to fix it, post-treatment residual effects)\n\nA consolidation of general information (easily Googlable, I know, but perhaps just links to reliable websites?) and our personal experiences (where Reddit really shines; we could brainstorm a list of keywords to search within this subreddit or provide links to helpful posts or comments) would make a great reference guide, again pinned to the top for first and easy access.\n\nI just remember coming here when I was barely able to function, doing my best to search, not finding what I needed, and then just making my own post. \ud83d\ude15\n\nA post like this pinned to the top for reference would have saved my question. It can be a work in progress, with us contributing links, feedback, etc. I agree. I was first hit by BPPV four years ago while on vacation. It was a nightmare, but I googled like crazy to figure out what I could. A couple of years later after two more bouts of BPPV and I found this community. I really appreciated the stories, the tips and just the general understanding I got that I was not alone. But the community is now inundated with posts from people who clearly have not looked up a single thing to help themselves. \n\nI like some of the suggestions I am seeing for how it could be improved. I think these are some great ideas.\n\nAnd I also agree that many are so scared and sick when they first get BPPV - it may be hard to search and do all the research. So having something pinned would be great. Easy access.  When I had BPPV I was so sick and scared (also have leg weakness) I could not think straight. Reddit saved me.", "BPPV or vestibular exercise hi. I am new to to BPPV. Two weeks ago I had a strain neck and vertigo. But after then the dizziness will not go away. my eyes felt blurry, everything so wobbly and move in slow motion. I cried and stressed so much in the past two weeks. Then my doc said I am either vestibular or BPPV.  I got so stressed because I dont feel everything spinning anymore yet I still cannot walk properly fully in balance. I felt like something still off balance. Is it normal? \nThe doc suggest me epley but sometimes I got losing more balance so I am really afraid and only doin brand daroft. I am strugglingg so hard to sleep at night since it is not comfortable to laying down closing eyes.\nI had this two weeks before my birthday yesterday and early next month should be my wedding day.\nPlease help if anyone knows how to help the recovery faster \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Lots of good posts that you should read in this sub.

Praying for our speedy recovery \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Vestibular rehabilitation therapy! Google balancing exercises pr try you-tubing them and try to master it!! It does take a very long time to see a difference! Everyone is different to react! I am almost crazy to figure it out what happened to me. Even my blood test is okay. Thankyou I will try it!! Me as well!! I have done so much testing and so much of everything. Sure enough. Everything comes back clear... yet I am in so much discomfort !! So are you completely well right now? Glad you finally come back to normal! Wish me luck Far from Normal. LOTS OF SUFFERING. For over a year now! I have not lived one day in the last year that I was NOT dizzy. Vestibular rehabilitation is working VERY slowly but it has brought me a very long way. When I first got this I was so bed ridden, could not walk. Could not do anything. Now I can go to the grocery store... but it is a struggle... very dizzy very off balance feeling, very nauseous. It feels like there is to much going on around me and my mind cannot catch up with it! I have just started SSRI medications about a month ago and I am feeling almost no different! I really confused is this a floating feeling of anxiety or I just got anxious because of my BPPV. Really confusing and dont know where to go. Praying for your recovery as well! Lets keep having faith! I never had anxiety or anxiousness before I got this. I get these random bursts of anxiety as well. They come and go sometimes quicker then others. I am using melatonin at night time to calm down and sleep, as far as the SSRI's go, they may have helped with my anxiety only a bit. But the time is not up for them, they said 4-6 weeks to start working. I may have to try a different one!", "Confused and frustrated I have been experiencing dizziness and tinnitus in one ear for a bit now so I decided to get it checked out by my neuro (history of migraines that were being well-managed). He performed the Dix-Hallpike test on me and said I for sure have BPPV but referred me to a specialist for confirmation/treatment. \n\nThe specialist used the goggles on me and did the same test again and I had 5 deg/sec upbeat nystagmus on both the left and right sides. She says she was not worried but that my description did not sound like BPPV and to see my neuro again?? Admittedly though, my description was a lot of \u201cI do not know\u201ds and guessing since I saw her when the vertigo was still very new to me and I did not really know what was going on. \n\nNeuro insists that it is BPPV in the left ear and tells me to try the Epley maneuver from home a couple times before I see him next month and well, I did tonight and feel even worse and more frustrated/hopeless than before. There was a moment after I did the Epley that I admittedly felt great but now I feel nauseous, my ear is ringing so loudly, and my head is pounding. Both doctors giving me mixed answers is so confusing and  worrisome and I feel so depressed and frustrated lately. \n\nI know there probably are not any doctors here but from everyone is experience, is any of this similar to your BPPV? Should I keep trying the Epley? I really appreciate any comments in advance! You could always pop over to the Askdocs Reddit and see what any of the doctors there think\u2026\n\nThe first two times I had the Epley done I needed to sit in the waiting room for a while because I felt so off kilter. For some reason the last time I had it done, I had the worst \u201changover\u201d of them all, but when it lifted I felt so much better than before that last maneuver. I not think it is too uncommon to feel a little worse before feeling better?\n\nTo avoid any uncertainty when talking to your doctors, you could always log your symptoms and then bring that log with you to the appointments and see if that is helpful. Following successful maneuvers, residual dizziness can be around for days to weeks.  I would definitely ask doc to send you to a vestibular therapist for help. A doctor yesterday said I probably had BPPV. Prescribed me medication and sent me home. Said I could try Epley Maneuver at home. I did. Today my vertigo seems more muted. Should I do the maneuver again tonight or wait-and-see? From what I have been told doing the maneuver repeatedly will not hurt you.  My therapist told me too wait 10 minutes between each try and do it up to three times. I did it again this evening. We will see. Thanks. I had my first PT session yesterday and did the Epley.  Not sure if it was 100% successful, but I am dizzier (not vertigo) today and more off-balance than before I did the exercise.\n\nI have a call in to my therapist, but searching PubMed, it seems residual dizziness (RD) is common following a successful procedure.  Duration is correlated with age and duration of BPPV before treatment.  See Teggi, et. al. for example. Update: I may have been performing it incorrectly the first two times. I did not hold the third position for a minute and a half. I did, however, two nights ago and now I am fine. No vertigo. No dizziness. Nice", "Question about scuba diving Hey you all. Recently I have started getting extremely random and annoying bouts of BPPV. \n\n(For background, I am nearly 33, female, and had gotten a few bouts of vertigo when I was...I guess in my early 20s? And then this year I have gotten three bouts after a very long hiatus. Absolutely will be trying to explore the root cause of it - and sidebar, I am so happy to chat to you if you feel like you understand triggers, causes, and prevention). \n\nAnyway, I will be going on vacation and am thinking of going scuba diving, something I have always wanted to do. Has anyone done that as a BPPV sufferer? Could the pressure changes possibly trigger something? Would love to hear some input - thanks :) not a dr but had bppv and also a padi certified diver.\n\nfrom my understanding drs really dont know for sure what triggers bppv. i do not think the pressure changes will trigger bppv. its more related to moving your head fast a certain way that tends to loosen that crystal in your head that can cause it (my opinion).\n\nslightly unrelated but regarding diving...in my opinion you do not want to just \"go diving\" while on vacation. its a fabulous sport/activity but you want to be trained. you want to make sure you have 3-4 days to get certified while on vacation. it might seem like you are wasting part of your vacation to get certified but honestly its probably one of my wife and i's best vacation's we have ever had. i will never forget each day of the certification, just great. also, to experience a whole different world under that sea is just awesome but you want to experience it first with a dive instructor. we got certified in the florida keys while on vacation. probably one of the best places to get certified in my opinion. Thanks for the advice/information! I will be in Greece for around five days and thought it could be a cool activity. I will take your opinion in mind when I decide either way :)", "vertigone I had posted about 4 months ago on here regarding the now 6 months that i have had vertigo. i have done it all, i have taken the prescriptions, i have done the maneuvers, i have seen the ENT specialists\u2026.. although I will say that my symptoms have slowed since first having it, it has not completely gone away. I have heavy dizzy spells that come in waves where I literally cannot get up from bed. i have been taking a plethora of vitamins that YOU GUYS recommended (I cannot thank you enough, because they have helped!)\n\ni am just laying here and randomly googled vertigo supplements just to possibly MAYBE see if there is something else I was missing. \n\n\u201cVertigone\u201d by humanx popped up. a natural supplement for vertigo, dizziness, nausea, headaches. \n\nI read a million reviews, and of course you will never know unless you try\u2026. but it ordered it immediately. i am desperate at this point. I have not started it, but I will keep this post up to date. take a look for yourselves and see if it might be right for you. \n\nI wish you all the best in your vertigo journey. and of course hope you all had a wonderful holiday \u2764\ufe0f", "Got kind of diagnosed but not sure I have been having dizziness for about a month now. Some days are not as bad but most days I have symptoms. I feel a weird spinning sensation inside my own head but I do not feel like I am actually spinning. It feels like a top or something is spinning in there. I am able to walk without falling as well. I think my symptoms are a bit better when I am walking rather than sitting or standing even. Also my doctor did not really give me anything to try. He did not seem to take it seriously. My doctor never gave me any exercises either. Told me it is better to let it pass naturally. It is a lot like i have it right now. That spinning inside your own head Have you gotten any better? Better than i was before. No more nystagmus and no more spinning attacks at least. Still feel like shit but slowly recovering How long have you been dizzy 5 months now Damn. Have a feeling this is going to be a long journey back :( Yeah it is been really hard. Im sorry about that, maybe you want to try some exercises? I have been dizzy for over 20 years but it was always seasonal so tied to my allergies. In recent years it had been getting a lot worse. I had a physiotherapist who helped me with the Epley Maneuver but that was not really preventive. I read about Ginkgo Bilabo on another online forum and looked at a Scientific Journal report on it, so this past September I started taking 60mg of Ginkgo Bilabo twice daily and have been vertigo free so far. Fingers crossed. I made sure I was taking a capsule of GB that was just GB and nopt processed with weird additives. I watched a YouTube video today of some vestibular exercises I am going to try Yeah that sounds like a good idea. How do you feel mentally? Like shit. I feel like I will never be normal and happy again What did he call it? He did not call it anything but described it instead. As what? He just said you were dizzy inside... that is not a dx. He said I have \"debris floating around in my ears\" That is BPPV and can be cleared with repositioning. Do you get dizzy laying down on your left or right side? Yeah, i feel the same. It is a really uncomfortable feeling. I really hope it will pass soon for the both of us No Hm, well the only interpretation of \u201cdebris floating around in your ears\u201d is bppv... have you tried an EPley maneuver from YouTube yet? It might be that you have not hung your head low enough to trigger the dizziness. Try hanging your head off the edge of the bed when doing the Epley. Sometimes it is pretty precise the position you need to get into to trigger your symptoms. I have tried that. I actually did a video chat with my friend who does vestibular PT. We did some tests and she said it is definitely not BPPV. This was last night. Well there goes your doctors theory. Yeah. She actually said I have peripheral vestibular hypofunction. She gave me some exercises to do. Sounds like it is all working out then, good luck.", "Hi folks, having a BPPV spell right now for the first time in 3 years. Trying to figure out what ear the loose crystals are in. When I am lying down and turn my head to the right and feel dizzy, does this mean my right ear is bad or my left ear?

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Yes. \n\nBut we dont know which canal it is in. Try the epley first and see if it works assuming it is the right ear. Give that a few goes and if still doesnt work, try the lempert and deep heads. \n\nGood luck! Correct, right ear. You have the beating nystagmus too right? Do the epley correctly, I will do them once per hour 3-4 times and then wait to see if it happens again. If that does not work try the Foster Half Somersault. Odds are it is your posterior canal. If not the lateral canal would be the next bet, the Semont maneuver works for that. Let us know how you are doing. In the quick reference guide (see AutoModerator post at the top), in the Treatment section, you will see which canal is most often affected and which one is least.\n\nAs far as I understand, you will know you have treated the right canal when your nystagmus goes away. Keep in mind it may take a few tries to move all of the wandering crystals back to where they belong. See a vestibular physiotherapist for guidance. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is the proper way to to determine which ear is the culprit. The Dix-Hallpike is the correct way to determine which ear.\n\nThere is an excellent resource in the quick reference guide in a YouTube video Thank you, that was very helpful. Thank you! \ud83d\ude0aI found out it was my right ear. I did the Epley Maneuver and it helped a lot. You are correct, the right ear is my problem and I had nystagmus along with nausea. I did the Epley and was careful not to move my head the rest of the day. I am sleeping on my good ear now and hopefully it will not be bad again tomorrow. Fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e \nThank you! \ud83d\ude0a Thank you! I am thankful for the information here on BPPV and the Epley. I spent years going to doctors who were clueless. They prescribed meds that knocked me out for days. Sleep normally like you usually do...I became paranoid and slept with my head propped up on two pillows for weeks and was doing multiple epleys a day out of precaution without supporting my neck and I MESSED it up big time. I have had a horrible headache from it for 10+ days now..good luck! Thank you for reminding me not to over think this. I have not had BPPV in 3 years so having a bad episode makes me paranoid for a few days. Yeah I totally understand. For me the aftermath is worse than the actual vertigo. The hangover 'off' feeling sucks big time, but it always gets better.", "Is it better to wear contact lenses than eye glasses?  \n\nIf I put the lenses of my glasses closer to my eyes, I feel somewhat better.\n\nSo I assumed contact lenses would be better. I do not see what difference it makes to BPPV? Dizziness got reduced. Maybe it is not BPPV. Maybe it is something else. Usually, when I would get dizzy, I would close my eyes. ", "Dizziness Back again lol so this morning in my sleep I rolled onto my right side (which was the first trigger of my vertigo about a year ago) and felt dizzy, laid on my back and it subsided. I sat up and the force brought me to lay back. Did that a few times until I forced myself to sit up. I just did the epley maneuver twice and felt very little dizzyness. I have heard Flonase has helped with vertigo for some people and I wanted to see if anyone has tried that. Flonase or Zyrtec is okay..essentially they are just anti histamine. Check with your dr of course. I take Zyrtec it helped in the past but it did not help much last time, which literally two days ago.", "Airplanes and BPPV? I have been experiencing vertigo when laying down or laying on my right side for about a month now. I have been trying the bbq roll and epley but unfortunately I have had no results. Although its annoying and uncomfortable, I am able to live my life like I normally can. I am planning a trip that requires me to to on an airplane and I just wanted to know if anyone else had a bad experience when flying? Or if theres any dangers? Everyone seems to have different triggers but I had my first attack in 4 years a couple of months ago after a stressful airplane ride.  Not sure if it was the flying or sleep deprivation, but there it was.", "Had my first episode - what now? Hi all,\n\nI had my first vertigo episode on Tuesday and it only lasted one to two seconds after I had turned my head to the left. I was unsteady for a few minutes after. I saw my doctor and she thinks that the cold that I have had possibly exacerbated the crystal in my left ear, hence the BPPV.\n\nShe said she did not think I would have another attack but said that BPPV could be recurring. I am terrified of that happening, I have terrible health anxiety. I feel some very faint twinges in my ear and am still a big congested but no vertigo or dizziness really since then.\n\nIs there anything preventative I can do to prevent the vertigo from ever happening again?", "Fear before bed As I am laying here in bed I can feel a slight spinning when I close my eyes. It stresses me out thinking I might have to call into work if I wake up and I cannot even get out of bed. I am so tired of living with this fear and anxiety. my 33rd day with vertigo, i know the exact fear and anxiety you have. its hard but you are not alone. im scared when i shower and lay down, but day by day we got to handle it. Easier said then done I know but you will see I had to sleep with two pillows slightly slanted against the bed head/wall. Find your comfort position through trial and error. Sit down on the bed looking straight, fix your eyes on one spot (a little above eye level) and slowly lie down (moving backwards) while maintaining eye contact with that spot and gradually changing the spot to a higher level as you move backwards. You may feel your heart rate go up because of slight spinning, but by now you must know the automatic act of clenching your entire body muscle makes it easier. Once you are down, relax yourself and breathe. Do not move sideways. This whole crap gets triggered from putting pressure on your ear while moving sideways or looking up by moving your head. \nRemember to relax your muscles and breathe once your body is done with the involuntary muscle steeling/clenching while a spin is going on. \nThere is so much bloody technicality in movement while going through BPPV and it gets exhausting because of the amount of trial and error that goes behind it.\nDo not forget to relax and breathe. Do you sleep propped up? I am a stomach sleeper and forced myself to sleep on my back propped up for several weeks (it was horrible, Lol) and it helped stop some of the swaying sensations I felt when I would lay down. Eventually they stopped altogether and I have slowly been able to lower my pillows to the point I can sleep on my unaffected side and get a better night\u2019s sleep.  Been a month for me as well. Still cannot lie on my right side without slight spinning sensation. I just avoid that side completely. Also use two pillows now too to stay elevated. Sending some love to all of you! Hope we can get over this completely. I have the same feeling too, I hate it so much and it drives me nuts! Ever seen my first experience of BPPV last year, my sleep has never been the same since. For some reason, I can no longer lay on my left side or else it would trigger an episode. Wonder if anyone else has something similar like this too?", "Need help! Hello. I am 24 years old male. I have been having anxiety for 4 years. Panic attacks, agoraphobia, anxiety episodes etc. My anxiety has caused me lots of dizzyness and made me develop a phobia for them. If I didnt have dizzyness I would be 80% better for sure. I also have bppv (aside from the anxiety dizzyness) that  i get from time to time. My phobia for dizzyness has gotten so bad that I cant even to the epley manuever which I know will probably heal me. It only lasts 5 mins. I know its easy... but when ever i go down into the first position I start getting extremely dizzy, freak out immediately and stand up. I dont know what to do. Anybody know how to get over this? Any tips? Your anxiety and fear is not uncommon.  I used to DREAD doing the Epley.  During my last episode, it took over 20 Epley over the course of 2 months to resolve my BPPV.  There is no way around the fact that it sucks.  BUT - know that that initial wave of vertigo when you lay back will only last about 20ish seconds. Try to wait it out.  Would it help to have someone sitting there with you to keep talking to you to distract you? I worked with a therapist who I saw once a week - to talk me through the Epley.  She also was a godsend helping the anxiety that goes with BPPV.\n\nOne of the huge things - it to try to get on top of that anxiety.  One recommendation is to get some anxiety meds - to take while trying to treat yourself.  I am not sure of your situation - but if it is possible, talk to your doctor.  Also, for ME - getting some Zofran (anti - nausea meds) was very helpful while doing the Epley.\n\nAlso - if you can find a good vestibular therapist, they can help you with the exercises, give you things to do at home....and if you find a great therapist like I did - they can also help talk you through the anxiety.  Getting a grip on the anxiety is going to help the mild dizziness a ton. I was prescribed meds for anxiety but didnt take them yet. I dont want to gain weight or have some of the sexual side effects. I was going to take them because my anxiety got to really bad but the day I was about to take them (3 days ago) my bppv came back even though it was gone for a month or maybe even more than that. You need to get your mental heath under control. It is affecting your physical health. See a mental health professional.\n\n&gt;I was prescribed meds for anxiety but didnt take them yet. I dont want to gain weight or have some of the sexual side effects.\n\nYou need to take the meds. If you cannot take the meds you need to get different meds, if they all cause unwanted effects you need to talk about why the benefits of the med are way more important than gaining weight and the possible other effects. I can tell you that all day but it is not going to help you. You have to believe it and you have to decide for yourself what is more important. Weight gain is not forever and your sexual activities are irrelevant if you are suffering an attack of BPPV.\n\nI do not have anxiety in relation to my BPPV but I have had anxiety longer than you have been alive. It is a bitch but you have to treat it or it will ruin your life.\n\nTalk to a mental health professional. Sort out your priorities and treat your health conditions.", "Finding BPPV surgery locations Hey all,\n\nI have had BPPV for close to a decade.  Epley maneuvers fix it after an episode, but I often have episodes (at least one a month) following it anyways.  I am fed up with it and want to explore my surgical options.\n\nI live in the DMV area and want to find a place that performs the surgery (posterior canal occlusion).  I do not care if I have to drive far or even fly to a different state.  Just need to find places that do it.\n\nAny help is appreciated. Thanks!", "Vertigo moved to one side after epley maneuver. I randomly started experiencing vertigo 2 days ago and I think it is bppv. I have been trying the epley maneuver but it did not have any effect until tonight. I originally felt dizzy when I turned to the right so I did the epley maneuver by myself. Idk if I did not do it properly but now my left side of the head feels very heavy and right side is fine. It feels like half of my head in an airplane. Have you guys experienced this before? Have a look at our ( in case there is something helpful in there for you. After I self-treated my BPPV, I experienced residual symptoms for a solid day (which I spent sleeping since I could not get up), but, after that, I improved drastically.", "What shot did they give me? I do not think I have BPPV though ever since a particular experience happened a couple months ago I have had these random minor dizziness which last for like 5 seconds maybe. But that is not what this is about. I am wondering about the shot they gave me.\n\nSo, a couple months ago suddenly everything started going back and forth. Very similar to how it feels after you go off a boat after a stormy ride. It was not spinning around like I believe vertigo is? (Correct me if I am wrong) but I have had the spinning kind (when drunk/fever).\n\nHowever, I went into the doctor. She immediately said I think I know what it is and said. Try this shot and if it gets better after 30 minutes then I am correct and you will be prescribed these pills: Sulpirida. It says its or schizophrenia but I mean I dont have that so. The shot and then pills for a week did solve it.", "Is this Residual Dizziness? I woke up with BPPV on December 26th, and usually when I have had positional vertigo before, it has gone away by itself within 24 hours.  This time it persisted, so on December 30th I had my doctor do the Epley manoeuvre on me.  The actual vertigo went away immediately after the procedure, but I seem to still be getting some kind of dizziness.  I have heard residual dizziness is common after being treated for BPPV, but I was wondering if someone who has had residual dizziness after BPPV could tell me if what I am experiencing is the same thing.\n\nThe dizziness I am getting is not light-headedness or full on vertigo with a spinning sensation, but more like imbalance and spatial disorientation.  I am OK when sitting or standing still, but when I move around, I feel off-balance and slightly disoriented.  If I turn my head quickly, it feels like the sensation of turning continues for about half a second after I stop, which sometimes causes me to stagger.  It almost feels like the physical sensation of very mild vertigo, but without the visual spinning or eye movements.\n\n**The weird thing is that it is worse in the morning, but tends to slowly settle down during the day, usually being completely gone by around 8pm, but then it comes back again the next morning.**  I read that residual dizziness is your brain adjusting back to normal after filtering out bad signals due to vertigo, but if that was the case, it would not make sense for the dizziness to go away in the evening then come back in the morning.  It is almost like lying down for a long period is what sets it off.\n\nIs this what residual dizziness from BPPV is like, or is it possible that I am still experiencing very mild BPPV due to the otoconia not being completely cleared, or does this sound like something else?  I am wondering if I should wait it out or get another appointment with my doctor.", "Working with residual dizziness and fatigue I had a bad case of BPPV on Tuesday (my first) and went to the ER. They did not help at all. Wednesday night I realized what it was and did the Epley Maneuver which helped get rid of the substantial dizzy spells. \n\nSince Thursday I have been feeling very fatigued and I feel a residual dizziness that I can see others have been feeling. I am a Labor and Delivery nurse on a busy unit. I called out sick Wednesday and Thursday night and my doctor told me to take tonight off as well, but I feel guilty. I am not sure if it is normal to be feeling this fatigued and if I should attempt to work. My biggest fear is getting dizzy while I am holding a baby or in a c-section. Anyone else work in jobs where you are on your feet for hours? How did you deal with the days after? I am lucky (?) to be out of work right now, but wanted to confirm for you that your symptoms are common.  Also, if you have not already, see a physical therapist who works with dizzy patients.  It has been super helpful to me.  Mine has helped with habituation to dull the lingering dizziness.  Like you, physicians have been zero help.  My PT also told me that often a person experiences their worst episode first, with the shortest recovery time followed by episodes that become less intense but linger longer.  This has been my experience.  Hang in there, though, it will get better. The residual is exhausting and annoying but will go away. Definitely agree with the other poster, see a PT and they will make sure you are straightened out properly. The last thing you would want is to be dizzy at work like that I am sorry to hear that your ER doctor was not helpful. I made a similar post a few days earlier and received great responses from this sub. The recovery process varies for everyone but in my case, I had to take Gravol for the first two days and sleep them off. After that, the symptoms have been gone and I have been functional (no residual dizziness, no vertigo when lying down/getting up as long as it is gradual and not in 0.3s). What you are experiencing is definitely normal especially within the first week of an episode; and I hope you get well soon!", "Vertigo with horizontal movement but not vertical I have been having issues with vertigo for about 3 days now, as of now the way it works for me (after doing the maneuvers a few times) is that up and down there is no vertigo but left to right or right to left does induce vertigo. It starts immediately and then settles within a few seconds. Do I need to go to some specialist? Or should I just continue doing the Epley maneuver? If this is a new problem you should go to a specialist so they can figure out which ear has crystals or if both do.  You can search for a balance center or vestibular rehab or pt.  They will probably need an order from your primary care Dr.  Your Dr might send it without seeing you to help you speed it up.  I had great experience with both pt and fyzical balance center. update: the right side is good so now turning to the left is the only bad thing, 90 degree horizontal is the best it is been so I am really scared to do the maneuvers now because I do not want to ruin it lol I would suggest going to a specialist, the loose crystal is not always in the canal that the Epley works on and there are different maneuvers they will have you do based on which canal is affected. If you want to try figuring it out on your own look up \u201cnystagmus during BPPV\u201d, the direction of eye movement is different depending on where the crystal is if I am remembering correctly. You might be able to self diagnose by having someone watch your eye movement (or you can record it) while you are having vertigo. I am negative now on the Dix-Hallpike test and I am unable to reproduce vertigo when rotating my head in any direction (I do feel a bit heavy if I am lying on my back though), only what I can describe as a feeling of it coming but it never actually coming\n\nI guess I will keep doing the daily Epley's and hit up a physio who specializes in this to see if everything is a-ok Interesting! The last time I had a bout it started in the canal Epley helps but at some point it moved to other canal. I did not have as much actual vertigo then but I felt like I was moving when I was sitting still - like I was on a boat or something. It is frustrating when there is no \u201cone and done\u201d fix. Good luck! Barrel roll maneuvers work best. Sounds like horizontal canal BPPV. Whatever side is worse when you lay on it, generally is the involved side. You want to start there and roll away from it. Check out a YouTube video or two first.", "Nsaids relieve nausea and dizzyness and neckpain. I frequently find my self in the need of taking painkillers especially strong nsaids because only then i get relief from neck pain dizzyness and nausea.What Is your experiences with the same symptoms? I struggle with BPPV every 4 to 6 months or so and I have not found relief with pain killers. They tend to make me more drowsy and the tiredness makes me far more dizzy. I have found relief with Zofran, it keeps the nastier side of nausea away which helps me heal quicker. I find that my episodes can last months of I do not get my vomit under control first. Vomiting leaves me more dehydrated and I am more selectable to knocking another crystal loose. Also the position I am in while throwing up does not help my dizzy. \n\nWhen I wake up with BPPV I try to get a hold of rubbing alcohol as quickly as possible, to smell it which for some reason stops the initial vomiting long enough for me to take a Zofran. I learned the rubbing alcohol trick from an ER nurse last year while I was having a excessively bad episode. Also with Zofran I drink as much water as I can possibly fit in my body. \n\nI do the Epley maneuver and rest. Because the Epley definitely makes it worse for a day but then slowly gets better. VRT exercises help once I am 3 or 4 days out of the initial episode, eye movement VRT before head movement VRT. and now I am considering magnesium supplements because I have heard many success stories using them. I also take an antidepressant and ADD medications that help with not feeling drowsy. \n\nI hope you can find some relief with out harsh pain meds, I know they can be hard on your liver. Out of all the things I do to combat BPPV I truly believe Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy has been the most beneficial, and finding a physical therapist who has a lot of experience with it and hopefully specializes in VRT is key. My first VRT was with someone who had never done it before and I was kind of the guinea pig.. months later through an audiologists tip I was able to connect with a women who specializes in VRT and has a wealth of knowledge. I have seen her several times and her techniques are game changer! Sounds like you may have a herniated disc", "Description of my symptoms: Do these sound familiar to you? I have used these descriptions/comparisons to try to communicate my symptoms to my family and my doctor (with these, the doctor gave me the BPPV diagnosis):\n\n-- feels like my brain is on a high speed oscillator. Any movement of my head, eyes, certain body movements brings this sensation on, which lasts just a couple of seconds. Stops when I am still. Happens again with each other movement, no matter how subtle \n\n-- sensation is like what it would feel like in your head if you fell quickly and unexpectedly, especially if you fell backwards \n\n-- sensation like if you turn your head, you have a \"ghost head\" following behind with a one second or so delay. Much like the physical equivalent of the visual \"trails\" you get if you have ever taken LSD\n\nAll of these and other descriptions I may not be thinking of right now are accompanied by a general feeling of strangeness, disorientation and confusion. The bouts come and go without any seeming reason. The spells last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks and usually seem to average out at around 2 weeks, give or take and there may be periods of weeks or even months between them.\n\nAnyway, any input would be appreciated and I am glad I found this sub! Thanks!\n\nUnrelated (I think): has anybody ever experienced \"bigsmall\"? I do not know what else to call it but if you have, I will bet you will know what I am talking about Yes, the first two are exactly what I had. Not sure about the third but if you mean like a slowness or heaviness I am your head then yes. This does sound like BPPV. Did you doctor do the Epley maneuver or refer you somewhere? \n\nUnfortunately, all you can do is the maneuver until you start to feel better. After that just rest when you can and try not to do anything that may make the crystals go out of place again like strenuous exercise or anything that will jostle your head until you feel normal again.\n\nSorry you are dealing with this! What do you mean by \" high speed oscillator \"? Think of an oscillating table fan sped up a few hundred times. Fortunately it only lasts as long as my head is moving. Do you mean that when you move your head, you feel dizzy? I have not been to physical therapy yet although there are some good how to online... this first started about 2 years ago.  I thought I had a brain tumor or something serious. I had an MRI, saw an ENT Dr., had a procedure done where hot air was blown into my ears in different positions for 2 hours; all inconclusive. Finally a couple months ago, another doctor diagnosed me over the phone (covid-19 precaution) in 5 minutes. Go figure. Close enough Yes, the how to\u2019s online are good! Especially if there is someone to help you because it does make the symptoms worse at first. \n\nI saw two different drs who thought it was eustatian tube disfunction from allergies - which have never really been a problem for me. I finally saw one dr over FaceTime who said to try to Epley and it worked! I do not know why dr\u2019s take so long to diagnose because it does seem quite common.", "BPPV After working out It seems like my \"push\" day at the gym triggers vertigo.\nI would assume it is to do with the bench press or dumbbell press  (laying horizontally, positioning of head?).\n\nWelp I guess I will avoid those.

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* No, but the other way around is true for me. Anxiety and panic attacks can trigger my vertigo. Yeah, especially when it gets really bad (like during the epley maneuver). Then the panic makes me vertigo worse :/", "I am new here- I have had constant vertigo for 4 days now. Hello everyone. For 4 days now my world has been spinning. When I am up walking around, my balance is off and the dizziness makes me so sick to my stomach. Sitting and laying down helps. I feel absolutely miserable, all day. Today is the fourth day and I woke up feeling like I would pass out when I started walking around. I am crying right now thinking \u201cwhat if I am like this forever?\u201d I am so drained already. \n\nI went to urgent care this morning, the doctor told me my ears had wax in them, and that is all he said. He was zero help, he sent me on my way with a prescription for nausea, but I am breastfeeding and would rather find the cause of the nausea before taking meds for it just yet. My question is, what should I do now? I feel lost and more miserable than I have ever been. Thank you to any one who is reading this Is it like you are on a boat, or like the room around you is spinning? It feels like the room spins c i cannot be of much help. but i still remember the first time i had vertigo. i could not even stand straight. had to be transported with the ambulance to ER. the doctors were of no help. refers me to pcp. pcp refers me to PT. after a week, it magically disappeared. \n\nat that time, i was worried that i would be like this forever and i am only 24. \n\nit happened a couple times after. but not to that degree and it would go away in a week. \n\ni jux want to share you my experience. trust me, i know it is scary but it will get better. best wishes for you. This is super helpful and super comforting to hear, seriously. Just reading this and leaving your experience is so helpful to me. I wish you well, too \u2764\ufe0f Sorry you are going through this... it sounds awful. I think a physical therapist can help you more than doctors in urgent care. You will not be like this forever. Big hug for you, hang on in there! Thank you so much. I think you are right. \u2764\ufe0f I am going to start searching for PT in my area and maybe that is a good place to start. Hugs!! I have been going through some vertigo off and on since I have been in post-viral. Not sure if it is Covid-related or my usual ENT/allergy issues. I had an acute vertigo incident in January way before Covid. I called my ENT and he recommended switching up my medications. I add Afrin and Sudafed which are OTC right now to my retinue of allergy meds. My earaches and dripping ear fluid issues have subsided, so hopefully the dizziness will also go soon. Your body seeks a stasis with balance and most everyone reports the post-covid inflammation issues come and go so hopefully you will be fine soon. Oh, if you are breastfeeding of course talk to your doctor before you start taking anything. I do not have kids but I hear it is limited what you can take while breastfeeding. This does not sound like BPPV, as BPPV is not constant like your describing, episodes only trigger with certain head movements. Yes it is quite limited and I did not have the chance to tell the doc at urgent care that I am breastfeeding. :/ so I will def be meeting with my care provider to get his two cents about it all That is good to know! I need to get in with my care provider and get his two cents about what it could all be :( thank you for letting me know this though Look up the Epley Manoeuvre - very helpful if it is Benign Positional Vertigo Will do! Thank you If you have waxy ears try to get an ear irrigator--basically a syringe that shoots warm water into your ear to flush it out (safer than Q-tips).  Also, have your tried testing your blood pressure?  I have taken atenolol a few times when I am super dizzy and it seems to help some. Thank you for the tips I will check my blood pressure! Hi,\n\nDoes not sound like BPPV. But hopefully nothing serious. Sounds like the urgent care doctor did not provide much help.\n\nI would just take it easy until you can see your primary care doctor, if it gets worse and have any vomiting I would go to the ER if you feel the need.\n\nBut hopefully it goes away on its own, I have actually had BPPV earlier this year and I know how you feel, even though like I said it does not sound like you have BPPV. Any info you can get that triggers it or makes it worse just take note of.\n\nBut I am sure you are fine, just try not to think about it too bad or else anxiety will kick in What does it mean if it feels like you are on a boat? Some people like myself have the boat feeling for quite some time after vertigo. It is like you are on boat all the time. I had a vertigo attack four weeks ago and I am still having residual dizziness. It is gotten better, but still having dizziness spill some times in the day. As the others said, it usually goes away by itself, but it takes time. Be patient and try not to worry because anxiety can make it way worse. Hopefully both of us will feel well soon. Please update what your diagnosis is once you find out, because I have the exact same problem and it is been 3 days now Unfortunately my care provider is booked allll month. So I have not gotten a diagnosis. But it is been over a week now and my symptoms have improved greatly. My balance is still off but the dizziness is so much better. I am going to get some blood work done just to see. Best of luck to you I hope you get to feeling better x Glad to know you are better now. Just wanted to know did it improved on it is own or did you used any medication or exercises, anything.", "Possible BPPV 3 days ago I started getting really dizzy especially when hanging washing on the line, trying to shower, washing dishes and sitting on the toilet!\n\nI am away for the holidays with my family and we are quite far from any Drs/Hospitals. I had a skype consult with my Dr and he said it sounds like BPPV and he told me it should pass.\n\nToday is day 3 and it is much worse. I cannot stand to make food or do anything. I feel I am going to fall over from the dizziness.\n\nAny ideas on what I can to help this pass faster and does it sound like BPPV to you or did my Dr just say that to rush me off our call? What is your definition of dizziness? If you are feeling lightheaded then it is probably not. \n\nBPPV is described as having vertigo that is brought on by head positions ie laying down, rolling over, looking up, looking down. \n\nThis vertigo can produce a mild to violent feeling of rolling with nystagmus (eye beating) that \u201cmay\u201d resolve over time (no specific timeline ie could be days, hours, weeks or months) but can be resolved much quicker (some people have instant relief) by seeing a specalist (or you can try your self - not advised) to test and resolve you using dix-hall pike. \n\nLoads of good detail on what this all means in past posts. I would start going through them and if you have more questions reply back here. One way to find out is to try a BPPV manuver - half somersault is the easiest to do:\n\n(\n\nIf at anytime during the manuver the room starts to spin - it is BPPV.  You may need to try it a few times.  If after 3 times nothing happens - then it is probably not BPPV.  \n\nJust curious - do the dizzy spells happen within a few minutes after you stand up? Thank you for taking the time to reply. My definition of dizziness is a sudden feeling of being unsteady on my feet as the room is spinning. Thank you for taking the time to reply. I am going to try the video you suggested.\n\nYes, they tend to happen a few minutes after I stand up. Okay - so room spinning is vertigo and with BPPV it is brought on by head positions as the vestibular function in your head which is mechanical is sending a different signal then what your eyes are sending to your brain caused by \u201ccrystal(s)\u201d that are misaligned, dislodged, moved and no one knows what caused them to move in the first place. \n\nIf it is BPPV there are a few ways to \u201ctest\u201d and \u201cconfirm\u201d that it is indeed BPPV. \n\n1) do the standard dix-hall pike (google it) test; AND / OR\n2) move your head in the position that causes the vertigo, hold the position and as your eyes and brain figure out what is happening, the vertigo will slow down and stop until you move your head again.\n\n*The vertigo will cause your eyes to beat which we call nystagmus (Google it). If your eyes do not beat (it can be violent or subtle) then it is not BPPV. \n\n\nTo resolve BPPV, you need a specalist (I use a PT that specialises in balance disorders) or if you cannot see someone and you are game to try and resolve the crystal your self, you will need to do the Epley manoeuvre (Google it)\n\nYou may resolve the crystal and have instant relief OR you may end up with residual dizziness. \n\nDizziness by my definition (everyone is different) is tht feeling of being lightheaded and the room moving... it is not spinning like you have alcohol poisoning. \n\nBest of luck and I hope you get to see someone soon. Sounds similar to what happens to me sometime and my doc said it could be Orthostatic Hypotension.", "Need answers quick please help!! Can a sudden movement from falling up and down cause BPPV??? it is been 16 hours now that I have been dizzy and feel like im about to fall whenever I try to stand up and walk around the house. I was trying to repair my air conditioner but my chair fell off so I had to jump down pretty high... and I also have TMJD a jaw disorder but not sure if this is related to my jaw. Have you had BPPV before? If not... this does not sound likely. I would consult with a professional. Nope...this is my first time being dizzy evenwhen im just sitting and standing.. Idk what to do anymore man. I do not think I can go outside and consult a professional under this covid-19 lockdown this is so damn stressful. What is BPPV like though? and yeah I kind of doubt i have bppv but this dizziness is so annoying and it is still here. Yea, I totally get it... You could always see if you can get a doctors appt over the phone or video. Some doctors are offering that right now. Also, you can google the 'Epley maneuver' on youtube. Try it at home, maybe you have someone that can help you. If you have BPPV, you may find relief right away. Hey man, I took a quick nap for 2 hours and it seems like the dizziness and balance problem went away. I tried walking in a straight line for 15 mins just fine.

Has this happened to you?? Wth\n\nSo I had an attack that stemmed from my left ear about a week ago. I was feeling a little bit better.

Oh gosh that sounds awful, I am sorry. I have not had that happen but I am pretty sure the last time I had it, it was in both ears which made it hard to treat. Honestly, pt helped the most.\n\nI would definitely take a few weeks and just sleep on your back elevated after treating this ear and just give yourself time to let the crystals settle down in both ears.\n\nI hope you feel better soon!", "when should I stop doing the eply manever? Right now at this current moment my dizziness and the spinning sensation is gone. I still feel there is pressure on my head when I change in position(especially when walking), and a bit of lost of balance whenever I walk/stand. Should I keep doing the eply manever or is there other exercises I should do at this stage of my vertigo? Try checking the ( \\&gt; Treatment &gt; last paragraph before the bullet points. Residual symptoms can stick around for a while even after all of the crystals have been maneuvered out of the semicircular canals.\n\nYou would only continue doing the maneuvers if your head still spins when you change head positions (i.e., there are still crystals floating around your canals, stirring up fluid, causing the illusion of motion).\n\nHope that helps? so the patient should not keep doing the maneuver if all the patient feel is dizziness and unsteady movements? Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, vestibular physiotherapist, otolaryngologist, or other type of specialist.\n\nCrystals rolling around in your semicircular canals = spinning room when you change your head position (e.g., sitting up after lying down)\n\nThe maneuvers linked in the quick reference guide move the crystals out of the semicircular canals.\n\nThere is often residual dizziness and fogginess after the crystals have been successfully maneuvered out (and you will know that they are out because the room will not spin anymore when you change your head position). The residual dizziness (not referring to spinning here) can last from days to months. Check the quick reference guide for tips on reducing the severity of that dizziness and preventing future BPPV (spinning) episodes.\n\nTo answer your question, if the room still looks like it is spinning when you, for example, get up from lying down, then you likely still have crystals in your semicircular canals, so you will need to do maneuvers until they are out. If the room does not spin anymore, but you feel gross, then the crystals likely have been moved out, and you just need to recover, again for days to months. \ud83d\ude15\n\nGood luck, u/luitheluilalui! Check out the quick reference guide; it will likely answer a lot of your questions. On my last episode of vertigo I was doing an epley once every hour, for a total of 5. \n\nI highly recommend having someone hold your neck especially if you are leaving it unsupported hanging off the bed or table, I ended up straining my neck really bad and now I have horrible tension headaches, when I press on the neck muscle tissue near the base of my skull the pain reverberates all over my head.", "Have faith Hi everyone! Positive vibes post here.  \n\nI had two bouts of BPPV within a week near the end of February and the residual dizziness has FINALLY started to subside.  I do not even notice it much anymore.  I still get it slightly after driving home from work (I use a computer all day) and when I lay down flat I still feel it.  I wake up laying perfectly flat or on my side though just due to moving around in my sleep with no residual affects when I wake up.  You can get through this.  You will get through this.  Feeling a little dizzy sometimes is not the end of the world.  Stay strong and have faith.  If you ever need encouragement feel free to reach out to me.  BPPV is super annoying and can cripple your mental health but the most important thing to remember is to stay positive and know that this too shall pass.  Have a great day everyone! Thank you for this super positive message. I am going on a full month of residual dizziness after a bout with BPPV for 2 weeks. I am getting better little by little. 3 weeks ago I would have a good day and then a bad day but now I am stringing together 2 and 3 good days in a row before having a bad day. I cannot wait until I am back to normal, or atleast 95% normal. Hurrah! Excellent post!  My last bout of BPPV lasted over 2 months (I was working with a GREAT vestibular therapist).  My residual lasted at least 8 months. The first few months were BRUTAL!  I am now a year and a half from the start of the last episode. And finally feeling MUCH better.  For some - it really just takes a long time to recover.  I think remaining active really helped me recover. I kept working, kept up with my hobbies (running, snowmobiling, trap shooting, dog agility, horseback riding, etc) and tried to keep myself busy and distracted as much as possible.  The anxiety of getting BPPV again has even subsided (knock on wood!).

Woke up.felt dizzy still. Google says it could be dehydration.  Chugged down a ton of water. Room started spinning, puked everything out. First time this was happening,  and I hadnt done anything out of the ordinary. Perhaps it was the handstand i was practising before? But it is not something I have not done a ton of times with no issues.\n\nBut anyways, figured it was bppv. Kept trying the epley maneuver despite puking couple of times in the process. Symptoms diminished in the night. Everything went back to normal the next day. But boy was it it a scary experience\n\nIt is been fine so far. But a re occurrence genuinely scares me. Anyone has any idea what causes it and how likely its going to happen again ? I had a few occurrences every month or so but each far less heavy than the previous one. Would still feel kind of shitty for a few days each time it happened but now I think it is been a little over a year since my first one and I have not had any in probably several months now Any idea what caused ur condition ? For me it is just totally random I am so jealous that you feel normal after what sounds like a pretty solid episode of it. Please do not let the re-occurence scare you. Sure, it could happen again, but if it does it will go away again fast and you will be fine. Do what you can to avoid letting fear set in, otherwise it could fuck with your brain and turn into something permanent like it did with me :(\n\nAlso take a break with the handstands/inversions.

I have also got a throat infection which hurts and makes me feel doubley shit.\n\nFast forward 24 hours and the throat infection feels a lot better. Sure it is not over yet, but I definately feel I am on the mend in that regard.\n\nMy bppv (after performing 2 apley manoeuvres on myself) has never felt better. Infact, I would say for the past 6 hours or so it feels like I do not have it (do not want to get ahead of myself).\n\nThe only reason I am posting this is for suffers who are going through an awful time - it will not last forever. For me, reading posts saying people have this for years was utterly depressing. You kind of question yourself - will I have this for years too?\n\nWell, everyday is a different day but at the moment I feel great. Those going through a shitty time - it will get better - and this will not last forever - however you may feel right now.\n\nHang in there guys. It is possible that the throat infection had something to do with your BPPV. You have 2 small tubes going from your inner ear to your throat (nasopharynx actually) called \"Eustachian Tubes\". Sore throat can cause one to get blocked causing a build up in pressure in your ear. If you fly or pop your ears, this can cause all kinds of mischief in your ear. \n\nGlad you are feeling better. Cheers mate.\n\nI dunno, I got the sore throat a couple of days ago and had the bbpv for over a week, but yeah good point.\n\nI am sure I will be posting again here in a few days saying how awful I feel. I hope I do not - but just enjoying this time I am feeling ok. So glad you are feeling better! :)\nYes, I tried to push through it for 3 weeks. Now that the vertigo is gone after Epley.I still have lingering dizziness and a headache. :( I think it will take time for my vestibular system to go back into sync with normal movement. I always tell everyone to try to get those movements in ASAP. I am glad your feeling better too. And I agree - I also feel the lingering dizziness come and go. How did You get the manoeuvre done? Yourself or a professional?\n\nLet us hope we have sorted it eh!!! I finally went to a Physical Therapist. I originally went to a ENT and he just gave me a print out of the maneuvers to do at home. Of course I did not do them right and made it worse lol Glad it is sorted now. Me too. Hope it stays this way. \nI hope you stay vertigo free as well. Get lots of sleep. I notice that I feel a lot better when I get more sleep. xx Yeah, i agree.\n\nI work fulltime night\u2019s (at work at the mo) and have a toddler at home so it is not easy getting sleep I am not going to lie.

Just \u201coff\u201d. Almost like you are kind of hungover? Maybe just me haha \n\nI understand. Sleep is not always easy to get at my home either. But naps. Naps all the time. Lol those help.

How does she figure out which ear is causing the vertigo? \n\nSo far she has taken the prescribed medications, drank Gatorade, drank ginger tea, and had some Emergen-C. We plan on doing the Epley Maneuver tomorrow which is why we want to know which ear is affected.\n\nThank you. Before doing the epley, I watched videos about the Dix Hallpike Maneuver. This is the one that you can see which ear is affected. Here are some notes I wrote when I was looking into all this for me :) Hope it helps.

Indeed ... After being here for months responding to people over and over I do wonder how people end up here. \n\nu/abundantswirls - I would read historic posts in this sub. - loads of good information to be found. Great notes \ud83d\udc4d Will try these myself tomorrow. I am scared to try them, tbt, because the dizziness when that nystagmus kicks in is so awful. It can last a couple hours for me. Woke up yesterday with vertigo for the first time. It is intense. Tell me about it, once I have an episode mine used to last 12 hours. All I could do was lay in bed and sleep on my side. Thankfully I have not had one in about 5-6 months Ugh! Sounds terrible!! Yes, laying propped up in bed here. Anytime I move, it kicks in. I keep my neck still, move slow, but still get the crystals doing their cursed tricks to my eyes. I took a video of the nystagmus from sitting up. It looks less intense than it feels. When I had my first attack in the middle of the night I did not know what was happening (which happens to most of us..) &amp; thought this is how I die. The nystagmus is what makes it just so much worse. You feel nauseous &amp; immediately need to lie down, head still. I feel your pain. I have been taking magnesium &amp; feel it has been helpful in managing. It is a lifelong management I guess.", "What triggers your BPPV? Hi just wanted to hear from you all what triggers your vertigo.\n\nHad my first episode in Nov 2019 in the midst of doing sit ups.\n\nThere was no symptoms since Dec 2020 till last night. Did sit ups last evening, was slightly giddy but no vertigo. Then I got woken up at 3am as I turned my head in the middle of my sleep and my world starts to spin again gosh.\n\nSo I guess doing sit ups is a trigger for me. What about you guys? Stress is a sure fire trigger for me. \n\nI have also heard from my physiotherapist that they anecdotally see more patients with vertigo during stressful periods. \n\nI also think extreme heart burn may trigger it for me, but that could just be repeated coincidence. Yes omg stress is also one of the triggers for me!! Inversion yoga poses, unfortunately. Stress and turning my head to the left quickly, or sleeping on my left side. Putting my head in different positions, mostly.\n\nLooking at a top shelf, looking at the ground, moving from my right side to my left in bed. That sort of thing. your dumbass triggers me I seem to have gotten under your skin, glad to know you are that sensitive to strangers on the internet yea stupid people like you do get under my skin. next time dont comment if you cant take the blowback. now gfy Lying down on a flat surface with my head turned to the left for more than a minute triggers me. \ud83d\ude11\n\nWhat \"loosens\" the BPPV is exercising (without treadmills!) and just moving on with my life. The symptoms gradually disappear in a few days. Caffeine. Excessive nicotine. Sometimes I just wake up and have a bad day and the next day I am fine. Occasionally driving sets it off for an hour or so My first BPPV episode was the day after a 20mile treadmill run. Coincidence or something to this? Asking because I am new to BPPV and your comment made me think of what I was doing the day before my first episode. Lack of sleep is a big one Menstruuuaaaation \ud83d\udd34 My first BPPV experience was the day after I did yoga. I had to tip my head to the left and hold it. I have slight scoliosis on my upper spine and neck which might have triggered the vertigo. Took me 3 months to recover. I could not treadmill during this period as the symptoms would grow stronger and I would have to wait it out for a day before I return to my new normal, which was the feeling that I was on a boat ride everyday. Aftwr 3 months though, I could ride the treadmill again with minimal dizziness.\n\nMy 2nd attack was last October. It is only this January that I returned to the gym. I feel almost normal, except during the times I would sleep on my left side by accident. So I am trying to avoid the treadmill until maybe next month. :) Hope it made sense, sorry. Not a natice English speaker.", "Advice for coping with BPPV Hi, the past few months have been pretty torturous for me, and I have been seeing a specialist to help relocate the crystals in my ears. I have around 30% permanent damage in an organ in my left ear now, due to a \u201cvirus\u201d that I was dealing with in October after a fever. The virus is gone, but the damage is done, and I have recently started physical therapy in hopes of regaining a more normal feeling with my equilibrium, and just a normal feeling in general. I constantly feel \u201coff\u201d or \u201cfloaty\u201d, I do not have the regular bouts of vertigo anymore, but I can get them if I position my head in certain positions. I have been through so many tests to try and determine what happened to my body, because the virus also affected my nervous system for around two months. I am here to ask for any advice for coping and adapting to this new life. I would appreciate anyone who regularly deals with BPPV to share with me some of the tools they use to get by. Thank you if anyone reads or replies. Many people suffer anxiety or PTSD concerning BPPV. What helps me is to remember that, with  a few treatments, my BPPV was resolved. The vertigo is terrible. Always remember exactly what triggers it and avoid those  positions. Try to go as long as possible without accidently triggering it. This does not have to be a debilitating illness. It has caused a good amount of anxiety for myself, I would jerk awake in fear that my head was tilting to the wrong side. I will try to avoid anything that triggers it. The Epley chair maneuvers have helped immensely, but after a while, even if I do not feel vertigo, I feel like I am off by a notch and feel \u201coff\u201d constantly. &gt;It has caused a good amount of anxiety for myself, I would jerk awake in fear that my head was tilting to the wrong side\n\nYes, this is the PTSD I was talking about. Those bouts of vertigo outdo any roller coaster ride I have ever been on. They are nasty. But you are on the track back to a normal life and you will readjust. This is not cancer or some other  terminal disease. This is a speed bump in the road of life. You are not alone. Good luck. The only thing that has worked for me is sleeping / laying /turning my head towards the side that does not have the crystals in your ear, if you do not have them in both. I always avoid turning my head to my left for extended periods of time, for example, and always sleep on my right side. Otherwise, it is a trigger for a rush of dizziness.  About a year ago I suffered full on BPPV for the first time in my life. The BPPV cleared up after 2-3 days, but since then I have had these periods of feeling off-center or \"floaty\" as you may describe. Three things have helped me a good bit. The first is staying hydrated, the second is periodically flushing out my ears (I am a wax producer), and the third and final thing if all else fails is this maneuver: ( This may not be your treatment, but keep at it and you will find something that will \"ground you\" back into this reality. Previous to BPPV and following symptoms, I never knew just how much of a role our ears play in making us feel present, and these days I wonder how many people who suffer de-realization or something similar \"mental illness\" actually have a vestibular disorder. What exactly do you mean by \u201cfull on BPPV? I am not sure why you believe my BPPV is lesser than \u201cFull on BPPV\u201d. My neurologist confirmed that I have BPPV, as well as 30% permanent damage to my vestibular organs in my left ear. Both ears were positive for crystals.", "BPPV has taught me\u2026. It has taught me that the balance system we have is flawed that a little stone in a canal can make the world spin. It also has taught me that for some afflictions the medical community really does not have any solid answers. I have had this for well over ten years now going back to my mid to early 20\u2019s. I cannot really bob my head to music very much because that seems to trigger it. It comes to me at least once a month as well. I do not look forward to my senior years because falls will definitely be an issue for me. I feel there has to be a better way\u2026there has to be a treatment that is better than a few maneuvers that may or may not help and meclizine. It is very frustrating to have this chronically randomly, because when you explain it to people\u2026.they do not believe you, or they think it is not really that bad.

Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* I was just thinking the same and made a post about it. This started 6 months ago and I have had 4 attacks since then. I just cannot keep doing this! Cannot keep going to therapists to have this fixed over multiple sessions and doing all the VRT exercises to beat the residual dizziness just to get hit with another attack! Last night was my first attack after almost 3 months bppv free..i had made such progress with the residual dizziness and was watching videos about neuroplasticity and life was wonderful before i got hit with it last night while rolling in bed at 2 am. It is mild i have to say but still..it is making me a little lightheaded and imbalanced and miserable cuz i have to go see a vestibular therapist again and here we go again!! What makes me frustrated the most is that it has taken hope away from me, hope that all the earlier sensations of head heaviness and internal spinning/rocking may never fully have a chance to heal because bppv will keep bringing them back and it is totally out of my control. Vit D levels are better after 6 months of taking it and all the precautions im taking and still this bppv wont give me a breal longer than 3 months. All the medical development  tells us nothing!! Yeah. It seems like the medical community just kind of casts this affliction aside and treats it like a minor cough or something. \u201cHere is some head exercises and Meclizine. Have a nice day.\u201d Is all I get when I go. The fact that it happens to me randomly is what annoys me the most. That and if people do not experience it themselves they either downplay it or in some cases may not even believe you.  Yeah and how it is the most common and easiest to fix kind of vertigo and harmless and so on. It is harmless i know but my head has not felt completely normal since all this started in May of this year\u2026there is always some degree of dizziness whether severe or really mild..but its always there I am sorry that you experience it all the time in some way. In that aspect I do not feel it all the time. For me it randomly happens and I never know when. My issue is that I have to alter how I enjoy life because of worry it will trigger it. So playing with my kids or enjoying music by moving my head in any way freaks me out. I literally listen to music with little to no movement. And with me being 36 and all the websites say that this starts usually in their 60\u2019s. Now I worry what my old years hold. There has to be a better way than just these head maneuvers. Well im like you..i have experienced the spinning vertigo every several weeks to months, but the lightheadedness that comes after is always there because it has never gotten the chance to fully heal to 100 % before the next bppv if that makes sense! It gets to the point where its almost gone and then bam the next bppv attack hits and all the progress i have made is gone. I feel very emotional writing this now. I cannot help feeling that there is something wrong with me u know, like this thing has added years and years to my age, im a 36 year old mom and not sure how i will live to raise my kids happily if this thing keeps happening so frequently! I really cannot imagine my life this way it is terrifying .There are a lot of detail as to how my condition started and the symptoms i have had and I hate my head right now, i literally cannot stand my own head anymore right now! I definitely understand that. I assume it is relatively new to you right now (I could be wrong). Mine started in mid-2000\u2019s and at first I was distraught about it. After a few years I fell into a more weird mind frame about it. I cannot call it apathy because I do care about it, but I would say it is adjacent to apathy. I get no answers from doctors besides the maneuvers so I kind of \u201cgave up\u201d I would say. I did not actually give up, but it is hard to describe my mindset. Believe me\u2026if they had a new treatment that had good results I would take it (even if it meant I had to go under the knife). So, I did not give up, but I gave up\u2026.I dunno how to describe it. Dealing with it well over a decade kind of messes with your head. Im so sorry you have been dealing with this for such a long time. How often do you get the bppv episodes? Do they last long or leave any residual dizziness? I wish mine would even be once a year thing at least then it would be more tolerable..but 4 times in Six months is just too much. And yes it does mess with your head. I look at people now happy and laughing and ask myself do they have bppv? Do they have chronic dizziness because of it? Lol so yes i think about it n worry all the time even when im having good happy days..like always there in the back of my mind.\nI really want to go back to work after 2 years as a SAHM and dont know how i can commit to a job if this condition is chronic? Some stories give me hope still like a girl who posted she hadnt had bppv in 2 years after having them every few weeks for years ..i wait for my turn \ud83d\ude05 I get it roughly once a month (give or take) and it lasts usually a day but has lasted a few days on occasion. I have random dizziness that is not exactly positional at times (but I struggle with anxiety too so that could be it too). As for hope. I definitely have that still to some degree. I hope it does stop eventually. Hell like you said even once a year would be an even trade to me at this point. Do you perform the epley maneuver urself when you get an attack? I want to teach myself how to do it properly but i dont in fear I may do it wrong n mess things up even more. I do. It is 50/50 on working. I am having BPPV today, and tried the maneuver. It did not work. Even when it does not work I have never had things get worse or anything in my experience. If it does not work for me it just stays the same.  Sometimes it takes more than one time to work. I will consider it. Thanks a lot for all your replies. Hope we both heal from this forever. I appreciate your responses and comments. Thank you for kind words. I feel for you too. Had it on and off for years with loads of residual dizziness and your right\u2026 people downplay it and do not believe you. It is somewhat disheartening when your looking for some empathy from loved ones. Yeah. It is pretty disheartening when family and friends write it off as not being that bad, and work places essentially call you a liar without calling you a liar. The thing that helps me most is daily yoga. Just 10-15 minutes. \n\nKnowing how to do my own Epley maneuver is great as well This is everything. I have never felt this seen in the past 4 years having this. Thank you for putting my thoughts/feelings into words. I have tried Epley like 5 times today alone.....It is 50/50 for me. You, me, and probably most people here. It is so horrible and annoying. There is the other one. Starts with an S. Do you try that one? Sermont \n\n Never heard of that one. My issue today is when looking up or on right side. I wish I had more definitive way to know what maneuver. Epley and sermont treat the same canal. \n\nWhat kind of nystagmus is it? Left right? Tortional (left-right with a vertical wobble)? So right now when I look up I get vertigo and when I lay on my right side. Never knew how to tell with the eye nystagmus. Do you do the dix  hall pike at home? No. I read that tests should be done under doctor supervision so I never really looked into it. My doctors also never did this when I saw them (because conveniently I was not having vertigo when I went), they diagnosed me based on my description of symptoms. You can do it at home. I never actually saw a doctor for mine initially because it was peak covid. We talked through how to do it. I watched a few videos then we figured what side to do the Epley on and it was like a miracle cure. \n\nThis is a great video about the Epley maneuver at home. \n\nNote that the dix hall pike is just position 1 of the Epley maneuver. \n\nIf you think it is the right ear. Try the right side first. If you get no dizziness/nystagmus then do not continue with the procedure and retry it on the left. \n\nThere are 3 types of nystagmus to watch out for. Strictly left and right (no up or down motion). Tortinal (left and right with a vertical component. Sometimes like a figure 8, sometime left right with downbeat, which from your position means your eyes are going left and right and in the middle you are looking at the ceiling) or up-down. \n\nThose dictate which maneuver to do to fix it. Thank you for the information. Let us know if you try it. I know how frustrating it is to not see a doctor and have them be worth anything. But you need to catch it while it is happening. \n\nFollowing the instructions in the video will help you diagnose what is going on and at least give you more info with the doctor for next discussions. Today\u2019s BPPV attack is lessened at this point, but I am going to save that video for future attacks.", "Looking for reassurance when it comes to the maneuvers My doctor diagnosed my with severe bouts of BPPV (many family members have it) but I also have a panic disorder that flares up with every episode. Meclizine and the occasional valium has of course been my go-to thanks to an understanding doctor but I want that last to be a last resort (or hopefully meds never needed again\n\nCould someone who has successfully performed the maneuvers (specifically interested in the half-somersault) reassure me of thier effectiveness? I can handle the wooziness and nausea but the spinning... does the spinning stop after the maneuver is properly performed a few times? Has anxiety played a role in your BPPV? Thank you fellow BPPV people.", "ENT thinks it is BPPV but I am not so sure A month ago, I had few episodes of vertigo in which for 10 seconds I feel like I am like falling or fainting but I am not moving. And it is not brought about by changes in neck position\u2014it usually happens when I am still for some time. I get nauseated and then the attack comes and I can usually shake it off I felt off balance for a week before the first vertigo attack and also was left feeling off balance after the attacks. Then after a week of those symptoms I got a intense headache that lasted a week and landed me in ER. I also went to see vestibular PT. I had negative Dix-hallpike test but she said she thinks I had BPPV that resolved and not have a headache because I was sleeping upright (I do have a history of neck issues). Now today I finally had ENT appointment (they were very busy so could not get in sooner). Hearing test was fine. When I saw an actual ENT he said he will not do any tests because my last vertigo attack was 3 weeks ago and they are likely going to be negative like it was with vestibular PT but he thinks it is BPPV. I kept explaining how it is not brought up by any head movement. So I come home from the doctor and I have barbecue in my backyard with my friends. I am sitting down talking to my friend \u2014not moving and then it happened. It was the worst I ever felt. This one lasted a full minute. I just felt like I was either like falling or spinning or fainting. I cannot exactly describe it. It came out of nowhere because it was not accompanied by nausea. \nI am going to call ENT tomorrow and get him to see me again. Please please guide me, what do you think? Should I push for more testing? What kind? Any questions I should be asking him? I am so scared and confused by all of this. Maybe vestibular migraine?  Have you looked on the veda website?  They have a lot of good info on there.  You will figure it out hang in there! Push for Dix-Hallpike; I am surprised he did not do this, but only based on how frequently mine DID do it, to MAKE SURE it was resolving.\n\nYou mention sitting still. How active are you? Because BPPV has been linked to sedentary behavior and often people on bed rest end up with it. Yes, I thought maybe it would be a vestibular migraine but he was adamant headache was unrelated to my vertigo. I just felt like he wanted to get to the next patient lol he did not do any tests. So I am in my late 20s. I would say I am lightly active. I do have a very sedentary job but I also have dogs so I walk, do chores, exercise sometimes etc. I hate when that happens. Advocate for yourself!  \u263a\ufe0f Insist on the DH if you really want it or find another doc if possible (though I know sometimes that is not possible). \n\nJust because most people seem to resolve in three weeks does not mean everyone will; maybe you are an outlier like some of us. My doctor told me I would be fine in three weeks the first time I saw him, too\u2026 it took several appointments. Good luck! Be persistent if you think there is something else going on, especially if there is pain. It could be vestibular migraine as someone else suggested (You do not nessesarily have to have the pain part every time for it to be migraine related either) but it could be some other issue as well, and it is good to rule things out. Honestly, you sound a lot like me! My PT says I do not have BPPV based on the Dix Hallpike she did on me. She feels I damaged my vestibular system somehow (possibly labyrinthitis, she said also because I have a history of migraines that I could have developed vestibular migraines which caused damage). I am going to be doing more tests with her on Friday and then getting a treatment plan. I have also had an increase in my migraines, so I am probably going to do Nurx or Cove and try to get back on preventative meds again and see if that helps. Like you, I had a week-long super intense migraine that was different than my usual ones. It is all very weird, but I am sure we will find a diagnosis. Reach out if you ever want to talk about it! \ud83e\udd70 Thank you for sharing your experience! Do you mind sharing how are your vertigo episodes? Are they short attacks of intense vertigo? I am also suspecting it may be vestibular migraine but my ENT keeps beating on BPPV even though I keep testing negative for jt. Vestibular PT kind of dismissed me after all the BPPV maneuvers were negative. What kind of exercises are you doing? Of course! So it is a really long story, but I will try to be concise! I have always had some balance issues off and on, but it was not anything that really affected my life that much. Then about 5 weeks ago, I had some vertigo one night. It was gone by morning, and I was like, okay whatever. But a few days later, I went into a grocery store and almost blacked out. I just felt so overwhelmed and off balance. It kept happening each time I would go into a store, and then it was happening when I would just walk outside. This progressed to sort of a constant feeling of being off balance/on a rocking boat. I have not had the really intense vertigo since that one night, or I get the super \"going to black out\" feeling if I go for a walk or go into a store, basically. Just the constant sense of being off balance for the most part. \n\nOf note, I do have a history of migraines, but right after the vertigo attack, I had a really bad headache in my temple for like a week that would not go away no matter what I did. I have not been given exercises yet, but my PT is going to run a few more tests on me Friday and then make up a plan for me! \n\nAbout vestibular migraine: I am still learning about it, but I keep reading about how if you have a history of motion sickness, a history of migraines, are female, or have a family history of migraines/dizziness, then you are at a huge risk of having vestibular migraines at some point in your life. I fit all of those things (yay) and the more I think about it, the more I can sort of trace my increase in migraines over the past few years + my increase in feeling off balance at times (not as badly as now, but definitely some noticeable stuff I did pick up on over the years). Do you have a Fyzical balance center near you? That is where I am going and they seem to be really open to treating lots of different things, not just BPPV. The PT said that since she does not think I have BPPV, I will probably end up doing some optokinetic exercises and such to basically help my eyes and brain match up more. (I found them on ( who has a list of providers) \n\nOne more little sidenote (sorry!): I was really convinced I had binocular vision dysfunction for a bit, and I did go to an optometrist who said I am fine, but if all else fails, I am going to find a specialist who can test me for that too. I matched up with a lot of the symptoms (headaches, motion sickness, feeling overwhelmed/off balance in stores or outside, etc). Sorry for all the info! Let me know if you have questions or want more info on anything, or if you just want to talk! Things will be okay. There are multiple treatment venues to pursue, even without a firm diagnosis. &lt;3", "Flying with BPPV I am going on vacation and where I am going is a 2 hour flight so I am wondering is it safe to fly with BPPV? Will it make it worse or improve or even affect it at all? I avoided flying for about 2 years because I was so worried about this. I just took two 3-hour flights back in late July and was not bothered at all. I realized I had a problem after a flight, when I tried to go down the ramp after we landed, and nearly fell over from disorientation. However, I have flown dozens of times since then. Just pack a few air sickness bags, and hope for a smooth flight. I have not had any problems since that first one related to air travel, and hopefully, neither should you! I have BPPV in only one ear, and I just avoid lying on that side. I have not had any problems flying. Dramamine (makes you very sleepy) one of those neck pillows for the sleep and ear plugs on with take off and landing but I normally keep them on the whole flight. Also ask for ginger ale when you get a drink. \n\nHave fun! What do you mean you HAVE BPPV? You are currently experiencing vertigo? Or you had it in the past?\n\nDo not fly if you have any cold or sinus or ear infection.\n\nConstantly relieve the pressure by chewing gum, drinking or popping your ears.\n\nPersonally, I would not wear ear plugs. I would just not allow the pressure in the ears to build up significantly. Well I have been experiencing vertigo for the past week or so. It has got a lot better but I do keep feeling it in day to day life. I just worry because I am only 16 and I have never had anything like this persistent before This. Take meclizine. Vertigo is not necessarily BPPV. If you  are experiencing  vertigo, visit a balance center and get diagnosed properly. I have been diagnosed with BPPV over a month ago so it is definitely that", "vision changes after vertigo I was diagnosed with bppv by my doctor and have had it for the past week. I woke up today and the dizzy sensation has stopped but I still feel off balance and my vision does not seem as good as before when looking long distance. Is this just my body adjusting to the lack of vertigo? You could still be experiencing the nystagmus associated with the vertigo episodes. Before you may not have noticed it due to the dizzyness, but now you are. My doctor told me to wait a few days for things to settle down, and if lingering symptoms like this do not go away to go back to the doctor at that point to figure out what is up I think you are right. When I got diagnosed he tested me for nystagmus and I had it at the time but probably have not noticed it until now. I am just glad the dizziness has finally gone I always felt after an Epley maneuver provoking the vertigo and nystagmus, that my eyes were a bit blurrier. It was like my body was exhausted from the intense vertigo and just could not pull itself back together to focus as well as it should.  Or, lingering nystagmus (as mentioned).  BPPV really does a number on the body.  It should go away (get better) in time though. There are eye stabilizing exercises you can do that involve taping letters to the wall or using your fingers. I am not sure exactly what they are called but a vestibular therapist could work with you on that! Maybe try googling eye stabilizing exercises. My VT is making me do one with my fingers atm. Yes! I had a bunch of these exercises. It was for gaze instability. So maybe Google gaze stabilization exercises.", "Can alcohol trigger BPPV? I had BPPV once briefly a half-dozen years ago, treated by my physician with Epley and Claritin. \n\nAbout five days ago, I had more to drink one night than usual (probably four or five standard drinks).  The next day, I had strong BPPV symptoms when lying down and some intermittent mild dizziness when walking around (did not otherwise feel sick or hung over).  The other possible correlate was that my kid was sick two days before, so I figured it could be either alcohol or a virus affecting my inner ear.\n\nNeither waiting nor taking a Claritin D made it go away over the next few days, so yesterday I did a home Epley three times (an hour or two apart each time).  I felt strong vertigo while doing it the first time, just a hint of vertigo the second time and nothing the third time.  No more vertigo when walking around or lying down.\n\nSo, now I am curious if alcohol can trigger a BPPV event, or if the timing was co-incidental?", "Vertigo or not? Hello everyone,\n\nFor the past 5 months I have been experiencing severe vertigo (I think). The reason I say I think is because I am not experiencing the typical \u201croom spinning sensation\u201d at all, but rather a falling backwards sensation that has been accompanied with severe lightheaded-ness and dizziness. It gets more severe when I am sitting down and more severe when I am lying down in bed. This has been happening all day long every single day for the past five months non stop. My doctor prescribed me Meclizine which I was hesitant to try at first because I typically have anxiety due to the side effects I have been reading online. I eventually gave in and took the Meclizine for about two nights in a row but wow did it make me feel like a literal ZOMBIE. It did help the lightheaded ness and dizziness go away but not the falling backwards feeling I have all day long. Does anyone have any recommendations on which medication helped you most? Also, would you consider my symptoms to be BPPV or something else? It is weird because I would not say I get any \u201cepisodes.\u201d It is constantly there every single day all day long and does not stop. Hi! I have been having the exact same thing as you for months now. It feels like my head is being pulled backwards every few seconds and is not triggered by anything particular and lasts all day.  My doctor thinks it is labyrinthitis and gave me some tablets which really helped but it came back and I am on them again ( I cannot remember the name but I will post it on here later). Maybe yours could be labyrinthitis too?  Thanks for your input! I do suspect it may be labyrinthitis, I went to the ENT but they suggested I do physical vestibular therapy rather than run some tests which I am angry about. I feel like they should have done those tests since I have been feeling like this for almost 6 months now. Did yours get worse when you were lying flat? Also plss if you can find the name of the tablets I am very desperate at this point. Yes most of the time I do not notice it when I am moving about but when I get into bed at night or sit down I can feel it. I wish I could get tests done too since I am so anxious about it but oh well They are prochlorperazine tablets, they take a few days to work but get rid of it! Omg you are a life saver, going to talk to my doctor about getting that. Did you have any side effects? No literally no side effects what so ever!", "After I get episodes of bppv my body till feels like It is moving and my arms and legs will feel very twitch as well. I have really bad tmj headaches and they make me dizzy and then I will get bppv in certain positions really badly that sometimes will wake me up from the dead of sleep. But after the bppv I get these feelings of motion when I am not really moving and my arms and legs become very twitchy. Can bppv trigger restless leg syndrome? Not sure about the syndrome, but anxiety is normal and anxiety can create all sorts of odd / horrible feelings. The rocking / motion feeling is \u201cnormal\u201d but you need to treat the BPPV... lots of good info in this sub for you to read. I have tmj to and someone told me tmj can cause bppv like symptoms without having the crystals loose. I did the epley maunver a couple times at home and I think it helped get rid of the rocking motion feeling Try doing some TMJ exercises and take ibuprofen/Advil to relieve the inflammation. 1-2 Advil 4 times a day helped relieve mine. As far as the BPPV goes I would give it a week and try not to worry. The anxiety makes it worse trust me. I had symptoms for months afterwards but it gets better. If epley triggers it then keep doing it to speed up the process. I am also on Zoloft right now and it is suppose to help the anxiety As someone who has been on and off antidepressants- I would highly recommend dropping the drugs and doing CBT instead. had the same weird feeling on legs and arms,plus a bobbing/swaying sensation that starts whenever i get anxious or whenever i look at a screen.3.5 months after the initial vertigo,90% of dizziness is gone,90% of balance loss sensation is gone,but that small 5-10% is enough to flare up anxiety attacks.", "Tilting feeling? Is it normal for residual dizziness to have this tilting feeling like my head/body is leaning or falling towards one direction? I had right ear BPPV and I am feeling this dizziness where it looks like my head is falling towards my right when I do things like move my head slightly right to look at something NAD, but doesnt sound like it.\n\nIs the feeling only when you move your head horizontally or even when you are stationary (say with eyes closed)? I can feel super tiny, slight dizziness sitting down with my eyes closed but it is mainly sitting (especially slouched) and turning my head slightly to the sides or sometimes also standing and turning my head or moving by body You could try doing the ( and see how you feel? Try moving your head slowly in those positions (faster movements trigger the semicircular canals as opposed to just the otolithic organs). \n\nIf this doesnt trigger anything, try moving your head a little bit faster horizontally (basically know you are trying to engage the semicircular canals, as they are the ones responsible with vestibular input past a certain speed). \n\nBasically you are trying to identify exactly when and how the feeling is triggered. I tried the Dix-Hallpike twice now on my right ear and once on my left but all I felt was some of the same dizziness with no spinning. \n\nI get this dizzy feeling when lying in bed too in all directions but it is worse on my right", "Diagnosed today, had epley but I think it is even worse now? Hi guys, I have have vertigo that occurred when laying down for the past week, and turning on my left side was a nightmare. I went to an ENT this morning who diagnosed me with BPPV and performed the Epley maneuver on me. He said not to move my head for the rest of the day, but the tiny bit my head has moved has made me think it is even worse now. Before only laying down would send me spinning, but the couple tiny movements I have made today have already got me feeling the vertigo come on again. Will I just be better when I wake up tomorrow, or is it possible it just did not work on me? I think any maneuvre is supposed to clear up the spinning. There may be residual nausea, however. \n\nYou may need to repeat OR it is the wrong maneuvre for you. I am not a doctor but this is based on my year of experience dealing with many a physio.\n\n I write the same thing all over this sub. If you get BPPV, do not go to any ENT. Some ENTs do not see BPPV very often, but might not want to say this.\n\nThe first ENT I went to did the RIGHT thing and said \"I think you have BPPV but I am not really specialized enough to handle this. I have a colleague in this clinic who spent a year in a vestibular center, I suggest you see her\". Not every ENT is going to do this.\n\nBottom line: If your BPPV is not better tomorrow, make an appointment at a balance center, or find an ENT who says he specializes in vestibular disorders.  Most major cities will have them. He did say I might need to do it again so if I am not feeling better in the morning I will try doing it one more time. If that does not work, there is a balance center in my city. I will just have to make sure my health insurance is accepted there. It is so miserable I just want it to go back to normal. Before the maneuver I could at least move about and turn my head while standing, but since I have been getting some vertigo even just turning my head left and right. I will try it again tomorrow and see if it helps. I know it is miserable. When it happened to me, I was on a vacation. There was really nothing I could do but ride it out for a week until I returned home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut you write that it happens to you when you are in bed and turn your head. Same thing with me. When I was walking around there were no symptoms at all. I just tried as much as I could to keep my head still when lying in bed. Is this the same for you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf your insurance does not cover the balance center I would contact them and explain that you have BPPV, your first ENT was not able to cure you and you want to see a specialist in vestibular disorders. Ask them for recommendations of a BPPV specialist. If they can not find one, chances are they will make an exception and pay for the balance center. Do not take no for an answer. So to update, now that it is been over a day since the epley maneuver, I can actually lay down on the affected side and not get vertigo. Yay! However I am still having balance issues when moving my head generally, although less severe than before. If it does not clear up in a week or so I will make another appointment. My experience?? When I had the Epley done, everything resolved in a day. If your vertigo was caused by the crystals migrating into the vestibular canals, and it appears that it was at least partially, not much is going to change in a week. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wonder if you are one of those rare birds who had crystals migrating into more than one of the vestibular canals? Maybe you need another type of Epley maneuver? First the should do dix halpike test, they wat to see which way your eyes are moving to see what canal is your issue. Eply is only for one area, different maneuvers for different canals. Anecdotally, I feel mine reoccurs more readily if I sleep on the affected side. How are you feeling now ? Much better! I have been mostly vertigo free. I get some bouts now and then, but nothing like it was before. When I start to get even a little bit of vertigo, I do the epley maneuver at home in my bed, and by the next day I am usually better. Glad to hear. Did you end up going to vestibular therapy for balance? Or just the epley manuever ?  Just the epley maneuver Thank you all after reading about the epley maneuver on here I definitely feel like I have a better understanding of what is going on along with some side effects I have been dealing with like depression and anxiety that I have never really had before in my life. Going to contact my doctor and ask for referral to an ear doctor. This all started in the middle of me taking antidepressants which only made me worse (clearly not depressed normally) I chalked the dizziness up to the antidepressant but after a while of being off of it things seem like they have only gotten a little worse definitely looking forward to an experienced doctor has to say about this", "Potentially BPPV, but doctor says I am fine It all started on Thursday night. I was under an immense amount of stress for 3 months straight, and more stress in that particular week. My sleep schedule had been irregular, but generally I try to get some sleep. Around Thursday night, all of a sudden, after I was lying down, my head started spinning. I was experiencing vertigo. It got to the point that when I went to the kitchen to put some dishes away, the room felt like it was spinning and I could not stand.\n\nI have no headaches. I do not *feel* tired, but my body is tired. I have loss of appetite sometimes, and I sometimes feel like fainting and I occasionally get double vision if I feel tired. At church this past Sunday I had difficulty keeping my eyes locked on the ceremony, it felt like my eyes kept moving. Something just does not feel right. I do not feel normal.\n\nI cannot concentrate on any tasks. It got so terrible that on the following Friday (after that Thursday night), when I went to work, I could not even be bothered. I arrived at work, stared blankly at everything, my movements were not the same, and I left for home.\n\nIf it helps, I do stretch my neck sometimes because it feels stiff. I am starting to wonder if that is the cause. I do not have any headaches, just feeling of imbalance, cannot focus, and occasionally feeling like fainting, or vertigo.\n\nI desperately want to see a neurologist but my doctor believes I am fine. I have another appointment today. You have double vision on occasion? If I am particularly tired I will feel like an object moved, or swayed. BPPV can often be diagnosed by tracking eye movements while having a patient do the Epley maneuver, I believe that is actually what the first position of the maneuver is for. You might be able to find an ENT who has experience with BPPV, I do not think all general practitioners know a lot about it. Ok that is not double vision, which is good. Bppv effects can last weeks. You dont need a neurologist. Google Brandt-daroff and do those exercises 5x a day for a couple of weeks. You will be ok. Do not freak out. Happened to me last year. For what it is worth, this sounds similar to the episode I had back in September. I was undergoing a TON of stress leading up to when it happened (my apartment just flooded, landlords are shitheads, work was busy) and I am still unsure if that was the root cause of my ongoing issues. Hm possibly. I would find a ENT, PT or go to a balance center to have them test for BPPV.  In the meantime, I would get a lot of sleep and rest. As others have suggested - go see a PT that specializes in balance issues.  It sounds like a crystal fell down into the wrong location and needs to be removed by positional maneuvering of your head \\. I have to mention that I actually *shook* my body greatly past Thursday night (the night when the dizziness came about) because I was so cold (I was being lazy and had not put on clothes right after taking a shower), and I am starting to suspect that shaking caused it. It all happened in that timespan.", "Why is this happening to me? On wednesday, I woke up slightly dizzy, as if I was being pulled in the direction I turned my head. As the day went on it got progressively worse till I could not walk straight and was vomiting. The emergency room treated me like I was a drug addict and were of no help (I do not do drugs). Finally, I visited my regular doctor and he immediately diagnosed me with BPPV. \n\nI tried the epley maneuver and either I am doing it wrong or it did not help. I am miserable. I have not gotten out of bed since then. I dont understand what triggered this and I am scared I will be like this for the rest of my life. There are other maneuvers you can try. Do a quick search. I disagree. Do not do this by yourself. Find a \"balance center\". Get an experienced expert to diagnose you and find the proper maneuver to do. Do not do the Epley or any other maneuver by yourself. First, you need to know which of your vestibular canals are involved. Then you need to pick the correct maneuver to remove the crystal from that specific canal.  Most physicians or therapists are not properly trained to help you. Google \"balance center\" in your closest city. Stupid question but I tend to wear ear plugs to bed. Is there a chance this condition was triggered by that? Not a stupid question. It is possible that the changing pressure in your ear caused the crystal to migrate. My BPPV started one day after I took a flight. I think that the changing pressure from the airplane may have caused my crystal to migrate. I have not seen any scientific discussion of that. But as far as I know there is not much research  about BPPV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI googled your question and came up with this article on the (\n\nSo, I think your question could be very relevant. I would certainly discuss it with an expert on the subject. Weird but I was also wearing ear plugs at work for a few months to protect me from noise when I got my first attack. Been having balance issues for 2+ years and spoken about plugs to the doctor but they said there should not be a link. &gt; I am scared I will be like this for the rest of my life.\n\nIf you say this to someone who has never had BPPV they will say things like \"It cannot be that bad\", or \"I have had a massive hangover once and the room was spinning.\" They have **no** idea just how debilitating and demoralizing it really is. \"Horrifying\" is a word that a friend used.\n\nBut it can get better. /u/RehaDesign's suggestion of a balance center is good but there might not be one nearby. It is probably easier to find a physical therapist who has experience with balance issues. Get into see them and you will be treated correctly. A warning: determining which ear and canal the problem is in is horrible as is a correct set of Epley (or related) maneuvers. However, you will feel better when it is finished. \n\nGood luck. Wow. Are you still wearing ear plugs? Yes I do, for sound sensitivity from other issues. You might want to change to something else. ( for example", "Mild BPPV, mild headache, mild anxiety and constant mild panic-attack symptoms Hello everyone, \n\nI am a 25-year-old male, I do not usually post on Reddit, I am more of a lurker but this time I need some consoling.\n\nWell, to get to the point, two months ago I had my first BPPV attack. I was the worst 24 hours of my life. I at uni, setting in the class when I noticed everything was spinning lightly, and I was sleepy at that time, so I thought of taking a nap in class during the break time. Little did I know, I soon as I tilted my head down and everything went spinning around endlessly, I ask classmates for help, the helped me go to the med's office. I throw up constantly, and they ordered a taxi to take me home, the spinning lasted all day and did not stop so did the throwing up. I threw up that day until I felt that my organs are coming out. \n\nI could not move out of bed the next day and barely managed to force myself to get checked, the doc ruled out that there was nothing alarming and this is BPPV. He did the epley  maneuver, and asked me to keep my head steady, avoid sudden movements and sleep on my right side. He advised taking Magnesium supplements and some anti-nausea medicine. \n\n\nDays went by, I started noticing my head is feeling less and less light and floaty. Everything was back to normal. I started forgetting about it. \n\n4 Days ago, I woke up in the middle of the night. I found myself sleeping on my left side (I avoided doing that since the doc visit), no problem I told myself, I turned to sleep on my right side and BOOM, vertigo!\n\nIt was very mild lasted for half a minute, and although I was alarmed, I slept no more than a minute later.\n\nNext day and the following, and the next... for the next 4 days, up to this moment, my heads feels floaty. It is as if walls are moving but then they are not. So subtle I feel like it is not there, but it is. This is accompanied by a very mild headache, especially the left half of my head and face feels heavier. It is also so minor one could ignore it, but I cannot, I feel like hitting my skull with a hammer to get rid of it. I also cannot help but feel anxious all day and my heart beats irregularly and first moments of sleep are difficult, and I have minor panic attacks when I sleep and when I wake up, I am guess that is when I notice the vertigo the most, and it reminds me of the first time it happened and how scared I was. \n\n\nTL;DR\n25yr old, having a second attack of bppv and it is so minor but accompanied by minor headache and anxiety and the whole package is not fun. and it does not seem to go away. From what I understand, the brain simply does not like being dizzy. So your anxiety and panic could just be a product of the vertigo. I am only speaking from my own experience. I was at the ENT and the dr kept tipping me back to show the student dr how my eyes were moving around. When they left, my heart was racing, I could not slow my breathing and I felt just sheer panic. I did not understand what had happened for a long time. I think my brain just could not handle the dizziness. \nHave you tried dimenhydrinate? I take that that as well as magnesium before bed. Maybe you could have someone do eply again? I also think yoga helps tremendously. \nI hope you start feeling better soon. Take care. It is normal to have residual dizziness after bppv.  You may need to do the epley again if you have vertigo.  The dizziness ess left behind should resolve.  You can go to physical therapist for it if it lasts more than a couple weeks.  Hope you feel better! It is just frustrating that the anxiety seems to happen on its own. Like, i am well aware of my condition and know tgat it is not endangering or very serious. But this thought could not help with the anxiety.\n\nI will try getting magnesium, I read that it helps with sleep as well. Maybe some vitamin D. And I decided to check with rge physicist again I will inquire about dimenhydrinate then.\n\n\nI am doing the maneuver at home, for my left side. But I only feel a strong vertigo when I lay on my right side with my head looking at the floor. I stay like that until it stops and slowly get up. I have been doing it once a day but I read that it should be done 3 time. I just hope I am not not doing it wrong. I have the exact same thing. The floatyness, the walls moving, anxiety symptoms, vision problems, derealisation. The whole nine yards.", "New to BPPV A few nights ago I woke up during the night to turn over and felt spinning for a good 10 seconds. The next night it happened a few more times. Seems to happen mainly when I turn over in bed and does not last for too long. Since then I will sometimes feel a little lightheaded during the day but nothing bad. Last night I slept on my back and did not have any episodes. I have not been to the doctor yet but I believe it is BPPV. I had my gallbladder removed a few weeks ago and slept on my back for almost 2 weeks so that may have been the cause or maybe stress. I start my new job on Monday so I am a little worried about how it will affect me at work. Any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated as it is given me some extra anxiety. Welcome!\n\nA good starting place for understanding and treating BPPV is our (\n\nOther than that, feel free to await some other responses! Thank you! Is it normal to feel foggy headed or headachey during the day as well? Otherwise all I feel is the vertigo sometimes when I turn over at night. There could be different things going on--the mechanical issue of BPPV, an electrical issue with your nerves, a biological issue with infection, a pharmacological issue with medication, etc. It would be best to check with a doctor, vestibular physiotherapist, ENT, etc. as they would be able to help you identify the causes of your symptoms. Welcome to the BPPV community. \n\nI had BPPV about a month and a half ago and it lasted 2 weeks. I would recommend seeing a Physical Therapist, they seem to be the most trained professionals when it comes to vertigo. They will do a Dix Hallpike test on you to confirm BPPV. Once they confirm BPPV they will do a head maneuver on you to put the crystals that have dislodged from your inner ear back to their right place. \n\nI would suggest getting a diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible to lessen any residual dizziness that might come after the vertigo is gone. I have had residual dizziness for 3 weeks now. I am not a doctor but seeing a PT really helped me. And yes, lightheadedness comes with BPPV. Hope you feel better soon! Thank you for your response! So its normal to feel headachey and foggy headed as well? Yes. Totally normal and probably to be expected.", "do not oversleep got my first case of BPPV in maybe a year, or at least 8+ months. but like the first time and few other times it happened, it was after a night I went to sleep early (usually go to bed late) and then slept in the next morning. Eh correlation doesnt equal causation. What is possibly more likely, based on studies, is that sleep deprivation can cause/trigger BPPV symptoms. So if you are oversleeping due to sleep deprivation on other nights, that might explain it better than just sleeping too much. *However* it is my understanding that sleeping with poor neck support could trigger BPPV, so I suppose oversleeping with only one light pillow (or none) can lead to BPPV later in the day\n\nEdit: I suppose the best way to tell is for researchers to try to monitor oversleeping vs normal amounts and control for sleep deprivation I have had the opposite effects really, once in a blue moon when I manage to get more than 8 hours of sleep I feel great and never have any sort of dizziness through the day but the times i have had the worst cases of BPPV, i have also had the worst sleep.\n\nCan also confirm that a bad posture and sleeping position will trigger BPPV, so invest in good pillows and try to improve your posture during the day if you do office work. i have noticed the same correlation. Long time sleeping and suddenly the BPPV is back. My theory is that it takes time for the crystals to migrate out of place. For me doing the Epley maneuver everyday for a week or so I can get rid of it. I hate feeling dizzy! I am sure it is different for everyone but I am with you on this. The 2nd time I got an attack was after I went to the chiropractor (after car accident) and told them I had vertigo &amp; they were wanting to do this activity where I lay my head on a hard small pillow, big enough to fit your neck, and slightly hang my head over it lying down. I am not sure if it was the angle at which my head was hanging (because that can sometimes trigger if crystals are moving/already moved in the ear), but the next day I got an attack. I am not sure if BPPV is triggered by sleep in the sense that the more you sleep the higher the chance you get BPPV, but it may be due to how you are sleeping (i.e. head tilted, sleeping on side, etc). I have my head propped up on both sides with a pillow underneath my main pillow so that I do not end up hanging my head over on either side. It is just a habit I have formed since I have had my first attack a few years back. Lying down for long periods positioned on your back has been mentioned in many of the articles I have researched online - so lying down, allowing the calcium crystals to move into your ear's semicircular canals, may be causing or contributing to the issue. I have found some small relief by performing the following exercises:\n\n* (\n* (\n* (\n* ( Interesting suggestion about neck support. \n\nI feel that every time I have had BPPV I had woken up thinking, my neck feels trashed... I then roll over and BANG! \n\nBPPV...\n\nHmmmm \ud83e\udd14 No repeat of BPPV since changing your head position on the pillow? Oh yeah very interesting, also I was surprised by the other comments. I really thought I was an outlier as well yeah that is more what I meant. not sleeping for long periods, but the act of lying down for extended hours probably messes you up moreso Well, changing head position on pillow doesnt necessarily prevent it completey because any random movement at any given time cud suddenly trigger it... But id say the propping up of pillows has been helpful to manage because sometimes I feel faint dizziness &amp; know to turn my head the other way.", "24 y/o Male with a lot of dizzy questions!

Is this normal for BPPV? \n\nThank you! After my episode, my residual dizziness made me fatigued as well. I think it is possibly mental exhaustion from your vestibular system trying to get back into sync with everything. Yep Yes. I am so very tired after suffering a prolonged bout of vertigo. \n\nIt truly is the worst. Absolutely,  it knocks me out pretty hard myself. Like others are saying, it is probably because your brain is working hard to reorient yourself. Yep. Yes. I am not sure if it is mental from dealing with the vertigo or physical from the body trying to compensate but I needed a nap pretty much every day when I had it. Thank you all for the replies! That makes total sense :) My residual dizziness lasts forever as well as fatigue. In fact I have not had a full blown episode in a month and I am still feeling woozy \ud83e\udd7a", "I have had BPPV for one and a half years, still ongoing. Help? I am a 25 year old female who started experiencing vertigo back in June 2018. Since then, it has never gone away. I feel some spinning when I get up in the morning, if I look up or down for too long, if I move my head quickly, sometimes even if I just lean back on my chair too quickly, when I lie down at night, etc. The spinning is not as severe anymore as it was back then, but it is still there. I cannot do things like get my eyebrows threaded without feeling vertigo, fall onto a bed in the middle of the day, headbang at raves, etc you get my point. \n\nWhen I checked with my doctor, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist, they all told me I have BPPV and said my ears look okay. My doctor and ENT specialist have both also done the Epley maneuver on me, just for it to still persist. I have also tried to have my mom help me with the maneuver, but it still never went away. I do not know if I am not doing it at the right angle or if the crystals in my ear move again because I am lying down at night while sleeping or what. \n\nI am looking for advice on how to get rid of this because it is extremely bothersome. Up your intake of vitamin d (a multi vitamin for example) would be a good start I think.\n\nBest of luck xxx I do not have a solution just sharing that i am in the same boat, i am 2.5yrs in. Your symptoms sound virtually identical to mine (M33). I have been sleeping at a ~45 degree angle on a mechanical bed and that has helped control the seriousness of the spinning, but it never really goes away, it is ever present.\n\nI have done a bunch of tests and they found absolutely nothing in CT scan, EEG, etc. Only VNG found both my ears triggered spinning so they called it atypical BPPV. But my experienced ENT said it is not BPPV, that is just an umbrella term they use.\n\nMy neurologist suggested going to the local university hospital as they handle outlier cases. I have an appt later this month, but not super hopeful unless there is a miracle. I am on year 8. If you figure it out, I would love to know your trick! \"headbang at raves, etc\" Is this serious? Are you aware that head trauma is thought to be a cause of BPPV? \n\n( I have never been to a rave lol I was just using an example. Head banging is not a term for banging your head on something though. It is just when you move your head up and down sort of aggressively to match the beat of a song \"move your head up and down sort of aggressively to match the beat of a song\"...even that is a bad idea if you have had BPPV. When  I had it (it was only  for a week), I basically moved my  head as little as possible. My trigger was when I was lying in bed and moved my head to either side, the room would spin violently. So, I just did not do it. After getting medical help, my problem resolved. But I know that once you have had BPPV, it can come back pretty easily. So, I try to avoid anything that would do that. I am sorry you are going through this. I had BPPV for 3 weeks until I saw a physical therapist who did a few different maneuvers on me and cleared it up almost 100% after the first visit. I would recommend seeing a PT with experience ASAP. \nI am my case, I struggled with BPPV without doing any maneuvers ( well I tried after the ENT doctor gave me a print out of the Epley to do at home, but turns out that was not the right one for me so it only made me feel worse). I tried to wait it out but it seemed to just linger so I finally saw a trained professional and I cannot recommend that enough. I still have slight unsteadiness but I think that is my vestibular system getting back into sync without a crystal messing things up. Lol\nHope this helps, and best wishes on a speedy recovery. xx any idea how i can get a referral to see a PT? because i have been to the ENT doctor already and my physician referred me to them for the second time when i do not think that is going to be any help. do you think i can ask the ENT specialist to see a physical therapist? Yeah I know that is bad if you have BPPV which is why I never do it, but even something like sit ups I am avoiding because of BPPV. \n\nWhat kind of medical help did you get to resolve it? Yes the ENT should be able to send you a referral. \n\nIn my case, I do not have the best insurance and it is cheaper for me to self pay. So I just called my local PT facility and asked for an appointment and told them I was self pay. For me, it was $90. First, I went to an ENT. He told he that he did not have experience with BPPV and referred me to a colleuge of his who worked in a vestibular clinic. I went to her and she diagnosed me properly and then did the Eply maneuver with me. She sent me home  with instructions on how to do it myself at home. I did it 3 times that day and by the evening, I tried to trigger my BPPV and it was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy recommendation is to do the same thing. Do not go to just any ENT, go to an ENT with lots of experience with BPPV. Or find a balance center. Most ENTs are like the first guy that I visited. They do not have much experience. But most will not admit this. Have had ongoing issues with BPPV for coming up on 30 years. My attacks often start with moving in bed so I invested in the Med Cline GERD pillow. Has improved my dizziness recovery after EPLeY. I also find the mandibular tapping to help me more.\nThis time of year is the worst for me. I am still being ruled out for Menere\u2019s disease. My ears look fine but I still have that I was on a boat all day feeling. I have twice been diagnosed with Labrynthitis after a bout of BPPV too.  Good luck. Oh and The longest between attacks was 9 years.", "Vestibular Migraine or residual dizziness or BPPV So I am having these symptoms, headache, Dizziness, fatigue, unsteadiness, lightheadedness. I have had this for about 7 weeks and I am starting to get a little bit better. The last week I have had headaches on the left temple of my forehead. At first I was diagnosed with BPV in a urgent care clinic. I then thought it was residual dizziness and I am not sure if it is a migraine or residual dizziness This matches my symptoms. My GP says cervical dizziness/headaches, and the neurologist I saw waved that away and said it was PPPD. They both started with a few episodes of BPPV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think it is both because 1) certain head moves trigger dizziness (it corrects itself right after I go back to 'good' position) and 2) because eye movements (horizontal, left specifically) sometimes and neon lights almost always near murder me.  We went grocery shopping for holidays last night, and that meant 4 stores in 2 hours. I can usually tolerate a quick visit to 1, but 4 in a row near killed me. As soon I was out and in pleasant semi-darkness of the evening, I was instantly 90% better. Ugh. For me, I was taking a medication that gave me a allergic reaction that was dizziness/vertigo and that fun stuff. After I was off the medication I was still dizzy and got a little better but still was vertigo/dizzy mode Then it will likely just go away as the medication effect wears out, hopefully! Some meds and allergies, even excessive water retention, can impact vestibular system and make you wobbly. Not sure it would include headaches, tho. The medication has been out of my system for 6 weeks. I have similar symptoms, although I was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis. Neurologist and Vestibular PT ruled out BPPV. \n\nThe PT is recommending me to do Gaze Stabilization exercises for motion of the head. This sounds similar to you because supermarkets set me off with the constant motion and turning back and forth. \n\nI am not a doctor but hopefully this helps!", "why????? hi guys, this will probably be a long post. i am a 18 yo female. i have been having bppv episodes for about 3 years now. maybe unrelated, but it all started a few days after getting put on birth control for the first time. at first, they would only happen every 3 months or so, but now it is increased to once every month and i have tried everything. every maneuver, it just does not seem to do anything.\n\ni will have the spins, nystagmus, and nausea for a minute or so then feel off for the rest of the day/night.\nbut the thing is, it does not seem to only be triggered by certain head movements. sometimes it happens with sitting up, and sometimes i will just be lying on my side and it hits me. it seems to happen on both sides, but i have this odd buzzing noise in my left ear. i told my doctor about it and she checked for nystagmus but did not notice any. i just do not understand. why is it not resolving? \n\ni have also been taking vitamin d supplements and it is seemed to help a little bit. any advice is appreciated. I think the best thing to do is to find a doctor or therapist that specializes in dizzy disorders.  A lot of regular physicians just guess and do not know how to treat many of the dizzy conditions.  My first three episodes were brushed off by a doctor.  I found a vestibular therapist that did extensive testing. Have you been tested at some point and told you have BPPV and found out exactly which canal is the troublesome one?  There are standard, classic tests to show this.\n\nHere is the tricky part though.  Even if you do have BPPV (tested with certain maneuvers that trigger the BPPV and show nystagmus), and it is corrected - you could be dealing with residual dizziness.  After my last two month long episode of BPPV (and this is when I finally found a therapist that could help me), I suffered from this yucky residual dizziness for almost a year.  The BPPV is definitely gone, but there is a lot of residual stuff left.  There is a different between vertigo and dizziness.  BPPV is definitely positional (like if you move your head a certain way - it makes the loose crystal shift in your inner ear canal).\n\nSo you may be dealing with something other than BPPV. And as I stated before, a lot of times doctors brush it off and just say it is BPPV without doing much testing.  They send you home with some meds and tell you to wait it out. See if you can find a dizzy specialist to help you out. Best wishes to you!  On a side note - there ARE vestibular exercises to help get rid of the residual dizziness. A therapist can help guide you through this. Highly recommend going to a dizziness clinic, insist on it from your family physician.\n\nBut if it started after going on birth control I would suggest getting off. Just use condoms and avoid your ovulation time if you are sexually active. My vertigo is hormonal.\n\nIf you went on birth control to regulate your period, there are better ways of doing that!", "I had my first vertigo after waking up yesterday, it was either cause I had a surgery on both my jaws 2.5 months ago, or cause I was using bad wireless earphones that I forced a lot inside my ears. I will be getting a revision surgery on lower jaw in a week or two, is it okay to proceed with it? So is this a problem? Should I go ahead with a lower revision surgery even though I just had a vertigo attack. I am afraid the surgery might make it worse. I plan to get it in upcoming one or two weeks. Also, getting the ct scan could cause any issue? Speak to your doctor. Nobody here can or should give you advice on this. Vertigo and BPPV are not the same.\n\nBPPV describes the mechanical issue in your ear(s) that can be resolved with head movement. \n\nVertigo is a symptom of BPPV but can also be a symptom for a many issues. \n\nBPPV != Vertigo\n\nWould recommend you speak to your doctor.", "what am i supposed to do?? what do i do in the middle of a bppv episode to stop it or help it go away??\n\nbecause usually i just wait it out miserably, shaking and vomiting for 5-10 mins. i get them once every month or two for unknown reasons.\n\ni try to search for some things to help in the middle of an episode but it just tells me how to prevent them. any help is appreciated. go see an ear nose and throat (ent) dr. i did for my bppv and resolved it for me. Can I ask what they told you for taking care of it? I am almost through month three and still dealing with it. I have tried everything they are telling me but next step is MRI... I am trying to Google and see what other people do, but seems like mostly \u201ccured\u201d by Epley. \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\nEdit: I have been seeing ENT- 4 appointment so far and being diligent with their instructions (allergy meds, nasal spray, exercises, moving head an d neck carefully, sleeping propped up and off the side of the affected ear, etc.). Look up how to do the epley maneuver on YouTube. It is easy to learn. Keep doing that maneuver until vertigo goes away. It fixed mine...I kept doing it until doing the maneuver did not trigger vertigo attacks. Here is the link. \n\n\n\nDo exactly what they are doing but at a more dramatic angle. Did your ent perform the epley on you? They did for me twice during the same visit. Immediately after I could not sleep on my affected right side for 5 days. Slowly my symptoms went totally away after about 2 weeks.\n\nThe epley needs to be performed properly for it to be affective. Yes but the first time I think it was done wrong. The second time a couple weeks later I think it was done right. I also have to do other exercises at home because i guess I am a stubborn case- he seemed surprised that my eyes were still moving at my last appointment, after weeks of home exercises and him doing the Epley twice (first appointment I think was not done completely though; the second appointment he did it twice in a row and that was recently and I go back next week again). Look straight up for a minute at a time about 10 times while standing,... are you starting to feel better hopefully?\n\ni did hear that the longer you have bppv the longer it could take for the symptoms to subside after the epley is performed. makes sense uh? my ent not only wanted me to avoid sleeping on the affected side for 5 days, after doing the epley, but i was also told to avoid sudden head movements for several days to a week or two. all said, each person is different.\n\nhope you feel better soon. its not fun.\n\none more thing. im a road cyclist and ride 80-100 miles/week. when i finally started riding again i think the exercise helped me but im not suggesting it if your ent doesnt recommend it. again, each person is different and follow your dr. Less nausea every day and I am starting to think that feeling sick all of the time might have been related to the nasal sprays they had me on, because I forgot about it for three days and then realized I did and have not had to force myself to eat. The dizziness is still here but better too. I do not have everything back to normal all the way so I just never went back to doing the nasal spray and I am going to tell the doctor in a couple weeks. Problem with this is, I realize it was helping to open things up that I did not realize were closed off before. But I would rather be stuffy than sick all day. I also read the spray can cause dizziness, so that could be why I am feeling more steady too now that I am not using it. \n\nI like to walk and ride my bike so I am going to do those things because I read that getting back to normal and not laying around helps recover faster. I wish I knew that early on when I stayed in bed because I did not know what was happening and was scared, but the information would have helped me. yea, i am pretty active and non-sedentary so that may have helped me a lot. i just kind of plowed through my bppv symptoms until they subsided. on occasion if i jerk my head too fast i can feel an uneasyness but its not something that is causing me concern.\n\nglad to hear youre slowly improving. it can take time. Not to pry or be personal but had found some studies that show people taking ototoxic medications can be more susceptible to BPPV. I got one episode 3 years ago and then had not had it happen again until February 2021 when it happened twice in a week! I had been reaching around day 30 with a tricyclic antidepressant (amitryptaline) and stopped taking immediately. Has not happened again. Maybe coincidence? Maybe not? I am wondering if the first time it happened I was on something for a sinus infection and it might be related. Have you had any bloodwork done? My bloodwork showed I was severely deficient in vitamin d.... low levels of vitamin d can contribute to BPPV episodes", "I absolutely hate my recurring BPPV and want surgery to fix it. I am so frustrated with my BPPV/vertigo spells.\n\nA little background. About 2-3 years ago I got my very first BPPV. I felt a little dizzy for two days. My partner and I read up on what was going on and set up to do the epley maneuver. There was no warning at all that in doing so, you often get more vertigo because you are moving the otolith crystals through the canal. So, when the real vertigo (nystagmus and all) hit my like a freight train, I started screaming and closed my eyes (do not do that, but it was the natural response to feeling super dizzy and terrified). We went to the ER and they told me what it was. By then, I was a nervous wreck. Even if I understood what was happening, my anxiety was so completely through the roof that my hands were nearly numb and ice cold.   \nI remember when they did the moves on me, the room spun so much and so fast on all sides that I gripped the bar of the bed I was on and just cried while it happened. The nurses have seen some crap and my partner let me know that the nurse watching the whole thing pretty much said \"poor girl\". I happened to have an extremely bad case on both sides of my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the past few years, I have had small bouts of vertigo, likely caused by anti-depressants. Generally called brain zaps, but the room definitely spins, it is not just a dizzy spell, I see what I call snap-back relay in my vision, going from mid point all the way to the side over and over like a bad movie reel. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is not okay to get this kind of thing twice a year. I know that does not seem like much, but this thing terrifies me. I am pretty sure I got PTSD from my first time having it and am horrified that it ever reoccurred.  \n\n\nIt is always activated laying on my left side, either outright laying on my side, or my head tilted to the left while laying on my back. It can happen when I am perfectly still. Twice it as woken me up mid sleep with an attack. Also, all day I feel quite dizzy and as if my vision just is not focusing correctly (I know this can be anxiety too, but I cannot be sure). In this particular bout I have had, it is not always there. For a few days I felt all day mild dizziness, but I could sleep on my sides with out a re-occurrence. Then two days later, I woke up today with a bout while having laid on my left side for some time with just full room spinning. Laid on my other side and felt the same thing, so I immediately just laid on my back, which always makes it stop. Nausea kicked in and then tears, because my god I hate this more than anything I have felt. I would rather have a broken bone.  \n\n\nI am going to tell my doctor of all this and say I would like a surgery to prevent this entirely, as in the little area where the otoliths SHOULD be, they stay there. No more adventures out into the semi-circular canals. I do not understand why the body would not just have that area closed off. Why is it even an option for something that while benign, is can be severe in the fact that you do not know up from down and fall when you get vertigo? I mean, I know it is because it is fairly rare and because of that, people who got it did not die out thereby those with a more closed pocket breeding, but I am still so frustrated and baffled that it is a possibility. There seems to be no reason that the otoliths should ever be able to leave their little house. I want it plugged so that they cannot escape. I read that there are surgeries, but I could not quite tell if any of them were about just plugging up the minuscule opening where the otoliths escape, or if it was about closing off certain parts of the canals so they cannot affect the perception of them bouncing around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know the maneuvers will help, but I am infuriated that this can and most likely will happen again and again randomly. With all the other crap I deal with (I have a pokemon catch  them all list of mental health issues) I can not deal with this on top of it all. I need it to be gone for good, not just pop up outta nowhere and disable me physically and mentally from living life for a month while the stupid crystals dissolve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies for the rantness of this post, I am just sitting here crying in frustration and had to get it off my chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, is there anything that has helped you guys? The nausea and constant slight dizziness even when still is driving me crazy. That and I am absolutely afraid to move around much because what if there is a new position in which the vertigo is triggered? Anxiety is already an everyday thing for me, this just bumps it up to 11.\n\nIs anyone else also as sick of it as me? Even if the maneuvers work at that time I do not understand why it comes back. I do not hit my head anymore than anyone else, I get colds sure, but no more than most people. I just do not get what is causing it.\n\nI also hate having to sleep for weeks totally on my back, with pillows to prevent me from turning my head on the side. It takes so long to sleep that way and it is uncomfortable. So, I wrote you a very long note and unfortunately it vanished and I do not feel like rewriting it. But in a nutshell, I am pretty sure you do have PTSD. As I understand you already suffer from anxiety. BPPV will take your anxiety to a whole new level. It is scarier than hell. I understand, I was there. \n\nWhat helps me, is that, I was worried that what I was experiencing could be a tumor or something much worse.  So, when the ENT resolved my symptoms with a simple maneuver, I felt relief. I still feel relief that,  should it return, I just  need to go see that ENT again.\n\nThe other thing is that my BPPV was only triggered by lying in bed and moving my head. Basically, I just avoided doing that as much as possible. I never got it when I was standing up. So, I just really tried hard to avoid triggering it until it got resolved.\n\nWhat is my point? My BPPV was pretty bad. But I feel fortunate that it was not much worse.  I hate when that happens. I always try to copy whatever I am writing if it is more than a few sentences.\nI know a lot of people hate self-diagnosing (I am currently in the process of getting diagnosed for all my issues) but I hold all the tell tale signs.\nI hate it so much :( \nI have also been having vertigo at rest too. Not moving my head, just at a computer laid back and I get really small spurts of blurred vision and adrenaline rush like a vertigo spell is about to start, but never fully does. \n\nI will try to set an alarm to move around (minimal head movement of course) since I lay in a bed at the computer most of the time (long story, bad neck)\n\nUnfortunately it also got worse with mild exercise, so my routine is on hold till it goes away. \n\nMy other issue is that I can easily set up a doctor appointment, but only the ER actually knows the maneuvers :( I cannot just up and see a specialist that quick for it, so I may have a better chance of just letting it pass in a month. But I will double check. Last time I had it my drop in doctor could not do anything.\n\nThank you for your response. Luckily I have not had a full attack as I have been more careful lately, but like I said in the post, I still feel dizzy and a little nauseated all the time, which just plain sucks. So thank you for listening to my woes, lol Hey, actually I enjoyed reading your post. You are a very good writer (\"There seems to be no reason that the otoliths should ever be able to leave their little house. I want it plugged so that they cannot escape\"). And I know exactly what you are talking about. I was there a few months ago too. I have a feeling some of your issues are related to PTSD, which I can well understand.  Those spins are violent, worse than any rollar coaster ride I have ever been on. And the worst part is not knowing if the ride will ever stop. Is not there a balance center near you? If you want to PM the name of your closest major city to me, I will have a look around and see if I can find someone more specialized than your ER.  Has anyone had head trauma no matter how light before your first symptoms?  I mean, I hit my head no more often than anyone else. My partner actually hits his more (we have shelves on the walls and are room is a bit too small for our bed.) I suppose that could set it off, but that is ... for lack of a better way to say it, so unfair? Every time I hit my head now I am just going to fear for BPPV to come back again.\nIt also still has not subsided since I wrote the post. I read it can take a month or longer for the crystal to dissolve when not in the proper area it originated from.  I just ask because I suffered a acoustic blast on my left side just feet away. Hearing loss, tinnitus and now I suffer from BPPV. I am still seeing the doctor but if it is not that then more neurological issues. ", "How does bppv get diagnosed?

Caffeine and weather systems were definitely triggers. \n\n**July 2018**  \nGetting fed up, a friend referred me to an Osteopath. The osteopath did some preliminary work on my spine, organs (adjusting liver, kidneys), craniosacral therapy (which is \\~ controversial, and painful) as well as work on my jaw. \n\nMy body reacted immediately. I had the most insane migraine that radiated through my head and jaw after an osteo treatment. As soon as I started the osteo treatment I stopped getting the 8 hour long vertigo episodes, but I was still getting vertigo here &amp; there. It kind of shifted into what my Osteopath thought was *vestibular migraines* \\- some ocular migraines, haziness, difficulty focusing my eyes, lots of weird stuff.  I am skipping some of the fine details for brevity, but I will say that I was not feeling good. I could not sleep on the right side of my head, I could not walk straight, and my ears were crackling all the time. Vertigo was becoming all-consuming. \n\n**August 2018**\n\nA bit of a shit show of weird vestibular symptoms, until the end of the month - my osteopath said I was now ready for vestibular therapy. She figured out I probably had a rare form of vertigo - *Cupulolithiasis*. She did a specific maneuvre during a week I was dizzy and then my dizziness stopped and has not returned.  \n\n\nI spoke to a friend who is a Naturopath regarding my experience, and she said I may have gone through a \"healing crisis\" - when things get worse before they improve. I have got to say, I am not sure what to make of any of this but I am grateful that the vertigo has stopped. It is been 40 days without any vestibular symptoms.  \n\n\nI want to encourage you all to keep seeking treatment and to not live with vertigo. It is kind of a puzzle, figuring out what is happening with your specific ear canals - and I had to go through three physiotherapists, my doctor, an ENT (who was 100% useless) before I just happened to know someone who recommended this Osteopath. She said that my type of vertigo is extremely rare - so much so that her professor said \"ah, you will never see this in person\" but she guessed correctly and probably fixed my vertigo, for the time being at least. I just know that I feel VERY different now. I can walk straight, I do not feel that fullness in my \"bad\" ear anymore, I can sleep on my right side and not worry about waking up dizzy, it is a relief.   \n\n\n&amp;#x200B; I think you are using the term BPPV like it is synonymous with Vertigo. It is not. BPPV is a specific syndrome. I do not doubt that you had vertigo, but I do doubt that you had BPPV. A BPPV vertigo session does not last 8 hours. It lasts a few seconds. By that I mean, you turn your head quickly, the room spins for a few seconds and it is over. If you do not turn your head, the room does not spin. \n\n But I am happy that it is resolved now.  Anything these practitioners of alternative medicine say should be taken cautiously. They do not have the knowledge and training that real doctors have. If it works for you then that is great, but this idea of a \"healing crisis\" sounds absurd.  Well, it depends where you live etc. This naturopath's partner has an MD and their schooling was pretty much the same, except the Naturopath route does follow some \\~ more unknown \\~ paths. I am definitely on the skeptic side of all things, so I was surprised that the Osteopathy treatment was altering my symptoms and manifesting some pretty intense results. My Osteopath also has a graduate degree in Neuroscience and is doing research to create some more legitimacy around the science of Osteopathy. ... can you describe the manuever?

Thank you for any advice you can give. Ask a Doc, please. I did take meclizine pills but it put me straight to sleep so you might miss the vaccine that way. Take care and feel better!  I do not know if it is too late, but meclizine will help with the dizziness but also make you tired. Hope you made your appointment! Havent had vaccine yet, still have a few hours.

Not sure if i was doing it correctly though. In line at the ENT now hopefully she can tell me what to do! Thank you for your help Thank you! At the ENT now Good luck! Every position in the Epley triggered my vertigo but it got less and less each time. Thank you! Doc just confirmed BPPV and gave me antivertigo meds. Good to go for vaccine thankfully!", "Do not know what to do. (Beginning sufferer) This is my first experience with what seems to be BPPV and it is scaring me pretty bad. Last tuesday I was at work and got intense vertigo and almost passed out. Went in an ambulance to the hospital, they did a million tests and did not really conclude anything. On Sunday a similar thing happened so I went to the Er. This time they did a head scan and concluded sinusitis. I have had eustachian tube dysfunction for awhile so this wasnt super surprising but they mentioned problems with my inner ear. They have me antibiotics and meclizine for the dizziness. Now its Tuesday and I feel no better and cannot go in to work. It is just a constant feeling of swaying and sometimes it gets alot worse to the point of vertigo and feeling like I am going to pass out. I have a brand new job and I am not making a very good first impression by not going in. I dont know what to do and this is causing alot of stress. What should my first course of action be? I am going to try to see an ENT and I saw there were some exercises here, so I should probably try those. This is really negatively affecting my life right now. Thanks everybody. The thing that separates BPPV from any other condition, is the vertigo being induced by head movement. If you feel somewhat better when your head is not moving, and feel worse when your head is moving, it is most likely BPPV. Also another thing that separates it from any other condition is the length of the vertigo attack. BPPV vertigo attacks usually do not last more than 60 seconds. So it could be anywhere from 2-60 seconds. Also, there can be some residual symptoms, such as what you described, like swaying feeling, unsteadiness, lightheadedness, and dizziness, even when you are not moving. It can be really scary! We have all been there! But it will get better. \n\nThe first thing you could do, is try the Dix-Hallpike test. This is diagnostic for BPPV, meaning if it is positive, you will know for sure you are dealing with BPPV and not another issue.\n\nIf it is BPPV, there are a lot of exercises you can try at home, many people have success that way. If you are more comfortable seeing a professional, I would highly recommend a Physical Therapist who specializes in vestibular issues over an ENT or GP. They just tend to be more knowledgable about it since it is their niche. \n\nBest of luck. I found this sub extremely helpful when I was first dealing with BPPV, so if you have any other questions do not hesitate. Check out the Epley Manuever, OP. For me it was triggered at one of my Jiu-Jitsu classes. We were doing Judo throws and I guess something got knocked loose. I was in the restroom throwing up from the nausea the dizziness caused. It was bad for a couple of days and then it would go away. After that I had two other instances of it but to a lesser degree. \n\nFor me I did the Epley maneuver and stayed well rested and have not had it in almost six months. \n\nI do however hate anything that makes me dizzy now since it is just such a scaring thing to go through. \n\nYou are in the right track though if I had the money I would have gone to the doctor too. \n\nLuckily I was able to find the help I needed through a doctor in YouTube. I agree with /u/tllallyrfrnds \\- the Dix Hallpike can be the first step to determining if it IS truly BPPV. A skilled vestibular therapist or dizzy specialist would do this test to you initially - and likely use goggles to view your specific eye movement (nystagmus) when they tip you back to provoke the vertigo.  You can also try it yourself, as mentioned.  You will know if you get the intense vertigo with eye twitching (it lasts about 30 to 60 seconds). Study the Epley before you do this, because if you lay back (the first step to the Epley) and get the vertigo symptoms, you can wait it out, then just move onto the next step of the Epley and finish the entire procedure.\n\nIt IS possible that if it is BPPV, the crystal could be in a different ear canal, and then it would need a procedure different than the Epley.  This is where a specialist could help.\n\nIf your Epley was successful, you should be able to do the Dix Hallpike again and NOT get the symptoms when you first lay back.  It took me 20 times of doing the Epley with my therapist and at home to resolve the issues over the course of two months. But I was left with 3 months of residual dizziness.  Still dealing with it. \n\nIf you search the forum, you will find a lot of knowledgeable posts by folks that have seen specialists and gone through treatment/therapy. It is helpful to read these posts and know you are not alone. And you might be able to relate to some of the other people's experiences.\n\nBest wishes to you!  Keep us posted on how you are doing. Hi love,\nYou got a lot of good advice from previous posters. I just thought I would add my experience since hearing about others helped ease my anxiety about it.\n\nI had my first episode 6 months ago. I had it for a month. I know, wth why did I deal with it for so long? Idk dude, I just thought it would go away on its own bc I am young and just thought it should heal up fast. It definitely does not work that way lol\n\nWell i could not take it anymore, I went to a PT that specialized in vestibular rehabilitation. I got the Epley twice and I was good. I had residual dizziness for about 2 months after that gradually went away. Now, 6 months after my initial episode I am back to normal!\n\nSo I just wanted to let you know, do not be scared. It will go away and you will be back to doing your thing in no time. Sending good vibes your way and feel better soon! xx\n\nPs: BPPV or not, definitely get yourself into a ENT, Physical therapist with Vestibular experience, balance center/dizzy clinic.", "My Experience with BPPV  I wrote a bit in my previous post about how I have dealt with BPPV, but I also have been reading some other posts from users who are not sure if they actually have it, why they have it, or how they can deal with it. So, I thought I would lay it all out here: how I got it, how I dealt with it, and what I do today to avoid it. Feel free to just ignore it, but it was really hard for me to find information at first and I felt hopeless; I would like some of you to potentially avoid that feeling and maybe draw some insight from my experience.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Beginning**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn August 2017, I had to move to a new apartment because my previous one had sustained water damage from a leaking roof. \nI moved into a new school-provided apartment (I was living in South Korea) which ended up being in a building full of university students. Over the course of maybe 2 or so weeks, I began to realize that I could not fall asleep until about 1 or 2am due to loud neighbors and paper-thin walls. And I had to wake up for work at 6am every day, thus making me severely fatigued. I was not able to get any cooperation from my neighbors no matter whom I talked to, but that is another story for another time. *Basically, I was fatigued and sleep deprived which set the stage for my stress.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**More Stress**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAmidst my sleep deprivation, I was also forced to work about double my normal teaching hours due to a colleague being out of work. This lasted from September to November, and this is where my stress got extremely severe. I essentially experienced burnout as a result of lack of sleep and overworking. One night, I went to sleep with earplugs in and slept on my left side. When I awoke, I felt extremely dizzy and had a ringing in my ears. Luckily, the extreme dizziness went away in a matter of hours, but I felt constantly lightheaded for weeks to come. (edit: The ringing in my ears lasted about a month.)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Diagnosis**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBecause I remained lightheaded all the time, which got worse when I stood up to teach, I decided to go to a doctor. I went to the ENT and explained that I had a constant ringing in my ears and dizziness. He told me he believed it was BPPV but we would have a test to determine it. I took a hearing test, which turned out to be fine. I then took the ( I was given some goggles (similar to the oculus rift) that have cameras in them and told to put them on while I sat on an operating table in the dark. The doctor came in and moved me all around in different positions. Afterwards, we watched the footage on a monitor. The cameras filmed the movement of my eyes as I was moved in different directions. Because my eyes darted to my left when I was moved into different positions (( the doctor said that this indicated I had BPPV in my left ear. He then performed the ( but it did not have an effect on me. He tried it a second time but I still could not feel a difference. Eventually, he gave me a prescription for diazepam which helps with dizziness. However, he said that using that prevents BPPV from healing in the long term, so to only use it in emergencies (such as at work).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Improvement**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI avoided taking the diazepam when I could, as I was hoping my BPPV would simply be healed away. However, I still felt dizzy when I moved my head quickly or stood up from a chair. I watched some videos on YouTube and tried to perform some maneuvers to dislodge the crystals in my ear, but nothing worked; in fact, it made it worse. So I gave up on the maneuvers.\nAs for my living situation, I moved in with a friend and was finally able to get a proper night's sleep. *I cannot express how much this helped me feel better in general.* As for my work situation, I finally stopped having to work overtime as we hired a replacement for my colleague who left. This also helped me de-stress A LOT. I was now able to get proper rest and work normal hours. By trial-and-error, I realized that sleeping on my right side, and never sleeping on my left side, allowed me to not feel lightheaded or dizzy. To this day, I think I have felt dizzy maybe twice since November and it was due to laying on my left side for a period of time.\nAs for the ringing in my ears, it might have been caused by my earplugs being too deep in my ears. **I do not think that the earplugs contributed to my BPPV because I still sleep with them in.** I have read that the main contributing factor for BPPV in people under 50 is head trauma. I suppose it is possible that I hit my head against my wall in my sleep, but I do not remember it at all; **therefore I cannot say with certainty what brought on my BPPV besides stress and sleep deprivation.**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I did not get enough sleep\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I had burnout from overworking\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* This gave me a lot of stress\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I went to the doctor and found little reprieve other than diazepam\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I made big life changes\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* I only sleep on my right side\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSorry for the long post but I literally do not know anyone who has experienced this, and you guys are the only people who can relate to my suffering. I just hope this somehow helps you guys out.  Thank you for your post - it provided me with some insight into my own symptoms. I am certainly going to assess my life right now and see how I can start accommodating my body to negate some of these symptoms I am having.  Thanks for sharing this! Hey I used to have BPPV about a year and a half ago. While waiting to see an ENT I decided I would look around on youtube and read everything I could find online that may help. I tried the epley and it did not seem to help me. I ended up finding ( - half somersault canalith repositioning. I did it on a Saturday morning on my bedroom floor and spent the rest of the day being dizzy, I honestly thought I fucked something up. Anyway, the next day I woke up and expected to feel dizzy throughout the day but I did not and I am happy to say that I have not been dizzy since. I even cancelled my ENT appointment. ( But also watch the video, I hope this may help. Hey, I just replied to OP with a video and a diagram, check it out and see if it may help you as well. Thanks for sharing! I will give this move a try! No problem, definitely worth it! Let me know how it goes for you. Actually this is the one that I tried and made it worse for me. So, I did not try it again; I hope it works for others though!  Awww that is too bad. I hope that you are able to find something that helps.", "10 Minute Exercise for Dizziness and Balance  Struggling with dizziness lately. Did this even though I was not currently dizzy and at the very least it was relaxing and seemed to open my sinuses. Saving this video to try again when dizziness strikes again.", "Cervical Vertigo or something else? So in the summer of 2018, around July or August I believe, I started having this constant vertigo. Its not really spinny, its more like standing on a boat and at times if I bend my head downards enough it feels like a slight falling feeling. It was really bad when it started out but now its just more annoying than harmful although I still want to get rid of it because it does increase with stress and affects my studying a lot. Also, I use to be able to keep my hands and stuff really still but now my hands whenever I try to keep it still still shakes or moves a little, and when it started out I could hear and notice the \"beats\" (I am presuming blood pumping) in the back of my neck more probably because my entire body shakes a tiny bit on each pump and the vertigo may have emphasized the feeling. Its not an ear thing since the vertigo is the same frequency other than lowering my neck, so is it probably a c1 c2 spine thing? How should I get it fixed after quarantine is done? I already had a chiropractor awhile ago that fixed most of the disks in my neck( alot of it was stiff) but the c1/c2 was still pretty stiff by the end of it when we checked the xrays which may explain why my symptoms of vertigo only improved slightly after the session. I am guesing its probably cervical.", "Is there any interest in a vestibular blog? Hi everybody, if you follow this page you most likely have suffered from vertigo at some point in your life and I am so sorry that you have had to experience this! Or perhaps you are a clinician like myself. For a long time I have though about starting a blog to help both patients suffering with a vestibular disorder as well as clinicians treating these disorders. I guess my questions is how many of you would read something like this or think that there is a need for it? I find good accurate information to be scarce on the internet. Anyways, I would love some feedback from you all on what you would find the most helpful in a blog before I embark on this journey. Thank you! You should look up the dizzy cook! I find her blog pretty useful YES!!!! I think this would be awesome.  As I struggled through my last episode of BPPV, I wanted to find personal experiences and connect with real stories. You find a lot of studies and then all the same canned info.  My vestibular therapist offered me real life info - and that is what truly helped me. Nothing is standard.  And yet, one can find hope from hearing other stories and know they are not alone in the struggle.  There are constantly new studies being done and new info coming out.  Yet, that info is hard to find online.  My therapist continues going to seminars and learning conventions.\n\nAlso dealing with the anxiety that goes hand in hand is a big deal. I would love a blog with info on what helps and what does not.  Fact or fiction. Comparing experiences.  I wrote a long post a week ago regarding the different positions of the Epley maneuver and how the crystal rotates around the canal.  It took me 20 Epley maneuvers to get the crystal where it belonged. Was I doing something wrong (was doing this with the therapist and at home), was it just stubborn, was the Vertigo supposed to be reproduced in ALL positions?  I could not tell that the crystal actually went back into place and did not know until a week later when we did the Dix Hallpike and it was negative.  Or maybe it was getting jostled around riding snowmobile that did it?\n\nAnyhow - YES to the blog!  So many people do not understand the violent vertigo with nystagmus vs residual dizziness.  Or how to test for it (all 6 ear canals).  Or how to just cope day to day while waiting for it to reside.  I had been diagnosed two years ago and recently had my 4th episode. Up until this last time - I just knew I had BPPV and it would go away on it is own. This last time, I actually saw specialists and got a true diagnosis and tested with goggles and everything.  I learned SO much!  The general docs (in my area) just tell you that you have BPPV and send you home with Meclizine and Zofran and tell you to wait it out without doing any testing. So to answer your question I would say it is useful. There are a lot of vestibular resources and forums out there but it does not hurt to add your own experience to the mix. You have also had the intense vertigo attacks that last hours and leave you unable to stand? Also with nystagmus? I have had 4 attacks of this in the past year. It is horrible. My most recent attack took me weeks to recover from. Luckily my intense vertigo attacks are positional and only last up to 30ish seconds if I stay still. But as I try to reposition the crystal in my inner ear to get it back to where it will not cause me the intense vertigo attacks, the bad vertigo happens when I change positions.  I am left with residual dizziness afterwards.  And yes, those were all with nystagmus. My therapist put goggles on me that videoed my eyes - as the direction of the nystagmus indicated which canal the crystal was in.  My last episode started in December and I am finally just getting over the residual dizziness.  It took two months to reposition the crystal so that my system could start to reset itself back to normal.  I cannot imagine that horrible vertigo lasting for hours leaving you unable to stand.  But even my 30 seconds of severe vertigo leaves me exhausted and feeling yucky.  My grandma had attacks that lasted longer and and it was diagnosed as Meneires Disease. Most definitely! Thank you all so much, this encourages me that my efforts would not go to waste!", "15 years old, possibly suffering from BPPV Hey folks.\n\nWhen I move my head arround, I get nauseous and throw up. I have seen people suffering for months on here, and I would rather die than have this for a week. Dying is pretty permanent though. This crap comes and goes. For me, once or twice a month. But I have gotten pretty good at navigating my way to the restroom while the room spins.\n\nIf you are only 15, please be sure to rule out anything else it could possibly be with a trusted physician. The period of puberty brings a lot of challenges and changes. For me it also brought migraines that did not go away for over a decade. I am hopefully going to the doctor today, but it is difficult with the coronavirus around. Hey do not worry! I had my first episode at 18 even if it is this just get a good doctor who can preform the head manuver you need or you can learn how to do it yourself! Also some people only get it once in their life and never again! So do not stress okay! For most people doing the correct manuver can fix the worst of it really quick and the little bit of dizzy afterwords is annoying but you can usually still go about your day! Just think of it as similar to a migraine or something that puts you out for a day or two! Chin up! Im at 20 year old female with bppv! Good luck, kiddo. It will pass!

So I have been suffering unexplained vertigo/dizziness for since 2015 now ,  but never had problems with being in vehicles cars, trains, planes etc. Eventually eased around 2017-2019 on it is own, almost like I got used to the sensation, it never went away fully but I could cope with it. Since 2019 I started to experience visual vertigo, as in feeling dizzy in large open spaces , for example at the airport,  large train stations , wide streets, certain floor patterns etc. But this summer in 2021 I started to all of a sudden get the same sensation when I am on a moving vehicle, car and train especially, which in the past 6 years of feeling dizzy 24/7, has never happened before this summer of 2021. It does not matter where I sit, and does not matter if i drive or not, i start feeling dizzy , especially if i move my head. So i have to keep my head dead still looking ahead all the time which is very difficult if you are driving, even then I still feel dizzy. I especially feel dizzy when the vehicle starts picking up speed and watching everything go by fast, especially on the train. I have seen all kinds of specialist over the years from ENTs to neurologists, have done MRIs CTs , all normal. Have even seen ophthalmologist. All normal there aswell. I dont know what to do anymore. I cant go far from home anymore especially if it involves using transportation, whether it is a car or train or bus. I rely on walking everywhere now, and even that is troubling for me, i also feeling dizzy while walking, cant move my head around etc. I feel it is getting worse day by day. I will be seeing an ENT soon just in case. Also I should mention that taking stemetil (prochlorperazine) seems to prevent my symptoms somewhat at the moment, especially when I am in motion (car or train). Otherwise I feel dizzy with it in mentioned situations. Still feel dizzy but not as much and as intense when taking stemetil. \n\nI hope someone can shed some light on this. Any suggestions? Ideas? man, sorry youve been affected for so long. its not fun.\n\ni dont think you mentioned if the ent's or vestibular specialists have performed the epley on you? if not go to one of them who are familiar with the maneuver. i found that attempting to perform the epley on your own is no where near as affective as from someone who is experienced with the maneuver. Thanks for your input. Yeah did forget to mention, during those ent visits they did the epley manoeuvre,  with no success.", "I am kind of freaking out I went to the doctor for ear pain after wacking my right ear while on the phone when thinking that a mosquito was about to fly into my ear. I immediately felt ear pain, an intense ear ache and it felt like something was in my ear. The next day I had intense vertigo and could barely get out of bed, I took a bath and tried to get the bug out of my ear (it felt like it was in there anyway, my ear felt really full). I ended up making an appointment for an ear doctor for the next day. I went in and the doctor checked my ear and said there was nothing in there, she did tests and said it might be BPPV, said that wacking myself on the ear could have caused the crystals to fall out and gave me a series of vestibular exercises to do, they helped immediately and immensely, with symptoms coming back off and on but now 2 months later, my ear still feels off and on full and achy, like right now in this moment, which makes me worry that it might be something else? I keep googling information about BPPV and I keep getting that BPPV will not make ears ache or feel full, and if they do then it is probably Menerie's disease. I am all sorts of worried and hoping for some feedback on personal experiences from others. Thank you. Hey mate when I had BPPV I can tell you right now. I had ear pain and ear fullness with it. I had a mri done incase it was not a Brain tumor on the nerve Everthing was good hearing test was good as well. I say BPPV can cause ear pain and fullness n if people say it cannot well I had it and was diagnosed with BPPV by a Professional ENT and I do not know there names but that focus on the brain. So do not freak out to much. I had ear full n pain for about 2 months after my BPPV went away. If you are worried get a MRI but I do not think it is necessary especially it only started after you hit your ear. I would not worry about it as much as you are. You can get a second opinion by an ENT just to ease your mind I also had funky ear stuff going on when I had BPPV.  It was a fullness, and fluttering, gurgling.  I had my ears checked multiple times and they said they were fine, and my hearing is fine.  I do have tinnitus, but have had that for over 20 years. The tone of it has changed though.  I also was told over and over that the ear troubles were not related to BPPV.  And with googling....I also found that fullness meant Meniere's. My grandma had Meniere's - so that totally freaked me out.  But now, it is been over a year since my last super long (two month) BPPV episode and my ears have finally settled down.  Also - just noting that I was working with a vestibular therapist that is very specialized in BPPV.  So - I was getting good, current info as I was being treated.\n\nMaybe try to get in with and ENT (ear specialist) for a full exam - just to make sure there is not something else going on.

Some mornings the symptoms would last a few hours before feeling back to normal.  Some mornings it clears up in 10 minutes.  Today went to ENT and he diagnosed me with BPPV in the left ear.  He performed epley maneuver, said to sleep on back with 45 degree angle for two days, and come back in a week.  I left there feeling more vertigo than when I arrived.  Over time it has begun to wear off.\n\nFew questions:\n\n1. Is it normal after the epley maneuver to still feel vertigo for a little while?  If so, how long does it usually take to wear off?\n2. Is it common for people to also do the epley at home until the BPPV goes away (over X amount of days time)?\n3. Any other suggestions to keep the symptoms at a minimum?\n\nI have an appointment with a physical therapist that specializes in canalith repositioning next week.  Could not get in sooner due to her schedule.  It happens to be the day after my next ENT appointment. I had a bout of it a couple of months ago. It gradually went away over the course of 2 weeks. I believe I did some kind of damage because even when the noticeable dizziness wore off, I notice I am sometimes a little more off balance than I used to be. That will go away too. Hope you feel better! BPPV sucks! I had BPPV and was dizzy non-stop for 2 straight weeks. From the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed, I was stumbling and dizzy. \nEveryone is different I suppose, and this is all anecdotal, but I must say: if it is wearing off fairly quickly (as in not lasting for 8+ hours), consider yourself one of the lucky ones. For me, it was awful. I had to call off work for 2 weeks straight, which strained my job at the time.\n\nThe ENT taught me how to do the maneuver and recommended I keep doing it at home every once in a while for each ear.  Sometimes after doing the Epley maneuver (like 2 times out of 10), it would feel a little better. But more often than not, I would not feel a difference. It was a chore. By the end of the first week, it was testing my resolve and it took a lot to convince myself that I was not going to be stuck living with dizziness for the rest of my life (I was 32 at the time). \n\nThankfully, it started going away after week two. There was an off-balance feeling that lasted for about a month or 2 afterwards, but I kept doing the maneuvers. Definitely keep doing the maneuvers the doctor recommends and hang in there. It gets better, but it is a slow process and sometimes it feels like the maneuvers do not help.  Just do not stop and keep at it. Be patient.\n\nI wish there was some magic thing I could recommend to alleviate it all, but unfortunately there is not. Keep visiting your doctor and good luck! Thank you.  I kept reading about the manuever and hiw symptoms should subside after a few minutes and thought \"Great.. this is not what I have\".   I am still not 100% confident in my ENT and feel the therapist I am scheduled to see will be my best bet.  Till then I will continue the manuever at home. Thanks.  Makes me feel good I have had BPPV multiple times over the course of a decade. It is important to note that it can take MONTHS for the sensations to fully go away. This is especially true if none Epley is done and the otoliths are left to dissolve. Additionally, the brain is very good at adapting to the presence of the incorrect signals and compensating so as they slowly dissolve, the compensation you brain has done will now, ironically, cause symptoms to continue as equilibrium is achieved once again. Are you certain this was an accurate diagnosis? BPPV is positional by it is very definition and while it can cause all the time unsteadiness , it does not cause dizziness like you are describing constantly (which sounds like a nightmare btw). It should only cause spins on movement. Sounds more to me like Meniere's or possibly Labrynthitis or VN. This would explain why the Epley did not work either, which has a very high success rate when done properly. \\&gt;Is it normal after the epley maneuver to still feel vertigo for a little while? If so, how long does it usually take to wear off?\n\nIn my experience, very much yes. I was worried initially because the epley maneuver seemed to do very little for me. I have had symptoms last for the better part of a month, although vestibular therapy taught me some exercises that help mitigate them much faster.\n\n\\&gt;Is it common for people to also do the epley at home until the BPPV goes away (over X amount of days time)?\n\nYes, although my physical therapist said that if there are not problematic crystals in your ears, the epley will not do anything. I have developed some kind of issue with my balance system as a whole, and it requires other exercises to keep it in check.\n\n\\&gt;Any other suggestions to keep the symptoms at a minimum?\n\nSee a vestibular therapist, or at least look up some \"gaze stabilization\" exercises online. Do them often even if they initially trigger symptoms. I have been able to develop a tolerance such that I feel less hostage to the symptoms. According to my ENT, the ER and my MD, it was BPPV. It was definitely positional. Some angles were less dizzying than others, and it would fluctuate. My problem was in both ears, so the Epley was sort of working against me at times. It would correct for one ear but worsen the other one, is what I was told. Maybe my case was leaning more towards the extreme end of the spectrum, but I recall those days clearly and would not wish it upon anyone even mildly. I did not realize that is what it was called, but vestibular therapy was a major part of my PT after I had a bleed in my cerebellum a few years ago. My instructions pretty much all said to do each exercise until I started throwing up. But I have got to say they made a huge difference. I have been using some of them again since the BPPV incident this summer.", "Feeling desperate I have suffered on and off with bppv properly for the last 2 years. Each time (months apart) has been more severe than the last. Usually I will wake up with symptoms and they will go away within a few hours. This time it is almost unbearable. \n\nI woke up with intense dizziness when I turned over in bed. Walking around normally was fine, but my God it is still there when I have gone to bed the following night. Even more severe. I am so exhausted, I am going through an awful breakup and now I cant even sleep for fear of triggering this hell. Any helpful advice would be so gratefully received right now. Are you doing any treatment? Maneuvers? Propping yourself up in bed? I am propping myself up in bed but I am so terrified to perform any of the maneuvers. Mainly because I am not sure which one I need to be doing (it feels like both ears are affected) \n\n I also cannot bear to position my head in such a way, my heart races even thinking about experiencing the level of dizziness I did in the morning. It has really frightened me as it is been the most severe I have experienced yet. Is it possible for you to make an appointment with a vestibular therapist? Doing the maneuvers are not fun... but once you know which way to do it, it can actually give you immediate relief sometimes. I have been searching in my area in the UK, I would need to go private which would be costly, but at the moment I dont care. I am going to try and find someone. I guess I feel helpless because my doctor has been so dismissive of this condition when I have  visited in the past. I really dont want to experience it any worse than this time round ! I know what you mean about dismissive doctors. Is it possible that you can see another doctor? And then ask them if there is any vestibular specialists in your area under your insurance? Maybe consider traveling to see a specialist outside of your area? sorry to hear. i have the exact same problem. been dealing with it for about 15 years. going to a doctor will not help because they will just say it is a migraine or something else. the only thing that will help get rid of it sooner is going to a therapist to actually preform the correct exercise. A lot of people on this subreddit say to do it yourself, and after i REALLY tried to get rid of it one day i am pretty sure it fucked my ears up more. Let a professional figure out what is right for you first and give you medical advice, not reddit. Now that that is out of the way, here is what helps me. \n\nIt is never really \u201cone side\u201d for me and all i do is sit up in bed for a few hours till it goes away. Sometimes i have to get to work. so i just keep\nmy head down and do not look around. If i had to drive it would be a serious life issue to fix. \n\nfor me, my triggers are doing anything that will make me pass the fuck out. A huge meal before bed, lots of alchohol, smoking a lot, staying up way too late and playing videogames. Stress and working too hard is also one so ai have to make sure not to push myself and tell\nwork to leave me alone after 6pm. It tends to be worse when i sleep with my head back or \u201cflat\u201d too. my shoulders need a pillow underneath them so i generally sleep pretty propped up. Sleeping with my SO helps too because we unconsciously wake eachother up in the night and it makes me move my head so it is not in ONE spot for 8 hours.\n\nGood luck and god speed, life sucks but you got to deal with it. Thanks for the reply and sorry to hear you are going through the same thing! Its really awful. I do think sleeping in one position all night definitely triggers it for me too. Although I did have a migraine 2 days before the vertigo, so I am understandably confused and frustrated and my triggers not being so clear.\n\nThanks for the advice on the maneuvers. I absolutely dont feel confident doing it myself until a specialist has seen me. I have been in contact with one today, and hopefully can see him this week. Do you see a therapist regularly? And if so, do you think it helps keep your attacks from being so severe?\n\nI have an anxiety disorder and the fear and dread that this condition fills me with is so awful. I am catastrophising about my attacks being more severe each time, eventually being bed bound, not being able to drive or live a normal life (!! Thanks anxiety)\n\nThanks again for the reply, and hope you stay attack free. Get your vitamin d levels checked. There are studies that link the two. Thanks - I would not considered this. I will look into getting it checked. i have not gone to see anyone in forever. mostly because I get an attack and maybe half of one a day or two or three later and it goes away for another month. \n\nthey did a hearing test, EKG, sleep test (the works) and everything was fine 10 years ago. no reason to do all that again in my opinion since it is commonly known that vertigo is like a toe cramp, no real cause to it medically sometimes. \n\nI do think if i went the dayor after to a professional i would feel better faster and maybe not get another attack for a month. \n\nFor me, it feels like if i do not eat healthy, sleep healthy, stay stress free, and fall asleep in a normal side or propped up back position; I am way more likely to have an attack.\n\nBest advice I can give is work out, get all of your macros, and stay away from alchohol at night. A big ass wedge pillow for my bed has helped sometimes too. Need to buy a new one since i sink into it a bit now.", "Strange sensation while driving Anyone that suffers from BPPV had any strange experiences while driving? For instance, my very first episode of BPPV happened last April of 2020. It took me months to get back into a balanced state. So in November I went on a 10+ hour road trip. Whenever I was stopped at a stop light or fully stopped, I felt like my body was moving backward and/or forward. It made me feel sorta uneasy and now I feel a little hesitant on doing another road trip. Not sure if this relates to BPPV or could it be something else? The brain makes up for the movement of your body, when you finally stop, the brain is still compensating so it feels like you are moving in reverse; it can even affect sight causing it to look like you are moving backward.  It is a natural experience that happens to everyone, its called a motion aftereffect. Ah yes! Thank you so much! I have been suffering from the exact thing you described for about five months now. I do not drive now due to this, do you feel like you are kind of on a boat swaying back and forth? I sorta get the feeling like I am constantly falling backwards, especially when I lay flat in bed. Sorry to hear you are going through similar issues. It definitely sucks for all of those that have to live through this. I do get that weird sensation of swaying back and forth sometimes. It has not happen again recently but I still get that strange sensation as if I am constantly falling while I am lying flat on my back. And when I am lying on my left side I get the dizzys.", "NOTE: It appears the BPPV subreddit taken over without my (originator and moderator) consent Note to the subreddit member it appears oceanblueberries has taken over the subreddit without my consent. \n\nIt seems I did not check into the subreddit within the time period required and oceanblueberries must have used redditrequest to request this subreddit. \n\nApologies, I had an illness and death in my family and my priorities were elsewhere.\n\nI have absolutely no connection to oceanblueberries and anything posted from here onward is from them is not coming from me the originator of this subreddit.

Not a doctor but could very well be a viral infection and should clear up in that case. You should not worry unless it does not clear up in a 6-8 weeks or it keeps re-occurring, in which case consult your physician.

Last week I posted about a short vertigo episode followed by a severe loss in balance. Today I went to a vestibular PT and they performed the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. She said I was negative for BPPV.

My general doctor thinks that I probably have vestibular neuritis since, before this my balance was excellent.

I still get it sometimes but my severe symptoms lasted for 2 weeks and it got better after. What used to kill me the most is severe migraines and headaches and those were caused I guess by neck nerves. I had a combination of problems since I use my phone a lot and work on computer all day. Best advice to get better stay off electronics as much as u can and do outdoor activities. I still get a sway of motion feeling though it is been 6 months. Really I did not feel like I got much better until last 2 weeks and staying off phone and computer as much as possible were the key for me and also doing neck exercises. Thank you for telling your story! I am glad you mentioned the phone thing. I have neck problems as well, and I look down at my phone wayyy too much during work. Last week, I left my phone off during the work day and my neck already feels so much better. Yes, at first I thought it was BPPV, until I got diagnosed with Vestibular Neuritis.\n\nMy first symptoms was I could not walk a straight line if my life depended on it. I would fall over, or walk in small circles.\n\nMy vision was that of constantly whatever I was looking at, swaying to the right in a wavy blur manner.\n\nThe only exercises I was given after being diagnosed, and seeing a PT was to:\n\n- Take 2 note cards, &amp; put an X on both.\n\n- Tape one at eye level on the wall, and the other 6 inches above that.\n\n- Stand 6 feet back.\n\n- Start off closing your eyes. Than open your eyes, and as fast as you can, WITHOUT MOVING YOUR BODY OR HEAD, look with your eyes back and forth between the 2 cards for 60 seconds.\n\n- After 60 seconds. Rest for a minute. Repeat the exercise again 2 more times.\n\n- Do the above exercise , 3-5 times a day.\n\nIt took me several weeks(~2 months) to get back to my normal vision, and balance. The worst thing of it all is the deep depression/feeling your quality of life will never return to how it was before. Unless you have an extreme case, I promise you it will return to how it was. It just takes time. Know that. Understand that. 6 feet is the length of approximately 8.0 'Wooden Rice Paddle Versatile Serving Spoons' laid lengthwise. 6 inches is 15.24 cm", "Feeling like I am on a boat About a month ago I started getting these spinning/dizzy spells in the evenings. From there it is just got worse and worse and can happen all day right from waking up. Sometimes it comes on with headaches and sometimes just the on a boat feeling. Went to the doctors and he thinks I have bppv but I am not sure as the dizziness is frequently accompanied with headaches and I cannot find anything that says it causes headaches. I am confused and getting fed up with it now. Also I was taking accutane when it started so I stopped taking it thinking I was dehydrated but I have been off it a month now and drink plenty of water and it is still happening. Hi! I think we have the same situation. Do you wear glasses? Hi, yes I wear them when I am driving/ watching tv but the rest of the time I manage without them :) Dm!! I have a lot of eye problems and I was thinking it might be your eyes. \n\nHave you been to the eye doctor recently? Not that recently. The last time I had my eyes checked was about 2 years ago when I got my glasses. Thanks for the reply I do get ocular migraines a lot where I see an aura not sure if that could be related? I do not know anything about ocular migraines but I would check in with your eye doctor since it is been a few years. I hope things get better for you soon. Ok thanks. Just out of interest how could my eyes be causing the dizziness? Hey Glittering-Cow, So I had BPPV about 2 months ago and got my BPPV cleared up within 2 weeks but have had residual dizziness ever since. My residual dizziness has gotten better and I, too, have ocular migraines. I usually get 1 OM a month, no big deal, but I have noticed that ever since I had BPPV that I now get a OM once a week. After my OM has cleared up, I get really dizzy. I feel like I am on a boat, I feel a lot of brain fog and overall uneasiness especially when I am lying down. My physical therapist that I have been working with for my dizziness said that Vestibular Migraine and Ocular Migraine are linked. I mention this because it might be something you want to bring up to your doctor or PT. Good luck and I hope you feel better. I am not a doctor but even subtle changes in your vision can cause eye strain which can cause dizziness. I felt quite dizzy as well all day yesterday and it persisted through the night. Even when laying in bed my world was spinning. Apart from a visit to the doctor, any suggestions on what I can do or take at home? Just wondering if there are any home remedies that might help alleviate. Okay that is interesting. Thanks for your help! Hi! I have been trying to find some home remedies myself but not much has really been helping me. I just try and get as much sleep as possible and drink lots of water. If your dizziness could be from something like bppv like mine, I have just been trying to keep my head as still as possible and not move around too much which I know is hard when you have things to do but the dizziness is not as bad for me when I have not been doing as much. Hope you feel better :) Thank so much! Yes, everyone is suggesting hydrating which I frankly forget about most times. I will definitely keep that in mind. Thanks again!!", "Does this sound like BPPV? &amp; is nearly constant unsteadiness normal after BPPV subsides? I have been having vertigo for about 5 seconds when I roll onto my right side, coupled with involuntary eye movements. Normally, outside the vertigo, I would feel fine and would have no other symptoms. It happened to me for a few days 6 months ago, went away without me needing to try any treatment/movements, and recently came back. My last vertigo episode was about 4 days ago. I can now lie on my right side without triggering an episode, so I thought it just went away on its own like it did last time.\n\nHowever, ever since the recent episodes subsided, I have been feeling unsteady, like I am on a rocking boat. I do not need to be lying on my right side to feel this way; it is constant. The feeling seems to get worse and more dizzying when I sit or move my head in certain ways, but it is not that vertigo sensation with involuntary eye movements anymore. Like I said, this is my second time having those vertigo episodes and I do not remember experiencing this constant dizziness after the vertigo stopped last time.\n\nSo, does this sound like it is BPPV? Can BPPV cause dizziness/unsteadiness outside the vertigo episodes? I am seeing a doctor soon to answer these questions but I was curious and wanted to hear opinions from this community too. :)\n\ntl;dr Ever since episodes of vertigo with involuntary eye movements (triggered when I turn onto my right side) seemingly went away on its own, I have felt unsteady due to a moving boat sensation and occasional worsening dizziness that is not vertigo. Is that normal for BPPV? My first 3 bouts of vertigo seemed to go away fairly quickly on their own and I did not have any residual dizziness. I did not know much about BPPV at that point. \n\nNow, this current episode got way out of hand. It lingered and I saw many specialists. Those specialists ruled out serious conditions. It was a vestibular therapist that really diagnosed me and taught me a ton &amp; helped me out. She performed many different dizziness tests. It took over 2 months with a therapist doing the Epley maneuver to get the crystal moved out of the ear canal. In addition, I had/have numerous balance, vestibular, and gaze instability exercises to do. I have had the residual dizziness that you speak of for 4 months now (since I tested negative for BPPV). I do not know why it is different this time. It is not fun.\n\nMuch of the therapy is based on challenging the dizziness. This is to retrain the brain now that your system is balanced again. For example, right after the BPPV was cleared, I would get the woozy mild dizziness looking up &amp; down. So I would look up &amp; down 15 times (and repeat that set 2 more times). Then I would do this while walking, then while running (I am a runner... So do not do it running if your not normally a runner!) Eventually it got better, but then changed to dizziness when looking or tilting my head to the side. So I challenged that until it got better. I am beat when being active. Sitting still, I notice the waves of dizziness more.\n\nAnxiety feeds this residual dizziness too. And when you feel those waves of dizziness, it is hard not to worry about BPPV coming back. It is a vicious cycle. I have mentioned many times  how I often will lay back doing the first step of the Epley to ease my mind that bppv has not returned. I try to stay active get plenty of sleep &amp; try to keep the stress &amp; anxiety away. Slowly the residual dizziness is getting better. It is been a long process though. And seemingly it is lingering longer because I had active BPPV for so long and continued life as normal. My body reprogrammed itself to being off balance. Now it has to reprogram itself to being balanced again.\n\nLet us know what you find out at your appointment. Having a professional to help guide you is invaluable. Finding someone that deals with dizzy conditions is key. A lot of docs are not trained in dizzy conditions &amp; just want to prescribe medicine (that is not effective) and tell you to wait it out. It is possible that the crystal moved from one canal to another, that is what happened to me the last time I had it. After it moved into the horizontal canal I had what you are talking about, it felt like I was walking on a boat and it would randomly feel like I was moving when I was sitting still. It took a different series of movements to fix it than what is typically used. Hopefully the doctor you are seeing knows about BPPV and can help you. Thanks for sharing your experience! I am not exactly happy that you have gone through something like this, but it is relieving to know I am not the only one. My doctor ruled out the more dangerous illnesses and diagnosed me with BPPV this morning, and they thought my residual dizziness was normal and part of my recovery since it is been decreasing in intensity these past few days. If it lingers despite me performing Epley and taking the medication they recommended, I will look into movements for the horizontal canal. Thank you for the advice &amp; I am sorry it is been lingering for so long! Like you, I think I notice it more when I am sitting/lying still as opposed to when I am active. I definitely could stand to be more active, so I will try to move around more despite how lethargic the unsteadiness makes me feel.\n\n Like I said in my response to another commenter, I was diagnosed this morning with BPPV and the doctor thought residual dizziness was normal and part of the recovery. Aside from the medication that you predicted they would prescribe, they offered to refer me to someone who knows more about BPPV if things do not get better, so I definitely have options to try before I freak out over having permanent dizziness. I actually realized after making the original post that my residual dizziness has been getting less intense the longer it is been since my last vertigo episode, so perhaps it will resolve itself soon and I should not worry. Still, I wanted to hear others' experiences too :) Sounds good, glad you have a doctor who knows about it. Hope it clears up soon. I am glad you got to see a doctor that could diagnose you! And please - do not hesitate to see the person that your doctor spoke of that knows more about BPPV. My therapist was truly a godsend.  She even helped my anxiety when I was freaking out that I would be dizzy forever.  And she could perform the tests again to help reassure me.  And she monitored my progress and continued to give me more and more exercises to help me recover.  Please keep us posted on how you are doing. It truly helps to hear from others and know that there is hope!  I am SO much better than I was, but still have a bit of mild dizziness daily....which almost automatically triggers the sick feeling anxiety brings. So I work hard to busy myself with something to take my mind off it.  And as the other poster /u/passesopenwindows mentions, the crystal can move to another canal and cause other problems.  There are 3 inner ear canals on each side - and any of those can be effected. So it is helpful to have a dizzy specialist working with you to keep things on track and make sure you are performing the correct maneuvers to help yourself get better.  Best wishes! This happened to me. Turns out my vertigo \"jumped\" to the other ear. Have the epley done on both sides", "Suggestions? I have been having vertigo flare ups for years that last a week or so but recently a few months ago my vertigo stayed and would not leave. Now since yesterday I have had constant dizziness and nausea no matter what I do. What should I do? Do doctors even help? You should go see a doctor, or if you do not need a referral go straight to ENT or vestibular therapist Find a doctor or therapist that is trained in dizzy disorders.  I found my regular doctor, the ENT, and the neurologist did not offer much help, other than to rule out more serious issues. It was the Vestibular Therapist (found in the physical therapy department), that actually was able to truly test me for BPPV (and a bunch of other dizzy disorders), diagnose, and treat me. Try what cured me(I did it by accident while birdwatching at some big tall trees). Go outside and while standing, look straight up for 10-15 seconds, then look at the horizon...walk a little and repeat about 20-30 times. See if your ears plug like you just went swimming and got water in them. I went to a doctor and they told me it was allergies, I am trying to get an ENT referral now", "Mini BPPV? Any insight? Hello!\n\nTwo days ago I got up from the couch weird and felt a second of dizziness/distantness, but it stopped when i took control of the situation. Ever since then I feel...weird. Ever so slightly off balance, finding it more comfortable to look to the right than the left, and a constant dull headache emanating from the left side of my head. However, no spinning, dizziness. Just feel slightly blurry in my head. Sometimes when I think about it I get anxious and nauseated. \n\nMy theory: it could have been full on vertigo, but i stopped it before it got too far. But two maneuvers I have been trying really are not working. I kind of want to see a specialist, but I can live my life fully and I am fine really, it is just annoying to always have this slight fleetiness to my head and constant but small ache. \n\nAny body have this? Any maneuver advice?\n\nHas anybody ever experienced this I had a really bad vertigo episode 2-3 weeks ago on a Sunday. It was debilitating. Started during my sleep when turning at night and made me sick to my stomach. I almost fell over while using the toilet. Found a maneuver on Pinterest to readjust ear crystals and it helped me end the episode. I had dizziness and off balance that lingered for almost a week. Been good for 1 week now with no signs. Last night, I noticed some off balance dizziness coming back. Here I am again this morning doing maneuvers again to make it go away. I have 4 kids, overweight and live a very sedentary life doing office work. Idk what suddenly caused this but now I am concerned. \n\nI initially thought it was a migraine aura. But the headache never came. Hope we get feeling better soon! Best to see the GP and ENT to rule anything out. For BPPV there does not have to a compelling event. For me, like others, I went to bed, rolled over at some point and boom, the room starts to spin! It is not the rolling that causes the crystal to move, by that stage, it is moved and while your asleep it is a ticking time bomb that goes off when you roll. \n\nAs a word of warning, you can overdo the manoeuvres and if the crystal is in a canal that your not treating ie another ear, in the horizontal, you are just going to make your self more sick.\n\nIf you have lingering dizzy ness, I would recommend going to a PT that specialises in this lovely disorder to provide balance exercises as the longer you leave (this is my experience) the longer that lingering will hang around. Anxiety can causes lightheadedness and dizziness... I also found that if I am \u201coff balance\u201d it would bring in tension headaches... \n\nMy suggestion tho if you are not experiencing vertigo is to see a PT who can help you with balance rehab. \n\nHelped me a great deal with lingering unsteadiness from BPPV I had similar what you had. Kind of blurry brain and feel like something wrong with balance. However no shifting while walking, no symptoms of real BPPV. \n\nAlready gone to ENT 4 months ago and got some tests.\nTests were: warm-cold air blowing on ears, hearing tests and sudden head movement to test if eye twitches come.\nNothing came out, no findings. Doc said it might be because of the nerves in the neck, do neck excercises.\nHowever after 2 weeks I got a real vertigo attack (this time BPPV for sure) when roll over the bed. Applied Epley by myself at home then went to same doc he did the same properly.\n\nSince 6 months sometimes better sometimes worse, it did not go away. I am fine during the day and morning. But at the night when I lay down, I feel floating sensation for some time. I move my head slowly or floating becomes worse. Haha yes! Exactly! Mine came at 3am when I could not sleep, thinking my vertigo is back. A viscous cycle of what is causing what \ud83d\udc13\ud83e\udd5a. A few things came to my mind and one was the barometric pressure dropped, the other was I ate like shit this week and last, I have not been consistent with my vitamin d. So I upped my d and it is subsided. I think it is inflammation but what is the cause I will never know.", "Residual dizziness after a full recovery 2 months later? About 2 months I had my first experience with BPPV.  I had 2 severe episodes and was able to go to an ENT and PT the next day.  I did 8 Epley maneuvers over the next week and then had residual dizziness for 4 days.  After that I was completely back to normal.  A few days ago I started noticing myself getting sudden lightheadedness at night.  It is almost like that feeling where you are falling asleep in class and then your body jerks you awake.  It is happening to me multiple times every night while I get ready for bed and try to fall asleep.  Could this be BPPV related? Could it be a less intense episode? Or something completely different? Wondering if anyone else has experienced this! I had active BPPV for two months.  And now it is been over 6 months since the BPPV was resolved. I still have issues with residual dizziness. I also suffered with gaze instability, as I tried not to move for so long to avoid the dizziness, and it caused a secondary dizziness. When I lay down at night, I get waves of dizziness. It is not the violent 30ish second vertigo that goes with BPPV, but a milder wave of dizziness. So, it is really not positional. As I can be laying still and get a wave of the mild dizziness. I do not know exactly what it is - only that I am chalking it up to residual and my body still trying to rebalance itself.  I do have days where I feel really good with no dizziness.  But then other days when it is worse again. It is definitely NOT BPPV - as I occasionally lay myself back and test the ear canals and they show no symptoms.  I am very active and life has returned to normal.  I did many vestibular exercises. So - you would THINK that over 6 months later I would not have any dizziness. But I still do. And it sucks......But not worrying and keeping anxiety at bay is also helpful. Maybe you could revisit PT or the ENT just to have them check you over again? OMG this is my same thing. The jerking feeling like you are falling asleep except it is in my head. I have had it for a year now, with other symptoms sprinkled in such as what feels like pins being stabbed in my body. Have you made any progress ? I have been having that exact same issue with jerking awake over and over again when trying to go to sleep, among other things. I am not sure it is not anxiety, tbh, since it happens without dizziness too. All I know is that taking a few pills of Valerian before bed helps with it (on top of twice a day full-spectrum CBD oil dose). Ugh I reached out to my primary and my PT and both said it was not vertigo but I am fully convinced it is somehow related.  It is still happening every night and it is so strange because if I lay flat on the couch and take a nap during the day it does not happen.  It only happens when I am falling asleep at night.  I take melatonin which makes me more tired but it still happens and I am at a loss for what I should do! At first I thought it was in my head but it is definitely not! I have had anxiety way before I ever got vertigo and this feeling is something I have never experienced before.  I looked up my symptoms online and found something called hypnic jerks? I am just so convinced that it is vertigo related. I am still trying to disentangle all that I have been dealing with for the past 9 + months, and it is hard. I do think that stress (over-activation of sympathetic nervous system or under-performing parasympathetic system) can contribute a lot, including dizziness and sleep issues specifically. Try relaxing before sleep, like low lights, relaxing music  (I am so sick of slow music before bed lol), maybe something herbal to help it out. Whether it is vertigo/dizziness related or not, it might help. I have periods when I can fall asleep okay, and then periods when I keep waking up all night, but some things do help, sometimes at least. Regarding 'jerking awake',  this might be of interest: (\n\nI have been experiencing a ton of this in the recent months, and the above makes sense to me as an explanation, since my sympathetic system is definitely out of whack and hyperactive due to stress and anxiety (caused by long term dizziness). So, even if you do not have any caffeine or other stimulants, the body can still (naturally) be in hyperactive state.  Try calming down and slowing down your falling asleep process somehow, it might help. \n\nI have days when I get these full body jolts during the day as well, out of the blue, when I should be fairly relaxed - it might be a glitch when my parasympathetic system tries to take over from sympathetic. They happen when I have (too much) caffeine, I think. Never had them before, they started with the anxiety that came after long-term dizziness I have been coping with. Might all be very coincidental and not causal, who knows.", "Keeps coming back Tonight is the worst episode yet. The bppv keeps coming back. I will perform the maneuvers and then it goes away and then I lay on the side that is not affected (left) and it almost immediately comes back. I have even stood up and walked around then laid back down. I have tried laying on all sides at this point and still get dizzy. WTF?? It is so bad I have only gotten 2 hours of sleep and now I am just up for the rest of the day which is going to suck. Did I mention I have a newborn so tomorrow is going to suck even more having to care for a baby ughssss.\n\nThe first ENT I saw was in beginning of 2018 and was pretty crummy. He looked in my ear for 2 seconds then said yeah I have BPPV but it will go away. Fast forward almost 2 years later I still have it. I am going to try to see another one. I am super frustrated right now too. I had 2 days of feeling great and now it is back. I am not sure if it just feels worse because I know what it is like without it now or because it really is worse.\n\nI have not heard of the salt thing but I am on a high salt diet due to a deficiency so that is interesting.\n\nMy PT did the maneuver on me in the morning and then had me not lay down all day, then when I did he said I should sleep at a 45 degree angle, either stack some pillows or sleep in a lazy boy chair. That should help them settle in a bit better first. Sorry to hear about your experience. I am interested to know more if salt intake actually triggers BPPV. If anything, I think it just makes the dizziness probably more intense. The same probably could be said for sugar and caffeine intake. What maneuvers are you performing? And you have had BPPV straight for 2 years? Might be something more serious if that is the case. I would definitely get a second or third opinion from a PT. Oh man, I am sorry you going through that. Two years? Dang...\n\nMy first episode lasted 2 months. After the Epley I stopped getting the Vertigo but for weeks I had a reside dizziness that eventually faded away....I still do not sleep on my sides. I sleep on my back slightly elevated. I have just trained myself to sleep that way now. I will do anything to minimize the chances of it reoccurring. Lol \n\nThe salt thing sounds interesting... if anyone has more information on that I would like to read about it too. I live in the south so..we are kind of notorious for having high salt diets. Even though I personally do not eat a lot of salt or at least I do not think so. I have also heard of a link between Vit D deficiency and BPPV. Here is a link that talks more on that...\n\n\n\nHowever, I would go to your doctor and test for any deficiencies before supplementing yourself. Obviously to much of a vitamin is not good for you as well....and the article does state further research is needed...\n\nBut other than that, I recommend a balance center or going to see a specialist to rule out M\u00e9ni\u00e8res or Vestibular Neuritisis since two years is a really long time to have constant symptoms.\n\nBest of luck and I hope you find relief soon! xxx Salt does not trigger my BPPV, but it does aggravate my Meniere\u2019s. I will have tinnitus and feel fluid in my ear. Sleeping elevated is so important for my BPPV after I have the Eply done. At the dizzy clinic I went to, after performing the maneuvers you were given a neck brace and told to sleep upright, on your back (recliner or 3 pillows) for 3 days. Do not bend over and do not turn your head quickly. Hmm, I have never heard of the salt thing, interesting! \n\nMine gets triggered when I toss and turn in my sleep (hence the inner ear crystals get dislodged I think).\n\nLike others have said I find sleeping on a reclining chair or on a bed where my upper half is raised at a 45 degree angle really helps in the meantime.", "Dizziness in the morning Hello so sometimes when I get up too quickly in the morning, I get dizzy. I dont know what it is because I have done blood tests and checked if I had ear problems that could cause this, but Everything's ok. Why does it happen sometimes? I would like to know This is not BPPV. If you ever have BPPV you will immediately recognize the difference between it and what you are describing here.\n\nIt sound like you have ( which can have many causes. It sounds like you should keep talking to your doctor about whether it is serious, or if you should just take it easy when you get up.", "Why should the maneuvers be done multiple times? Hi everyone! Glad I found this community because the information found online is sparse, repetitive, and sort of dismissive of the person\u2019s experience.\n\nI have suspected left ear BPPV. The physiotherapist recommended Epley twice a day.\n\nI was wondering what is the point doing the maneuvers multiple times. Is it just so to increase the chances of the crystals going back to the right place? So you do a maneuver and it fails, keep repeating until it works. \n\nOr, do the maneuvers work gradually because the crystal is comprised of multiple parts? Each time you do it, a part settles but more remain.\n\nI lean towards the first idea. As I worked with my therapist doing the maneuver.... We always did it twice. The second time, it was essentially to see if the first time worked. If she laid me back &amp; the vertigo was still there.... She would continue with the entire epley. Then I would take a break for a week.... In hopes the second time worked. When if go back, it was the same. Lay me back to check to see if the vertigo was still there. If it was, continue with the Epley. Wait a bit, then try it again. If &amp; when you finally do not have the vertigo anymore, then you no longer do it.\n\nFor some people, it only takes one maneuver to clear it. For me, it took over 20 (over the course of two months).\n\nAfter a successful epley, it is recommended you stay upright as much as possible to let the crystal settle. Thank you for responding!\n\nInteresting! I felt much better yesterday after Epley and throught I was fine as I could not induce the vertigo. However, in the process of doing Dix and the Epley again, I probably disturbed it again.\n\nAnd to clarify, even if the Epley was successful during your session, the progress may be lost by next week due to body movements throughout the week? Due to older studies this could be correct... That you could disturb the crystal if you do not allow it time to settle. My therapist contradicted this with more current studies &amp; told me you can get back to normal activities right away, as tolerated. I actually have no idea at what point my crystal was cleared, so obviously was not careful. I still felt horrible that entire week (after my session with her) and did the Epley at home mid week, along with the half somersault (as that maneuver never provokes the vertigo as bad). When I went back to her she laid me back &amp; no symptoms. Even though the positional vertigo was gone... I was still very dizzy &amp; felt horrible. I saw her for two more weeks &amp; she tested all 6 ear canals again, as I was certain I still had bppv. Still tested negative. It was a long road to recovery! This gives me hope. I went to the ER a week ago after having a long episode of vertigo. Been performing Epley at home after doing physical therapy this week. I feel disequilibrium and it is depressing. Just going to continue to Epley until it is gone. Best wishes to you! It is truly no fun. And I still fear every day that it is going to return.", "A bit discouraged. Therapist cannot get the crystals to get out of the way either. So I caved and took everyone is recommendation and went to a vestibular therapist today, and not even he can get the crystal to move out of the way. We tried 6 times and it moves like it is supposed to and then dead stop during the final movements it just will not complete the maneuver, and we are back at square one and he said I am a \u201ccomplicated\u201d case. \n\n\nI go back Friday but I am so disappointed that I got no relief at all today. \n\nFriday marks 6 weeks. I am exhausted aaaaand my stomach hurts. I have never had this much difficulty before. I am sad for you. So similar to my journey. Hang in there! Mine was a super stubborn case too (you will see details in my other reply to you). You will get it! Try to be positive &amp; patient. You have already had it so long.... It may take longer to fix. At least you have a specialist helping you out. Fingers crossed Friday goes better for you! What maneuver did they do? In my experience they only do one... Which is the epley maneuver and that does not work for everybody because not everybody's crystal is lodged in the same place. I ended up doing the barbecue roll for mine, and another time I did the half somersault and those worked for me. They are detailed on YouTube. Yeah the epley does not work in fact makes me worse which I informed him ahead of time so we started doing the barbecue roll. But it just will not stick we lost count how many times we tried it lol but trying again Friday before I go to pieces. Mine is up and down not left to right so everyone is frustrated that it will not stick and that the usual fix all is not fixing me. Sigh Yeah definitely. He seemed super stressed because he could not get it and he was so used to the epley being the fix all. But since mine is only up and down, mostly down and then constant unsteady when uptight he is not sure where the hell the crystals are. \n\nNo epley for this girl unfortunately. I left almost crying and still dizzy I was sooooo hoping it would work/ ugh. But thank you! I had my crying fit for the day and we will try again Friday. I am so sorry this is happening to you. A thank you. I really appreciate it. I feel like a sad little kid haha I just want to crawl up in someone is lap but I am trying to just endure and hope something works. I was a stubborn case too, the place I went was a Dizzy and Balance Center. They ended up using some vibrating thing behind my ear while doing the maneuver to get the crystal to move completely. I hope you can find something that helps. Thank you. If these guys cannot get it to go I am just going to have to shell out the little bit of cash I got and go to a dizzy clinic. There is one by me but of course closed cause of covid. That is the next stop. After my first session with my PT, well actually it was the second, as the first time she did MANY tests to see exactly which ear canal was effected, and I had the goggles on so she could see the nystagmus better - she did the Epley twice and is like 'There - you are cured, go about your normal life and be happy! Come see me in a week.'  I went back a week later and when she laid me back, she was just crushed that the symptoms were still there. Hmmm.  She quickly turned on her super happy positive mode and we did the Epley two more times and she said sometimes it is stubborn.  Little did we know.....just how stubborn it was.\n\nDid your therapist test ALL 6 inner ear canals to pinpoint which was effected?  Did he do any other tests, like for vestibular migraines, gaze instability, meneires (and there are a bunch more)? Did he give you any balance/vestibular exercises to start doing (not maneuvers to get the crystals back in place, but head and eye movement exercises to help with the dizziness/balance)?  Oops - maybe you posted this info - I better go read the rest of your post! I had the same thing happen! I was so distraught thinking I would just be sick and dizzy for ever. The only thing to work is to take Benadryl when I start to feel a little wobbly. So far, its worked 100% of the time. Give it a try? I got BPPV about 2 weeks ago. I had the Epley maneuver done probably 10 times and the BBQ roll about four times. I am still dizzy and it is exacerbated my panic disorder so I can barely be treated now. My right ear is scabbed from only sleeping on that side.\nI am scared too. Hang in there. Omg I am so sorry you are going through this too. This is hell. My anxiety has been shot through the roof because of this. And each time they cannot get it fixed it gets even worse on the anxiety end.", "Do not think I have BPPV, but maybe someone here could help me out? I have had recurring bouts of vertigo of varying degrees and frequency for over ten years now. (I am 26). However, I do not think it is BPPV from what I have read about it. It does not seem to have much to do with tilting my head or sitting up/lying down, and it is very irregular. \n\nI experience three main types of vertigo: 1. very mild and more frequent dizziness that might happen when I stand up too quickly or turn my head really quickly; 2. more intense and less frequent vertigo that feels like I am walking down the aisle of a plane during mild turbulence (like the ground is moving up at me), and which happens for like three days after I fly on an actual plane, or for a few moments after I get off at the \\~10th floor from an elevator; and 3. really intense vertigo that feels like I am rolling down a steep hill, where I cannot move my head half an inch without feeling like I will throw up, which has happened twice in the past 10 years and might be related to being dehydrated, maybe (that is what a doctor told me the first time)? \n\nI also have experienced \"exploding head syndrome,\" which is basically a kind of sleep-related auditory hallucination (in my case, I hear loud buzzing occasionally when almost asleep). I do not have a history of ear infections. This was the only vertigo-related subreddit I could find. Any ideas? Considering we do not actually know what causes BPPV to happen (We know that the crystals moving around causes it, but we do not really know why they escape - Ear infections and a few other things can do it too) I would say all lot of this sounds like what I go through. The thing for me is the snap back vision, where in your eyes have nystagmus (involuntary movement) which is a tell tale sign of something being bppv.  \n\n\nI recently just got BPPV again and feel constantly a little dizzy and off balance even when perfectly still. I have both full on snap back vision (when the room basically resets rapidly, due to the eye movement, though nystagmus is not always present) on both sides. A few days ago, I could lay on either side with only the mild dizziness all day. Woke up after being on my left side for a few hours and it hit.  \n\n\nI think BPPV can manifest in various ways. For some it is laying down or laying on the affected side. For others, looking down does it, getting up does it.   \nThe crappy thing is that I would gather for most people, since it can be a very intense and disorienting sensation, their anxiety kicks in. Even if they do not have an anxiety disorder, anxiety can make you feel dizzy and other strange sensations. Blood pressure can also drop with anxiety response, which also causes dizziness. It is entirely possible that all three are a combo of anxiety, bppv and blood pressure drops (getting up too quick, or turning head too quick.)   \nWhen I am about to fall asleep, I get a jolt sensation which amps up my adrenaline and I feel like I am falling backwards or through the bed. Not like a hypnic jerk though, it is definitely due to my recent bout of vertigo as it is somewhat more predictable and I do not need to even feel that tired. \n\nAuditory hallucinations along with everything else you said makes me think it might be an inner ear problem (infection, inflammation etc), along with bppv, which would explain the different levels of vertigo and the seemingly not totally predictable triggers.\n\nI would definitely talk to a doctor and get examined for what might be the causes and what you can do.\n\nI will be doing the same, because some of my symptoms do not classically fit bppv, and others fit it to a T. I was going to write as well, but you just covered it all!! This could indeed be BPPV.\n\nYou mention it happens after a flight. Mine did too. You mentioned it being triggered by head movements or getting up quickly. \n\nDo not see any doctor or ENT. I suggest you see a therapist who specializes in vestibular disorders or go to a local balance center.  thanks for the response. I do not experience any snap back vision, but do have low blood pressure, so maybe that is a contributing factor? I will bring it up to a doctor. the thing is, my vertigo does not really make me feel bad that much, except for the severe cases I get occasionally. I just feel a little dizzy or like my equilibrium is off, but not anxious or nauseous. but it is just so consistent that it becomes kind of frustrating or worrying thanks for the advice. I have mentioned it to doctors in the past and they have just chalked it up to the way my ears \"naturally are,\" or allergies and sinus stuff. I will look into specialists I recently read that the ears are connected to the blood, meaning when they detect which way gravity is putting pressure on you, they signal to the brain on blood flow to compensate. At least, that is what I understood, so I could be wrong. But if that is the case, it would make a lot of sense if you and any of us with this issue that does not feel quite like bppv but something more might have inflammation or infection in the inner ear and it is sending false gravity signals to the brain about how to control the blood. Which would explain low blood pressure, maybe. I could be totally wrong.\nEven if I am totally off, we do know that low blood pressure makes one feel dizzy, because the brain is not getting blood fast enough and it kind of pools in the legs. Another reason to get up if you lay down or sit a lot every half hour or so to stretch.\nAt least you are not alone. I have not had a full vertigo spell in a day as I have skipped exercise for the time being, but all day I have mild dizzyness, mild nausea and feel off balance, like someone is trying to gently tip me over even when I do not move at all and my head is supported.  I may not be a doc, but that answer of \"That is how they naturally are\" is just kind of waving it away. Being off balance and dizzy sucks and can be very frightening and in the case of a fall, actually dangerous. Definitely seek a second opinion and specialists.", "Anyone taking anti depressants? Husband is at almost three months struggling with BPPV. Has done everything in terms of BPPV physical therapy and has reached a threshold of recovery but is still not back to normal.

He is exhausted because everything he used to do with work requires more thinking due to BPPV. \n\nHis mental health has taken a terrible hit and he is very depressed.

It is basically a disability, although I do not know if it is considered so --- certainly the mental health aspect is recognized. I know the BPPV might not affect him every day - but even if he could take a couple of weeks to de-stress, chill and be good to himself, sleep &amp; eat well, that might help. Maybe it is time to take some vacation days or personal days?  \n\n\nI was prescribed an anti-anxiety med (aka antidepressant?) for my BPPV (Citalopram). I am taking it because at the near-year mark of my BPPV I was desperate to try anything.  I think it has helped, although anxiety was a trigger for me.

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Bppv is when you have violent spinning for 20-40 seconds.   You get nystagmus in your eyes and the room spins.  This does not sound like it.  But go see primary doctor if you cannot see ENT right if way.  Most primary docs have seen bppv hundreds of times.  Then ask your primary doc to refer you to both an ENT and just as important a vestibular therapist.  Vestibular therapists (really just a physical therapist with some dizzinesses training) are a godsend.  They help you help yourself in fixing, managing and maybe even preventing stuff. It could be. I have suffered from\nBppv for over 25 years and it is not always super violent spinning. Sometimes it is just an unsteady \u201comg I am falling\u201d feeling. Could be that you have just a few otoconia out of place in your left ear. It definitely does not feel like violent spins....that I am aware of.  I usually pop up out of bed trying to get it to pass and feel it for a good 20 seconds to couple minutes.  It just seems to be positional is why bppv came to mind, not sure what else it could be. That is \"good\"? To know lol. From the previous poster and most of what I have read online it says strong spins and I do not feel it is quite \"strong or violent\"  just crazy how it happens when I go to my left side in particular.  I am prone to ear problems and do get dips in my blood sugar but this seems to be positional only. A bit of a late reply but I am an anxiety sufferer and this sounds a lot like something I get ! Have a read of these two links and see if this describes what you feel !\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nStress and anxiety can cause symptoms even when you do not feel particularly stressed/anxious as your body can be hyperstimulated. An appointment with your doctor would be best to find the real root cause but this could be something to consider :)", "I wanted to know if this is vertigo or something else. It has been goin on for a year now I get these sudden spells of dizziness like the room was tilting ro one side and even lying down I still feel as if I am spinning. It normally occured once or twice a month so I never payed too much attention I would normally just ride it out and sleep it off. But for the past few days I feel like I have been getting consistant, although mild, dizziness and some parts of the day where it would spike up and becom intense. I cannot think of anything that could cause it. I drink alot of water and eat the same. it might be due to my bad sleep but I have friends that pull all nighters and are fine (coordination wise). I looked up my symptoms online and it seems like the only thing that links up with my symptoms is vertigo but it is worrisome that I am experiencing this at 15 years old and that most people experience this is their elderly years. I also get cold sweats when i experience my intense episodes of dizzy spells maybe that might point towards something. Just because your friends can get by with bad sleep patterns does not mean you can! Bodies are all different, chemically and biologically. Some people can treat their bodies like shit and others are WAY more sensitive. So you need to think of your body a bit differently here, you are not your friends. You will find probably over the next 20 years you will be figuring out what exactly your body wants in terms of sleep &amp; nutrition etc. It is like an engine and you got to figure out how to keep it in tip top shape. \n\nSo yeah, the sensation of spinning is vertigo. \n\n15 years old is when I got my first vertigo tbh, it was near my first period. Are you M or F? \n\nHormones are a huuuuge vertigo factor. H u g e.\nAny history of headaches or migraine/visual stuff?\n\nThere are lots of diff causes of vertigo but the main ones appear to be:\n\n- bppv (ear issue)\n- vestibular migraine (brain issue)\n- vestibular neuritis (I assume ear but I have not researched this one)\n- M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease (unlikely for you) Vertigo comes in different forms though, as /u/katerinavauban mentions. If possible, try to find a doctor/therapist that specializes in vertigo and dizziness. Or even a dizzy clinic. I have found that although some ENT's or neurologists can provide a good diagnosis and care, many can not. If you have a lingering case of BPPV, some of these symptoms could go with it. There was just a video posted of someone doing the Dix Hallpike maneuver (this is an easy maneuver that docs use to start the process of diagnosing BPPV). If you lay back (you will need to test both the left and right), and within a minute get the severe vertigo with nystagmus (eye twitching), you know it is a form of BPPV. You can google Dix Hallpike, and also search for the video.  Otherwise please go seek help so that you can get to the bottom of your vertigo. Hopefully it is nothing serious. But the quicker you get on top of it, the better! And if it IS BPPV you can work on doing the Epley maneuver to clear it. A specialist will put goggles on you to watch your eye movement and determine which ear canal is effected. And there are different maneuvers used to clear the crystal out of different ear canals. The Epley is the most common, for the most common ear canal effected. Best wishes to you! Keep us posted on your progress. If the vertigo isnt repeatable with specific movements it is not bppv. Other causes can be migraine (even without the typical headache), hormones, blood pressure or vestibular nerve inflammation/damage. You should find a clinic that specializes in dizzieness so they can properly diagnose you. Commenting because I have been having the exact same issues recently. I got it real bad one day last month while on a long walk with my wife, and since then it is still mildly lingering. Some days I do not have it at all, and others it lasts all day. I can still function at work and home, but it is still there and I think I am just getting used to it (which does not make it easier by any means). I am wondering if it is possible for this to happen seasonally. I always seem to have it when the weather gets hot. But this year has been especially bad for me.", "How does you BPPV feel throughout the day? Mornings and nights are the worst for me. During the day I was able to cycle to my physio appointment and do some exercise. I actually found walking more difficult then biking (very curious). I do feel scared to bike though so I stick to protected bike lanes and go slower then normal. When walking I sort of feel floaty like on a boat on a nice day to being out on a slightly windy day.\n\nIn the morning everything spins and I stumble to get out of bed. I now take it more slowly. Sitting first, and then standing up.\n\nAt night, position changes (from one side to the other) can actually wake me up. Meanwhile, moving from side to back and vice versa causes mild vertigo.\n\nIn the evening I feel worse then during the day but much better then the morning.\n\nHow do you feel? Are mornings also more difficult for you? When my BPPV was active I found it got worse towards the end of the day as I was getting tired. I also found that without natural sunlight that the floating / dizziness / lightheadedness feeling would be worst as my eyes were providing reference but struggled to do so in a dark room such as when going to bed. \n\nMy last bout of BPPV took a month to resolve with PT and exercises and I am now back to balance exercises to keep my residual dizziness in check.\n\nKeep up the PT work \ud83d\udc4d Thank you for sharing your experience.

The streets look gorgeous but they have a lot of contrast, too much even.\nYour comment helps me keep my spirits up because this is such an unsettling feeling. Cannot wait for it to subside. Exactly the same as you. Worse in the mornings and nights. Feel floaty and detached from reality most of the day.

She did not even look in my ears, she just gave me a printout of Epley's home maneuvers. And this makes me worry a little bit that my diagnosis is more self diagnosis and what if something is being missed.\n \nNow I have experienced symptoms that definitely seem BPPV like vertigo when tilting my head. And I have had past ear problems (chronic labyrinthitis over 20 years ago, having to fly with a bad respiratory infection just last year, frequent allergies, etc). \n \nOne of the symptoms that I do experience that I am not sure is BPPV is a frequent location of my my vertigo. Lately I have been feeling it at the back of my head at points where I am not even moving my head that much (like while driving straight). It just seems different from my other symptoms so I am wondering if this is common for other folk with BPPV. Not sure if this is the same, but looking up and to the left was my trigger. Easiest to make happen when I was in bed.\n\nCould you possibly be dehydrated? That appears to be the fix for me and many others. Oh, that is interesting. Not only am I chronically bad with drinking, but I have also restarted my keto diet and that tends to make you lose more water. Thanks, you have given me ideas! You are delightfully open-minded.

So after having every single BPPV symptom for 2 weeks, I finally got a diagnosis today. My provided performed the maneuver that I keep seeing (I forgot the name already). One symptom I am not seeing as often is pressure in the head whenever changing positions. Kind of like someone is squeezing my head. It usually hits worse when I lay down on my stomach and makes me dizzy. It is definitely gotten better since my appointment today but it is still there. Is this a normal symptom with BPPV? Thanks! Not saying I do not trust my provider! We just talked about the dizziness more than the pressure. I think the pressure can be a normal sensation for bppv.  Everyone is vestibular system is going to handle the problem differently.  Think of how hard tour brain is working when it is trying to normalize the dizziness and vertigo.  I often feel head pressure and pressure in my affected ear, especially when my symptoms are high.  A great book if you have any continued problems is rock steady by Joey remenyi.  Sounds like you are on the right path!  Good luck! Thank you for the response!\n\nSo I have had vertigo before. The kind you get after riding a rollercoaster. Is BPPV just that but on steroids? I am trying to learn haha So after a successful reset your brain is going to need time to recalibrate itself back to normal. It is expected to feel residual dizziness, pressure, fog, or just a general \"off\" feeling for some time until this happens. The longer you let bppv go before doing the epley maneuver, the longer the recovery will likely take. \n\nDo not panic, the residual \"off\" feeling is temporary, expected, and will go away. Be sure to go outside and take walks, look around at stuff, do not just sit perfectly still. If you get vertigo again then that means the epley maneuver did not get all the crystals back, just do it again.

(Kicking myself that I did not just go fix it sooner). I was wondering if anyone experienced feeling off/fatigue for awhile after treatment, and how long until you felt normal again.  Thanks! :) I still get the occasional woozy light headed feeling after not having a full on bppv episode in the last 6 months. The woozy feeling can bring on depressive emotions. Thanks for the reply! How long until you were able to sleep regular again?

I do not have any more vertigo with head movements. Feel much better actually. Just have this lingering off feeling and headache. I am glad you are still doing well post 6 months!

I have had bppv before and since it was mild it did not think too much of it...come the next day I had the worst episode of my life. Not saying it is, but it may be a precursor to a larger episode. My minor bouts of dizziness happened through a few days before it grew worse. \n\nI always keep dramamine or my meclizine on hand just in case now. Definitely speak with your Dr. And get his opinion as well. It sounds maybe like vertigo, but it does not sound like BPPV to me. With BPPV an intense dizzy feeling is triggered by turning the head in one direction. It does not happen when you are stationary. Usually BPPV is positional like moving head position, standing or sitting, etc. It could be low blood sugar, low blood pressure, eustasean tube disfunction (especially if you have allergies) or as the previous poster said the beginnings of vertigo. I would note when it is happening and also what it feels like ie do you feel like you are on a boat or general dizziness and then call your doctor. \n\nIf it is not persistent and effecting your life, I would personally wait for an in person visit and get a check up once the pandemic has cooled down in your area :)\n\nGood luck! Earlier today it happened when I turned my head. Specially when I was laying on my side. It is happened when I have looked downward and up as well. \n\nI was just stating a time where it happened while I was stationary. Thank you for your reply! Like I said in my post it only happens once a month or so - if that. Not very often at all. And it does happen while I am moving, specially laying on my side or pointing my head down or up. I sure hope it is not leading up to a larger episode :( but thank you for your input! I hate saying it, but better to be prepared than not at all imo. Ooh ok! May very well be vertigo :) you can actually tell by performing the first part of the Epley maneuver on both sides. Have someone check your eyes and if they are twitching back and forth it is vertigo. The Epley can make the vertigo worse at first, but completing the maneuver should improve it. Oh no you are definitely right. Oh I did not know the Epley maneuver was based off of your eye movement. I read online that it was just based off of if you feel the vertigo while preforming it but the information was probably wrong. When I did the maneuver I did experience vertigo but I did not have anyone look at my eyes. I will try it tonight and see! \n\nThanks for your help :) Look into Vestibular Nueritis!", "first experience last night/today. Ummmmmm\n\ndoes this happen every day or .. ???\n\nLOL this shit is a nightmare! i had my first dizzy spell when i was drinking late last night. i thought, huh? ive only had two glasses of wine? wtf? i almost fell over? when i tried to get up this morning, i stood up and almost fell out of bed. i thought, damn, i must be hungover from those two glasses of wine. i must be a lightweight now. i made an appointment with my doctor anyways and saw her an hour later. she mentioned the word vertigo and i immediately recognized it and said YEP THAT IS THE FEELING! it is like lucille 2 on arrested development. however liza acts, that is how i feel. wow. i was sent home with some motion sickness meds and exercises to try. i still did not really believe there was anything wrong with me until i was at home and i tried to get up from my couch - damn. almost fuckin felll over. the room spun like it did the other times. screamed for my boyfriend and could not move. i moved to the bed and propped myself upright. googled the exercise to do. moved my head back and forth at different angles and felt sand sifting back and forth in my skull. a brand new feeling i had never felt in my entire life. after i did the exercise i felt like i was going to throw up. for 5 hours. i couldnt look at my computer or phone. i had to just lay there and breathe. \n\ni literally have been struggling with my health all year. i have carpal tunnel in both wrists, had a molar pulled after an infection, and a laparoscopy to remove endometriosis and a cyst from my abdomen. (2 weeks ago!) i am fuckin done with this shit. i am so stressed out. \n\nthat was THE MOST frightening experience of my life. and now i have to do another exercise before bed...wish me luck. If the dizzy spells dont go away soon, I suggest you visit a balance center. Wow this sounds horrible. I have to say, after living with my dizzy/balance issues for 6+ years, it was not until 2 years ago when I found a PT that specialised in balance disorders that I actually felt like I was talking to someone who understood what I was going through. Everyone else was a waste of time... they just diagnosed me as having Anxiety :/", "Anyone tried acupuncture or Chinese medicine to treat symptoms? I have read acupuncture and Chinese medicine could help treat vertigo. The pills I received from my family doctor do not seem to have any effect on me. I am getting desperate to find relief. \n Just tried Accupuncture for bppv and it did not seem to help much. Hard to tell. I was worse the next day but much better the day after that. ", "Anyone else got vestibular damage? Some have followed my story about my initial attack of vertigo that my body never seemingly recovered from. \n\nMonth 5 now, just had VNG testing done to assess my ears. \nLeft side is damaged, I am not sure exact percentage. But I still had some reaction so it is not totally dead. \n\nCried like a baby anyway lol. \nAny one else got damage too? Or did I just get the shit end of the stick? No damage diagnosis but that is what I am concerned about. I am supposed to go to vtr rehab, but having a difficult time reaching them. \n\nUp until June the episodes were short, then I experienced 1.5 days where the first episode was about 4hrs and subsequent ones were 1-1.5hrs. Dr says that is not just BPPV because it would pass in seconds. Still have shorter ones too but those long ones are scary AF!\n\nAre you experiencing headaches as well? Before the really bad long episodes I experience really bad headaches before and after on the back bottom of my skull. UGH, the VNG test was HORRIBLE. I would not wish that upon my worst enemy! I was told that I have a 20% deficit in my left ear. It is a total bummer... but you eventually get somewhat used to it. I have heard that a good vestibular physical therapist can do work miracles for some. ... Oh and from the way that I understand it, the more that you DO have a response during the VNG test, it shows you are healthy.  A normal person will have a spinning response. An ear with vestibular damage will spin less. At least that was my experience... The technician did not share my enthusiasm when I said I did not have a response on my left side. Then my right side, which I was sure would be a breeze because it is healthy, was absolutely horrible. Ugh. Hugs from afar, homie. The actual vertigo I had left after about 3 days but I am stuck in some sick form of residual dizziness, it is driving me nuts! And yes! At the very back right where your skull meets up with your spine, that area will get really inflamed feeling and tender and I will get a headache shortly after. Thank you! I just started going to vrt about 2 weeks ago my head is just like on a rocking swaying boat constantly. \nI had some spinning in my bad ear but very little and my right ear spun like crazy obviously healthy. \nAll the technician said was well \u201cAtleast the nerve is not completely dead so there might be some hope\u201dI was like f-n great that is wonderful. Lol I never want to do that test again. I feel like I can live out the rest of my life in peace... as long as I never have to do that test again. I am hoping that your therapy helps make some improvement! Please share updates if you find and relief/success with anything. it feels normal now but the back/base of my head was swollen during the dizziness this past weekend. \n\nAnother thing I am concerned about, the dr did not ask me about fluid from the ear but this page ( shows a concern about it. I did not notice until it was dried I am also suffering after a vertigo episode hit me the first time I went to bed and woke up normal the next day but when the second episode hit me I woke up dizzy like on a boat that constantly rocking and it is been about 2 months since it started. Ughhhh I am so sorry I would not want anyone else to go through this my stress is through the roof lol I have unilateral vestibular damage as well. Think it was 20% for me so quite mild. \n\nVestibular rehabilitation is indispensable. Honestly I wanted to do more than my vestibular specialist recommended and she was herself surprised as to the progress. \n\nI would recommend you check your eyes before you start just to make sure you are syncing systems that are actually independently optimal (you are basically trying to re coordinate your eyes with your ears). \n\nThe rotary chair worked wonders for me paired with platform training. At home gaze stabilisation exercises as well. The dynamic component is more challenging (head moving) as opposed to the static one (standing on a foam board/on one leg etc).\n\nFrom what I remember in various papers the outcome is good with most people achieving normal functionality - the brain is amazing!! Okay! Thank you. I am not sure of my percentage yet and got quite down as I have gone 8 times and only one symptom went away. My eyes are definitely out of sync because my balance is pretty much perfect standing still but if I start to move my head or do eye movements the boat sensation gets horrid. And one eye is blurry and \u201creacts slower\u201d so something is not syncing up. I will keep trying the eye exercises and see if it starts to improve. If one eye reacts slower make sure you do not have a lazy eye! Vestibular symptoms can exacerbate such eye weaknesses.\n\nAnd do not worry, it takes time to retrain your brain - vestibular rehab works but is the long game. That is so funny you say that because I have always told my friends in pictures of myself that I swore I had a lazy eye \ud83d\ude02 i just might get to tell them all I told you so. \nThe most annoying symptoms I have now are the rocking and the occolopsia (eye shaking) when I first wake up that scares the daylights out of me and I noticed it happens when I wake up unintentionally on my bad ear. Ugh I am trying to be patient. Thank you. I was just diagnosed with Labrynthine Dysfunction right ear. Advanced Vestibular Treatment was recommended. It is very costly even after meeting my deductible.($2000 for 7 weeks of treatment.) Has anyone experienced AVT?", "Persistent Dizziness after BPPV? Has anybody had persistent (non-vertiginous) dizziness after having BPPV? Like, the BPPV and vertigo has been fixed but persistent dizziness has stayed? I presented with BPPV a while ago and since then the vertigo has cleared up but the persistent dizziness has not. I am wondering if other people have had a similar experience. Yes, many people seem to be experiencing residual dizziness. There are quite a few recent posts regarding it if you scroll through or do a search on residual dizziness. I am on month 3 of dealing with it &amp; have exercises from my vestibular therapist that help. You can search my posts as well for more details. Absolutely yes. It sucks. However, I have found that a couple things helped me get rid of it.\n\n#1. Do not let it hinder your days. Go on as you would normally. It helps your vestibular system readjust. A lot of sitting down and laying around makes it worse.\n\n#2. Do all kinds of balance exercises. At least once or twice a day.\n\n#3. Make sure you are getting the recommended amount of water, and eat well.\n\n#4. Try doing the Brandt-Daroff exercises if you can. \n\n#5. Try not to let yourself get too stressed.\n\n#6. Give it time, I know after a while it feels like it is just never going to go away and something else is wrong, but you just have to let your body readjust. What specific therapy activities have you found to be helpful, if you do not mind me asking?\n\nHave you ever heard of persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD)? Thank you, I actually had BPPV a long time ago and it is just the dizziness that is been hanging on for the past few years now, so I am curious about other peoples' experiences. I have heard of PPPD but am not super familiar with it. There are others on the forum that know quite a bit about it.\n\nThe exercises I got are basically to retrain your balance system. Move your head up &amp; down 15 times &amp; do it 3 times a day. Then focus on your thumb held out in front of you at arms length and move your head up &amp; down 15 times (3 times a day). Now do same exercises but moving head sideways (without focusing on anything &amp; then focusing on thumb). Once this does not cause dizziness anymore (in a week or two... Or a few days) start doing this while walking. I eventually did it while running... But only because I am a runner. Basically you want to challenge the dizziness so your vestibular system adapts to being normal again. Eventually if I looked diagonally I would get a wave of dizziness too.... So I did those exercises looking diagonally.\n\nThe best thing you can do is to get moving again. You will feel crummy at times.... But in the end, hopefully it helps. I had BPPV for over t we I months so that may be why my residual dizziness is taking so long to go away. Some days are better than others. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. Yes, I have had dizziness now for 12 years so I understand the struggle. Some days are better than others. Thanks for the input, I will take a look at some of the other posts. Yes. I woke up from the middle of a dream with pretty bad spinning/vertigo and now I have had residual dizziness since it happened, which was last September. I am fairly certain I developed PPPD as a result of the traumatizing incident. I am feeling so hopeless and depressed because it is been like 8 months now. Others have said it takes like two years to plateau. I want to be dead. Yes been diagnosed with Pppd after continuous vestibular migraines.... apparently\n\nI am in a constant state of sway, rocking, like I am on a boat and tinnitus.\n\nMal de debarkement has also been mentioned.\n\nHave to do vrt, start back on amitriptyline and keep my ADHD on church as it is strongly linked to my mood/anxiety...\n\n\nFor me, a huge reliance on my visual system for balance apparently.\n\nLots of headaches and cognitive fog and fatigue Yep yep. My residual dizziness lasted a little over 2 months. \nVestibular rehabilitation exercises helped get that sorted out /u/mcurri02 this is all awesome advice!!!! These are things that I also need to remind myself of daily as I work through the residual dizziness. Oh dear - 12 years?!?!  I thought my 3 months was a long time. As you mentioned, perhaps it is something slightly different than residual dizziness. Because I surely hope this does not last a life time for me.  Have you gone to a vestibular specialist or a place that specializes in dizziness?  I would seriously think about getting re-evaluated at this point. This was my pattern too. As a kid I would wake up with vertigo then one day it transitioned into persistent dizziness that never went away. I never had a single issue with dizziness/vertigo until last year. I am a 26 year old male. Ugh. I fucking hate this. I am so sorry you have been going through it for so much longer than me. I cannot believe it fucked me up after just one episode.\n\nThis might be a weird question but can you describe the dreams you were having when you would wake up with vertigo if you remember them? I am curious if theyre anything like mine was. Its been so long but I do not think I had dreams. I may have woken up with a start with an extreme sensation of vertigo, but again this is so long ago. Now I am just left with feeling imbalanced all the time. I am also a 26 year old male. \n\nThe vertigo was positional, so if I stayed in one position I would be fine but if I went to move it would hit me. Ah okay. Thanks for the response. Sorry again that you have dealt with this for so long. I hope one day there will be a cure.", "Sometimes things that should be obvious are not, so I thought I would share-- If this is obvious to you, please feel free to ignore, but if you are like me and do not always realize until it is too late...have I got a story for you!\n\nI normally sleep on a spring mattress and I do not always use pillows under my head. So, I am not sleeping in my own bed this weekend--the bed I am in has a thick memory foam topper. I forgot my pillow on the couch and figured, no big deal.\n\nWRONG.\n\nI was very wrong. Turns out no matter how I try to sleep my head sinks too deeply in the memory foam and after trying 3 positions I was experiencing enough vertigo and nausea to need to get up. I am now properly supported on the couch, I have ginger in my system and I am hoping that it is a short lived incident because I do not have time to deal with days of vertigo right now. So\u2026 your head was hanging lower than your body in a way? Interesting Go see an ENT or Balance or chiropractor (make sure they have the special glasses) a d have them check you for your crystals being out of position. Get it before it gets worse Trust me I would love to but I am uninsured and poor (just exactly not poor enough for medicaid). I have gotten through more than 20 years of this with OTC meds and at home exercises. I appreciate your concern though, if this was new I would high tail it to a doctor with a sliding scale. Liquid vitamin C 1000 MG, Liquid vitamin B12 200,000 %, B Complex, Magnesium\u2026 every couple days will do wanders\u2026 and sunlight 20 minutes minimum a day All good for nervous system and overall health Nervous system is permanently trashed due to life-long medical condition. I do my best to treat it at home and to be honest, there is not too much help for it at this point beyond surgery that I will not have (because I do not feel the benefits outweigh the risks) and a handful of meds I cannot afford that would not make that much difference.\n\nOverall health is fair, obviously having limited medical care and chronic conditions is not ideal. I honestly do my best to eat healthily and supplement where and when I can (I am writing down your suggestions from above but liquids might not be in the budget as my budget is Walmart Spring Valleyq, Costco deals and occasional BOGO deals.) I am saving up for an eye exam because it is been far too long but I never had success in 10 years of near constant ophthalmology appointments. So I do not have much hope but I at least plan to try. Keep the smile \ud83d\ude0a it is the most important asset you have.. and it is free \ud83d\udc4d", "sneezing?? has anyone else gotten vertigo shortly after sneezing?? sometimes for me it even starts a vertigo attack &amp; the room starts spinning.", "I have been told I had BPPV before. Is this it ? Hi guys I was diagnosed with it two years ago. Last night I turned my head to the right quite awkwardly and I remember the dizziness waking me up. My eyes were moving all over the place and it happened again just not as intense on the same side. I have woken up today and I felt a bit dizzy turning my head. The worst one for me is lying on your back and then coming up to a sitting position it usually makes me dizzy for 40 seconds. I also have health anxiety so dizziness scares the hell out of me ! Does this sound like BPPV ? It is similar to my experience, find a dr or physical therapist who can confirm and then do an Epley maneuver and readjust your crystals. Sure sounds like it.  If you have done the epley before you can try doing it.  You can watch YouTube videos on the dix hallpike to figure out which ear it is and then do the epley for that side.  If you have someone to help you it will help with the anxiety because you will experience the vertigo.  I often do it a couple of times and then I do it before bed every day for a few days and sleep on my back propped up on a couple pillows.  It will get better!", "How to ease residual dizziness? Hello, so I had first episode of BPPV (hopefully the last too) and was able to self diagnose and do the half somersault movement thanks to this group. Was able to see an ENT that morning too to confirm even if I did not have vertigo anymore at time. \n\nNow just want to ask when the dizziness will go away? The world\u2019s not spinning anymore when I move my head but there is constant dizziness, like motion sickness. I cannot eat and have ongoing dull headache. ENT gave me betahistine but have not really felt it working since I still feel so dizzy. \n\nThank you! Unfortunately the residual dizziness can linger for a fee days up to a few months.  It will diminish in severity, but may hang on.  Research shows it may be related to how Ling your ear crystals were misplaced, as now your brain has to compensate for your new normal.  I have had 2 episodes that had residual dizziness that lasted 3 to 5 months.  I have done vestibular rehab both times to speed up the healing process Oh wow that sucks you have went through this twice and with such long effects! Hoping I can get through this as soon as possible since it is been impossible to do anything like work and care for my child. I would suggest that you try to push yourself to do things and start pt as soon as you can.  It seems that helps with being comfortable doing basic things.  The veda website has some great info on it that may help you.  Best of luck to you! I am currently in PT for BPPV that I had for roughly 2 weeks. I have had residual dizziness for 3 weeks now. I have a good day and then a bad day. Good day then bad day...but PT has been great and speaking to a professional who specializes in vestibular rehab has increased my progress and eased my VERY anxious brain.\n\nI do not have a timeline on how long RD will last but I know working with a PT helped me. Wish the best for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT I also suggest trying to get back to your normal life as much as possible. Once your crystals are put back into its rightful place your brain needs to re-train itself on how to balance in world. Go on a walk if you can. Look up and down and side to side. Take in as much information as you can (safetly, of course). Doing that has helped me a lot in my recovery.  seconded what the other use mentioned about getting back to normal. This was told to me by my physio. He said holding yourself back will actually delay the recovery process. Of course I am not a doctor, only repeating what I was told, so please be mindful and do your own research in that regard! I wish you great luck with getting better. Do not worry - it will get better!\n\nI would also like to link to you a post I made about some things I learned about BPPV. Namely, my ENT informed me that consumption of caffeine, as well as excess sodium intake, can bloat the inner ear canal and cause a re-occurence of BPPV. Not sure if it would apply to you, but I wish I would known back when I first got BPPV. ( Thank you. Trying to do normal stuff today. I do drink a little coffee in the morning but i have cut back like half of what I normally drink. Hoping this is okay and will not trigger anything. Thank you for your help! I am in a developing country and do not really have immediate access to PT. :( I will try to check on youtube if there are some exercises i can do. Trying to go back to normal today. Thank you! Thank you! I will be checking these out since I do not have access to PT. Yes, I would recommend seriously thinking about the caffeine stuff! Personally when I found this out I was bummed, as I used to rely so much on caffeine. I started sleeping better and reducing stress, as well as just eating better, and my energy levels shot up more than caffeine had helped me. Now I do not miss the caffeine at all.\n\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that there is speculation that stress can be tied to BPPV. I was discussing this with another user just the other day. Of course I can not say one way or another if it is, but I do know my BPPV episodes were coupled with times of extreme stress. If by any chance you were going through a high stress time, might be worth investing some time in just de-stressing a little bit. I started exploring just in general how I could reduce stress in my life. It has been beneficial in many ways.\n\nI really wish you good luck! Great to hear, I hope it helps! Please do make sure to read that entire comment (I mean, the one that includes the link to the exercises). I think if the exercises are done incorrectly or hastily it can make things worse. So I have really clearly outlined important parts of those exercises. Sorry as I know the comment is long but all of that info is relevant.\n\nAlso - do not attempt these exercises the day you are cleared of BPPV (day you have done the repositioning exercises.)\n\nI would also advice you to proceed with caution doing those exercises. I was a little weary to share them because it seemed like your BPPV spell was all within the course of a day (you got BPPV, then did the repositioning technique I think, and later saw an ENT who confirmed you were clear of it?) Your situation is very different from the one I encountered, so I am worried if those repositioning techniques might make things worse for you.\n\nIf I were you - I would honestly just wait a couple days and see if the residual dizziness resolves on its own. If they do not, maybe that would be a good time to try this. This is just my own idea and what I would do if I were in your position. Best of luck to you. I did not finish my small cup of coffee out of fear haha! Might as well not drink while I am still experiencing dizziness. I was stressed a bit that day since I was in line for covid vaccine for 3 hours haha (did not push through they ran out). But was not extremely stressed. But will try to be mindful about this as well. Thank you so much! I want to confirm - did the ENT actually confirm your BPPV is gone? How long did it last? I guess I am just slightly confused why you are having residual dizziness at all. I am worried those exercises are going to make things worse for you, because I am not sure if you have residual dizziness , or if maybe the dizziness is something else. :( I kind of regret sharing my comment to you. oh man. 3 hours to wait for the vaccine. That sucks to hear. But I am so happy for you that you got it! I am sorry, I did not mean to scare you about the coffee. But I figured it is better to share that. Good to hear you were not too stressed. In fairness, my ENT did NOT mention stress as a potential trigger for BPPV. I have only read it about it as a possible link. de-stressing is always good for health in general though so I figured no harm to share that. I have re-read your post. You are having constant dizziness and nausea. I am going to go out on a limb and say I am not sure this is residual dizziness from the BPPV. I would actually advise you against doing the exercises I linked. Those exercises will induce dizziness and make you more dizzy. I think these are going to make things worse for you :( I think I will delete that comment. I should have read your post more clearly before I wrote my initial comment to you. I apologize to you. It could be a while. I suggest finding maneuvers you can continue to do at home to speed up the healing process. Some use Epley, some use Brandt-Daroff but it really will probably depend on what your PT or ENT think, based on how it presented for you and exams, etc. \n\nTook me a little more than three months to feel like I was actually getting better- I had done four Epleys during that time and several weeks of daily (3 times a day) Brand-Daroffs. I had several days straight recently with no problems but I looked up a few days ago by mistake and since have had some dizziness and felt off balance and twice a little nauseated. This sucks.\ud83e\udd74 She did still see some eye movement when i saw her and confirmed it was bppv but i do not have vertigo anymore just this residual dizziness when i turn my head quickly to the right. Today i feel better than yesterday and have been able to do more chores. No worries i appreciate the help. ENT did tell me to move my head side to side for exercise and that is all ive been doing since seeing her. Did she do the Dix-Hallpike maneuver, or did she just look at your eyes for movement? Dix-halpike is how bppv is typically diagnosed, as far as I am aware.\n\nIf you are feeling better today with less dizziness, I would recommend to stay away from the exercises I gave you to be honest. Because it seems like the dizziness is getting better, and I am worried those will make you worse. Follow the instructions of your doctor of course.\n\nThe point of the habituation exercises is to get your brain used to normal movement again, as far as I am aware.\n\nI am so sorry for any confusion I caused. I just know how much bppv and in general, dizziness suck, and so the last thing I want to do is unintentionally make someone is issue worse. I greatly apologize for jumping the gun. Maybe the exercises I would linked would help, maybe not. But it sounds like if you do have residual dizziness, it is already fading on its own, so I think it is probably just best to heed caution and stay away from the ones I linked, just in case they worsen things for you. I wish I were a doctor or someone with more knowledge so I could help you better. But it sounds like things are steadily improving for you.\n\nMake sure to take it easy after your COVID shot and please stay hydrated. Staying hydrated is important for vestibular issues anyway. She did the dix-hallpike maneuver yes. I will continue to drink the meds the gave me and do normal activities hopefully this goes away on its own soon. Thank you so much for being so kind. Just to note - I did not get the vaccine they ran out haha. Sucks here where I am, but hoping to have a new schedule soon. :) Can i ask if you have had your covid shot and if it triggered vertigo? Having some anxiety now fearing it will trigger vertigo. ok good i am glad she did the maneuver. sounds like you are properly cleared of bppv which is great news. yes keep taking your meds. If they do not work do not feel bad to ask for more (or different) meds. I was taking a heavy dose of zofran/ondansetron when i went through this, it is an anti-emetic which helps nausea and vomiting. Anti-emetics can be truly amazing drugs (at least for some folks). They do not help with dizziness (that I am aware) but at least eliminates the accompanying nauseousness. There are several such anti-emetics out there (metoclopramide/Reglan is another one, though I never found it to work as much). I looked up betahistine, but I have no familiarity with it, so I do not know if it works well with anti-emetic drugs, but your doctor would know. I believe it might be an antihistamine, similar to meclizine. These help with motion sickness. I found antihistamines very effective for helping with motion sickness personally, and very helpful during BPPV issue, but not with nausea and vomiting (at least for myself). I used to take an antihistamine (dramamine) for dizziness, along with an antiemetic. Ondanestron comes in a quick dissolve version that goes on your tongue - it begins working against nausea within minutes, it is incredible.\n\nSorry they ran out of vaccines. i hope you get a new one soon. When you finally do get the vaccine - make sure to stay very well hydrated the day following up to it. Then give your body a chance to rest once you get it. Staying hydrated is very important for these dizziness issues as well. so make sure to drink lots of water. Before bppv i admit i actually never drank water. now i drink several glasses a day, it is all i drink now. it will help with many things\n\ngood luck to you my friend I have had my covid shots, and no, they did not get vertigo. To be honest I cannot see a reason why it would. I would not be worried about the COVID vaccine causing vertigo. However, I would recommend surely staying hydrated prior to the vaccine. When I kept reading how to prepare for the covid vaccine, everything I read said to stay hydrated, stay hydrated. I made sure to drink a lot of water the day prior.\n\nThe things I am aware that can trigger BPPV, according to my ENT:\n\n* caffeine (bloats inner ear)\n\n* excessive sodium intake (same as above, bloats inner ear)\n\n* nicotine (restricts blood flow to the inner ear)\n\nPersonally - after he told me this, I realized that all of my BPPV episodes had followed (within 12-24 hours) of eating very large amounts of sodium. Similarly, my ENT has dealt with BPPV multiple times himself (Which is why they referred me to him specifically), and had noticed that all of his episodes followed days where he got himself a big coffee, or a large popcorn, etc. Very similar to my experience. I have another friend who used to frequently get BPPV, and he realized all of his episodes were occurring days after he took caffeine pills for his job. As I have mentioned in other posts, all anecdotal, but convincing for me personally, especially as I trust my ENT's advice.\n\nAbout the sodium, he had a pretty relaxed view on it. He told me, do not change your life up, but avoid high-sodium foods, and his way of approaching it was 'if you eat something and it tastes very salty, spit it out, and drink a lot of water.' He was very adamant about staying well hydrated, as this helps regulate fluid levels in the ear.\n\nMy dietician also had a perspective on it - that it might not be really about an exact amount of sodium, but rather regulating your sodium levels from day to day. This was only her speculation so take that with a grain of salt.\n\nSome people on this message board informed me of another possible connection:\n\n* lying down for long periods of time.\n\nI was surprised to hear this. I will say that a couple months ago, I ended up lying in bed for close to 24 hours, and had a very very brief spell of vertigo following this. it was the first re-occurence I would had. It could be coincidental, but I did find it really interesting that several people had told me they would seen this connection, and then I experienced it myself. I think the issue here is lying for very, very long periods of time. 24 hours for me is very abnormal.\n\nAlso note, this is just my personal experience. Someone else might lie down for a long time and have no issues. BUt I still wished to share this with you, as it is simply good to keep in mind.\n\nAnother possible link is low Vitamin D. I do not know if there is conclusive evidence on this, or if it is just speculative. But it cannot hurt to make sure you are getting enough Vitamin D. Just make sure not to take too much. Or at least do some quick searches to see what is an acceptable level. There is a lot of debate on how much is too much Vitamin D. Thank you so much. I had covid back in march and some are saying it can cause BPPV like some cold viruses that can cause inflammation, so not sure if it can still cause this even if months ago. \n\nBut again thank you for your thoughtful replies. I will make sure to keep hydrated before my shots. I want to add - do not let my long post give you anxiety about, oh my, I need to do so many things to avoid this! Or that you should be afraid of all these possible triggers. Please do not let it have that effect at all. Rather it should have the opposite effect - I hope giving you these simple things will give you some hints on how you can possibly prevent it, which is great news. I know my ENT was very straight forward with me - he said that diet was going to be the biggest thing that would trigger it.\n\nI feel like BPPV can cause huge amounts of anxiety in people. Try not to get too stressed about it (easier said than done I know.) I will tell you that I have not dealt with re-occurences of BPPV, outside that day following where I laid down for 24 hours (and even then, that one was incredibly mild. I did not have to do any repositioning technique. It was a tiny, brief spell when I finally got up, and I did not get another. I did not have to go to the doctor or anything). Since my awful BPPV experience, I cut out caffeine and I regulate my sodium intake from day to day, and I stay well hydrated daily. In addition, I get good sleep and work on reducing stress. I can not tell you if one or any of these things have prevented re-occurrances for me, but that is what I have done. I used to be filled with anxiety over BPPV but this also lessened with the passage of time. In the beginning I was terrified daily of BPPV coming back. I could not even think about it and even told people I spoke to not to bring it up to me. Slowly I began to deal with this fear and it lessened. Things will return to normal, I promise you. (Though it probably feels all messed up right now.) oh. I am so sorry to hear you had COVID.\n\nI dealt with BPPV prior to the COVID epidemic, so I have not actually thought to look in to that. Perhaps there is a link between COVID and BPPV, I am not sure, only because I have never explored that personally. I am sorry I do not have more info there but I do not want to speculate on something I do not know about. Even if COVID itself had a link though, would the vaccine have this effect? :( I am sorry I do not have a more definitive answer. I would say even if there was some slight chance of this, getting vaccinated against COVID is worth the risk. Agree. Never want to go through covid again. Thank you! I asked this question a few weeks ago as I believe my BPPV was caused by my Covid vaccine but did not get any responses. The only information that I could find was flu vaccines linked to BPPV. I believe that my Covid vaccine was the catalyst for my bppv. There is some research surfacing to support the side effect. Many viruses are linked to bppv so I would think this would include Covid19 as well as the vaccine. I had a recurrence tonight by looking up too quickly. It only lasted a few seconds but I started panicking and crying almost PTSD like. The anxiety is almost as bad as the vertigo. Agree, this is awful. Oh that sucks to hear. How are you now? Hoping you are feeling better. I had an short episode last night but getting better. BPPV is a frustrating beast! Damn. I am sorry to hear about your experience about this in general. I know nothing about this to be honest with you, so I just can not comment on it. this is completely new info to me :( I would definitely be curious to learn more about this and in what ways it could cause it if it does. The only thing I would have to think is, the risk of COVID is so much worse than the risk of BPPV I think :( At least bppv can be cured but with COVID it can just be so dangerous. Though of course I am not in any way trying to downplay BPPV, which is utter hell I know first hand. I am just assuming the chance of bppv from the vaccine would be so minimal compared to the chance of eventually catching COVID without the vaccine. What a difficult time we are collectively emerging from.. I wish I had better thoughts here.\n\nI am sorry you have been dealing with bppv :( Definitely, the anxiety is worse for me. I would be 100% able to deal with it emotionally, if I had some sort of warning when it was coming. I am terrified that out of nowhere I might be hit with the spinning and vomiting again, and not be able to walk anywhere\u2026 it is depressing. You are not alone. It is depressing!  I am such an active person, this has been very difficult.", "What kind of Vertigo do I have? Is it serious? So the other day I was sitting on the couch and my left ear was itching, so i went and stuck a Qtip in it (which i never do) to try and itch the spot, and i ended up pushing wax too far into my ear. So i went to the drug store, and got some ear wax removal kit that worked. Just put 10 drops in, wash out with warm water. Next morning I was basically back to normal, but then it hit me. I was sitting on the couch again and all of the sudden my balance was completely knocked off, my vision kept going \"up, down, up, down\" for about 15 seconds or so, and ever since then when I lean my head back, or tilt it to the right I get a feeling of dizziness. This was yesterday when I had the first vertigo trip, and just about an hour ago I got it again but it only lasted for ~2-4 seconds. \n\nThe problem is, I still get a dizzy feeling when I lean my head back, or tilt to the right, or when laying down and flipping sides quickly. I never had this before, and i have NEVER gotten vertigo before. I thought I was going to pass out when I first experienced it. \n\nIt is not necessarily \"horrible\" vertigo, but its an annoyance that I want fixed. Do you think I did permanent damage to my ear pushing wax too far? Should I see a doc? How long should I wait until I see a doc, since it is only been 2 days? (3 days since i pushed the wax in) Hello! Sorry to hear about the dizziness. We all know how crap it can be. I would suggest bppv since it only happens when you tilt your head. You could always see your Gp who can refer you to a physical therapist if needed. You can always look up videos to on testing which ear/canal that is affected.", "Triggering vertigo attacks Can you trigger vertigo attacks with other vestibular illnesses or is bppv the only one where you are supposed to be able to do that? From what I recall when I was getting tested for all sorts of different vertigo - BPPV was the only one that triggered the nystagmus and 20ish seconds of severe vertigo. And the way your eyes twitched help determine which ear canal was effected.  The Dix Hallpike is the standard BPPV test. But there were other test done as well to test the other ear canals. And special tests of doing balance, watching eyes, focusing. None of those other tests triggered the nystagmus if they were positive. She was looking for other signs (balance, eyes not focusing, or being not stable).  I am not an expert, and there may be other tests I am not aware of. Hopefully someone with more knowledge will chime in! ", "vertigo aids Hi guys,\n\nI have never had vertigo but have got to know someone who has had an episode as of late after a number of years and thought I would ask you guys for some guidance :-)\n\nAre there things which would help ease vertigo a little? I have listed some things which come to mind\n\n1. CBD oil?\n2. eye mask\n3. heated pillow/ heated eye pillow\n4. natural remedies?\n5. less sugar maybe?\n\nAny suggestions are always welcome, would be great to learn more about this and what helps you Epliey manoeuvre and going to a balance center. Thanks for your reply.\n\nAre there any items which could benefit even slightly? Going to a balance center or doctor and figuring out the cause of the vertigo will be the best thing for vertigo.\n\nPersonally, Ice packs and sleep/rest helped me during an episode of vertigo. Also, ginger tea worked great with the upset tummy/nausea Gravol to knock you out &amp; sleeping it off is the only thing that helps me! See what is listed in other comments. I also find something with bold detail (like a letter poster) to stare at will help end an session earlier I swear by ginger capsules. I have had vertigo (bbpv) for 7 years. I could never get to a doc so i was always taking ibuprofen like candy and that is not good so i had to be my own dr and google other options that is where i came across ginger pills. If i want to lay in bed a little longer in the morning i know i will get vertigo in the afternoon so i take a ginger capsule (with food!) and i can feel a huge difference from when i do not take the ginger.  Sometime i did not get vertigo or the attack did not last as long and the vertigo hangover/comedown is not as bad. I dont know how to link to amazon on here but the capsule i buy are called Solaray Organically Grown Ginger Root 540mg Youre amazing! Keep being amazing and keep striving in life \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udfff ", "Why Do I Get Dizzy and How Can it Be Cured? ", "There really is a Reddit for everything. So, hi, I have BPPV and anxiety I have been reading through everyone is posts. It is a lot to take in, and I do not know if I feel better or worse. My first episode was maybe a year ago. It is really frightening to me. To be out of control, like being drunk when you know you are not. And the nausea... was given motion sickness pills at urgent care but no explanation. I actually thought the pills cured it because after 3 days, no more.\n\nSecond episode (seems better to maybe call them clusters since it is days worth of multiples), also went to urgent care but different one, where they explained everything, taught me the Epley, and explained the pills I was given. Referred me for a PT to do Epley as well. But of course it went away so I never bothered with the physical therapy. That was a month ago no two months ago, and here I am again. \n\nSince it is happening again with much less time between this episode and the last, I started doubting the diagnosis. This would be my anxiety screaming hey you have cancer! So reading that some of you have been going through this for years, that is where I feel sort of better but also sort of worse. This is going to go on for decades? The Epley which I now have an appointment with physical therapy on Friday for, is not going to fix it once and for all? Has anyone here had the procedure or surgery or whatever it is where they remove your stones so you can grow new ones? I caught a little bit about that procedure when googling, months ago, but did not take it seriously.\n\nMaybe I should have. \n\nOh, and f/48. I already have enough problems. I for sure do not need this too. Not that anyone does. But, damn. With BPPV often you manage it. You may have an episode now and it is difficult to predict when you may get another one. It could be never, could be next week. It is about recognising the signs and treating yourself (or with help) appropriately. Having the right diagnosis is important. \nThe crystals or particles actually belong to another part of your inner ear (they sit on hairs which make them responsive to gravity) the problem with BPPV is they break off and make there way into another section of your inner ear (canals) which then make these sensitive to gravity when they normally would not be. The canals are plugged at one end hence needing to roll the head and body around to drop the particle where they belong. Once they are dropped back they re imbed themselves so another episode is not necessarily the same particle. Surgery is extreme and would not recommend when you can fix it relatively easily with the right manouvere. Thank you.", "Can someone help me determine possible vertigo symptoms? I have always had ear issues- ear infections my whole life up until now (25 years old) where it would feel like my whole jaw moved and I could not bite down. I now realize maybe this was TMJ? I constantly clench and grind my teeth. It is been a lot worse now with quarantine and bad anxiety. I constantly have headaches from it. Lately I have been feeling like I have to hold onto something when I am sitting to keep from falling. I cannot focus on anything without it looking like the object is vibrating/shaking. My head also feels heavy and like it is shaking at times. I have been telling myself maybe it is my anxiety, but now I am wondering if it is possibly vertigo after reading symptoms. My hands and feet are also suddenly sweaty and I never had this issue before! TIA! Hi, love! Sorry you are feeling this way. TMJ, or so my dentist has told me, can either exacerbate vertigo or cause it to crop up suddenly. Vertigo is vertigo regardless of how it presents, but how you treat it depends on where it comes from. I would recommend going to a dentist first because judging by what you have written, it sounds like this only started after your jaw issues. Look up dentists in your area who specialize in TMJ so you can get an accurate diagnosis. If that fails, you should schedule a visit with an ENT. Either way, you will get it figured out! Feel better! Please tell me you have seen a doctor for this medical history you have mentioned. Yes! Have seen a doctor about my anxiety and have been medicated previously. My dentist knows about my jaw issues and suggested a night guard that I have not gotten yet. Have seen multiple doctors/ENTs for my consistent ear infections. Last time I went to the doctor was November. Random question- have you ever been checked for Ehelrs danlos syndrome. Google beighton score on google images and see if you can do them.", "Was this bppv Went to bed last night at around 10pm fine, rolled over in bed around 11:45pm from my left side to my back and got dizzy and had nystagmus. Turning back left or right off of my back did not seem to trigger it after that. I could only trigger it when leaning up or laying straight back down. So I went back to sleep on my left side, woke up a few hours later at 3am and it was gone. Does this sound like a quick episode of bppv? It sounds like it to me, especially the nystagmus.  I have had them resolve quickly like that (upon rare occasion).  Sounds like you got lucky with repositioning quickly! Yea I must have gotten lucky it was quick and I am thankful for that. I wish I knew what caused this. It is so weird I lay down that night fine, then 2hrs later boom. You and me both.  I cannot pinpoint any specific trigger except that I usually wake up with it.  I found some evidence in Science Direct about barometric pressure changes affecting BPPV incidence, but nothing concrete. This is the 2nd time it is happened to me, last time was a year ago how do you know u had Nystagmus ? Because I was experiencing it. I know what it means to have nystagmus, which is uncontrolled jerking/movement of the eye.", "Anybody else have a BPPV episode brought on by a bad cold/ sinus illness? That is how it often happens for me. Hi! I was diagnosed with BPPV like 6 years ago but I had had mild episodes for years at that point before I went and got something done. Now I am having the worst I have ever had, accompanied with nausea which I almost never have. It is so bad!!! \n\nAnybody else get triggered by sinus or cold illnesses? Oh yeah definitely. I have Covid right now so I am not having a fun time. Glad I am not alone. I am just wondering. I read that BPPV is not constant dizziness but honestly I feel like almost constantly dizzy unless my head is still for a very very long time. Is that still BPPV or something else? I have the constant dizziness and off balance feeling, and it is definitely giving me nausea sometimes. I am trying a week of sudafed to see if it changes anything because I live in the fifth worst city for allergies this season so maybe it is related. You are definitely not alone \ud83d\udc96 Does Sudafed help? I was taking DayQuil\nWhile I was sick but now that the sick is basically over the dizziness is still here During my second longest spell (11 days) I was constantly dizzy for the first 3 or 4 days. Prior to that I had not had a spell last for more than a day or two. With most lasting a few hours so there was not constant dizziness.\n\nMy last episode lasted 5 weeks and I was not dizzy for 5 weeks but I was dizzy off and on 3 or 4 days at a time with the dizziness only abating when my eyes were closed or I was very, very still. &gt;Anybody else get triggered by sinus or cold illnesses?\n\nWhen I got my second COVID vaccine my lymph nodes on my left side got very swollen and painful (9/10 pain scale). Without thinking I tried rubbing the one behind my ear for a few minutes and because I am as bad as a child I probably yanked on my damn ear, too. The next morning I had full on BPPV with all the dizziness and nausea and vomiting. It went away in the next day or two but it got my mom and I thinking about my childhood with illnesses, even if the illness was not one that was known to cause nausea and vomiting I did and we wondered if it was a lymph node issue, they got swollen and hard fighting whatever illness I had and in part bothered my ear making me dizzy and nauseated.\n\nSo, to answer your question, maybe? Idk about bppv but I have had dizzy spells every allergy season, ear aches, or sinuses. Every time, it affects my balance. TBD, I was only taking one 4-6 hour one a day because I have a heart rhythm issue so I wanted to test the waters, but I am doing two things starting today: switching to zyrtec (was on Allegra) and doing more sudafed for a few days. So we will see? That would be such an easy fix! I think, it has something to do with inflammation. If I have bad allergies it will bring a, bout out. I will take a Benadryl and it will disappear. \n\n\nIt is such a strange, illness. And so unpredictable.\n\n\nBest of luck hope, you feel better soon. I literally give you so many props! im on my 3rd week of it and it is so dismantling. But from what I heard after a cold and illness your ears are prone to infection, have you checked them out? Any ringing or random popping? It could be one ear or both. It is definitely BPPV But no popping or ringing.", " My doctor did not believe my story about the earthquake. Hi all, recently diagnosed for BPPV by a specialist. Thought I would introduce myself by telling you a story of my GP\u2019s reaction to my vertigo anecdotes before I got sent to that specialist. Warning: heavy lashings of dark humour ahead. \n\nWhen I first went to the doctor complaining of dizziness and nausea he did all the standard things. Blood test. Heart check. aRe YoU sUrE you are NoT pReGnAnT? (I know they have to ask, but it makes me sigh when they do) \n\nAnyway, I had two pretty severe nausea/vertigo episodes while waiting for tests to come back. One was in the vicinity of some nosy equipment at work. The other was triggered by a small earthquake in a VERY non-earthquake prone area of the world. It made headlines because the quake was actually in one capital city, but the after-shocks were felt in another capital city, where I was. We were on the 6th floor at the time, which is why I suppose I felt it so severely. Both episodes caused nausea that lasted for about a day. During the earthquake, I thought I was going to pass out, while everyone else just felt a little wobble. It was really not fun. \n\nSo when I rocked up at the practice to get my test results back I decided to tell my doctor about these episodes because he was clearly out of his depth. The conversation went like this. Subtext embellishments for humour purposes added in brackets: \n\nD: So your test results came back normal. \n\n\nM: That is frustrating. I had more episodes. One was near noisy equipment at work. The second one was during the earthquake. \n\n\nD: Right. (WTF are you talking about, you crazy) \n\nM: You do not believe me. (It happened, you ignorant ass) \n\nD: What do you want me to do? (Because I have no idea and I am incompetent) \n\nM: Send me to a specialist. (Do I really need to tell you how to do your job???) \n\nD: Fine. I will send you to an ear specialist. (Uuuhhh I have picked this out at random) \n\nTL;DR: I had the worst vertigo I have ever experienced in my life during a small earthquake in an area that almost never has earthquakes.

I got BPPV a few years ago and at the time I did not have health insurance and I have always been poor and have this inmate fear of being broke or in debt. It was also a super stressful time in my life and I developed anxiety. Much of it stemming from BPPV and the fear of something, some sort of real damage. I went to the ENT and got it fixed. A year ago I got up to quickly and the vertigo came back. I was drenched in sweat. This time I went to the ENT and no matter how many times I did the Epley it would not go away but I felt fine. Then covid hit and I never went back.\n\nSince my first episode and more so since my most recent one, I am constantly on edge thinking I am going to get it. Like I cannot lie down or move in bed. I hold my pillow when turning and I get up out of bed real slow.\n\nI always think I have it and it is tied to my anxiety so when I think I have it I experience anxiety and vice versa. \n\nWeird part is idk even know why I am so afraid. I have had it and it is not a big deal. It is not life threatening but idk I cannot convince myself. I mean yeah going down to do the Epley and that motion sucks but it cannot be helped.\n\nAnyway does anyone else have this and is there anything that can be done? You are not alone.  I think it is because it triggers anxiety when it hits due to how it affects your body and brain.  I just bought Joey remenyis new book rock steady.  It is about vertigo and tinnitus and her approach is very anxiety based.  You might find it helpful.  She has videos on YouTube too. I agree - the anxiety that it creates is horrible. And then the anxiety makes it so much worse.  I had active BPPV for over two months and then almost a year of horrible residual dizziness. I was working with a therapist that was amazing - and she really helped with the anxiety. It is been almost two years since my last LONG episode, and I still think of BPPV every day. I wonder when it is going to hit, and if I move wrong, will it happen again. Overall, I am very active and healthy. I eat well, not on any meds, and am involved in many physical hobbies. I find keeping busy helps keep my mind off it. Trying to get on top of the anxiety is the main thing.  And knowing if it happens again, I know how to fix it (even though I had a super stubborn case that took forever to heal and I was SO sick during it). I also think I will get Joey Remenysis book - I have heard good things about it! Hang in there - and know there ARE people out there that totally understand what you are going through. u/Colmanson1 \\-  agreed 100%. my one month bout is similar to yours.\n\ni am a cyclist so i am guessing/hoping my exercise helps a lot.\n\nalso, u/bthug27, hopefully this helps, i was told by my ent dr that while bppv is super annoying its usually not an ailment that is a serious concern. obviously, if someone is falling and potentially hitting their head, from the dizziness, that is serious, but the ailment itself is not a serious health issue. that helped me a bit until i/my ent could resolve the symptoms.\n\nu/bthug27 \\- hope you feel better soon. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4f Another thing I want to mention is that my therapist told me to STOP worrying/wondering if/when it is going to strike again. She said, 'You do not go around worrying every day if you are going to get cancer or not. You cannot predict it. So there is no need to waste energy worrying about it. You know how to treat it - just make sure when it happens again to get on top of it right away.' Yes, indeed. \n\nOne thing that did not help me - was dealing with people around me that did not understand BPPV.  I remained fully functional. Kept training (running), kept going to work, kept doing EVERYTHING in my life. But I was SO sick. I fought hard each day through the nausea &amp; dizziness, and worrying. But I kept going.  People got tired of me not being the same person I typically was. They did not understand how HARD each and every day was to keep functioning. Most people would have been bed-ridden. But the fact that I still looked normal and was functioning - made them wonder if I was making it up.  Heavens no!!! Ugh.\n\nTry to get on top of that anxiety - and that will help a TON. Also know that you DO have a support system should BPPV flare up again. Thank you! Wow I will check it out, thanks! Thank you for your response!\n\nJust to clarify you saw like a regular therapist? Not like a VRT place?\n\nRegardless, she makes a good point. I have been wanted to see a therapist for this and a host of other reasons but I never have the chance. It is like without a job you do not have insurance. With a job there is no time to use it. Fml. I really should have seen a therapist years and years ago. Putting it off just makes it worse. It was a vestibular therapist (specialized in dizziness) that I found in the regular Physical Therapy Department. But she has had BPPV as well... So was truly a godsend in helping out my mind at ease. And did a lot of dizziness testing, performed the Epley many times &amp; gave me vestibular exercises to do. I saw her weekly for over two months. Hello,\nI have also had maybe 3 bppv attacks over the past 4 months, cause by an attack of labyrithitis that happened in May. My last bppv attack was a month ago and had 3 sessions of maneuevers for it and the spinning is gone but the residual dizziness is still there. It is mostly when i move my head in certain directions, when i move my head up and down ,diagonally or horizontally to the left my whole visual field seems to move too! Have you had this too? Is this gaze instability? I have been doing gaze stabilization exercises since May but im not seeing much improvement. How long does it take for the gaze to correct itself? That does seem like the gaze instability. It is slow to correct itself. I had the residual dizziness and much of what you mention for months. Are you increasing the difficulty of the gaze exercises weekly? I kept getting more difficult ones as time went on. I even had to watch these YouTube videos of moving things (that would make any other person around me super dizzy!) like moving checker boards, spiral stair cases moving, driving fast weaving through traffic, etc. Im mainly doing the exercises at home as best I can, I have increased the intensity over time but still the same for specific head moves..im not an expert and my therapist does not seem that good or knowledgable but not many therapists where I live so I will have to wait and give it some time. The residual diZziness is better than it used to be I dont get that lightheaded fainty feeling as bas as i did a couple of months ago..but it is still there to some extent and worsens if i have a headache, which i seem to get a lot of mild headaches nowadays.. how long did you have the residual dizziness before you felt back to your old seldf again? Thanks My residual dizziness was bad for almost 8 months. It was slowly getting better.... But it took a long time. I was very busy &amp; physically active during that time. It helped to keep my mind busy. Although many activities were a struggle &amp; I still felt dizzy sick a lot. I am now a bit over a year &amp; a half since my last episode &amp; am feeling pretty good! Do not give up hope. Think positive &amp; cherish those good moments! Im really glad you are doing well now..your comments give me hope..did you experience days when you were feeling better followed by days when again you were not feeling so well? Cuz I seem to have that! Days when im really feeling much better and my residual dizziness is so light just to have days when i feel like my dizziness is more intense and i start to doubt if im going to be like this forever! Some days im more balanced and steady while walking and some days when i can sense that my balance is off again and it is frustrating! It makes me wonder if I have vestibular migraines. I even started eliminating some foods and will get some supplements and see if they will help. Yes - I had a lot of times where I would feel so good....then feel horrible again. I could not pin point it. It seemed there was nothing that I could put my finger on that would make it better or worse.  And it just crushes you. The anxiety and fear comes back that it will never get better.  But you have to be strong and just know the good days will come back again and keep pushing forward. Seems like its common then, recovery is not linear for everyone..thanks for giving me the hope and confidence that it is a matter of time I have never had anxiety in my life. And i woke up randomly one day with severe dizziness and BOOM. High levels of anxiety. Horrible. After seeing MANNY specialists and MANNY doctors. They think that going on SSRI's will not only help with anxiety. But apparently study's show that in most people it gets rid of dizziness as well. You should look into this! I am still in the stages of this so I cannot tell you if it works or not. I have been dizzy/ off balance and had LOTS of horrible symtoms for over a year now. Praying this works. They say sometimes you have to try a few different medications to see what one works best for you I can attest to this as well. 10ish years ago I got vestibular neuritis which turned into bppv. I had residual dizziness for nearly a year. My doctor put me on an ssri (celexa) and it gave me my life back. Not sure if it was PPPD and the celexa helped fix that or what. \n\nFunny enough when I was on it, I got a few bouts of bppv and though it was annoying I never freaked out/had the intense anxiety that I normally do about it. Do you still have dizziness to this day? How long did it take for the ssri to start taking effect for you? Are you still on the ssri now?

Prior to this, I never had it only when I would get bouts of bppv. \n\nMy doc told me it would take weeks to see an effect but for me it was almost immediate. I felt dizzy free in a few days. Not sure if it was placebo effect or what. \n\nI am no longer on it. I got on it in 2012 and weaned off in 2016 to start a family What do you mean when you say you get bouts of bppv? When you stopped taking it in 2016 was the dizziness gone completely, and then it just came back now, this year in March? I have had this for over a year now and it was just a couple months ago they started me on SSRI's, I do not think this one is working..

I was told I should try yoga to help with vertigo! Have you ever seen a Chiropractor or go to massage therapy on your neck? It might be something to look into! I went to physical therapy for my vertigo and found out it was neck related! Now I have found that stretching out my neck with some yoga poses helps a lot and makes my neck less tense I stopped doing yoga, over the years two of my BPPV episodes started while doing yoga so now I am afraid to do it. The last time was going from sun salutation to downward dog and then happy baby. As soon as I was on my back on the floor I felt it happen, like I felt really weird but the actual vertigo did not start until I sat up. I do not know that any certain position triggered it, I think it is maybe a matter of going from head up to inverted positions over and over? Uh oh I fear having to stop yoga for this reason.  Yea that is very possible, the type of yoga that I do is very drill seargent-like, so there is a lot of rapid cycling through sun salutations. It really bums me out, I liked yoga a lot. Once in a while I still do a few poses when my back is bothering me but I am really careful about how far/how fast I change my head positions.", "I got ya homie! ", "My first ever Vertigo (27F) At 5pm today I started getting dizzy, I thought it will go away if I lay down or took a nap but it did not... It actually got worse after I woke up from my 1-2 hour nap, its 11:40 pm now and I have been in my bed for over 6 hours. I just switched from laying on my right side to the left &amp; everything started spinning... I feel scared &amp; helpless Hi, you have come to the right place, read the historic posts in this sub and you will see that you are not alone. \n\nIt can be very scary, it can bring on anxiety which can heighten the spinning sensation but just know that it is a mechanical issue that you can recreate by rolling over and that you can sleep by the sounds of it on your back. \n\nSleep propped up with a few pillows, sleep on your back and tomorrow make an appointment for a PT or ENT. Hey I am 27F also and was just diagnosed with BPPV A little over a week ago. i am so sorry it definitely sucks and it is scary but if you are able to go to a doctor they can definitely help and my doctor sent me to a physical therapist and he did some therapy on me and corrected it almost 100%\n\n I am seeing my physical therapist on Tuesday again so I can get to 100%\n\nYou definitely are in the right place and there is tons of support on this forum.

If you have any questions you can message me ive only had it for a week but I still understand how hard it is Yes iam able to seek help we have free healthcare. May I ask what the physical therapist exactly do? They do the eply. They turn your head and the crystals get back into place. It is AMAZING. I feel so much better. I have seen them twice but doing another appt Tuesday just to make sure. Awe free healthcare is nice I am in the US so it is an arm and a leg for medical stuff \ud83e\udd23 but I have undiagnosed sudden leg weakness so I am used to it Thank you for your reply, I did the Epley Maneuver and slpt a couple of hours and I feel much much better now. I have been doing extreme fasting + gardening alot so I think that is what threw things out of whack. I will stop the fast and will leave my garden to be for a few days, I hope this will solve it. It was honestly HELL. It definitely is one of the worse experiences that the majority of people will never experience. \n\nHappy to hear you are on the mend! \ud83d\udc4d", "How long do residual symptoms last? Had 4-5 bouts of really bad vertigo that eventually put me in the ER after looking down about  a month ago that threw me out of wack for over a week (difficulty focusing vision, dizziness, brain fag).\n\nSince then, it has improved substantially, but I still do not feel 100%. Very sensitive to motion, still some very mild dizziness when looking down, vision issues mostly resolved but still come and go a bit; especially in certain lighting conditions or when using computer.\n\nMy vision also seems to have to 'catch up' so to speak when i turn my head quickly. But that also comes and goes.\n\nIs this typical to have very mild but still noticeable symptoms that wax and wane for over a month? I went to a PT who specializes in ears and BPPV for like 2 months after my last multi-day vertigo attack. From the symptoms you described, it sounds like what I experienced until my PT did a big ole Epley on me that fiiiiinally moved my ear crystals out of my ear tubes. After that, all vision delay was immediately gone, head swimming was gone, but I was left with intense fear and paranoia of it coming back that definitely manifested some head swimming in the next several weeks. It took me being really mindful of those fears and repeating to myself that I was safe and I was just imagining it for me to finally move past it. I also experienced daily headaches for the next several weeks while my brain reconfigured, so to speak. My PT had me do eye exercises daily to recalibrate, as well, which really helped. She looked really closely at my eyes while in the office to determine if my nystagmus had subsided. It was such a relief to have her help. \nIf you are still experiencing vision delay, I would get a referral for a vestibular PT. Your ear crystals might not be all the way back in place. Good luck!! Thanks for your reply! I think I am in part 2 of your description. It is such anxiety that my heart begins to pound when I think I feel something. I will def go to the vestibular PT good recommendation. It took 8 months for my worse residual dizziness symptoms to resolve. I was working with a vestibular therapist. It took 2 months with her to actually fix the BPPV.  But although the intense vertigo when I turned my head certain positions was gone, I was left with residual dizziness. Also, because of my lack of head movement during active BPPV, it caused 'gaze instability' which sounds a bit like what you are dealing with. I had a ton of vestibular exercises to do to help correct this.\n\nI still have a bit of the gaze instability and mild dizziness. At this point, I am making it my new 'normal.' I am WAY better than I was a year ago. But there is still some yuckiness left.  Also, I do believe that anxiety and being hypervigilant comes into play. Perhaps I always had the type of dizziness I am dealing with now? But because of BPPV and the fear of it coming back, every time I get a wave of mild dizziness (more like being on a boat), I fear BPPV will return. So, it may be helpful to do your best to not worry about it.  I know - easier said than done! I keep super busy (physically and mentally) and that helps keep my level of worry down. Less time to think about BPPV returning and less time noticing tiny symptoms. Thanks so much, good advice. And I wish you well. Sounds like you are on the right track. I do not know if this will help, but, in the ( check the Treatment section to learn a bit about Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness (PPPD)?", "Can anxiety cause bppv?

So it happened to me twice, but now idk how to sleep. I literally cannot sleep on my back. I always sleep on my side, but if I sleep on my side it will probably just happen again so idk what I should do. It is a scary and bewildering feeling, for sure. \ud83d\ude15\n\nCheck out the treatments and suggestions for prevention in the stickied post at the top of this subreddit. We have been there--some, just once, others, more often.\n\nAll the very best in your recovery. Have you been tested for bppv?  If that is what you have the epley maneuver should help with the vertigo.  If you do not, you can try to sleep propped up on a few pillows on your back. I have some medical conditions other then BPPV that have mandated I sleep on my back. So as a life-long stomach sleeper and occasional side sleeper I have tips to get you sleeping on your back.\n\nFirst try sleeping on the couch or in a reclining chair. I learned to sleep on my back a few years ago after I spent a week almost 24/7 in a recliner and hospital bed.\n\nMy preference is actually to sleep on a couch over a recliner or a bed if I have to sleep on my back. The narrow width and plush back make it easier.\n\nNo matter if I am sleeping in a bed, on a couch or in a chair a must to keep me on my back are pillows.\n\nI do not need fancy or expensive ones just a half dozen bed pillows, a body pillow and a wedge.  I build up an incline behind me and stick the wedge behind/under a knee on the side where I have a bad hip/knee, I also flank my sides with pillows and kind of prop up my arms/elbows. The body pillow ends up wherever. \n\nIf you absolutely cannot sleep on your back you can try laying on the couch with the affected ear up with your back to the back of the couch. Pack pillows between your knees, under your head, and in front of you (supporting your upper arm) until you feel comfortable and do not feel like turning on to your stomach or affected ear. Over the winter when I got hit with the worst BPPV, back sleeping was not helping the first few days and the couch side sleeping was really working out for me.\n\nOf course, every body is different and your mileage may vary. Try the pillows and/the couch or a bed.\n\nIt is hard to have such a miserable problem and then on top of everything have your sleep disrupted. I am a side sleeper too, when I was dealing with BPPV I ended up avoiding the affected side as much as possible (if you have bppv it should only be affecting one ear) but on occasion I would just roll to the affected side anyway and power through the dizziness since with bppv the spinning only lasts about a minute or less. I learned to sleep on my back, and I have been fine for awhile now. Anytime I am exhausted and roll around at night, I wake up with vertigo.", "Residual dizziness or vertigo still? Hey I have been preforming the epsey manuver twice a day \u00d73, for two days now and my vertigo has gotten better but I still feel weirdly dizzy and when I do the epsey manuver things still move a little bit but not as much as before. Does this sound like I still have missplaced crystals somehow? Or residual dizziness? Thanks guys! The only way to tell is by having a videonystagmography where a professional checks for nystagmus. I can appreciate that is unlikely to be possible with the corona. \n\nIn that case, I would say keep doing the epleys and maybe incorporate somersault exercises. Cannot harm you if it is indeed just RD and your crystals are in place. Gl!\n\nLE: I think I did epleys for like 7 days straight to get rid of all the super fine dust. Good to know! Thanks! Yeah usually I would see my physio but virus \ud83d\ude2d Are you able to tell when you get the bad vertigo with Nystagmus versus the other dizziness?  For ME - it is definitely different than the residual dizziness.  The wave of intense spinning hits for about 30 seconds and I can barely keep my eyes open (and if I do - I really cannot see anything because they are twitching so fast).  And this happens only when I am in certain positions. That is one of the key's to knowing if the crystal is still misplaced.  After my crystal was in place - I did not even know it until a week later and the Dix Hallpike was performed and I did not get the 30 second wave of violent vertigo with nystagmus.  Yet, I still felt super yucky with other dizziness.  It is been two months now, and I still have residual dizziness. Some days are worse.  And the dizziness changes as my body tries to adapt to it is new 'normal.'  It is a long process for some.  And yes - try the Half Somersault too!  I did plenty of those, since those never provoked the bad vertigo. Yeah im 99% sure its residual! Thanks so much for your reply!

I am on my fourth or fifth episode of vertigo, the first time I had it about 15 years ago was the worst, I do not remember specifics but I spent close to a week or so pretty much in bed. Since then the episodes were sucky but doing the Epley or Brandt-Daroff maneuver was tolerable and helped minimize the vertigo fairly quickly. \n  \nThis time (started yesterday afternoon) is horrible, almost as bad as the first episode. Doing the Epley maneuver brings on really strong vertigo, I feel like I am going to throw up. The glitching only lasts about 15 seconds in a few of the positions but it is very intense. Afterward I am nauseous, shaky, sweaty, hands are cold and it feels like I cannot get a breath - which pretty much describes how it feels when I have a panic attack. \n\nI guess I am wondering if anyone else has noticed if every episode is not the same, if anyone has had anxiety attacks along with the BPPV? Maybe since the Epley is making me feel so much shittier than the other times I should stop doing it? I know, I need to talk to my doctor,but it is 11 on a Saturday night so I am just looking for some reassurance I guess. Following up my own post in case it helps someone else. I did a little more digging online and found out the Epley is SUPPOSED to induce really bad vertigo in the first position, because it is easy for doctors to check your eye movements in that position to diagnose BPPV. I have been doing the Fosters maneuver today, a lot less vertigo while doing it but it feels like things are improving. No panic attacks today. this does not answer exactly what youre asking, but i feel like sharing my experience may help in some way(?)\n\ni had a really bad bppv experience about 5 year ago that went away after a week. then i lived 100% symptom free until another weird vertigo episode back in september 2019 that im still nowhere near recovered from. this second episode was nowhere near as bad as my first (which had me vommitting profusely for hours and i spent two days in the hospital) but this recent episode will not fully subside. \n\nprior to this recent occurrence, i would never really had an anxiety in my life (except for maybe a few weeks when i first started high school but that went away eventually) and i had absolutely never had anything like an anxiety attack. however, when i woke up on that one night in september think i immediately started to panic and thought i was going to go through the horrible episode i went through 5 year ago again. my body was not happy about this and i started to get really anxious/panic and get really nauseous. i did not end up throwing up, however I am still dealing with the anxiety that this caused.\n\nlike, its been four months, and i still get lightheaded/dizzy every time i leave my apartment to go to work, get groceries, etc. again, I had NEVER had even the slightest hint of anxiety leading up to this, and now I cannot fucking escape it. it is like this vertigo episode re-wired something in my brain and now im an anxious mess.\n\nim now stuck in this logical loop of \"is my dizziness causing anxiety or is anxiety causing my dizziness\".\n\ntl;dr my symptoms basically transitioned from vertigo -&gt; headaches and anxiety -&gt; anxiety.\n\nits improved a bit overtime, but holy shit id give literally anything to feel \"normal\" again. I am sorry to hear that, having dealt with panic attacks off and on and a few episodes of BPPV having both constantly at the same time sounds awful. I never noticed a correlation between the two until this time, and since I have had a couple of days to think about it I am pretty sure that I did have a panic attack right after the vertigo started because the vertigo was so strong. I have not taken any anti-nausea medicine or Valium yesterday or today and I feel a little better, even though the vertigo is still going on. I called the National Dizzy and Balance Center and they could not give me much advice over the phone but did say they would never recommend doing the Epley maneuver more than once every 4 days. Anyway, I hope you can get help dealing with at least one of the two issues soon, that is a long time to be miserable.", "Unable to complete Epley without intense nausea - BPPV + Migraine Hi all,\n\nI have had BPPV two or three times before, usually a few years apart, starting in my late 30s. I discovered the Epley manoeuvre the first time, and that has usually worked quite well for me, without any residual dizziness and it is never made me ill.\n\nLast week I identified a bout of vertigo and attempted the manoeuvre. The first two times the nausea was so bad I ran to the toilet, but did not throw up. The next two times I did. Somehow I did manage to get through the full manoeuvre and I thought it had worked since doing the test did not start any nystagmus. Over the course of the weekend I was still feeling off balance and on one occasion nauseous. I figured this was residual dizziness.\n\nThis morning, which is five days after the initial onset, I was feeling particularly off balance. I tried the test again, which indicated bppv on the left side and I then did the manoeuvre on that side. I did the test again and it then indicated the right side. I tried the manoeuvre on that side and got sick again. I have not attempted anything since, but still feel quite off balance.\n\nI have an appt booked in with a vestibular therapist later this week, but I am hoping for some insight from the community in the meantime. I do not know what is going on, the vertigo seems to be switching sides and is more difficult to clear than I have ever experienced. Any tips are welcome!\n\nOne additional note, since the past year I have been diagnosed with chronic migraine and am on two medications for this: Candesartan and Aimovig.

It is fairly common with treatment of posterior canals seen with Epley maneuver, where crystals can mobilize into a horizontal canal\u2026 treatment is not exactly the same and sometimes is the exact opposite of what you would do with Epley. At this point, leave it to the professionals. You can however be aware of your imbalance and attempt to stay more upright when sleeping at night to keep you safe abs help with symptoms in the mean time\u2026 New here, so not an expert, but I, too, have experience nausea/vomiting with Epley, so much so that I have avoided it and am now on day 22 with vertigo. Finally saw a head and neck specialist today, and was approved to take zofran before I attempt the maneuver again so I do not get sick. 22 days, oh my! I am very sorry to hear this and I hope you are able to clear it! I did not read this until after my appointment yesterday and the PT did not mention canal conversion, although he said I had atypical symptoms. His testing showed posterior-LEFT side BPPV, but he said my eyes were tracking in the opposite direction than expected. He said this could be due to the specific position of the crystal in the canal.\n\nUnfortunately, after receiving treatment I have had a couple episodes of nystagmus on the RIGHT side, and on his advice I just did an Epley for that side. Luckily the intensity was much less and the nausea was very brief, so I was able to self-administer this time.\n\nI mentioned this canal conversion in my message to the PT so I will see what he says. I also asked about having BPPV on both sides concurrently. Bilateral canals is possible, but not common. Trust your professional. Good luck.", "Vertigo drove me to depression It is official. I thought it should be gone within 24 hours the first time I got it. I will wake up the next day and everything will be back to normal. Nope. Well 3 days then. Nope. A week? Nope.

I do not know. So for now, I am depressed after spending 3 years going from severe depression to happiness. Very unfortunate that I just threw away those 3 years because of some dizziness. Fuck vertigo. I hope I will be normal again some day but for now, I feel like I am in hell I had a bout of BPPV that lasted 4 weeks, and then started feeling better and better little by little. It took another 2 weeks after that for it to fade completely. Do not give up and keep strong. Stay cautiously optimistic. I have talked to people who have had to deal with the dizziness longer than me, and others shorter than me. But it goes away. Have you checked in with a doctor or ENT? Do the Epley maneuver from time to time, and stay focused on improving. \n\nI think one of the key aspects of that point in my life was to understand that my health and mind are at risk, and they need to come first. I had to take an extended leave of absence from work (they did NOT like that, they did not believe a person could be dizzy like that non-stop) and I just focused on improving my life at home. I could not do a lot of things I love and enjoy, so I focused on small things. Arts and craft and that kind of stuff. It was a challenge. It is like learning to stand on a moving bike while dizzy. But be persistent, safe and have fun. I would call my friends over and tell them how I fell off the toilet while trying to sit down. Talking with them helped me. I tried to keep the conversation about them, and even tried to cook for them! They saw me struggle pretty bad but I would try to lighten the mood.\n\nSo, there is things you can do and focus on to help you, you just got to stay strong and cautiously optimistic. Do not give up. Keep at it and take it step by step. Baby steps of you have too. Do not worry about the outside world too much, focus on improving your quality of life for the time being. Little things, like maybe cleaning up that room or thing you have been putting off. Or listen to motivational videos on YouTube.\n\nAnd if you need to chat, you can always hit me up. But stay true and do not give up. You have got this, friend.  /u/BackSinner nailed it (falling off the toilet made me laugh and reminded me that someone at work thought I was drunk because I kind of veered into the wall while walking) and let me add a couple things.\n\nA friend knew intellectually that I had BPPV but she really did not **know** what that meant....until she got it. She used the word \"horrifying\" to describe the experience. Yup, that is about right. \n\nIt really helps to have someone who talk to who has had vertigo and knows what you are going through. To that end, you can get in touch with me as well and I would be happy to chat on the phone too. Things will get better. It may not be easy or quick, but it does improve! \n\nThere also may be a link to low vitamin D so it cannot hurt to take it. Please go see a Physical Therapist who understands balance issues as it is not uncommon to have to do the Epley over the course of many days. I know, it is awful doing the maneuvers but they help you get to the other side!\n\nFrom one BPPV sufferer to another, keep your chin up and plowing along. Im interested on the link on the vitamin D deficiency to this. I havent heard that before but i guess i would be a good example of that link. I started out with BPPV and i always have a low vit D, enough that i get prescribed 50,000 IU. It later progressed into PPPD, as i was told * Are you sure you have BPPV? Have you been diagnosed with BPPV? What have you been doing for it? From ( article\n\nRESULTS:\nAfter two months of treatment, in both vitamin D treated and non-treated groups the intensity of BPPV decreased significantly as compared with control (P=0.001 for both groups) but at endpoint, the intensity of BPPV aggravated and regressed to the baseline value in vitamin D deficient non-treated group (P=0.001) whereas, in vitamin D treated group, improvement of BPPV remained stable and unchanged over the study period.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThis study indicates that correction of vitamin D deficiency in BPPV provides additional benefit to rehabilitation therapy (Epley maneuver) regarding duration of improvement. These findings suggest serum 25-OHD measurement in recurrent BPPV.", "BPPV first timer Hey guys - a week ago woke up with all the symptoms of BBPV.

But no more intense dizziness or nystagmus after it was clear the Epley had worked. I have now been through this three times and have learned that for me, the Epley works. I hate doing it and I sometimes cannot tell immediately if it has worked but I have generally been successful. You need a Vestibular Physical Therapist. After trying Epley for weeks I found a VBT and one session started to improve the symptoms. If the Epley does not work right away it is likely not going to. I found a vestibular therapist in the Physical Therapy department that specializes in dizziness.  My regular doctor, the ENT, and neurologist offered little help. Yes - they ruled out more serious issues - but could not seem to help with the actual BPPV.  MY PT was equipped to test for many types of vertigo - as there are different maneuvers that need to be done, according to which inner ear canal is effected.\n\nIt took over two months and over 20 Epley and many half somersaults to get my BPPV cleared. Some people have stubborn cases, or the crystal that is causing the problems are in 'clumps' and it takes longer. The Epley made me super sick each time. The half somersault did not make me so sick.  I find it is key to know which side of your ear is the problem child, as that is the side you want to treat. I had residual dizziness (and it was super yucky) for almost 8 months after.  But - my residual dizziness could have been worse because it took so long to correct the BPPV. \n\nBest wishes to you! Hoping you get some answers and have a speedy recovery!

Canalithiasis is the most common and occurs when otoconia are moving within the semicircular canal, causing vertigo and nystagmus that resolves within 60 seconds.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Cupulolithiasis occurs when otoconia adhere to the cupula and cause vertigo and nystagmus that persist for a longer period of time.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;((\n\n  \nIn case anyone is experiencing lengthy episodes of BPPV and are wondering why some of the more popular maneuvers (Epley, Somersault) simply are not working, there are other maneuvers you can do. (Which maneuvers are TBD, still trying to figure my own BPPV out right now, heh)", "Favorite Maneuvers I have been dealing with intermittent vertigo for about 6 years now. It happens a couple of times a year, mostly during the summer. Episodes last  a few weeks. I had my first ENT appointment a week ago, which was pretty underwhelming. He had me answer a few questions and pretty much confirmed that I had BPPV, which I had self diagnosed and have been treating for awhile now. He did not perform and hands on procedures or scans. Kaiser... am I right?\n\nAnyways, the one tid bit that I did find interesting was that he claimed that what I am experiencing is purely mechanical and can only be fixed mechanically. So I proceeded the last few weeks not concerning myself with allergy or anti-dizziness medicine and only tackling the spins with maneuvers. \n\nHere is my new cocktail of maneuvers:\n- I wake up in bed sleeping flat\n- Vertigo is triggered/confirmed by turning my head to the left while laying down or sitting straight up\n- If I can trigger it, then I start the Epley maneuver affecting the left ear\n- I sit straight up and rest for 10min\n- I then do the Foster half somersault maneuver affecting the left ear \n- At this stage, I should feel a lot more balanced. If this is early on in a persistent episode then I will most likely feel very nauseous and anxious. However, if after 10 min I still feel imbalanced then I repeat the Foster maneuver until everything feel exactly balanced. \n\nThe turning point for me was finding the right set of maneuvers and performing them until everything felt completely balanced. Before I would do a maneuver one or twice and deal with the residual unbalance for weeks. \n\nDoes anyone else have a procedure locked down? I did the Eply maneuver twice and my symptoms disappeared. That was 2 years ago and it has not come back since. Keeping my fingers crossed. The best maneuver is the one that works and that varies depending on which ear canal is involved. Even knowing which canal some maneuvers will work better than others for different people. It is always best to see an experienced doctor if possible. How do I find a doctor that will not brush me off? Can I call kaiser for a second opinion?", "Pain on left side under eyebrow and up into temple Does anyone else have this sort of pain? It is sensitive to touch almost like a bruise? Currently in week two of therapy from bppv. Just wondered if anyone else has experienced this type of pain. It is most likely brain cancer or a brain aneurysm.  I am kidding of course, I am not a doctor and have no idea.  But I am pretty sure it would not be related to BPPV.", "Not full on spins, but a wave of dizziness when laying on \u201cbad\u201d side Hey everyone, I am going on week 3 of residual dizzy feelings, after having the Epley maneuver done twice, PT says crystals are back in the correct spot, and has me doing 3-4 different exercises with my eyes and head movement, but I have been mainly sleeping on my good side for 3 weeks now, every time I try to sleep on my right side, I get a sense of dizziness, but not the full spins. Anyone else experience this ? yes - this still happens to me. I had active BPPV for over two months. My residual dizziness is now on month 4 or so.  I have been mostly sleeping on my good side and on my back. If I lay on the bad side, I still get a wave of dizziness.  According to my therapist, this is because your vestibular system is trying to get back in sync with being 'normal.' again.  I was supposed to challenge this right after my BPPV was cleared to help get my system back to normal quicker.  I did do tons of exercises challenging my system - but did not want to risk laying on the 'bad' side again.  And by challenging - I mean if you bend or turn a way that causes the residual dizziness, I was to turn that into an exercise and keep turning that way 15 times - and repeat that 3 times.  I was supposed to do this multiple times per day.  And I agree - it did help the residual dizziness go away quicker.  But laying on my bad side. Nope - not ready to give it a try yet.  Too scared of the crystal getting loose again and getting full blown BPPV.\n\nSo, long story short - if you are brave enough to lay on your bad side - go for it! After being free from BPPV for 3 weeks, it should be fine for you to lay on your bad side. And the more you do it, the quicker that residual dizziness will go away.  I am just too chicken to challenge that one! Thanks for the reassurance! I think anxiety is playing a big role in this as well for me. I am going thru this now. My PT has me doing the Brandt- Daroff 3x a day to help with the residual dizziness. Basically our vestibular systems need to be rest and realize that those positions are not a danger. \n\nI think it is also pretty common to suffer from PTSD after a long bad episode. I know I have been lying down at night and just like waiting for the dizziness to come on....even though it is greatly improved.", "Reoccuring BPPV Hello everyone!\n\nI am new to this community and I have had BPPV a total of 4 times since 2016 (FYI: I am female and 28 years old). I am sad to see that others are dealing with this that are similar in age, however, it is slightly comforting to know that I am not the only one.\n\nEach time I get BPPV, it is different lengths of time and the severity is also different. The last time I had it was when I woke up last Friday (Dec 13th). However, it did not affect me while doing normal everyday tasks like in past times (only while sleeping on my right side). I went to physio twice and now it is gone again.\n\nI was just wondering how many times have you had BPPV reoccur? Have you only had it once? Or have you had it multiple times? For me, it was May-July 2016 (2 months roughly), Dec 2017-January 2018 (1 week), July 2018 (1 day), and Dec 2019 (6 days). \n\nI hope I do not have to deal with BPPV for the rest of my life but a part of me feels like this might just happen every year or so. It is manageable and going to physiotherapy seriously helps. I like to think of it as just a common cold, sometimes you get sick, but it will go away if you are reactive and get it dealt with. \n\nI wish there was a way to be proactive, but I think it just randomly happens. I try to live my life as normal as possible and do everything that I would usually do because I do not want BPPV to control my life or be scared to live my life.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading and I am looking forward to reading what other peoples' thoughts are on BPPV. I have only had it once for about 2 months (this September -November)... I do not really know what side it is on as PT treated both sides. I am scared it will come back... so I have just kept sleeping on my back. Does it happen every time you sleep on your right side?\n\nUgh it is stressful I am sorry to hear about your experience and how stressful it can be. I do not have it anymore. I got treated for it and it only took 6 days to feel back to normal with no vertigo. I was able to sleep on my right side last night :)\n\nThe clinic I go to make me wear those goggles, so they can determine the correct diagnosis for me. This time it was my right side horizontal canal.\n\nMy best advice is not to be scared of it. It is like spraining your ankle. You may sprain your ankle once and you may sprain it again later on. However, you got treatment once and now you know what to do again to get better even quicker.  \n\nFor sleeping, I would say do not be afraid to sleep on both sides as well as your back. If anything, I would sleep with 2 pillows just so your head is propped up. That is so funny I am a 27 year old female and I also had mine recur on December 13th when I woke up!\n\nI first had an episode when I was in college, I think I was 21 years old. I had just gotten my wisdom teeth out a few weeks prior to the episode and I am convinced that was what triggered it in the first place, sitting practically upside down in a dentist\u2019s chair for at least an hour and them drilling my face. \n\nAnyway, in college I remember having drank the night before and I rolled over from sleeping on my right side onto my left side and the room just started suddenly spinning. I thought maybe I was still just really drunk but quickly realized that was not it. The violent spinning stopped shortly after it began but I still got dizzy when I tilted my head back and my balance was off. \n\nMy parents took me to the ER where they did the Epley maneuver. It did not immediately help, I did not feel better right away. I had this cloudy headed feeling and was off balance for about a week after the episode. But it did eventually fully resolve and I did not experience another episode until last Friday, December 13th, 6 years later. \n\nIt happened the same exact way it did before too. Rolled from sleeping on my right side to my left and boom, room spinning. Went to the ER again just to confirm that is what this was as it had been so long since my first episode. They sent me to PT on Monday (their ER PT had left for the day). But by then my symptoms were much better, they did some head maneuvers to see if I had nystagmus and I did not at that time. But the foggy head and off balance feeling lasted until about Thursday of this week. Now (Saturday) I feel completely normal. \n\nI am still anxious that it will come back, but I know I cannot live in fear my whole life. And now that I know I can just go to PT, it makes me feel better that there is an easy fix. \n \nI wonder how common it is to have BPPV like this, that recurs randomly with long periods of time between episodes? Thanks for the advice. :)\n\nI have just been traumatized to sleep on my sides now lol I actually got it the most laying down flat. \nIt is hard to not be scared of it but I have accepted that it is something that happens. I just hope it does not come around to often. I am sorry it is reoccurred for you a few times over the years, but I am glad that they are not as long as your first bout and only a few days. I still have some unsteady/woozy feelings every once in awhile...like when I bend over to wash/blow dry my hair but no vertigo since Epley treatment. \n\nI sleep with one of those \u201cu\u201d shaped pregnancy pillows with another pillow to prop me up. Not preggers but definitely more comfy than the wedge pillows. I will eventually try to sleep on my sides again, BUT I have actually trained myself to sleep all night on my back. They say...sleeping on ur back prevents wrinkles. Lol Mine is in my right side. I had a bad vertigo spell back in May and still cannot lay on my right side without developing bad vertigo. Hoping it will eventually pass because that is a side I used to sleep on! I had a similar situation (bppv recurring after i thought it got treated. Turns out i had to get more intensive treatment with a clinic that focuses solely on vestibular/balance issues. It hasnt returned since.\n\nGo see a renowned specialist and you might see dramatic improvement. No problem! I completely agree with you - I am scared as well and just coming to terms with the fact that this might just happen every year or so is really hard to accept. \n\nThat is a great idea about using the pregnancy pillows! Haha Ahh, that is so crazy that you woke up the exact same day as me with BPPV! \n\nI feel like you are right that getting your wisdom teeth was probably the culprit. When I woke up with vertigo on Dec 13th, I think it was due to me going to the dentist twice earlier that week (check-up and a cavity filling) and I also went and got my hair done (tilting your head to wash your hair). I like to always justify why my BPPV happens - I never want to just think it is random because that is a horrible feeling that I cannot do anything.\n\nI am glad you are feeling better! December 19th was the last time I had any dizziness symptoms. But I can report now that it is been 3 days so far with no vertigo :)  I have even decided to sleep on my right side even though that was the side that was affected.\n\nI am also wondering the same thing. The first time I had BPPV in 2016 I think it was due to an ear infection (my ear was clogged and I decided to use drops which I think made it worse). The second and third time I smacked my head pretty hard because I can be a clutz at times haha. And then the fourth time was me just thinking I could do normal things like book 3 appointments in one week that might make people like me get it again. Overall, I think in my case it is all self-induced pretty much (or at least I hope so that I can prevent it from happening again, but we will see). That is horrible - I am so sorry to hear about your experience. They say that it will eventually go away on its own. However, to speed it up you could try some maneuvers if you have not tried yet. My last case of BPPV was also the right side and I used the BBQ roll/Lampert maneuver. Hoping your BPPV disappears quickly so you can get back to sleeping normally! That is awesome that your BPPV has not reoccurred since! I go to a clinic where they specialize in balance and dizziness. It works for about a year or so and then something happens and I get it again.\n\nWhereabouts are you residing? I am in Canada and I would definitely be interested in going to Toronto or Vancouver to see a renowned specialist. I live in California. I visited Dr. Mango's team in ( and they completely addressed (i.e. \"cured\") my bppv, hopefully for good. \n\nI saw a few other clinics and they did not resolve my vertigo so I had the sad thought that it was something I would have to tolerate for the rest of my life. Then I saw Dr. Mango's team - they put me through a battery of tests and finally put me in this zero-gravity chair to pinpoint exactly where the olith was residing then rolled it into place. Wow, that is really neat! Thank you for providing that info. I will have to look into it :) :) \n\nNow you have a reason to come visit SoCal during the winter! Thank you I will definitely check out that maneuver! My first episode was about 6 years ago when I was 25. We were at Disney world and went on that mission to Mars ride where you look at a screen but the whole room you are in moves. I am convinced that is what initially caused it, the rest of the vacation I felt awful and could not go on any rides.\n\n My second time happened a year later. While I was on top of the wing of an aircraft (I work on planes for a living), I was close to the edge and on my hands and knees. When I stood up everything started violently spinning so I just let my legs collapse and crawled back to the top hatch. I went to the doc later that day and he performed the epley maneuver but it did not work right away and it was happening in both ears. Later that night I researched the half somersault method and that cleared it up after a few hours.\n\nThird time was another year after that I was snowboarding. Happened about halfway down the mountain after I took a little tumble and hit my head. I only got to snowboard for a few hours on a 4 day trip. I performed all the maneuvers I knew on both sides but I could not figure out what side it was on. This episode lasted the longest and after I got back from that trip I was told I was leavinf the next day on a short notice trip for work. I saw a doc on that trip and the epley worked this time.\n\nI have just started having an episode last night when I rolled over and my world started spinning. So now I am just trying to ride it out. The maneuvers are not working this time either. I am so sorry to hear that you have had reoccurring BPPV. I would definitely recommend going to a balance and dizziness clinic ASAP to get treatment for your most recent case of it. I know that you feel like you can ride it out and that the maneuvers you are doing are not working so what is the point. But trust me, it is so worth getting it properly dealt with. I got better in 6 days - if I did not seek treatment I bet I would still have it and may still have it for another month or 2.\n\nThat is very interesting that you have been able to possibly pinpoint the causes for your BPPV. Do you avoid doing these activities now? Sorry to hear we are in the same boat! \n\nI am 27F and I have had BPPV since I was about 12-13 years old with about 3-4 episodes each year that would last anywhere between 2 weeks to 2 months. The dizziness was not overly severe though (or maybe I just learned to put up with it) and would only be really bad when I would first wake up and I would be fine by the time I had gotten ready for the day/had breakfast etc. Definitely uncomfortable though! It was almost like waking up drunk and not being able to walk straight haha. \n\nDespite having it for so long (and at an unusually young age) I am only just about to go to specialist balance disorder clinic next month. About 5 months ago I had the worst episode I have ever had where the room was violently spinning and it was making me vomit constantly from the motion sickness. It was triggered by me falling backwards into bed a bit too hard and I slammed my head on the pillow hard enough to jerk my head. \n\nI got taken to hospital where it continued for about 2 days. It lasted so long because the Epley manoeuvre was not working- it was too long of a procedure and my dizziness was so severe that I would get through 2 steps and then start vomiting and could not continue. We ended up trying alternative manoeuvres! The one that worked was one that they do not do with elderly patients but they basically slam you down hard on the bed on your side, lift you up quickly and then slam you down on your other side. \ud83d\ude02It would have been pretty funny if I was not in pain! \n\nThat episode was a horrible experience but the good thing to come out of it is that I got the referral to go to the specialist clinic whereas doctors would normally just tell me to wait for it to subside and they could not do much about it. \n\nI hope you get to a place where it is manageable for you! It is a horrible thing to have to deal with! Wow, I am so sorry to hear that you have had BPPV since you were 12-13 years old! I am really glad to hear that you are going to see a balance and dizziness specialist next month. They will definitely help you get better quicker and provide you with info about the condition. \n\nFor the most part my BPPV is manageable, it is just upsetting when it happens. It truly is a horrible thing to deal with. The most challenging part I find is explaining it to other people. I am really happy that I came across this reddit thread and that there are people my age that are dealing with this condition as well.", "How old where you when you got bppv? Just out of curiousity.

My bppv started at 12 and pretty much ruined my junior and senior years of high school. I completely empathize with you and your frustration. \n\nDid the ENT confirm that it is actually bppv? As there are several causes of dizziness/vertigo. If so, then I suggest you get yourself to see a vestibular physical therapist. You could be doing the exercises incorrectly/wrong angle etc. You can find one in your area on the website vestibular dot org and click on \u201chealthcare directory\u201d. These are physical therapists that specialize in the vestibular system/dizziness. Have you had earaches or infections lately? Anything with your sinuses, allergies?\nBeen to the doc lately? \n\nNo caffeine, no super sugary foods, take care of your anxiety. Breaks from screens, and try to do your exercises a lot. Make sure you are not hungry, dehydrated, or getting sick. All of that cannot cause dizziness. Pressure on the weather fronts can also contribute.\nTry meclizine for dizzy spells, it seems to work good. Also, ginger is good too. Peppermint seems to help some. Get a referral to see a physical therapist who specializes in vertigo. Like someone mentioned try consuming ginger, maybe as a tea? You could also try wearing sea bands, I notice those usually help a bit. Also sorry to hear that you are going through this! My symptoms began during my second year in college and I have never been the same since unfortunately. It is just been constant trial and error. Poor thing! I am 23 and have had this for over a year now! No relief either. You are not alone. I could not even imagine going to high school with this. You are a strong person! \u2764\ufe0f You should ask your doctor about SSRI medications, they are said to help with dizziness and vertigo! I hope you can find the right one for you! and I hope you heal from these horrible symptoms asap!

So I had positional vertigo about 6 months ago and got a prescription for nausea medicine for it. There seemed to be no cause for it then as I simply woke up one morning with symptoms. It went away after about a week. \n\nIt seems to have come back the day after I went to Disneyland, and I think the jarring rides may have caused it. It is not as severe as last time, but it is concerning nonetheless. I still have some nausea medicine (Ondasenton ODT) which I hope lasts until this goes away. \n\nHas anybody else gotten BPPV from roller coasters? Thanks. My BPPV started immediately after a 3 hour flight.  I am convinced that the change in air pressure blasted the crystals into my inner ear canal. I can well imagine that a similar thing happened with you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never liked rollar coasters. Now I have a second reason not to ride them. ) Did you have a cold or a stuffed nose? That could explain it - my doctor told me to use a nasal spray with xylometazoline during take off and landing, to make sure the canals are clear and ease the pressure on my ears :) \n\nAh and pop your ears once in a while, do not wait for the pressure to accumulate and for them to pop on their own.", "Does vomiting help? Just threw up. As with most things, usually that makes you feel better, and I do a little. But will all that nausea just come right back?\n\nAfter a long good night's rest, I suddenly awoke this morning in a tail spin. After a few more times, I realized it happens when I am on my right side so I believe it is this BPPV.\n\nor is the only main solution to do those exercises and wait for it to go away in a day or two? Vomiting does not help. If it is indeed BPPV you need to do the exercises and because it happened on the right side then you start the Epley maneuver on that side.\n\nBut be warned, the exercises are awful and you will feel even **worse** when you are doing them. I have done them before many times and I have to screw up my courage to do them when I get an episode. \n\nYou should get checked out by a Dr so they can give you a definitive diagnosis, with an ENT being the best, but a general practitioner works too. But neither of them is the best at the treatment and for that you should look for a Physical Therapist that specializes is balance disorders.\n\nI hope this helps. yeah I did not mean if vomiting would be a solution. but to answer my own question, it does help with taking the edge off of being so dizzy and nauseous. I am still dizzy but have at least been able to drink and eat some now. Try holding your nose closed blowing just barely slightly just a tiny tiny bit. I discovered this one day in desperation after being in bed for 12 hours motionless staring at the ceiling.\n\nFor me that works it seems to reduce the symptoms of BPPV but it does not get rid of them. It makes it tolerable for a while. Do the exercises help then? You said they make you feel worse. My dad has BPPV and has vertigo every 2-3 days, and he stays in bed the whole time. Im just looking for tips which will help make it tolerable, so i would really appreciate any help man. Sorry, I should have been clearer. When you are on the other side and **finished** with the exercises, you will be happy you did them. It is like night and day going from \"I will never be able to live a normal life again\" to \"Hey, I feel a little beat up but I am doing ok! I wonder what is playing at the movies.\" (subject to ensuring that you do the exercises to target the correct canal, get help from a Dr/ENT/Physical therapist)\n\nBut actually doing the exercises sucks because you feel worse during them. It is like you are leaning into a punch.", "BPPV? Hey guys!\nIt startet almost two weeks ago when I got my new earbuds. I wore them about two hours at work when suddenly I was feeling so dizzy and lightheaded and I had to go home. The next day I tested the earbuds again and the same thing happened so I knew they caused this. After that I have not used them or any other earphones but I still feel a bit dizzy non stop. The feeling I have is almost like I am on a ship. My head feels heavy, some fullness in ears and a bit nauseos some times. Usually it is quite mild and I can handle this but sometimes it hits harder and I need to lie down and my legs and hands feel weak. I have tried the Epley manouver and I am not sure it has helped. And I also dont think head or eye movement is triggering it. I kind of feel it all the time. Its really annoying and starting to affect my everyday life a lot. I am a backbacker in Australia and Im not sure how it is here with the doctors and how much would it cost me ect so  I thought I write here first.\nDoes somebody have some advice for me or knows what it could be? \nThank you! It does not sound like BPPV is head movements and positions do not trigger vertigo for you. Actually, there was a thread posted a while back with users experiencing similar symptoms after using headphones. Check it out: \n\n\nHope this helps. For treatment, unfortunately I am not familiar with Australian healthcare, but you should be able to see a doctor and ask them about your symptoms. Take care! xx Update: the dizziness is kind of gone away but since yesterday I have a pretty high temperature so it is probably some infection in my ear. I go to the doctors on Monday but does somebody know any home treatments I could do in the mean time? :)", "10+ bout a day for 18 years I have vertigo all the time. From the moment I wake up.

Both in family Why have not you gotten an MRI to rule those two out?? Also no, BPPV does not occur without motion. It is a mechanical problem if debris floating in the tube work within the inner ear. There are a number of vestibular disorders that are associated with hearing changes that can also be tested for by an ENT or neurologist. Also, disability can be gained for a condition of this nature IF you have a real diagnosis. Sounds like they have not given you an answer yet. See a new ENT or neuro MD please.

Hi \nYes i have seen many ENTs/ audiologists and just recently got referred to a vestibular therapist that im currently working with but not really sure she will be very helpful..i told her many times about this n she is not giving me exercises to specifically target n correct it..so i was hoping someone would give me some advice\nBtw i had bouncy vision when i walked first 3 weeks after initial attack in May but that resolved quickly so not sure why certain head movements are still not okay for me I saw three different vestibular therapists before finding the one who I felt was making a difference. This sounds exactly like what I went through after I had BPPV. My gaze was off when I moved my head up and down, left and right. I found it hard to focus when reading on the computer or a book. I also felt very dizzy when tilting my head left and right. With that said, I worked with a physical therapist for 2 months and I started to feel a lot better. My PT put me through a lot of \"high intensity\" work outs where I had to do a lot of head movements and hand-eye coordination like juggling a ball while spinning or jumping on a trampoline while catching balls from multiple people throwing them at me. I \"graduated\" PT and for 2 months felt pretty great. However, just recently in the last 2 weeks, I have noticed my gaze instability come back. Its been very subtle, a little light headedness when I move my head too quickly, I get dizzy when I do certain workouts, etc. I hope it does not worsen but if it does I know I can go back to my PT and she will set me straight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, TL;DR - I worked with a PT who put me through high intensity work outs that challenged my dizziness and gaze instability and it worked wonders! Best of luck! That is great you had a great therapist to help you..I hope you do not have to go through it again ! im working with one now and she is having me do the same exercises you mentioned. Im only seeing her once a week and doing the rest at home cuz i dont have time for more sessions. Problem is im not sure whether the exercises should be done at high speed if i can tolerate it from the start or has to be done at low speed then faster with time? I read somewhere the object or sign you are fixating on should not move or bounce as you move your head is that right?", "oitis media (advice needed:/ ) I have constant vertigo throughout my day and i am on day 21. I have seen an optometrist, chiropractor, ent, urgent care, mri, and my primary doctor. so far only diagnosis i got was oitis media (middle ear infection) from the urgent care. so i went on 7 days of antibiotics the liquid went down but they say most cases of inner ear infections can last 6 weeks. im half way (if this is truly the remnants of middle ear infection). the vertigo is the worst part because i still cannot drive, game or watch tv without the fear of getting a shaky vision, i feel like it instantly triggers my fight or flight responses because i become fearful, anxious and i start to sweat. If ANYONE has had anything close to my symptoms with middle or inner ear infection can you share any advice you got or help you have gotten, literally anything helps. seriously im JUST HALF WAY and feel this defeated. Otitis media is a middle ear infection (the space between the inside side of the eardrum and the inner ear).  Middle ear infections are not typically accompanied by dizziness or vertigo.  Typical middle ear infection symptoms are:  sinus/upper respiratory symptoms, ear ache, slight hearing loss, and maybe some ringing.  An inner ear infection is not really a medical diagnosis, rather a term thrown around by someone who does not want to explain how the inner ear works.  A common cause of dizziness/vertigo is from the inner ear, but does not involve an infection.  One function of the inner ear is balance and orientation of your body.  Three fluid filled canals, situated at different angles, contain something like salt crystals.  It is not uncommon for some of the crystals to move where they should not, causing the system to send a message to your brain about the orientation of your body (laying down, going 55 mph, etc.) different from the information the brain is getting from other parts of your body (like your eyes).  This conflict of signals makes you feel dizzy.  \n\nIn my personal experience, and I have read plenty of others here, was successful treatment by a physical therapist.  My regular doctor and an ear/nose/throat specialist both recommended an MRI and anti-dizziness medicine available over the counter.  I gave someone a ride to their physical therapy appointment and happened to ask their therapist for ideas.  She offered to do something called the \"Eply Maneuver\" on me, which was a precise series of head turns and body positions.  I felt worse for about 30 seconds, then much much better.  I returned for a few more treatments and the dizziness resolved within about 10 days.  She said it might come back but that usually the first episode is the worst one.\n\nI wish you luck because that dizziness was awful! I went with a chiropractor who did the eply twice on me, once slow once fast and not once did my vertigo get triggered. And it is not really when my head is positioned. It is more like movement or focusing on something and looking away quickly triggers it but something i notice very much \n\nwhen i get vertigo after it is gone away, my ear drum or the inside of my ear, i feel some pressure there. Like it hurts because of pressure. I have taken meclizine too but it just made me drowsy the whole day and still i had vertigo This is true, but the other half of this is viral \u201cinfection\u201d of the vestibular nerve which supplies the otolith organs and semicircular canals (mentioned above). It can be with (labrynthitis) hearing loss or without (neuritis) hearing loss. This does take several weeks to improve, antibiotics will not do a as damn thing, and PT CAN help. Get to one for some therapy. Also you could start some vestibular stabilization exercises (a la Herdman) as well. Google vestibular ocular reflex training or VOR x 1 for a head start on PT. I had a ear infection that turned into a mastiod effusion. Dizziness was my frenemey. I got a MRI to find it, as the tests and blood work, etc did not pull up anything. A lot of allergy meds were prescribed, and they said it would take several weeks to clear up. \nWhen I get dizzy, otc dramamine or meclazine work. Also, get a neck pillow, one that you travel with, and put it on. It will keep your head from moving a bunch. \nAlso, try to take calming measures bc once you get dizzy, you get anxious. Wife has been having severe vertigo for a couple days now.  Tried a teledoc visit, urgent care, and 5 hours in ER today with nothing but some dramamine and zofran which barely allow her to keep food down.  It is not BPPD because it is constant and she just has to sit in a dark room with her eyes closed hoping she does not throw up again.  Yesterday I felt a tinge of inner ear pressure but it went away quickly so I am thinking there is something going around that affects the inner ear but I am not sure.  Her temp and vitals all look good, so no signs of infection.  She is in her mid-20's so it is likely not Meniere's or a stroke. I appreciate you thank you for the advice Have you guys gotten your ears checked ?? Just the quick scope they do in urgent care and ER.  I am trying to book an appointment with an ENT but that might take a few weeks. Do you guys have ear pain/pressure or random popping in one or both ears ? I had a couple of transient(&lt; 5 minutes) bouts of pressure but that is it.  Wife has the vertigo and did not notice anything. What are you all symptoms if you dont mind me asking??? I do not have BPPV or at least have had no response to Epley, Dix-Hallpike, Brandt-Daroff tests/exercises, but I feel like I have had something in my ear since Feb 2020. My doctor thinks it is eustachian tube disorder because they found an effusion and fluid in my right mastoid. I cannot get my ear to clear. Both ears ring constantly. I have increasing ear pressure/pain in right ear. And I have the kind of dizziness where everything I lie on sit on stand on is moving. If I close my eyes I go into orbit or a spiral. If I get too winded, that is when I see things move. I never had an ear infection that I know about. Since then I have seen four doctors. No one has a clue after hearing, MRI, CT, VNG clear. I have had migraine meds and decongestants for the ETD which has done nothing. But yes, it feels like something is continually funneling or sitting in my ear and dulls my hearing And makes my right ear feel heavy. I got otitis media infections as a kid, but I am 42 now. I get feeling defeated, and I hope you find some relief and some answers soon. I get constant \u201crice krispie\u201d pops in my left ear when i swallow water or anything really. It is annoying. i got a cold recently so it made my vertigo come back, it was not as excessive but it certainly came back Strange thing is I have not had a cold since this started since I am always wearing a mask. Ugh. Ear stuff is annoying.", "Looking for advice on a possible re-occurrence Hey folks. Reaching out for advice here. About 2 years ago I got a bout of BPPV which was pretty horrendous. I was bed bound for over a month. I eventually found a great physical therapist who treated it. It took several treatments as the crystals shifted to another canal after initially clearing.\n\nWhen it was first going on, I attempted several maneuvers at home, including epley and somersault, but it made it worse for me. So I decided not to do this again.\n\nI have gone 2 years without an occurrence but recently I am dehydrated due to an unrelated medical issue, and today I am discovering that I am getting minor vertigo when I lay down. I am hoping this is going to go away on it is own. Do you have any recommendations? I have unfortunately moved, and there is no where near me anymore I can get this treated, so I feel I am in a bit of a bind. Have you ever had it come back, and it went away on its own? The vertigo I have experienced today was pretty minor, but it is consistent whenever I lay down.\n\nUnfortunately I lack transportation and live in a rural community. Even in the nearest large city there are no decent locations to get this treated. My old physical therapist is many hours away from me and I have no way to get there. Any advice is appreciated I do not have any advice, only reassurance. \n\nI have been dealing with it on and off for about 30 years. Eventually, it goes away on its own. But sometimes, it takes a while.  Hydrate up, and then watch some videos about how to do the Dix Hallpike for diagnosis and the Epley for the specific bout of vertigo. I have also read sleeping at an incline helps recovery after a bout, and it does seem to help me. Hope you feel better. thanks man. I am a little too spooked to attempt them at home, as last time I did that it made it far worse. SLeeping on incline is a great idea, I think I am going to do that tonight so than you for bring it up. Thanks for the good wishes, and you as well In fact this experience you are telling me about is exactly what I was wondering about - glad to hear it does go away on its own eventually, even if it takes some time.", "Anyone get nightmares when trying to sleep? I have BPPV, and I notice when I lay down and feel dizzy I just know, this feeling that I am going to fall asleep too fast and have a nightmare. I hope this makes sense? I wonder if anyone else experiences these short nightmares. I also twitch awake very fast after having the nightmare", "Pulsatile tinnitus? Has anyone experienced any pulsatile tinnitus associated with BPPV? I began experiencing tinnitus about 10 weeks before my only severe bout with BPPV, which lasted six days.\n\nMy near-constant tinnitus disappeared entirely during that episode and  I have yet to experience it again.\n\nPer my audiologist I am treating my BPPV with the Epley maneuver at home, with mixed results. I have to repeat the exercise every few days in order to function somewhat normally. I had some funky ear stuff going on - which closely fit the description of Pulsatile Tinnitus. Yet - the doctors disregarded it. The ENT said my ears/hearing were fine. The vestibular specialist did not have much to say about it either.  I find it hard to believe it was not somehow related.  For me - it was fluttering in my ear(s). It would at times be faster or slower. And then something like a gurgling swish (as if something was making it is way through a valve). No rhyme or reason. It would come and go.  And now - one year past my last BPPV attack that lasted over two months - it is finally gone (knock on wood!). But it occasionally does come back to flutter for an hour or so.  I experienced this with only the last two episodes I had. The first two I did not have the ear stuff going on.  I do have regular tinnitus and have had that for years. But now I have a new higher pitch that sometimes chimes in.\n\nYou mention that you had BPPV for 6 days.  If it is resolved, then you should not need to keep doing the Epley maneuver.  If you no longer get the severe 20ish seconds of vertigo and nystagmus (eye twitching) during the first step of the Epley (called the Dix Hallpike), then likely your BPPV is resolved. You may still be experiencing a residual dizziness - which is a whole different kind of yuckiness. i had bppv for about a month back in march 2020. fortunately i never experienced any ringing in my ears. I passed my hearing test as well.\n\nI still get nystagmus (bad enough to make reading/concentration somewhat more difficult), which worsens between exercises. That severe episode was last February, but it remained debilitating enough that I had to make my first audiologist visit in October. I do have it too. BPPV  with Tinnitus ( occasional), and I used to think that they are not connect lol. I had a severe case of BPPV back in May 2020. I only managed to get working with an ENT in December and I am still going through the epleys with him but I feel like a new person and it is almost resolved. I have experienced really bad pulsatile tinnitus on a couple of occasions and have had regular ringing of the ears. All hearing tests etc okay so he is said it will definitely be linked to the BPPV and all the movement going on in the ears. It is not a cause for concern at all. Expecting it to be gone once the BPPV is fully resolved. Not sure if it is relevant to you but I also had issues with earwax and ringing always seems to be worse when I have lots of wax. i have it whenever i try to workout and im in a pull-up position. like if my heart is beating heavy and my arms are above my head. i hate it", "Diarrhoea during episode? Hi all, asking a question on behalf of my mum (56). She has suffered tinnitus for years and bouts of dizziness. She has had episodes of waking up with vertigo and last week she had a bad episode, the room was spinning and she felt nauseous. For the full day she had diarrhoea and felt that she had a sickness bug. The next day she felt better but was still dizzy and has had bouts of dizziness during position changes such as leaning over or looking up. \n\nShe called her dr who recommended the manoeuvre (cannot recall the name sorry but I am sure you know what it is!). She did it last night and it triggered a very bad episode, she felt so sick after and had to lie down on the floor and sleep there all night as could not make it up to bed.\n\nDoes it sound like BPPV? Can it cause diarrhoea?\n\nI am very worried something sinister is happening; the dr is very relaxed (and not the best) so did not really advise much. She also had coealic disease but apart from that she is healthy. Absolutely not.  Her dizziness sounds like BPPV though. Sounds like BPPV to me too. I had it a few months back. Did the exercises that the ER doc gave me for almost 4 weeks. I was afraid to go to a PT because when I did the maneuvers at the ER I hurled everywhere and was embarrassed to get sick in front of a stranger again. However, when I was not better after 4 weeks I bit the bullet and went. I will never delay again. The PT had special equipment that helps determine the correct maneuvers to move the crystals back in place. After 2 appointments, the issue was resolved. Absolutely not what sorry? Not diarrhoea? Sorry.  Diarrhea is not related to the BPPV she probably has. I had the same experience.  I was so sick after doing the maneuvers and felt WAY worse for the next hour before starting to feel much better.  I was panicking right after the maneuver because I felt so horrible and was wondering if that was my life now lol.  I had to do the maneuver by myself at home.", "Having symptoms of 'dizziness' for 6 months Ill try to keep it short\n\nOne day 6 months ago i wake up feeling weird. I brush it off and went into my car. after driving for 10 minutes on the highway I decided I couldnt handle it anymore and went back home. Spent the day on bed. I did not feel like things were rotating, i could walk just fine, but i was really struggling with cars moving around, its hard for my eyes to focus on one point. Its like sometimes my mind just wants to go blank and not look at anything. Its been like this every since, every day, for 6 months. Sometimes i got it worse, sometimes not, but its always there. My worse symptoms is when im driving, sitting in front of the computer doing work. and in a supermarket. I went to an eye doctor, an ear doctor, and a neurologist. They all said i was fine. The only suspicious thing was an in ear inflammation that happened a few days after the symptoms started. But the ear doctor did all the tests and could not find what it was. I read about BPPV but most people describe their dizziness as spinning. and i dont experience that at all. I have no problem walking, turning my head, biking, balance exercises and so on. I just have this crippling symptom that is hard to describe that does not allow me to work (Im a software engineer). Im on medication now since my doctor said it was probably anxiety. Im skeptical  \n\n\nDoes this sound like BPPV? I got BPPV during brazilian jiu jitsu (a concussion). \n\nI - and along with everyone else i have talked to/researched - experience the spins for bppv because it is sympomatic of an olith moving around your vestibular tubing. It absolutely feels like the world's violently spinning around. \n\nI AM NOT AN EXPERT, but this does not strike me as BPPV. I agree, does not sound like bppv to me. Sounds like it might be Vestibular Neuritis. Go back to your doctor then go see a vestibular kinetherapist. You got this! No, that also comes with violent vertigo amongst many other things. Also not an expert but a BPPV sufferer, and this does not sound like bppv to me either. Keep pestering the doctors bc I have Anxiety Disorder too totally unrelated and that does not sound like anxiety either. my wife gets the same thing. the leading nuerologist in the area says that its just the crystals, and that in rare cases they are \"sticky\" and take forever to settle Gypsy is right. I had vestibular neuritis and you definitely get spinning vertigo.\n\nOP it sounds like an inner ear disorder of some sort. Sometimes anxiety meds DO help inner ear issues.  I would keep a journal of your symptoms and triggers and if the anxiety meds do not help, schedule an appointment with your nearest dizzy clinic. this sounds a lot like what ive been going through for about 4 months now. i did not have a violent vertigo episode, but i woke up in the middle of the night (i very distinctly remember having a dream that made me feel like i was starting to flip upside down) and i had some pretty shitty dizziness and my eyes lost their ability to focus on anything. it triggered some really rough anxiety that still has not subsided, as well as ruined my ability to play sports because i get winded and my heart starts to pumped really hard and fast as soon i try to do something physically strenuous. Hi did you find any answers? Ive been feeling this for about a year! Also no violent vertigo but basically feels like it is all out of focus when going to the supermarket or looking at busy patterns seems like it is anxiety. it has diminished now, but i still get bouts of it every now and then. theres also always a baseline of \"dizziness\" i have almost permanently and i have been coping with that", "New sufferer and I am scared (m, 22)\nNever suffered through anything like this. Woke up Friday morning feeling like the world was spinning before my very eyes. Felt nauseous all day while suffering through periods of severe dizziness. Was barely able to walk without holding onto something. \nWent through the weekend with a few improvements, and now we are here.\nI have done a few \"maneuvers\" to help, and I found I have had some relief doing this, but i dread the prospect of having to see a doctor and specialist for this something I never thought I would experience. I am terrified this is my life now, and it is making me anxious that this could be some permanent issue for me. Just ugh. \nIs this normal? Am I just being overdramatic? You have not said why you have decided you have BPPV. What exactly are your symptoms? What causes your vertigo? I do not like self diagnoses, but it fits the description of head movements causing episodes, nauseous, and severe bouts of \"why is my head spinning\" whenever I get up from the affected side.\nI do not suppose the maneuvers would help with relief if it something else? Not overdramatic. It is total hell. As someone who went through this recently, the only advice I can offer for now is to do everything in your power to curb your anxiety. Keep a positive mind because THIS WILL PASS. I know its a lot easier said than done but DO NOT let fear set in because it will cause way worse issues down the road. I promise it will go away in a few days if you rest and keep positive and just do what you can to lay in the right way to minimize dizziness. Seriously do everything you can to convince yourself it will be okay. So, when you turn your head in a certain direction, the spinning starts?\n\nIf you do have BPPV why would you dread seeing a specialist?? My BPPV was cured almost immediately after seeing my specialist. Most people kick themselves for not seeing a specialist soon and getting it resolved. Never been a fan of clinics and hospitals. I have been a generally healthy individual through most of my life. I just hate that I would probably need to see one now in the worst possible time in the world. Hey man, I was the exact same way. I was completely healthy my entirely life until I got hit with this at 25 for absolutely no reason. If it does not subside or starts to get worse please see a doctor. I am still not sure if you have BPPV or not. But someone posted here a few days ago about an app they created to help diagnose and treat BPPV. Maybe this is something you should look into.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can either buy the APP or communicate (DM) with the person who created it. Maybe you can work something out with them. Definitely helps. I am trying to be positive. I know mine is not \"as bad\" as other people's. I have been improving gradually since first getting smacked by it on Friday. \nMade myself feel worse by doing some maneuvers, but I have gained a bit of relief and I am hoping it subside more so tomorrow. The first time I ever went through it I am pretty sure it was something viral and I was basically bed-ridden for a week and then my life went 100% back to normal. My recent episode is a different story but you will be okay I promise. Not over dramatic at all.  BPPV sucks and terrifies me every time it happens.  I had my first one a very long time ago as a kid and never knew what it was.  Then four years ago I got it again and a few times since.  I usually get residual dizziness after the worst of it and that goes away after a couple weeks.\n\nSeeing a doctor helped me because I was not doing the Epley correctly, so I do recommend that as well as getting a diagnosis. You are not being over dramatic.  People that have never experienced BPPV have no idea how absolutely horrible it is. And I agree with what others have already said - do not let the anxiety get to you.  BPPV can feed off that and it will only make things worse.\n\nIf you have looked into the Epley maneuver and tried it....have you determined what side is effected? If not - you can test this by doing the first step of the Epley (laying back with your head turned to one side - almost to your shoulder, head extended past your shoulders). This is also called the Dix Hallpike. You can do it to the left and see if you get that horrible 30ish second vertigo with nystagmus (eyes twitching).  If it happens, that is the side effected.  If nothing happens, try the right side.  Then continue to do do the rest of the Epley maneuver. If it triggers the vertigo, just wait it out.  Yes - it is horrible. And you may feel yucky after.  I got terribly sick everytime I did the Epley and could only do two per day, and then wait a few days before doing it again.  There is also a maneuver called the half somersault.  It does not provoke symptoms as bad. But you need to know what side you are dealing with.\n\nThe best thing you can do - even if you hate going to doctors, is to find someone that specializes in dizziness.  My regular doc, ENT, and neurologist offered little to no help. I found a vestibular specialist in the physical therapy department.  She was a godsend and did many tests to rule out more serious problems.  She helped me with the Epley.  I had to do it 20 times over the course of 2 months before it worked.  So, please do not wait to get help. Get on top of it right away.  She also gave me exercises to help my balance/vestibular system get back in sync.  You may very well end up with residual dizziness - and those therapeutic exercises will help a bunch. Not overdramatic at all, the first time always catches you off guard. Did you hit head? If you did, that is a cause for sure. Also, I know the epley maneuver and 1/2 somersault are good ones to try too. I had it come back after a month but go away after a week, it is weird. But yes, being nauseous is completely understandable. If you go to the hospital, they might give you meds, just be sure to ask for ones that will not make you sleepy 24/7 because meclizine will do that to you. Hi love,\n\nYou got a lot of good advice from others. Just wanted to let you know that I understand the feels and to let you know that it gets better.\n\nYou are not being over dramatic, the anxiety that comes with BPPV is real and sucks. Just know that it is nothing to be scared of. It is just a bump in the road right now. You will heal up and be back to normal in no time and if it does ever happen again (some people only experience it once and others more) you know what to do and what to expect. \n\nFind a balance center and get professionally treated correctly if you have not. If you have, take it easy on your bad ear for a few weeks and know that residual dizziness is normal for awhile. (Took me 2ish months to feel 100). \n\nFeel better soon! If it is BPPV, going in will not do much as there is no magic prescription medication for it. All you can do is continue with the maneuvers and/or hope the crystal dissolves/relodges back.\n\nIt is important to find out if its something serious but maybe try a remote session with a doctor (over the phone or webcam) but it will be hard because they would need to perform the dax maneuever on you to truly see. Do not you have a family member that could do the dax hallpike maneuver on you? It is not hard to do and the signs (twitch eyes) are obvious.\n\nAlso it depends on where you live of course. If you live in NYC....yes this might be a bad idea to go in. If you live in some less populated area...the hospitals are actually kind of dead believe it or not. It is just the major metro areas being hit hard due to density. It is possible (and common) the manuevers will make you feel sick. Make sure you give each position enough time. Even then, they can still make you more sick but they will help in the big picture. Best of luck mate I got smacked with this on Wednesday morning...awful nausea and I had a doc diagnose me with with BPPV....I am now on day 3 of the dizziness and I came here looking for answers because I had the exact same fears. I am terrified that this is how my day-to-day life will be forever and it is causing me a lot of depression and anxiety....I am glad to hear from others that this is temporary...it sucks man. I am 20 and never thought I  would have to deal with something like this. It is actually getting better. I did a lot of the bppv maneuvers like the half summersault technique, and I also believe my allergies have been a massive culprit as well. Spoke to a doctor and she suggested the maneuvers and decongestant medicine. It is been three days since I have had an episode of vertigo. \nI still get mildly light-headed, but it is getting better each day. Trust me, it will not be like this permanent. Give it a week or two. Thanks! I am a chronic hypochondriac and am prone to panic attacks...so this has been absolute hell. This gives me some hope I am exactly the same way. It is definitely a pleasant ordeal but take it from someone who gets extremely anxious over everything, it does get better. It just takes a bit of time unfortunately. Do not get discourage if you still feel light-headed, it subsides.", "Return of BPPV Hi everyone. So I had an episode in september and it was really really strong one. And it was also the first in my 26 years of life. I found about it and learn how to treat it myself with the maneuver. It was ok. Till the end of the December. It returned, after four months. So again I did the maneuver. This time it was that strong spinning as in september, but I felt really dizzy and threw up. After my treatment I was ok. Now it is 10th of January, after cca 13 days later. After cca 12 days of sleeping normal with lying in bed not sitting. And it returned. Do you have any information on this returning? Is it possible that it could haunt me for the rest of my life? Or it could go away after a few episodes? Or is it hard to tell? Thank you so much for response. Yeah it tends to come back. I was affected for about 2 years and then it resolved itself. Best thing you can do is vestibular physio to reduce the intensity of your episodes \u2014 AND go to a dizziness clinic to get a confirmation that its your inner ear and not your brain. My timeline was very similar. It went away on its own back in September and had another episode in December and I ended up going to a vestibular therapist. That is your best bet. They can tell you instantly if you are experiencing bppv. When I went for treatment I was pretty bad, I ended up throwing up as well. One of the worst days of my life. I have not had spinning since then that was on the 28th. I am still not back to normal but they have me on a program of exercises to help establish balance and anything else that is out of whack from the vertigo. Best bet see a vestibular therapist ASAP. \ud83d\udc4d \ud83d\udc4d Alas - I could not find any \\ information on preventing BPPV from returning.  \n\nWhat has helped me is sleeping on my left side \\ and carefully sitting up in the morning to avoid tilting my head to the right. :) Thank you all for responses! Yeah back in september I visited neurologist who told me that is problem with the ear. When read about causes of this thing, I found out that one of those is a inner ear infection. And maybe I am fabulating, but started to get this puzzles piece by piece: my mother told me that from young age I have commonly had a problem with the inner ear infection, and after years, I would say in last years, I am having this small but annoyingly frequent pain deep down in my ear (I think left). And if it is not a pain, it is like somewhat \"bubbly\". It is like from high pressure. And there is this one time when I was around 8 years old and traveled by plane, I had an ear pain, from the altitude or something. So we will see. It is not like it is all the time, 1x or 2x Epley maneuver and it is good, but I wonder if it is not some infection that can be fixed.", "Okay I have BPPV! 27 F--- Undiagnosed Weak heavy legs.\n\nAlright so thank you to everyone on here who gave me advice and helped me over the past couple of days. It has been so hard ever since my legs started getting heavy for no reason that when I started having the room spinning I thought I lost my damn mind. Just saw the doctor and she did a test and my eyes were moving so I have the benign paroxysmal positional vertigo nystagmus. Check mate and done. I finally have a diagnosis for something! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nabout to go to the pharmacy and get some medication. Any advice on how long I should wait till I drive? I asked my doctor and she said to wait a couple of days and if symptoms improve I just love hearing you guys point of view on things.", "Which side is it? I am feeling a little bit of a head turning / slight moving sensation when I am in bed turning from the left to my back, and also turning from my back to my left side. \n\nI used to have right ear BPPV but went to the PT and it went away minus some residual dizziness. However now it feels like I have a little bit again but I cannot tell if it is my right side because when I am on my back and turn to my right / on my right turning to my back, all I feel is slight wooziness, which I suspect is residual dizziness Turning from back to left sounds like left side. \nIf you feel anything turning from back to right then I would say there is something on the right. If it is been a few days and you are still feeling dizziness when turning in bed like that I would say that you most likely still have BPPV, although possibly more mild, but would benefit from another treatment. You can do an at home epley maneuver as well if you cannot or do not want to go back to the pt. What happens if I do the epley maneuver on the wrong side? \n\nI used to have right BPPV for over 1.5 years and now it is suddenly on the left but I do not know why. \n\nDo you think a bad pillow might be causing it? The first position of the Epley maneuver can tell you which side is affected. If your head is turned to the right when you fall back on the pillow, the problem is on the right side. Doing Epley on the wrong side will not hurt anything, I do not think, but it will not fix anything. \n\nI am currently dealing with a nasty bout of BPPV but Epley, Foster and Brandt-Daroff are not making it any better so I am hoping to get an appointment at the Dizzy and balance Center soon to try to figure out what is going on. If you do it on the wrong side technically nothing should happen. I believe there is a slight risk that the maneuver will dislodge the crystals on your other side. I am not sure how to prevent this, there might be slightly different versions of the epley maneuver to help though. \nIf the symptoms are consistent with BPPV, then it is safe to say that that is what it is. Specifically that the head motion leads to the dizziness about 10 seconds after and lasts for about 30 seconds before going away. I am a little suspicious that doing the epley on my right before when it was affected might have dislodged crystals on my left side. what i am concerned about though is if i do the epley for the left ear and it causes bppv on my right side again after fixing the dislodged crystals on my left. \n\n&gt; leads to the dizziness about 10 seconds after\n\njust to be clear, does this mean that if i am on my back and turn to my left, i should feel the motion going on about 10 seconds after? because i think i feel it immediately after turning i have tried to do the first position on both sides when i first started feeling this, but nothing happened. \n\noh that sounds really bad that nothing\u2019s helping. i hope you figure it out soon, good luck! Thanks! Maybe what you have is residual, then? The last time I had a vertigo episode before my current one it was pretty mild and I did not have the spins so much as just feeling a bit off and slightly dizzy when I looked up. I did the Brandt-Daroff maneuver every day for about a week and it really helped. Good luck! I believe it should come on 10 seconds after, and be strongest within 15 seconds of that and then go away within 30 seconds (of the 10 second onset). But it can vary.\n\nThe other alternative is that you could have had BPPV on both sides, but it was milder on your left, so fixing it on the right made you more aware of the symptoms on your left side, that is what is most common.", "Constant dizziness and running out of hope Hello! I read this page often so I thought I would come here to share my own experiences with dizziness and vertigo. I am a 23 y/o female.\n\n4 years ago, I randomly got extremely dizzy one afternoon. The dizziness was such a weird feeling that it came with a huge bout of anxiety and nausea. A week and a half later, I was very lethargic, could not get out of bed or eat or anything. The dizziness persisted. It took a few months before my doctor tested me and told me I had the Epstein Barr virus which most likely affected my inner ear. During this time I also had severe headaches. Eventually after many months the dizziness started to fade, but it was like a bit of it was always in the background at times. In 2019, this happened again. I randomly got dizzy one day at work while sitting. It was like everything was spinning around me and the same bout of anxiety and nausea took over. This time, I ended up in the ER where I was told it was vertigo again but was negative to all the BPPV maneuvers they did. I went to the ER two more time in the following two weeks because it would not go away and I also had some blurred vision/visual disturbances. I saw an ENT that ruled out any ear infection and an audiologist who ruled out any hearing problems and also said it is a \"vestibular weakness\", not really vertigo, but my balance is just weak and I need to move my eyes more. This period of dizziness was the worst. Not only was everything spinning at all hours no matter what position is was in but also some sort of sinking feeling was happening. Like the first time, eventually it got somewhat better but still always there in the background.\n\nNow, the last 6 months in the last covid lockdown have been brutal. More specifically, in the last 2 months, my dizziness and headaches have gotten much much worse. I also have always had some degree of neck pain, even in the periods of dizziness before, (I assume associated with poor posture) but now it has also gotten worse. Not only does my neck hurt but my shoulders, and the pain radiates to the back of my head. Last week, I went to work and as soon as I got out of my car I was hit with an extremely painful headache and this sharp dizziness when I would move my head. I could not even stand or walk. I could not move my head up/down or side to side. Every time I would take a step, it felt as though I was floating or walking on something wobbly. Every step seemed to radiate some pain to my head. Doctor said it was either a complex migraine or tension headache, but referred me to a neurologist.\n\nI have had 2 head CT scans and a head and ear MRI done which have all come back clean as well as many blood tests. Any advice on how to proceed next? Hello! So sorry to hear you are going through this. I started getting all these symptoms in Oct of 2020 and got tested for everything under the sun and they eventually told me it was \u201cvestibular loss.\u201d My ENT finally came to this conclusion after a VNG test (which was a nightmare).\n\nI was told to go to physical therapy and luckily my city had a top-tier PT team that specified in vestibular issues. \n\nThe PT worked WONDERS. I sometimes feel like it is still there lingering but for the most part I feel like I finally kicked this thing back in March.\n\nI need to do the exercises every single day to keep the symptoms at bay and they told me this could last forever, but I am comfortable doing the exercises so that I NEVER feel like that again.\n\nThe floating feeling is personally what I considered the worst because even if I was not dizzy or nauseous it was always there.\n\nAgain, the PT worked wonders and it is the first thing I suggest everyone with vestibular issues try. \n\nGood luck and DM me if you have any questions. Thanks for the advice! \n\nRight before covid, I did go see a PT who had experience in vestibular issues but even he did some testing and said he did not think it was anything vestibular. He did give me some exercises and I worked with him for a bit until covid shut everything down. \n\nI just started going to another PT now so hopefully it will start getting better. \n\nWish you continued luck and good health on your journey! Thank you so much. I am hoping that PT works for you this time around!\n\nAgain, good luck \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc OP, I went through all this last year myself. My doctor was undecided whether or not I had BPPV or vestibular migraines causing my vertigo. I had a vertigo spell beginning in 2019 that I went away quickly but was followed by lightheadedness and severe headaches for months. Now, I just over a case of covid in April. Several weeks after I tested positive, I woke up one morning with the worst case of vertigo I ever had. That lasted for weeks. I quickly went to a physical therapist and they were able to correct it after several sessions using the epley maneuver. Now, I do not have any vertigo, however, I am back to getting these severe headaches again. I am not lightheaded but I also just feel off balance most of the day. I am sure it is all connected somehow. Trying to figure out the cause can be a pain but like the other person said, I had more help with a good physical therapist via vestibular therapy. Good luck, this is no joke and has completely changed my life (not in a good way) Are your headaches like migraine type (around eyes and on temporalis muscle)? And also, is your dizziness focused on a specific part of head (temple, front, back) or it is just a general dizziness? I am so sorry to hear you are going through this! I completely understand, the headaches are sometimes unbearable. I think my headaches may be related to my neck and shoulder pain as well and everything just seems to hurt at once. Thanks for the advice, I am now going back to PT so hopefully that will help ease some of the pains. \n\nGood luck to you on your journey! Wishing you good health. the dizziness I would say is quite general, I have not been able to pin point it to a specific area. The headaches though are mostly in my forehead (eyebrow level) and the base of my skull. I do also get that pain in/around my eyes. is there any chance that you have TMJ? and also how long does the dizziness and migraines last? are they 24/7-constant, which get better some times inside the day, are they on-off (like, they are present for a day, then you dont have for a week, and then they come back), how would you describe them)? could be possible, I do get slight jaw pain/soreness that I have attributed to my neck and shoulder pain. However, there has not been any injury to my teeth or jaw. When I am having a bad flare up, headaches and dizziness are constant. The only thing that helps is laying down, that kind of stops the pain. The dizziness is also worse when I move my head around. well it is not needed yo have an injury so as to have TMJ, many people have TMJ all of the sudden, like me, I was wearing braces 4 years ago and then I was wearing mouth guard, after 2 years of wearing a mouth guard, I developed TMJ, with jaw-locks and jaw crushing sounds, along with dizziness, lightheadedness and migraines oh no sorry to hear that! Have you been able to find a solution or something that works the minimizes the symptoms? This is bizarre.  I am in a similar boat although I am currently in an \u2018okay\u2019 period.  No advice, I am just so sorry you have to go through this.  There is nothing more frustrating than not knowing what is going on. Thank you, sorry to hear you are experiencing this too. It is interesting how many people deal with this without knowing what is actually happening. \n\nHope all stays well and good luck! Anxiety causes a lot of this. I get the \u201cwalking on a rope bridge\u201d feeing all the time. after being on an elevator. Or in a car for a long time. I get tension headaches from clenching my jaw all of the time too. I went to so many doctors because I was dizzy. I am also 23, female. You can look into POTS too. Thanks for your perspective. The car thing is very relatable. I have had motion sickness since I was very young and car rides do give me bad headaches. It got better for a period in my teens but came back. \n\nI hope all is well and that no more dizziness comes your way! :) I am so glad I found this.. currently going through the same thing with no answers!! I get lightheaded/dizzy constantly. Also a really tight feeling in my head and face. It is super concerning, I have my first neuro appt next Monday. I hope you get it figured out soon!!", "Can BPPV vertigo be very mild? When I turn my head certain ways I get slight vertigo at times. ER visit all clear after tons of tests. ENT said just hearing loss. I did the stretches for ear crystals, and on one side I sure got a spinning sensation and a a little nauseous.  Could you provide a link for the ear crystal stretches please? Also yes, I get similar mild ones all the time. I have read that if the crystals are very small it can be a very mild vertigo, or the crystals can be sticky and not move very freely which can cause this.  If you know what ear it is I would do the epley every night for a week or two before bed. Yes. I often get mild episodes, especially in the anterior canal. Just a gentle floating sensation, or a slight movement of the room looking up. I usually sleep on an incline and increase water intake for a few days if I cannot get it with the Epley and it seems to peter out on its own after some days. Same here. I got a mild BPPV last night when I forgot to use my inclined book holder while reading my notes on the desk. So instead of the Epley maneuver, I just walked it out, and prayed it out. I felt balanced again after an hour.\n\nSometimes, I am not so lucky - my dizziness can last up to 3 months. One Simple Way To Maintain Your Balance And\u00a0Prevent Dizziness!\n", "Weird dizziness, not sure if I still have BPPV? I had right ear BPPV for 1.5 years before going to a PT for it. Now I do not see the room spinning when I lie down or turn in bed, but I still feel some sort of movement like my head is slowly moving around. Maybe a woozy feeling? It happens occasionally lying down on my back, but more turning to the left and from the left to my back (sometimes the right too). \n\nBut sometimes I also feel some kind of slow moving head sensation even when I am just sitting down or if I am sitting in a certain position like leaning back against my chair looking at my phone that I have held up to about nose level. This feeling is worse on rainy days, sometimes after eating spicy food or eating too quickly, when my allergies are worse (congestion making it hard to breathe), and when I have a headache. \n\nI never had this kind of feeling throughout the day until after seeing the PT for BPPV. Some days are worse than others. On lucky days, I barely feel anything even when turning in bed (although there is still a little). \n\nIs this lingering residual dizziness or do I still have BPPV? It is already been a month You could have a BPPV still there, or more likely sounds like you still have motion sensitivity which can be from BPPV or you may have a low function of your ear which can give you those symptoms (also very common for them to flare if you are sick ie headache). You might need some exercises to help with that, usually it is some gaze stability exercises. This is very common and usually goes away quickly once you start doing the right things. - I would go back and see your PT, one to re check BPPV but also to look at your other symptoms. Do you know if they have experience with vestibular as most physios can do an epley but do not have a lot of experience with other issues relating to the vestibular system. \n\n\nGood luck! Yeah my PT specializes in vestibular issues. What I am concerned about is if she makes me perform the Epley again if there is no lingering crystals causing BPPV, but the exercise messes up other crystals causing them to move around. Because I read that doing the Epley when you do not have BPPV can potentially cause it in the other ear or something like that? Or is that just a myth? In my experience no, I cannot say I think I have ever caused a new BPPV.  Doing the epley (or the first part to test) is just putting our head in the maximal position which would stimulate a crystal if it was there. If a crystal does dislodge it probably would have anyway and then you are in the best position to treat it. The crystals are usually embedded in some gel so they are not floating around ready to go where they should not. I would not recommend the epley as a home exercise if the symptoms are not there. Your symptoms though do not sound like BPPV at present but I always recommend checking as you can be surprised and it is the easiest to fix and sometimes can be setting off some other problems. Would doing the entire Epley exercise dislodge any crystals? Because the last time I went to the PT, she had me do all the steps for my previously affected right ear just in case there were a few lingering crystals there\n\nBefore I would get motion sensitivity turning from my back to the right in bed and that is when she made me do the Epley I described just above for the third time \n\nNow I feel more motion sensitivity turning left for some reason when it was my right ear affected. Thanks for the info btw! Yes often you do the whole epley if you had previously tested and it was positive just incase. \n\nSounds like it would be worth an assessment to address your motion sensitivity. Hope you get better! I do not have an answer but I am having the same thing, just sitting on the couch I randomly feel like I am in motion. The BPPV vertigo is pretty mild now but all of a sudden this started up today. It is bumming me out, I just want to feel normal. I have an appointment at the Dizzy Clinic on Friday, hopefully they will have some answers.", "Persistant dizziness and vertigo after adjustment maneuvers It all started 3-4 weeks ago when I had a really bad ear infection in my right ear, got it treated and everything went well... I still feel a small bit of pain if I move my jaw all the way to the right, but other than that nothing too drastic.\n\nSince then, I would frequently get random bursts of dizziness and vertigo which persisted for the rest of the day, however at that point they were not too debilitating. I decided to get it fixed and after a bit of research, it all made sense. Especially considering the ear infection a couple weeks prior. I decided to attempt the epley maneuver myself and visited the ENT the same day. ENT ran a couple of tests and told me there was nothing too serious and that I could continue with the epley and other maneuvers. However, since the first epley I attempted I have been experiencing constant debilitating dizziness and vertigo. It just does not stop regardless of how I am positioned. It is been 4 days now and I can barely sit at my desk and focus, it is becoming quite worrying considering it is almost exam season at my university. \n\nI read online that a successful repositioning with the epley maneuver could leave some residual dizziness for a day or two, however, I am starting to think that I may have done something wrong and that I did not even have BPPV in the first place. The dizziness and vertigo I have been experiencing are extremely debilitating and I cannot function properly anymore. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience with residual dizziness after the epley or half somersault? Should I continue doing these maneuvers? This is starting to worry me...", "Does anyone get dizziness while driving due to BPPV? \n\n( F,29, Chronic BPPV. Sometimes I get a bit dizzy but I feel like it is less about head movement (I am super careful turning my head during a flare up) and more about my brain freaking out with the visual stimulation. Almost like my brain expects every visual movement to be a start of an episode so it over reacts to visual stimuli. Anyone else feel like their brains overreact or is that just me? Omg yes this is me to a T. I am F, 27, been struggling with BPPV since I was 15. I have so much anxiety about it I overanalyze/overreact to literally every single movement. I have about 4-6 BPPV episodes a year but every other day I am dizzy because I am constantly anticipating being dizzy/looking for it. I avoid so many things like planes/amusement park rides/etc. At the risk of making my brain feel whack. SAME. I have never felt so seen. It can be so discouraging and depressing sometimes how often my brain is triggered and forces me to retreat. I feel like an anxious asshole sometimes with all the limitations I put to avoid episodes but it feels good to know I am not alone. When I first got vertigo, yes but it made me VERY anxious at red lights. Now it does not bother me. I chose yes, but it is really only when I am a passenger. Made me psychotic I swear. I would look down at a red light because the traffic crossing in front of me would trigger. Had to blow cold air on my face to avert a panic attack. Full on crazy. I went on 50 mg of Pristiq to settle my brain, worked like a charm. No side effects whatsoever. I had one relapse of vertigo while star gazing around a campfire looking at Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Lasted a few days, Epley worked. Will not be doing that again. Stay well. Yes, especially when looking over my shoulder Looking over shoulder and down, or down and to the left like when parking and looking at the curb. Have gotten very conscientious about head movements and also I do the kneeling maneuver if I seem to be having a flareup. \n\nAt first, driving was terrifying.", "Recently diagnosed, but still not completely sure.. Not completely sure if it is BPPV, but maybe it is, or something else.\n\nApril 14th, a couple Tuesdays ago, I was taking a bath after a massage which involved using a pulsing device around my neck.\n\nI began to feel very disorriented, and weak. So I got out of the bathtub, and my girlfriend helped me to the bedroom where I basically collapsed in bed, and fell asleep almost instantly for 2 hours.\n\nI was extremely unbalanced, and my eyes could not focus on anything. That night, and the following day anytime I tried to focus on something, it would be like my vision kept wanting to move to the right and drag whatever I was looking at along with it creating the visual to look like a wave of whatever I was looking at to be shifting to the right.\n\nThen April 16th, last Thursday, I went to the clinic to see the ENT (Ears, Nose, &amp; Throat) doctor who checked my temp., looked into my ears, and eyes, and listened to my chest, back, &amp; heart.\n\nThe doctor then made me hop up on a table, and pulled out this extender where my knees were, which made me go into a sitting position with my legs extended outwards. The doctor tipped me backwards, then forward again (my guess some sort of attempt at the Epley manuever), then had me hop off the table back intonthe chair by her desk.\n\nShe diagnosed me with BPPV, but I wonder if she just did that because at the start of the appointment she asked me what I thought might be going on with me, and I said maybe some form of Vertigo, and at the end of the appointment she concured.\n\nI guess I am asking you all if maybe she diagnosed me with what I was just able to gather, or if she would of legit came to this conusion on her own as well if I simply said I could not give her an idea.\n\nI am still wondering if I did not have a mini-stroke, or heat stroke in the tub with warm water while being dehydrated.\n\nI have been at home since resting, and performing the Epley manuever about twice a day since.\n\nIt is now been a week + 1 day, and while I certainly feel better since Day 1, and Day 2, my vision, and balancing issues are still problematic, and disruptive of my everyday life that I was living before all this started. I have not drove, or been able to walk really without complications of being off-balance.\n\nAlso my vision seems to be wonky lately. If I look to my right, and slightly tilt my head back I can see whatever I am focusing on clearly, however if I go to look to my left, or over my left shoulder, it is **extremely** blurry, and I get some heavy double vision that does not seem to go away.\n\nI guess I have the following questions:\n\n1.) Could it be something else rather than BPPV?\n\n2.) How long does it take for me to get back to the same level of vision I had before this started?\n\n3.) Will I ever have the same level of vision, and balance as I did before this started a little bit over a week ago?\n\nThis has caused some quite a bit of anxiety as I have a job I will need to eventually drive to on my own to save money from not taking cabs, etc.\n\nThank you for your time reading this, and any future comments. Doctor should (if they have not yet) do a test to see if you have nystagmus.  Test will video your eyes and see if it drifts.  Nystagmus is a smoking gun symptom of BPPV. Doctor wants me to go tonthe Rehab center for that test I believe, where they put the goggles on you.\n\nHowever it is like $350 or so for that appointment. I am a little angry that they break up these appointments that could probably be all done in one go.\n\nI am not made of money nor have insurance to make an insane amount of trips to the Doctor's or Rehab Center. I fall in that lovely bracket of \"make too much money for assistance\" when I really do not after all my living expenses are paid for the month.\n\nIt all adds to my anxiety lately that I just will not find out what is wrong with me, and I will not know how long all this will take to get better or *if* it even will. When you got tipped backwards, that is the first step of the Epley, and also a diagnostic test called the Dix Hallpike.  If you were laid back with your head turned slightly to the right (or left), and head ending up slightly lower than your body, and held there for about a minute, that is the Dix Hallpike test.  If this truly is BPPV, during that minute of being laid back, you would have had a wave of severe vertigo and nystagmus. Most people can tell their eyes are twitching.  The video goggles will help determine which way your eyes twitch, to determine which canal the crystal is in, if it is indeed BPPV.  This wave of vertigo usually subsides after about 30 seconds. If your doctor saw this happen, they should have continued with the rest of the positions to complete the Epley maneuver.  You can try that maneuver yourself (google it - Dix Hallpike), on both sides (right and left).\n\nI almost feel like this is something other than BPPV.  In my experience (in MY area), and lot of regular doctors, and even the ENT, and neurologist were not fully trained in knowing all about the different forms of dizziness, vertigo, BPPV.  I saw a PT that was a vestibular therapist that did MANY other tests on me to rule out a lot of other conditions that could be going on.  See if you can find someone that specializes in that area to help you.  In the meanwhile, do the Dix Hallpike.  Have someone watch your eyes as well when you do it. You can find videos online of what the nystagmus looks like. So I bit the bullet and went to Physical Thearpy today, and it was not BPPV after I got all my testing done.\n\nDoctor is positive I have Vestibular Neuritis. I have to do rehab exercises at home for the next couple of weeks but the Doctor is confident I will be back to normal (or as normal I was before all this haha) I am so glad you went in &amp; found out what was going on! Thank you for reporting back to us. Others can learn from reading about your symptoms as well! Good luck in the next few weeks with your exercises! Thank you! The test they did for me, the goggle one, took about 5 hours.  Also went into a dark room and sat on a chair which spun around and I had to look at a dot in the dark room.  Somehow that told them I had nystagmus also.  This was at a VA hospital.", "Can doing the Epley on the wrong ear cause that ear to become affected? I had right ear BPPV that cleared up but I had residual dizziness. My PT performed it on me twice again recently in case there were some lingering crystals. \n\nToday I am feeling some vertigo unless it is severe dizziness when I lie on my left and my right, but it is worse on my right. Even moving around, I have some issues. \n\nIf I no longer had BPPV but had the epley performed on me, could this make one or both ears become affected again?", "Is this BPPV? So lately for about a week I started to get the slight vertigo feeling and now it just seems to get worse everytime I feel conscious of it. Like when I am playing a game or something I dont feel it at all, and its constant. It feels like I am on a boat that wobbles. Does not sound like it, but your symptoms could be mild as compared to the severe spinning and rapid eye movement that makes you vomit, like the symptoms I had. Could be MdDS and Meniere too. Does it get better in a moving vehicle? Does scrolling text make you feel nauseous? Have you been on a boat trip or similar lately? It does feel better in a moving car, and usually scrolling doesnt do anything That is MdDS symptom.", "Questioning my vertigo diagnoses. Does anyone\u2019s else\u2019s get worse after waking up? I have a theory that maybe laying all night, the vertigo gets worse when you get up and change positions and the crystals are all out of wack. \n\nCould their be any truth to this? Yes, if you do a maneuver to help reset your Crystal's in your inner ear and then sleep flat on your back you can knock them out of place. After you reset them, sleep at atleast a 30 degree angle for 3 nights for them to settle down in place. I need this but cannot figure out how to do the maneuver properly. \ud83d\ude15 just waiting to be able to go to my PT.  I have low blood pressure and BPPV.  Makes it hard to get out of bed in the morning. If you follow a video on YouTube with the steps sometimes people can get it. The trick is waiting 30 seconds after the symptoms go away before going onto the next step. And sometimes it takes several times going through each step. Granted what you find may not help you out because it could be something other than the BPPV that is causing the dizziness. But your PT could help tease that and your primary physician helping regulate your BP issues. I am positive it is BPPV ... had it last year and primary physician told me it would go away on its own and it did.  This time I have had it for 2 months \ud83d\ude15. At least I do not get nauseous .... yet. Before my crystal got back where it belonged (it took over 2 months &amp; 20 Epley maneuvers) I did find that going to bed &amp; getting up were each an adjustment. I would lay down slowly &amp; get up slowly &amp; it always took my system a while to readjust to being upright or laying down. I know during this time the crystal was still floating around, so it made sense with slow constant position changes. Just to verify, this is not the intense bad vertigo, but rather it was a milder dizziness. I knew which positions to avoid to keep away the bad vertigo (only provoked that during the Epley each time) My diagnosis was definitely BPPV from a vestibular therapist who did quite a few tests &amp; used goggles to video the nystagmus in my eyes.", "Not sure if Vertigo or something else Hey all. For a the past few years (and I think certain times of the year) I suffer from a weird feeling in my head. It is very hard to describe. It feels like my head is heavy with very slight pressure that makes me feel slightly 'dizzy', especially when turning my head. It almost feels like there is water in my head or like there is a slight delay when moving my head. I am wondering now if this has something to do with the inner ear. \n\nI am  in perfect health, so doctors say. No idea what could be casuing this. I have tried researching it on my own to no avail. Some people say I could just be sensitive to barometric pressure and etc. Anyone ever felt anything like this? i just recently recovered from a first bought of bppv. my advice:  go see a ear nose and throat (ent) dr or a vestibular specialist. i saw an ent dr. either should be aware of how to diagnose and perform maneuvers if necessary to resolve your issue. if it is bppv its not supposed to be a serious ailment although obviously if it makes you dizzy enough to fall then you really should get it resolved asap. It is funny. The feeling is more annoying than anything. I am more than able to function. Of course, it is worrisome because I have no idea what this is. have you tried doing the dax hallpike maneuever yourself? No but I will look into it! Vertigo refers to a **spinning** sensation.  If you have vertigo you will be able to detect *what direction* things are moving and what head position triggers the spinning.\n\nOther ear related feelings such as pressure,  being slightly dizzy, fullness in ear etc are a little more ambiguous and you will have to do additional research if you are not experiencing vertigo. With dizzy and ear sensations it is best to see either (or both) a neurologist and an ENT or seek out a dizziness clinic so they can do further testing if this is ongoing. Also -  I always mention migraine as a possibility to people because painless migraines with dizziness as the symptom are sometimes misdiagnosed. Barometric pressure is a big one for migraineurs.", "Help with my mother\u2019s BBPV We have tried the Epley Maneuver twice now, with no results other than her vomiting violently with muscle spasms all over. Someone please help, I am worried. Does the epley typically work for her or is this her first time ?\n\nPersonally I hate the epley but I am not sure if I have bppv vertigo or a different type.

It is not an efficient use of my time but it keeps the extreme nausea at bay.  Maybe this time she should pop a gravol and try to rest if the epley is too much. I am hoping this may be helpful. I am posting a reply to someone else in this sub from 3-4 months ago.\n\nHey I used to have BPPV about a year and a half ago. While waiting to see an ENT I decided I would look around on youtube and read everything I could find online that may help. I tried the epley and it did not seem to help me. I ended up finding ( - half somersault canalith repositioning. I did it on a Saturday morning on my bedroom floor and spent the rest of the day being dizzy, I honestly thought I fucked something up. Anyway, the next day I woke up and expected to feel dizzy throughout the day but I did not and I am happy to say that I have not been dizzy since. I even cancelled my ENT appointment. ( But also watch the video, I hope this may help. It worked for her twice in the past. She had BPPV many times before.", "Light dizziness when mostly looking down I did the epley twice and have been waiting for it to go away for two days now. I do have history of bppv that has happened 2-3 times in the past decade. This started happening the day after I was shaving(probably from bad head positions,looking down a lot etc). Is that what u would call residual waiting for it to go away? I did not have a episode tho so is that weird. What should I do it is very mild? Have you resolved the BPPV? When you do the Epley, during the first step (which is also called the Dix Hallpike, used to test for BPPV), do you still get that brief moment of intense vertigo with nystagmus?  If you no longer can provoke the intense vertigo while doing the Epley, then what you are dealing with is residual dizziness.  I had residual dizziness for over 6 months.  And now - a bit over a year since my last episode of BPPV, I still have residual dizziness if I look certain ways.  One is if I turn my head slightly to the left or right and look down while walking. I cannot seem to make that one go away, no matter how much I challenge it and try to get my body used to it.  I had super severe residual dizziness for the first few months after resolving my BPPV. That could be due to the fact that I had active BPPV for over two months. I never had a episode in the first place for this current residual, Ive only ever had one bad episode in my life when I was young but for this one  I woke up experienced a little headache and then mild symptoms that still are present for 4 days. Is this still residual ? What can I do to help it. And I did the maneuvers and did not experience vertigo which means it resolved but I still get a little dizzy when looking down, very mild tho. There are other forms of BPPV that I am less familiar with. There are 6 different inner ear canals that can be effected. If there is a crystal loose in one of the less common ear canals, it can cause symptoms a bit differently and thus needs other 'maneuvers' to get the crystal back in place.  In this case, it is best to see a specialist that is skilled in dizziness to do a battery of testing.  There have been other posts in this sub referring to these other less common forms of BPPV.\n\nOtherwise - I would have to say it is still residual.  My residual (a year later) still comes and goes.  I have times where I look a certain way and whoosh - just a wave of the mild dizziness (NOT the intense vertigo). And why it gets worse and better - I have no idea. I cannot pinpoint it.\n\nOr - this could be an inner ear infection, or many other things that can cause mild dizziness.  Best to see a doctor if it persists and have a complete check up. How was your quality of life during your recovery? I had my second attack on December 26 and was treated on the 28. Went back to physio on the 31 and the bppv was seemingly resolved. I still do not feel good though. I can hardly do anything at this point. Like Watching tv, pretty much anything that you would normally do I cannot do yet. It is frustrating and hard to feel like there is a light at the end right now... you seem like you have been through it all and a good person to ask. I have the same thing. It comes back again and again, basically after a period of 2-3 years. While it is not at it peak, I can still feel myself spinning if I look down. Maneuvers do help, and I have the medical prescription handy, just in case it strikes back with full force. Just wanted to know, that the affected ear canal, why only that one? and How are other people fine? Is it some rupture in the tube or anything else? I heard somewhere that surgery helps, but I are not going to go for it. PS: vertigo in my family is genetic from maternal side. It is really horrible, I keep on puking every 10 minutes when it comes back, I wonder what is going to happen at the old age. Watching TV was always gross for me! And all I wanted to do was relax and watch TV - but it would make me feel so woozy. A year later - I can watch and only get one wave of dizziness!!!!\n\nI was MISERABLE as I recovered. Yet, I continued with my usual daily stuff. I got up and went to work, I continued running, I snowmobiled, I did all outdoor chores. It was a struggle - but I knew I needed to keep living, as it was my only option. And it was exhausting. For ME - being still and idle, made it worse. My therapist was always shocked that I could continue to run (and even in totally white conditions that messed with your vision, in the snow). I snowmobiled in the winter, and was very active. Many people are so unbalanced, they cannot do anything. I would start to feel better slowly. Like weekly, I would notice a little something. I would have set backs. Then I would feel better. The anxiety of it returning is a killer. And even now, a year later, I think about it every night as I lay down and roll over. Not to mention staring at my computer every day at work. Yuck. Pukey feeling all day long.\n\nThere IS a light at the end of the tunnel. I am not saying it will not happen again. But you cannot fear it. Do not let it consume you. Do not let the anxiety overtake you. Looking back, I likely would have benefitted from some sort of anti-anxiety meds to help me. But I do not like taking meds of any sort - so fought it on my own.\n\nIt also sucks, as folks around you expect you to be fine and recover quickly. The expectations of others is stressful.  Give yourself some grace. Know that it IS a horrible thing, even though it is not life threatening. You feel like crap. No way around it. Rest as much as you can. Do things that make you happy. Try to keep your mind and body busy doing things that do not make you super dizzy. The best thing is to get back to normal day to day things as quickly as possibly. I know it is hard. But you WILL start feeling better. Does your physio offer good guidance and support? Have they given you exercises or helpful advice during your recovery? I know - I totally wish I knew why this happens and what triggers it. All the mentioned 'triggers' are not relevant in my situation. It seems many in my extended family have had a form of vertigo. But for most, it happened only once - and was not truly diagnosed as BPPV. My grandma had Meneires....and luckily I tested negative for that!  Why and how that left sided canal keeps breaking off otoliths.....GRRR! Even yesterday, as I was snowmobiling and flying over bumps and rough ground, I wondered if it would shake something loose. But then remembered my therapist saying, 'You cannot worry about it. You cannot stress yourself worrying about it. No one knows why it happens or how to prevent it.'  Yep, that is true! But I also think that if someone told any of us that deal with BPPV - that if we cut off a finger we would never get BPPV again - we would do it!\n\nNeither my mom, dad, or sister have had it. What makes me different? What have I done different in my life to make it happen to me? I am healthy, active, fit, not on any medications, no medical conditions, no past trauma (other than minor things from sports). It sucks that those inner ear canals are in a spot that is hard to study and there just is not enough data on it. I was fascinated with my vestibular therapist, who was always attending seminars with the latest and greatest info, the stuff she would learn. I learned so much from her. And now, a year later, would love to check in with her to see what has come up in the past year that is new. There is so much old and dubunked info out there. It feels like a very slow recovery. I am also worried there could be something else going on which I am slowly ruling everything else out. That is impressive you could still be so active. I find it hard to do much of anything. I just feel so off. It is hard to explain I guess it is a dizziness but not a typical dizzy feeling, just off. \nI was trying to anti depressant route but it was causing anxiety and I was worried it was adding nausea when my bppv hit again so I put it on pause. I have nerve pills I can take though. I am also not a fan of taking meds but am finding it hard to get through without. \nAnd yes, people cannot see what we are feeling going through this so it is hard to relate or sympathize I guess. \nI go back to physio on Tuesday. They are helpful there. I have not had a chat with them yet about recovery because last time I was in it was a recheck to see if my symptoms had subsided and I was given exercises so I will be asking more about recovery at this appointment for sure. Listening to your case , I feel you overthink alot, same as I do lol. Like overthinking every other small incident happened to me in the childhood. Idk if that is smh related to this.\nAnd you know, I can totally relate to you, like whenever I get some sudden bumps on the road, sitting in a car doing nothing, still worried about how it might get triggered again smh. I sleep leaning  left hand side to prevent BPPV, like whenever I smh manage to make myself lean towards right, I get small flashbacks, reminding myself about that undesirable feeling.\nRegarding the genetic thing, I guess I too might not have it genetically though. Like you said, your grandma had Meneires, my mom simply never went for a treatment with the specialist ( strange, ik lol) , so I cannot truly say If she had vertigo particularly.\nUnavailability of enough data on this, like this being a rare shit really pisses me off. Like when I first encountered it at the age of 13, did not had much knowledge on how to google stuff, just went to doctor, he gave meds and I got recovered within a few weeks. But when it came back after almost 2-3 years, I did a detailed research, like left no site unvisited, from there I got to know about BPPV and it is maneuvers. Did them on myself, and got relief and within a few hours meds did their job as well, and it went away. Then I discovered, that I cannot sleep in a particular posture. Since then, I am sleeping following that. It is been 3-4 years and luckily it is not back just yet, just needed to discover the posture I should not have.\nIt is a rare thing, not many people have it and guess that is the reason, no particular cure does exist just yet. Hope, you get some updated info about BPPV and would like you to keep us updated.\nThanks :) Did you have other issues with your ears.. popping/crackling.. I have read a lot of your threads but I cannot remember if that was a symptom you experienced or not. Yes... I did have popping &amp; crackling. And even a weird fluttering. That was all checked by an ENT and he found nothing. And I was told it is unrelated. The cracking &amp; fluttering comes back milder at times... But so far no bppv again. It is so annoying. I was surprised they did not find anything.... Because I am not imagining it! That is so weird. I keep thinking I must have an infection or something because of it. I guess it could just be everything settling again. u/Colmanson1, u/Klemkray, u/Tdalea: I continue to update the ( so feel free to check the post periodically for new remedies and suggest your own if you have any!\n\nu/AzkabanResident: You can check the treatment section of the reference guide linked above as--if you can pinpoint the action causing the spinning (e.g., looking down)--you should be able to treat your BPPV using the maneuver that was specifically intended for that semicircular canal.", "Is this BPPV or something else? Hello! I have recently developed vertigo and am trying to figure out if it is possibly BPPV or something else causing it. I am 25, M, and generally healthy. No head trauma that would cause a crystal to become dislodged. No past ear infections (that I am aware of) either. I will try to outline my case in as little text as possible.\n\nAbout 1 week ago, I wake up at about 3am with horrible spinning. Every time I roll to the left, sit up, or stand too quickly the room spins at 100 mph. I get extremely nauseous and end up vomiting once. Pretty quickly, I can tell it is my left side as I am not experiencing the same vertigo when I roll to the right. I book an appointment to my general doctor that afternoon.\n\nI get to the doctor, and explain what has happened so far. He lies me back and turns my head to the right. No vertigo to speak of. Turn to the left, it comes on pretty hard and fast. He says that it is definitely my inner ear on the left side, but says it should resolve on its own in a few days. Advises that if it does not to call back to be referred to a PT to do the Epley maneuver. Perscribes Meclizine and sends me home.\n\nThe next few days I notice that it has slowly improved, but not completely. Took one Meclizine the day after they were perscribed, but did not notice much of an effect so stopped taking them. Each day is gradual improvement, the spinning shifts to a general unsteadiness akin to a boat rocking back and forth. I am able to sleep more on my left side without difficulty.\n\nThe only kicker is this - about 3 days after the spinning started, I developed symptoms akin to a viral infection/sinusitis. Pressure right below and behind my eyes, stuffy nose and I can feel what seems to be sinus drainage down my throat. Now have a slight cough/chest congestion that is barely noticable. Took benadryl for a couple days until the sinus pressure resolved.\n\nThe rough timeline would be this to help with outline of symptoms:\n\n- early Mon. AM - violent spinning on left side, nausea, vomiting\n\n- Mon. PM - visit GP, confirmed left side inner ear issue. Perscribed Meclizine\n\n- Tue. AM/early PM - slight improvement, one Meclizine taken but no real improvement noticed\n\n- Wed/Thurs. - development of symptoms of sinusitis/viral infection, Benadryl taken every 6 hrs. until sinus pressure resolved\n\n- Fri/now - vertigo greatly improved but still present. More like a boat rocking/general unsteadiness unless I lie down on my left side extremely quickly, and even then the vertigo is not instant. It takes about 5-10 seconds to kick in, lasts about 30 seconds and then I feel fine.\n\nCould it still be BPPV? Everything I read online says it likely is, but the viral symptoms have really thrown a wrench in the theory. If you have read this far, thank you!! It could still be bppv.  I would ask for that script to pt.  They may be able to fix any crystals in 1 or 2 visits.  From my experience the longer you wait to move the crystals back the more likely the general dizziness will linger.  On the plus side, it definitely will not hurt anything even if it is not bppv.  Good luck! Totally agree with first comment, see the therapist ASAP. I think the longer the crystal disrupts your ear the longer the recovery. Specifically ask for a vestibular therapist, general PT\u2019s are not sophisticated enough to know the nuances in the nystagmus movements. It took me 4 weeks to get a vestibular therapist. I ended up clearing my right ear with the bbq roll in the middle of the night one week before the therapist. This was after 4 weeks of self Epley that did nothing because I shifted it. During the exam she checked my left and dislodged a crystal I was not aware of. I had it in both ears. I had sinus pressure and tinnitus for a few weeks after my ears were clear, I kept wanting \u201cto pop\u201d my ears and could not. I tried to explain what I was feeling, I could not tell if the sinus pressure in my ear, was all in my head (pun). This was 6 months ago, my general imbalance improved over the next 3-6 months. I was on the forums, groups, etc. It is a waste of energy, see the vestibular therapist, do not wait. I have gotten vertigo from sinus infections, so it is absolutely possible that the sinus pressure has caused your inner ear balance to go south. Mine resolved after the infection ran its course, a few days. Oh, heads up: DO NOT MIX BENADRYL AND MECLIZINE. oh yes for sure, I only took the one Meclizine tuesday and never again. It did zero for me", "BPPV and Dental work Hi All I need urgent root canal treatment, my dentist is suggesting extraction instead due to my vertigo but I do not want extraction.\n\nAre there any tips out there for having dental\nWork, this is literally the classic position that triggers my BPPV lying flat head tilted back!\n\nMust be another way I mean she suggested sedation but she said if you get dizzy and move whilst doing the root canal it will be a disaster. I have had 3 tooth extraction while just sitting in a normal chair at the dentist and when he was about to pull out my lower teeth he had someone hold my head still then done it. Mind you I was only the 2nd ever person to have the extraction done by a chair that was on the waiting room. It really help not causing another bppv episode. Find a dentist who can administer sedation maybe She said she can do sedation but she said if it triggers vertigo having my head back the sedation would not stop the attack and she cannot Risk movement \ud83d\ude2d Before you schedule an appt - see if your dentist can position the chair to reduce/minimize the chance for BPPV while you are sitting in the chair.  If you find a position that works- then you should be ok for the real appt. I guess you can ask her to not flatten the chair that much or to put a pillow under your head so that your head stays up. Would that still trigger your BPPV? Oh no. Well that is a pity. The only other option is GA and that will cost a bundle. So this is how all my vertigo symptoms happened was from the medication/root canal. A couple years later I had to get another and he gave me some anxiety pills which helped me. I also ask him to not let me be flat or high up because that also triggers it for me. I also recently had 2 surgeries and had to lay flat while I was out cold and did not feel any triggers (thankfully) I Did ask but she said the way the chairs are built within the U.K. are required flat, she said back in the day they used to do lots of work sitting upwards but with technology the way procedures are done it has changed. I guess that is bad news for vertigo sufferers lol. If I could lay flat but have my head raised it would be fine but the dentist is insisting root canal would be impossible this way! I have asked my doc for a referral to a vestibular doc to see if they can do the Epley maneuver, tried it once a very long time ago with a bad doc and did not try again as it did not work and left me feeling\nWorse. Oh I have read a fair bit about root canal triggering vertigo for people the first time. I will go for the sedation for sure, I think the issue for the dentist is they know when a vertigo attack happens you cannot exactly just lay there and ride it out, vomiting starts it is just a whole mess. Funny enough I have been put under twice and woke up fine but I suppose while under full GA it would be really different I am not sure if my BPPV is also connected to my root canal, but it kind of happened to me too. A few months ago in July, I had a root canal done for the first time in my life. It was a 1-2 hour procedure with lots of drilling and etc. 4 days later, I woke up on a morning, and the room started spinning. I thought I was going to die, and that was officially the start of my BPPV journey. Now, during these past 7 months, I have had two more BPPV episodes that were fixed by my PT, and many weeks of lingering dizziness. I do not sleep on my right (bad) side anymore, I put two pillows under my head, and many more precautions. That is exactly me!! I miss sleeping on my right side. Mine has been on and off for almost 3 years. Yeah, I guess that is something that we likely have to deal with for the rest of our lives. My lingering dizziness (feeling like being on a boat all the time) days were so so bad, and honestly, now I am so so so happy that at least those days are gone, although I have to be so careful whenever I lay down to get to sleep. I had a root canal 3 weeks ago - prior to this I was having daily vertigo attacks, when they tilted me all the way back BANG - vertigo.\nIt did not last long but here is the kicker\nI have not had vertigo since!\nI saw a specialist afterwards and his opinion was that the tilting back cleared the vestibular area. Wow what a result! Well my doctor told me to do the epley maneuver at home 2 weeks before going but I am too scared, last attempt went wrong and I ended up knocking myself out by accident! I found a dentist who is willing to try work with me head raised on a pillow! The things we have to do with vertigo lol", "Another episode 26M. Tingling sensation throughout body. (long read) I went to the ER last night after my vertigo dizziness episode last night. The two days prior to yesterday's episode,I had been spinning a bit in my room because I could feel the sensation of being \"off\" in my mind. I was gauging how off I was, I felt like was on rough seas, I would walk or turn my head and everything would move up and down. Thinking that it was just minimal vertigo, I went about my day, still feeling \"off\" in my head. \n\nThroughout the yesterday, I was able to walk, no nausea, able to eat. With every change of direction I made with my head, things moved up and down but I was able to walk anywhere in the house. Then in the evening, the spins started, the actual vertigo sensation of things spinning and nausea and eventually the 4 hrs of vomiting had come. I rested in my reclining chair, with a trashcan next to me, and vomited everything out.\n\nThroughout those hours on my chair, I got a bit hot but I was mostly (very) cold, I had a tingling sensation all throughout my body(mouth, legs, hands, gums/teeth), my fingers became hard to move and to control, they became stiff but definitely not due to the cold I felt. Even while having a blanket over me, I was still freezing. I felt my abdomen(below the chest) start to feel stiff and it was heavy,but I could breathe in and out fine with my chest. \n\n\nThe spins were going from right to left, titling my head back and looking at the ceiling things were moving closer together and while looking at the ceiling, something I was not focusing on, outside my corner of my left eye, were moving to the right. I felt the tingling sensation on the back my head, I felt the tingling sensation make a 'U' shaped tingling sensation it made from the back of one ear to the top of the back of my head to the other back of the opposite ear, very weird and scary. \n\nI had trouble keeping down fluids.. Ginger tea, Gatorade and green tea with ginger.. I could not keep it down and vomited it all up. \n\nI decided to do the Half somersault exercise on my bed, but it did not lessen my vertigo, then I followed up with the epley maneuver and still no luck. After finishing the epley maneuver, my whole body got the tingling sensation and then I vomited and called it quits and headed to the ER. \n\nI was given fluids, meclizine(antivert) and something else for nausea(I think it started with an \"A\" and was hooked to my arm. My blood was drawn and so was a urine sample. \n\nThe Dr. attending me said this vertigo was not caused by dehydration, And that he wants me to get my crystals readjusted once every 6 months so it does not happen again. \n\nMy prescriptions are: meclizine(anti vert) 25mg oral tablet and ondansetron (Zofran ODT 4mg oral tablet, disintegrating). \n\nI vomited Gatorade twice last night after leaving the hospital. Today I still feel \"off\", walking wise is at a much slower pace and things still move. Shaking my head feels off as well. I am sure if I did the half somersault or the epley maneuver I would feel the spinning sensation. \n\nI do have tinnitus, in my right ear and it comes and goes in my left ear as well. My right jaw sometimes get stuck and then it pops, so it might be related to my tinnitus. \n\nMeclizine has not really worked for me in the past, I figure I will still feel this residual for a while. I have no nausea this morning. \nI am really bummed..ive had this for such a long time since I was a young teenager now I am 26 and I still get it. My vertigo did go away for some years, but these last 4-5,6years it is been back. \n\nI figure I should see a ENT, maybe it is linked to my tinnitus, maybe it has to do with my jaw.. Eyes.. Ear crystals.. I am not sure. \n\nAny advice? Where should I go from here? Any similar situations you have been in? \n\nTLDR: Went to ER last night, after 4 or so hours of vomiting, got the vertigo spins, did half somersault and epley maneuver to no success and called it quits and headed to the ER. I had tingling sensations throughout my body, trouble moving fingers at times, felt a 'U' shaped tingling sensation behind my head from ear to ear. I felt hot and then very cold. I had trouble keeping fluids down. Dr says he believes this was not caused by dehydration and it is instead something else. I was prescribed meclizine and Zofran. I think this is related to my ears, my tinnitus. I figure I need to see an ENT and find the cause to this, because it is terrible. My husband and I are in the same boat w his vertigo. Had his worst episode Monday, similar as yours. Dx with BPPV but we are looking into TMD dysfunction which stood out to me in your story with your jaw clicking. It might be something to check out. His normal PT maneuvers are not helping much this time and 4 days since the episode he is still very off. Hope you feel better soon! Thank you for the well wishes. I hope your husband figures this problem out as well! Primary doctor wants an MRI with a neurologist, so we will try to see where to from here", "BPPV triggered by alcohol? I just found this sub after googling my symptoms, and Google kept telling me that a 4-day hangover was extremely unlikely so here I am.\n\nThe world spins for a couple seconds if I do something like bend over, and even rolling over in bed made everything twirl.\n\nBut it only lasts a second or two at a time, and it started last weekend after I had a bit to drink. I do not drink much at all (I think the last time I drank was before Christmas) and I was just curious about anyone else\u2019s experience and if their BPPV has ever been triggered by alcohol or if I should keep Googling my symptoms to get to the bottom of this.\n\nI appreciate any insight! I dont know if alcohol can trigger it, but i do know that alcohol makes my bppv a lot worse, so i mostly stay away from it.", "Treatment by an ENT doctor or a vestibular therapist? Hello all,\n\nSo I just had my first experience with BPPV yesterday. My father has suffered from it for years so I knew what it was almost immediately. Unfortunately, he gets it very often, probably about 6-8 times a year, ends up in the ER almost every time, has fallen and smashed his head in public, does not drive anymore, etc etc etc. After witnessing that for years I was an absolute emotional wreck yesterday, especially considering I am a dancer and am going to be devastated if I have to quit. \n\nI want to be sure I treat it right from the beginning so that I do not draw it out too long. The problem is that while I have insurance, the deductible is almost 5k and I have not put anything on it this year. As such, I can only afford to go visit a specialist a few times until the new year (when I am going to get all my medical treatment done - yay America). So i want to make sure I spend my money on the most helpful people. \n\nI would probably be more inclined to spend that money on a vestibular therapist as they spend longer with you and are more likely to offer something other than medicine, but I just wanted everyone is opinions on who you found the most helpful and saw the best results from. \n\nTIA everyone. Can you tell me where you are located? I am in SoCal, and while I am on an HMO, I had to pay out of pocket to see a specialist that had their own clinic. It was $150 first visit, any other additional visits were $120 after the fact. I am also in SoCal! Marina Del Rey to be specific. That is very very affordable. I was concerned about having to pay upwards of 300 to visit a specialist Hey did You go the the bppv in the valley? Also did it help? Get your vitamin d levels checked. Ideal is in the 50\u2019s and optimal is 80\u2019s. Will do. I had a blood test about a year ago and was fine but I will check it again. I would not be surprised if I was deficient because although I live in California I wear sunscreen all day every day and cover almost my whole body when I go outside. Have you heard of b12 deficiency having any bearing on BPPV? I know I am deficient in that. My personal experience - the Vestibular Therapist hands down was the BEST! The ENT did all the proper testing for hearing and such, but did not offer much help for BPPV and dizziness.  My vestibular therapist did all the pertinent tests for all different types of vertigo and dizziness. So, as long as you find a good one, I think you would be further ahead seeing the therapist. Wonderful, thank you so much for your response I went to BVC Physical Therapy. They have quite a few locations and I did go to one of their clinics in the valley. You can read my other replies on another thread about details of my visit. And for the record it helped tremendously. I honestly do not understand why others struggling with BPPV would second guess going to a balance therapist when there is so much positive feedback from others. Thanks for this info. This is close to my house too and was considering going. My BPPV just started 1.5 weeks ago and have not had much luck. Will try it out. Thank you for the reply. Lol - Same - I have been to 3 ENTs over 6 years and each one has done all the tests and said, your hearing is perfect, there is no pressure in your ears followed by using an endoscope to look inside my nasal and sinus passages only to say, there is nothing wrong with you. - none of them offered any further assistance, help or advice. - I was pretty much told to live with it and I did while the anxiety monster grew inside of me as I worried for years there was something more going on. \n\nIt was only after I went to a discovery doctor that he sent me off for a load of tests (MRI, CT, blood, etc) that eventually lead me to a vestibular therapist and I remember day one... \n\nI shared with her my diary of the past 4.5 years (found her 1.5 years ago) and as she read it she said, \u201cI totally get what you are going through, everything you have written about I see people that are going through a similar experience... I think I can help you\u201d. I was shocked \ud83d\ude2e this was the first time in 4.5 years that someone had actually acknowledged that I had a problem!! She stood me up, walked me to the corner of the room and asked me to do some really basic balance stuff... I failed miserably and started to cry. She asked me what was wrong and I said, \u201cI had no idea that I could not do these basic head / eye movements and that it would throw me off so bad!! I also feel so upset that I have wasted 4.5 years being told I have to live like this and here you are, giving me something more then nothing to do.\u201d \n\nGoing to the PT was one of the happiest days of my life as this stranger gave me hope that she could help me. - prior to that day and from when I can remember my woozy / dizziness began I was not living life, I was merely going through the motions. \n\nDo not get me wrong, I am by no means \u201cfixed\u201d. I still get woozy / dizzy feelings that can wreck my day or a few hours but my quality of life has vastly improved. \n\nI also recently went to get my eyes tested by a Neuro optometrist. He put a VR headset on me and the results showed that my left and right head / eye movement was in sync but my up and down head / eye movement was out of sync and so I am now working with my PT on exercises to improve this. \n\nSo what did I learn? while an ENT makes sense to go see as you need / want to rule out anything sinister, a lot of them are useless if they cannot see a physical problem. \n\nFor anyone reading through old posts. Do not accept \u201cyou have to live with BPPV or residual dizziness\u201d, find a vestibular therapist and start living life!! Exactly! Each week.... My vestibular therapist basically talked me off the wall &amp; calmed my anxiety. She has had it &amp; deals with it herself.... And treats many people. Just to have someone that understands. Worth their weight in gold! I cried the day she told me again that BPPV was fixed (for now) and discharged me with instructions to keep doing all the exercises. Happy tears. And tears of 'how will I survive without her?' No one has to live with this! It makes me so happy to hear this. Over my life doctors have SO often dismissed my concerns (with lots of various health issues) only to land me in the ER a few weeks later because they told me my problems were in my head. As such I am always wary of going to doctors. I was able to make an appointment with a vestibular therapist for this upcoming Thursday which I am thrilled about. Wish me luck! I have not heard of B12/vertigo link but anything is possible. But I have been iron deficient as well. Now I take flinstones vitamins (2/day) and it is helped air. Who knew. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Physio 100%. Dancing is a recommended treatment for vertigo so you should be fine minus the occasional vertigo day. The more you exercise your vestibular system with movement, the better! Sending well wishes your way! Please report back!!!! We all can learn so much from everyone sharing their own experiences.", "Help I cannot handle this I have never experienced anything like this apart from when I was a kid and would spin insanely fast on those spin things...\n\nWoke up 2 days ago to suddenly find everything fucking spinning severely.\n\nIt is my right ear I am pretty sure. \n\nI have done the Everly move twice.\n\nI feel so fucking sick. I do not go on spin rides to avoid this feeling. I am sensitive to this sick feeling.\n\nIt always happens in the morning when I am waking up and cannot be careful about my head movements.\n\nEach morning I am so fucking nauseas, my stomach drops and it hurts it is spinning so fast.\n\nDoctor was useless and said there is no cure - you are young and your brain will get used to it...? Does not seem to be going away???\n\nI cannot live with this. Do you make sure that you are well hydrated?  That can make a huge difference. I am so nauseous I am definitely not hydrated. I cannot drink water without being sick,\n\nI will try it more though if it can make it worse dehydration I know that feeling! As someone said stay hydrated and force the bouts out with, a maneuver. \n\n\nI was on a similar boat and would \u201ctap out\u201d mid maneuver because it would induce such a heavy bout.\n\n\nI have someone stand near me and touch my shoulder/arm while I do a maneuver and toughen it out. It helps a lot. Once you break thru the first bout every thing gets better.\n\n\nIf you can overcome the maneuver and bout it brings (I know it is, hard as hell) you will feel better. \n\n\nSome people are fixed thru one or two maneuvers. I still get it completely randomly. Usually after drinking, a bit the previous night (hydration).\n\n\nBenadryl also seems to help.\n\n\nAlso I would try going to a physical therapist. And definitely get a new doctor (even tho they usually are useless from my experiences).\n\n\nBest of luck. The half somersault maneuver works best for me. And when I am really feeling dizzy I take meclizine which is OTC and helps a bit. i cant offer much help, because i had an inner ear infection, and i dealt with that exact dizziness for 6 weeks so far. id feel pressure on one ear only, and car rides would make only my left ear pop. but that last sentence you said \u201ci cannot live with this\u201d are the exact same words i told myself the first week of dealing with it. but you are not alone. and you are brain will recalibrate. for me when I would get vertigo it was not just in bed, it was sitting, walking or standing, and the same instant i got it id have to hold on to something secure on the ground. i know the fear you have but it goes away. i promise it does. You can direct message me im always on reddit. I know exactly the fear and anxiety you are having. Yeah it totally sucks. I was already in a bad mood before this due to my 5th or 6th week in a city wide lockdown due to covid :/\n\nMy doctor said my ears looked fine. Do you know why they do not test for anything else like brain tumours ? You should get an mri, it was one of the processes i had to go through, then therapy and an audiology test Since your doctor is useless, you need to see a therapist with specific skills. Some folks go to a motion clinic that specializes in balance issues.\n\nDoing the Epley maneuver with a skilled therapist will give better results. Your doctor is wrong.  There is a fix for this and it is easy.  You should not have to live with this.  I agree with the other comments, get to physical therapy.  If you cannot then watch YouTube videos on the epley and do that.  I had a new episode Sunday and had to do the epley 3 times in a row to move the crystal.  Since then the vertigo is gone.  Expect some residual dizziness that will make you anxious that you are going to get vertigo, that is normal.  Watch Joey remenyi on YouTube, she is great!  Best of luck and you will get better! I think one of the hardest things about BPPV is the hopeless feeling that happens, I always feel like it is never going to go away when mine hits. It does lift OP, I promise this will get better. Try the maneuvers if you can. They do not work for everyone (did not for me) but even if they do not it will still lift and get easier. Be very kind to yourself. Both physically and emotionally.", "Is this BBPV? ", "Just diagnosed Hi there , I was just diagnosed with BPPV. I have tried the manoeuvre that many claim to be a miracle worker, however it and others make me feel more sick. Is there any advice? This is torture Hi, and welcome to r/BPPV!\n\nIt is wretched to feel what you are feeling. (We have all been there--some more  than others.)\n\nHave a look at ( to see if it helps. There are different maneuvers, depending on where the issue is. Even if you did the right maneuver, it might feel gross for a while as your body readjusts.\n\nOthers will likely also comment on your post here, so you might see a few more words of help or encouragement. \ud83d\ude42\n\nGood luck, u/itsamemario1234567! Yea go to a vestibular physiotherapist and they will let you know what maneuver you need... they are usually good to get you in ASAP. I second this! My therapist helped get my BPPV under control with one session. Mine was on the right, and she did the Epley maneuver on that side. I tried it at home before going, but she kind of held my head over the edge of the table and it just worked better! \n\nI still have some other issues going on causing a dizziness, but it is not that classic world-swirling BPPV anymore. I third this!  My physical therapist knew what and how to help. Try the various maneuvers. I was not able to do anything with the epley myself but my PT was able to. When she did it, it was awful awful. I threw myself off the table all 3 times. It brought out the vertigo so bad, I could not continue on. But as I was walking out of the pt office, I noticed I felt better. But after that, I would do the Brandt daroff or the half somersault maneuvers myself with success.", "need advice for dealing with college &amp; bppv hello, I am joining this sub to try and get some advice about what to do as a college student with bppv. I first started experiencing symptoms last semester (early 2019), and when I went to the school\u2019s health center, all they told me was to eat &amp; drink more (history of ED). it started hitting me much much worse around a month ago, and finally I was given bppv diagnosis. so far they are blaming it on congestion, so they gave me zyrtec and flonase.\n\nall that aside, I am struggling a lot in my classes. these past 2 weeks have been exam weeks, and getting my grades back has been so painful for me. it is hard to study and retain info thanks to bppv, and sometimes getting up in the morning to get to class is difficult. \n\nwhat should my next steps for self advocation be? I have emailed my college academic advisor regarding my concerns (no response yet). other people are advising me to get doctors\u2019 notes, SDS accommodations, even to cry to my professors (lmao probably not going to do that). \n\ndoes anybody here have experience with getting help at college for bppv? any advice would be much appreciated. it is kind of ruining my academic life and although I am hoping it goes away soon, I would like to be prepared to fight for myself.\n\nthank you so much for your time! Hey have you had a change in diet the past couple years before ? Honestly I tried everything from tests to acupuncture and it did not work for me BUT I did adjust my diet dramatically. I had extreme vertigo to the point I cannot walk straight, get dizzy on trains or cars. It would come and go whenever it pleases and I would have no choice but to sit and stare at the wall for hours until I feel better. \n\nDoctors did not help me so I started self diagnosis. I was eating a lot of sushi for 2 years and by sushi means a LOT of sashimi like tuna which is high in mercury. I cut it out 100% for a year to test and my vertigo gradually went away. Til this day I still do not eat sushi and have no cravings for it. There are episodes once in awhile if I do get up too fast from my bed,  lifting my head fast, or turning the head too fast will make it come back. I have to be very conscious of movements and screen times too. \n\nUnfortunately bppv is hard to diagnosis because the brain is so complex and there is not enough studies on it. Honestly doctors do not understand vertigo unless they themselves have had it. They will give you the runaround to try this try that. You will end up spending a lot of money on useless tests. Occasionally I will do the Epley Maneuver at home if I am out of options. I do think some imbalance comes from the ears which you can try. You should also keep track of your diet and  daily activities like staring at electronic screens for too long (this triggers my vertigo). It is a long process but it was the only way for me. Something must have triggered our first vertigo and it became a chronic illness. \ud83d\ude14 Hiya! I am also a college student with a history of recurrent bppv.\n\nHave you seen a vestibular therapist or ENT/someone who specializes in dizziness/inner ear issues? With the correct diagnosis, they can perform the Epley or BBQ or whatever maneuver to move the crystal out of the ear canal and completely fix your symptoms. I would really recommend seeing an ENT if you can! Every full blown episode I have had has been fixed by these maneuvers and mostly resolved in &lt;2 days.\n\nI think I would first look into addressing your symptoms before trying to get accomdations from your school, which is mostly my approach lol. BPPV treatments are highly effective (supposedly), with super high success rates, so it might be more worth your time just to get treated! If those maneuvers are not working, your diagnosis from Student Health could be incorrect and you should see a specialist. When I am having an episode, I immediately take meclizine (available OTC as Bonine), try to diagnose myself and do the correct maneuver, and then go see a doctor if I am still experiencing spinning. My professors have been pretty understanding, but my episodes also are not long (idk if yours are).  \n\n\nThat being said, meclizine is magic if you are not already taking it. I react really, really poorly to BPPV, like I get super nauseous and exhausted just sitting upright and literally cannot watch TV without throwing up--without any medication. After I take meclizine I can basically resume my life. I would also learn the tests &amp; maneuvers (Dix-Hallpike test and Epley maneuver for posterior canal BPPV, a test whose name I cannot remember and BBQ roll for lateral, can find lots of stuff on YouTube!), I think they have helped me regain control of my life so I do not have to go see a doctor every time I get BPPV.\n\nSorry I do not have much to say on the institutional support side, but these are some small things I do to try to deal with the horrible condition that is BPPV!! Sending u good vibes~ and hope you feel better soon \ud83d\udc95 how interesting! i do not think i have had anything that drastic of a diet change, but i will keep tabs on it. thanks a ton for your input!! This is the correct answer. Do not just see a GP or even a generic ENT. Go to a balance center and see someone who specializes in vestibular disorders. Many doctors have had very lilttle experience with BPPV and you need to find someone who works with it on a daily basis. Ultimate do what your body feels. BPPV differs dramatically from one person to another. I pushed myself through the last year of uni - 6 months later I have decided my body deserves a break and postponed my training contract. Bottom line, you might just take a certain time to heal - give yourself that. It could take 2 days or it could take more. But college will be there for you nonetheless so take a longer break if you feel like it I am a college student with vertigo as well! My initial episodes started really bad and I saw a doctor and suggested the maneuver and it worked and went away but fast forward 8 months later and I have found that I have it very subtlety almost every day I can tell it is there. I go to a therapist for anxiety and she even mentioned that stress and anxiety can cause the dizziness and vertigo symptoms. I also noticed that when I am looking at my phone for too long I start to feel like I am falling over and my head spins. I would suggest doing the maneuver and going to a doctor if it does not work. You may need your ears drained or go to a specialist. I know how awful it feels and it is almost scary to go to bed because I wake up feeling like I am going to fall. It will get better!! Hi a college student with vertigo as well! my initial episodes started really bad and i saw a doctor and suggested the maneuver and it worked and went away but fast forward 8 months later and i have found that i have it very subtlety almost every day i can tell it is there. i go to a therapist for anxiety and she even mentioned that stress and anxiety can cause the dizziness and vertigo symptoms. i also noticed that when , I am dad.", "Working out Hello, I had surgery on my middle ear 2+ months ago and think I developed vertigo.\nEvery day is different, some better some worse.\n\nBut I have wanted to start working out and being active again but the dizzy spells &amp; feeling sick just stop me from even having a walk most days.\n\nDoes anyone know what exercises you can safely do, is there medication to help that does not put you to sleep? This is so new to me I do not know where to start.. I worked with a vestibular therapist while I had active BPPV for two months. She always told me during and after the vertigo was resolved to get back to normal activities as soon as possible, so that your system learns to adapt to being 'normal' again. I had terrible residual dizziness for about 8 months as well (still have a bit). I was fortunate that I was able to continue all my normal activities/hobbies, which included running, snowmobiling, running my dog in agility.  Only do what you can tolerate though.  Making yourself feel worse is not the goal!  Baby steps. I also learned to keep my head very still with these activities, in order to NOT provoke the BPPV.\n\nBut, before taking my advice or any others.....be sure to be properly diagnosed with BPPV. You could have something else going on.  If you actually DO have BPPV, there are fairly simple tests that can be performed by a specialist to determine which side is effected.  And then they will perform  maneuvers to help correct the vertigo. My therapist was a godsend, as she helped the anxiety that came with the constant sickness and vertigo. She also monitored my progress and increased exercises that were meant to challenge the vertigo and help my system readapt.  If it is not BPPV - then none of this advice is relevant! So please be sure to see a dizzy specialist.  There are 6 different inner ear canals that can be effected, and you need to know which needs to be treated, as there are different treatments.", "Hey there please read this if you have the time, I need some insight. Hi! So this is my story short...\n\nWhen I was a teen (like 12-13) I started having vertigo episodes. I would wake up one day with vertigo and could not get up at all for the whole day sometimes two day. I honestly loved it cause it meant no school and tv all day with no moving lol. Went to the doctors they told me it was probably from puberty. It disappeared when I was 17-18yo. A year ago I suddenly, literally out of no where developed a panic attack disorder. I started taking antidepressants which cause vertigo eeevery morning. I stopped them after a month cause they made me feel way worse. So since then I have been having the occasional vertigo episode where I just randomly wake up with it. Or sometimes a panic attack would bring it one which I have no idea how it works. So I went to a neurologist and they did all vestibular tests but all was fine (I was not having a vertigo episode when they did the tests tho do not know if that counts). I have since realised that doing those head movements from YouTube to move the crystals really helps me and that the problem is always in my left ear. I still do not understand why it only happens to me sometimes and how can a panic attack cause it? Anyone have a similar experience? I do not have any similar experience, but I wanted to comment. Haha I could not imagine enjoying vertigo! Your school must have been awful!\n\nSorry to hear about the panic attacks\u2014what the heck is that about?! Hopefully you find a solution Yeah no idea! But sometimes I might trigger a vertigo attack just by blowing my nose too hard \ud83d\ude05", "I just got diagnosed yesterday. Is there anything I should know? Or expect from physical therapy? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also have unrelated leg heaviness so I have to go to doctors all the time anyways. Just wasnt sure if there is anything I really need to know about this. If this is regular BPPV,in my experience it will go away in a week if the maneuvers do not work. Should be no worries Sweet! I was not sure. I struggle everyday with the leg pain so it is hard for me to take the time to focus on the bppv. Thanks so much", "Someones got to try this..... I will tell my story. About 5 months ago I became dizzy. To a point where my body was compensating ahead of time to the missteps I was about to make. Felt like crap, the bed would spin when I tried to sleep, when I would read smaller print the words would jump forward and backward and I was seeing brown opagur straeks and blotches(seem like VERTIGO??). Well anyway I was going to the grocery store and decided to stop and birdwatch in the cemetary first. So for about 35 minutes I would walk and pause and while standing look straight up(maybe 10 to 20 secinds) into the huge trees for movement of birds, then bring my binoculars up if I saw any. I probably looked straight up maybe 15 to 20 times in this period. When I got back to my truck and hopped in, my head went Poof and I got the worst \"swimmers ear\" in both ears with my hearing decreased by maybe 50 % and everything sounded \"hollow\" , like I was in a big fishbowl. Tried to clear my ears(hold nostrils and close mouth and blow softly), and they just would not clear. Went shopping, then home and for about 2 hours while sitting upright, they would not clear. Finally right before I went to bed I tried again and POOF my ears clear and dizziness decreased by 90%...I slept so much better(this was thurs night), all day fri and Sat I felt normal again, then Saturday night a little dizziness came back, but was gone when I woke up. It HAD TO HAVE HAD SOMETHING to do with looking staright up for 10-20 seconds those 20 times in 35 minutes!!! No idea what happened, but it is always great to hear a happy story. Glad your dizziness went away, OP! No one else is going to try it?????? Is not it kind of obvious it put the crystals where they should be? I recently started going to PT for my vertigo only to find out I do not have BPPV but more of a balance issue that presents similarly. My last session was walking while looking up, straight, down, straight etc then stop and focus straight. Do the same for side to side. It kind of sounds like you did a similar movement looking up? I did not have the swimmers ear side effect though. BPPV has to do with crystals getting into wrong canals, and I do not see how looking straight (or your eyes generally) could correct something like that, especially if you had it for months. Also, \"seeing brown opaque streaks and blotches\" is unlikely to have anything to do with vertigo.\n\nMy guess is that what you were experiencing was not BPPV, but had to do, at least in part, with vision (perhaps some form of vision induced dizziness - a very wild guess here, since I personally experienced something similar).\n\nIn any case, happy you are feeling better, OP. Do not get upset if no other wild guesses appear. \"straight\"???, I said STRAIGHT UP. Like straight up at a huge tree or the sky. I am glad you experienced such sudden relief. (I love it when things resolve instantly!)\n\nAs far as I know and have read (e.g., ( BPPV does not involve hearing loss. It occurs in balance structures, not hearing ones. Vertigo and hearing loss can co-occur in diseases like M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's--but it does not sound like that is what happened to you.\n\nIf it was BPPV you experienced, it is possible your up-and-down head movements mimicked the ( but that is usually performed for cases of BPPV involving the anterior/superior semicircular canal--which are extremely rare (1-2% of BPPV cases) but still possible. (See the ( for more information.)\n\nAppreciate you sharing your finding with us! \ud83d\ude42", "Migraines &amp; BPPV? I was diagnosed with BPPV about a year ago, I would say maybe 6 months after my diagnosis I began experiencing chronic migraines. I even had an MRI done which came back clear, &amp; a neurologist diagnosed me with chronic atypical migraines induced by stress/anxiety. Was just curious if anyone else has been battling the both of them &amp; if you have found any particular things helpful?  I am hoping the BPPV was a one time thing for me because it lasted three weeks non-stop. The migraines, however, I have had since childhood. \n\nCarry ibprofen and any prescribed migraine meds on you at all times. Take your prescription the moment you start to feel a migraine. I try to find a Coke or a diet Coke to drink for the caffeine, and a nap in a dark, quiet room is my saving grace. \n\nI always carry IB because having a script medication is new to me and if for any reason I do not have the script on me, at least I have IB stashed everywhere. I usually take about 800mg(,mcg?) Every 3-4 hours which is usually four pills. \n\nStress is a trigger for me too so sometimes I take a regular dose of IB right before I do something super stressful/anxiety causing.\n\nI take a lot of IB. It is not really recommended but I really do not have a lot of choice. I am lucky that IB can usually at least take the edge off but unless I catch the migraine at the start, it will not get rid of it. \n\nYou may have developed migraines as a stress response to the BPPV but from what I have researched and discussed with my doctors, the two are not really linked. I was having a ridiculous amount of migraines leading up to my month of BPPV and while my Drs all agreed it was a problem, they also did not think they were connected. \n\nWe just get two awful things that like to trigger each other. Fun! ", "How long do your symptoms last typically? Hi BPPV,\n\nI am a 26M dealing with my second episode of possible BPPV. My first episode was 4 years ago which put me in the hospital vomiting profusely for hours straight and was diagnosed as a vestibular migraine. Back then however I was back to normal 100% after about a week of bedrest. My recent episode was about 7 weeks ago, and I woke up in the middle of the night extremely dizzy, but without the vomiting luckily. \n\nSince then, I have seen an urgent care, emergency room, neurologist several times, my primary care physician, a vestibular therapist for an evaluation, and an ENT. So far, pretty much no one has helped me. They have diagnosed it as vestibular migraines even though I have no history of migraines (besides that prior incident but that was definitely BPPV) in my life and my neurologist gave me Topamax to try to treat me (which I am NOT happy about and do not really want to be on). It is been almost SEVEN weeks and my job has been really cool about everything but I feel that it is at risk. I cannot work from home much longer. Why has not this gone away yet?\n\nMy current symptoms include: dizziness (pretty much around the clock), getting very light-headed when standing or changing positions, fatigue, tinnitus, jaw pain, trouble sleeping. It should be noted that I am an athlete and was in very good shape prior to this and now I am struggling to get up and down the stairs of my apartment. Also when I saw my ENT she said my posture was atrocious and my neck and lower back could be causing issues, however my neurologist told me that my neck was probably a symptom and not the cause.\n\nAny advice on what to do? I am so sorry to read this mate. Sometimes people do not realise what a debilitating thing this is. I do not want you to feel alone because you are not.\n\nI wish you a speedy recovery and that someone will more knowledge may pitch in with a response. I am so sorry you are not doing well. \nWe are in the same boat and I am not sure if what I have is BPPV anymore since I continue to have issues for the past month. \n\nAll I can say is that you are not alone. It is debilitating and depressing when you feel like crap 24/7 and after weeks of it, it just becomes exhausting and overwhelming . But hold on. It is sucks, but you have to keep the hope that you are going to get better. Feeling low and having anxiety over it will only make you feel worse. \n\nI know you mentioned you are not sleeping well. However, I am at my worst when I do not get enough sleep. Try your best to get some good sleep in. It does the body and mind good. :)\n\nHave you tried Physical Therapy or a Balance Center? Even though I am still not symptom free of whatever I have...it does seem to improve with PT. They may also have an idea of what is causing your issues. Does not hurt to try?\n\nI am sorry I could not be more help. \n\nBest of luck and I hope you find relief soon. Take care. Sounds terrible, and I (literally) feel your pain, like so many others in this group.\n\nFrom your symptoms, it sounds like you have Vestibular Neuritus.  Basically the nerve that connects the balance system in your ear has been attacked by a virus.  Swelling occurred, damaged the nerve, and your body likely fought off the virus but your nerve remains damaged.  This nerve will likely not recover, but over time your brain will learn to process the degraded signal so that things will get marginally better.  PT seems to produce very slightly improved outcomes, but several ENTs I saw were pretty skeptical that PT did much of anything that just trying to live your life would not do.\n\nSource:  me after 18 months with this thing.  It is brutal and depression and anxiety are definetly part of the symptom set.  In time things will get better, but it is inches forward in my experience, not miles.  Word is that after 2 years you have hit your recovery plateau.\n\nSorry my man.  I hate to not have better news.  There is just no quality treatment for this thing.  :-( Holy shit, this sounds like exactly what I have been going through. And seeing as how im at nearly two months of suffering, I do not see how it could be anything other than this. How the fuck has no other doctor considered this. Thank you for responding to my post.\n\nI am absolutely devastated to read that this may be permanent but at least now I have something to yell at all my doctors about. This looks horrible and reading about it is making me so miserable.\n\nI had started cleaning my ears with cue tips in the last few months, I wonder if that attributed to getting a virus or some kind of infection in my ears :/ No, cue tips would not do this. The balance system is in the inner ear, which is sealed off from the world.  You did not cause this.  Just like you get a cold from random people, you got a virus from someone that attacked this nerve.   Airborne or skin to skin contact, etc.  No ones fault.   \n\nIt does get better but it is tuned my life down.  Smaller world.  Sucks my friend!\n\nDoctors would love to cure this but there is little known about the cause (virus is very likely but not certain) and there is no therapy or regimen that can fix nerve damage, so we are left with time and hope that the brain can manage to figure out what to do with the degraded signal. \n\nDo a little research on Vestibular Neritus and talk to an ENT.   Effective therapy I think does not exist (debatable) and ceartainly no cure, but you have youth on your side.  \n\nFor what it is worth, 6 months in I felt some improvement then about a year and a bit another plateau.  At 18 months I think I am about as good as it gets and it is rough at times.  \n\nGood luck my friend!  I really hope it works out for you. &gt; I had started cleaning my ears with cue tips in the last few months, I wonder if that attributed to getting a virus or some kind of infection in my ears :/\n\nThat is hilarious cause that is what I said. Except I had bought an endoscope with ear picking attachments and was using it quite a bit right before my first time. But of course, that has nothing to do with it.\n\nI hope you can start feeling better soon. It sounds way worse than what I have had so I cannot even imagine. Hey,\n\nJust wanted to follow up on this, I saw a vestibular therapist this morning, and he said that based on my caloric/VNG test results (which came back normal), he does not suspect that it could be vestibular neuritis, since that would show weakness in those tests. Granted, I did not get those tests done until about 3 or 4 weeks after the inital vertigo incident that woke me up in the middle of the night. \n\nDid you have those tests done during your experience and were the results similar?? Hm no I did not have those tests done.  From what I can tell there are 3-4 most common issues that cause the symptoms we have and none have any treatment options (other than true BPPV which is due to the crystals in the eustaecean tube collecting in one side.  PT can dislodge them and you are basically back to normal).  \n\nDid the doctor say what your options were for treatment if it was not vestibular neuritis?  If not true BPPV then it is all pretty much wait and see and hope... I would agree that a solid nights sleep is huge.  Do not hesitate to talk to your doctor about Ambian or similar sleep meds.  They really do work in my experience, and while the sleep quality is slightly different (\"hypnotic\" sleep) it appears from most research it is just as restful to the brain.  Do not be scared of going for some meds after talking with a Dr.  You may not be able to directly tackle the balance issues in a meaningful way, but you can  improve your life by making sure you get decent sleep, eat reasonably well, etc.  \n\nAlso, not sure about you, but crowds cause me a lot of anxiety.  Seems my peripheral vision has diminished (not an uncommon side effect of Vestibular Neruitus) so I am constantly feeling like people are sneaking up on me.  Bad times my friends!\n\nWe are just a tangle of weird, analog, easily disrupted systems!  Hi constantly, I am Dad! Thanks for the advice. My Dr did tell me she could prescribe me Lunesta. However, I have been having pretty decent luck lately with OTC sleep aids. feels good to get some sleep. \n\nYes, I find that it is hard to coordinate myself in public. For me, my anxiety gets high when I feel so off and disoriented walking around. Gives me the worst headache. \ud83d\ude29\n\nLet us hope we both feel better soon! \ud83d\ude0a Just throwing this out there. For me, everyone throught I had BPPV but my PT believes it is cervicogenic Vertigo due to my neck. My neck has been stiff and my muscles have been all kinds of knotted up since my symptoms started. (I am also a fitness junkie and let us say I do not properly stretch like I should and after a car accent a couple years ago, I have been messed up and not doing myself right lol) I know you said your dr thought the neck issues were a symptom and not the cause... but I would mb look into it more.  mine neck seemed to be the cause. In particular, the SCM muscle is affected for me. After PT and dry needling of the muscles my constant lightheaded feeling is going away and the neck issues are slowly going away too. I hope this helps. Like I said before, this may not be the cause for your issues but it does not hurt to try to rule other things out. Just putting out my personal experience. Good luck! \n Yeah, hang in there!  It does get better, but oh boy does it take time.  Lunesta never did much for me.  Do not be afraid to do your own research and push for meds that you think may help (but honestly, there is really not much to lean on.  I think there is a dizziness med - Meclazine I think? - that I took that made me completely whacked out in a different way.)\n\nKeep this thread up to date as to your progress!  It is helpful to hear from others even if there is no hope.  ;-) Absolutely! I am actually doing a lot better. They are starting to think my issue is from my neck. Link describing it here: \nPT, Stretching and dry needling has helped with most of my issues. Still have a lot of way to go but I hope everything resolves soon. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb Thanks for chiming in more. This is just so fucking devastating for me to read. Crowds never used to bother me, and this new anxiety is going to seriously damage my ability to function if it does not subside. I live and work in new york city and a lot of what I do revolves around crowds, i.e. commuting on crowded subway cars, busy transit centers, going to tiny underground concert venues.\n\nMy life is so fucked :/ Hi, thanks so much for your reply! Can you elaborate more on your symptoms and how your experience initally started by any chance? And do you happen to be a software engineer or work on a computer a lot of the day? I really want to give you hope!  And there is some!  You WILL improve from where you are.  My dr. said \"Most people mostly improve within 2 years\".  Brutal diagnosis, but as I am around the 18 month market it IS better than it was in year 1.  \n\nYou will be able to enjoy the city and music again, but it is going to take some time.  \n\nAt 26 your body is also going to recover faster than my 45 year old 'ol busted ass, so assume more rapid improvement.\n\nTry and take a few months to make your life a little quieter and smaller.  Bring friends over to your place.  Attend friendly house parties.  \n\nSee where you are in 3-6 months and you will feel some improvement!  You are not dead yet!  ;-) Sure! \nI woke up about 4 weeks ago with Vertigo super bad. It went away after a couple minutes but came back when I tried to lay on my other side. The rest of the day I was \u201cfoggy\u201d or disoriented I guess? It was an odd feeling And had the worst headache. That continued everyday. The vertigo did no happen everyday tho. Only when I tried to lay down fast, lay on my side or look down (bring my chin to my chest). The entire time my neck was so tight. Ever since I woke up that first day. I also had this knot on right side of my neck/shoulder. I could not turn my head left or right or really anywhere without getting a dizzy feeling and tightness. I went to an ENT and they told me it was BPPV. Tried the Epley. No vertigo. Went home, tried it again. No vertigo. The next morning, I tried it and bam vertigo! So I went to a chiro, they gave slight relief but it was short lived. So... I just kind of tried to push through it for 3 weeks. It gradually got better but still had a constant headache in the back of my head and around my eyes and a constant dizzy feeling plus the neck stiffness and pain. I finally had enough and scheduled an appointment with a PT that specializes in Vestibular Rehabilitation. He performed the maneuvers on me and it seemed to help at first but it was not a normal reaction. He then did some further evaluation and suggest we try to fix the neck. \nSo, TLDR:\nmy symptoms were:\nWoke up with vertigo\nConstant dizziness/disoriented \nTension headache constant at first\nStiff neck/ neck pain\nDuring the beginning, I could not sleep. I was so in uncomfortable and worried about causing the vertigo it kept me up.\n\nI do work at home on the computer most of the day. Since college, my posture has not been great. My PT thinks the muscle knot is from long term poor posture.\n\nHope this helps. Oh get some good noise canceling headphones.  Makes commutes much less chaotic. thanks a ton, this sounds similar to me in a lot of cases but different in others. ive been diagnosed as it being a vestibular migraines and dealing with a few other symptoms like tinnitus and TMJ and stuff. but when i went to my ENT she did somehow immediately notice my neck looking like shit. \n\nhowever i also had an MRI and theres a pretty substantial arachnoid cyst under my cerebellum so i have to see a neurosurgeon to make sure that that is not something causing issues either. theres so many possible issues, im such a fucking mess ugh I am sorry to hear that. My PCP thought I was having vestibular migraines as well and I was in the process of seeing a neurologist. I never had a history of migraines my whole life, so I felt \u201cunsure\u201d about that. At the time I thought I had BPPV so I assumed it was possible but it just did not sit right with me because I did not feel like I was having actual \u201cmigraines\u201d just lots of moderate pressure like pain. I also occasionally get tinnitus but it only lasts for a few seconds. I attribute that to the pressure I feel in my ears from the swelling/tension in my neck as it is not constant and happens seldomly. I do have an annoying clicking sound that happens ALL THE TIME! Ugh\n\nI am glad you had imaging done. It sounds like that may help give you more answers. I hope the neurosurgeon will provide more answers for you or at least peace of mind. My advice is to just relax, stress adds more tension and if you are like me...I tend to hold stress and tension in my neck. Makes it all worse. \n\nAll will be well eventually. Sounds crappy now but you will get answers and be on the path to recovering. I think it is only human that we have to go through some health BS at some point in our life but honestly...we are all a mess. Lol \n\nKeep taking care of yourself and get plenty of sleep. If anything, good sleep will help your body naturally recover to a point and make some of your symptoms more bearable. :) best of wishes. I am leaving this comment here in the hopes it might help someone out there. Last year I had BPPV that went on for months and I was beginning to think vertigo was just part of my life. I consulted my physician, a specialist and even had a CT scan. I was given several different possible causes but nothing conclusive. \n\nFast forward 3 months. I stopped using hair product and within a week the BPPV subsided. Apparently the hair gel was getting into my ear canal and along with the cold (ice hockey arenas) it was causing the vertigo. I am surprised I feel stupid that I did not think of it sooner but even more surprised nobody has ever mentioned it.\n\ntldr; if you have vertigo and use hair product discontinue and see if the vertigo subsides. thanks for chiming in and I am happy to hear your symptoms subsided! I do not use any hair products and I live in NYC so the climate is pretty tame. this all started the first weekend in september and i have no history of allergies so on of my first thoughts was maybe allergies.\n\nsome other food for thought, i had just moved into a new apartment and i was on the ground floor and it was kind of a shitty apartment and i saw a cockroach here and there so i was using borax as well as a different pest spray inside the apartment to keep them out of my kitchen. im hoping that exposure to these chemicals did not have anything to do with this starting but i doubt it\n\nadditionally. my basement flooded three weeks after moving in and the landlords never did shit so its possible that some kind of mold formed in my basement, but i also completely avoided using my basement for the remaining two months i was there after it flooded, so im not sure if that could have had an impact either.", "Maybe BPPV? (17,male)\n\nI really need some help on this, I have been getting these weird dizzy feelings that come an go every few seconds that is last almost less then a second, its really annoying, I have felt this for 4 days in a row now, I have felt this before but not this long before. It does not make me fall over or anything and I would not call it normal dizzy feeling, I do not feel like the room is spinning or anything its more like a off balance feeling, I even get it when I am sitting down. I have been trying to ignore it as much as I can but its starting to annoy me a lot. Besides this and headaches starting everyday, I feel fine. When I feel like this I can do task and talk normal but its throws me off because of how it feels. \n\nNote : I have had ECG's , xrays so I highly doubt this is something else that is going on. I also got a thing for bloodwork from my doc just to see if something else is going on.  If you get it even while sitting still it is more than likely not BPPV. BPPV is positional vertigo, as in moving your head certain ways causes the vertigo. Most commonly tilting your head straight up or down, a lot of times rolling to your side in bed will do it, usually it is only rolling one way that causes the vertigo. Maybe ask a doctor about ear infection, blood pressure issues, etc. Thank you. I have a blood work test that I will be doing in a week or so Good luck, hope you get some answers! Thanks, something weird, I took 300mg Ibuprofen and my dizzy symptom does not seem to be as bad Maybe it is related to your headaches then? I get tension headaches about once a month and they do not make me dizzy but they do make me feel \u201coff\u201d. I would keep track of things like that you notice between now and your appointment so you can tell your doctor. \n(Thanks for the award!) Your welcome, And yeah I did not even consider that the headaches were related to this, until my next appointment I am going to keep track of when I get like this, but I feel like this even when I do not have a headache, maybe silent headaches? I start feeling weird even before I have an actual tension headache, so maybe? Either way it is a good idea to pay attention to your symptoms and keep note of what is going on to let the doctor know.", "At home v. Doctor office with new bout Hey all, \n\nMy horizontal and downbeat nystagmus is back. Not nearly as bad as the last two times, especially the first episode (awful, I thought I was having a heart attack\u2026), but enough to notice when trying to focus my gaze and also at my computer. I recorded my eyes this morning to make sure I was not just imagining it, and sure enough I got it on camera. \u2639\ufe0f\n\nI am taking this as a sign to slow down, go to sleep earlier and set a better sleep schedule, meditate daily again (got away from it for a while), take breaks from work during the day, cut my caffeine and salt intake back even more, and get outside for some Vit D and fresh air more often.\n\nI am considering doing maneuvers  at home to start with, and avoid the doctor right away this time., since I have read many of you treat it at home with success and not have to drive immediately to the doctor in relapses. Part of me is nervous that without seeing the doctor, I might make things worse. Spouse agrees to try and treat at home based on my schedule and the fact that our insurance is something of a barrier- we have it, it just costs upward of $200 some visits if they do the Epley twice (each time I had it come back before, they did it twice in a row, then held me for \u201cobservation\u201d).\n\nAny thoughts on going right to home treatment? And reasons with a mild relapse for still going straight to the doctor? It is the same side that I have already been dealing with, so I am confident in what side to treat.

Best wishes to you! I will keep my fingers crossed that you are successful right away. Thank you! \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc for sure. \ud83d\ude0a At least I can recognize when I am having it creep up, and feel like I can try to get out ahead of it\u2026 trying to remain positive since it caused so much anxiety before and I do not want to go back to that fear! For sure keeping on top of the anxiety is a HUGE thing! And it is probably the hardest too. Hard to keep that fear away. But knowing that you CAN resolve the BPPV helps ease the anxiety.  Stay strong! I usually treat at home initially and then go in for pt if it does not resolve in a few days.  There is not too much you can do to make it worse.  It should come back to baseline after your maneuver.  Worst thing that could happen would be putting crystals in another canal, but even that can be resolved by going to your doctor or pt anyway. I am one of those that tried to treat at home and made it worse. Despite being treated professionally in the past and thinking I knew what I was doing. I always tell everyone to just go see a vestibular physical therapist right away That is a fear- crystals going somewhere else for a joyride, Lol.  \ud83d\ude43 I am considering going in so they can instruct me on how to do Epley at home. I have anxiety as it is, and think if they told me it was safe and showed me how maybe I would feel less worried about trying by myself.\n\nWhat I REALLY want to learn is the somersault but they said they do not do it at all and would not guide me because of that\u2026 people who do that one make it sound like a miracle. \ud83e\udd23 If you know which side to do the epley on and you have done it before you should be fine.  Watch Joey remenyi on YouTube do the maneuver to refresh your memory and just make sure your head is hanging down the 20 to 30 degrees.  I sometimes have my husband help me with it and have even had him video my eyes when I go back into the dix hallpike so I can see if there is nystagmus lol It was doing the somersault often that effed me up. I ended up with bilateral bppv. Thankfully only in posterior canal with both. 5 sessions of physical therapy so far with multiple epleys and semont maneuvers and my left ear STILL has particles out of place. Bilateral BPPV from somersault, and it was only one side before that? Or was it bilateral before?? Either way, that is awful and I am sorry you are dealing with it.\n\nI am about 9 months in, more or less, and  I super frustrated that I am apparently not one of the cases where it just goes away.\n\nSomewhere winking I read that you will stop getting symptoms because the crystals eventually will dissolve; I wish that were true. Correct I only had it on one side prior to self treating. Ended up with bilateral after self treating and also with cupulolithiasis in my left ear (this is the bppv where the particles stick to the nerve or in a little ball\u2026 making it harder to reposition them).\n\nIt is so frustrating I definitely feel you I am so sorry that happened. I hope you are better very soon.", "Reoccurring Episode Hi everyone, I am currently experiencing a mild vertigo episode. I cannot move without falling over but I can lie propped up in an upright position. Whenever I move, the room suddenly is spinning out of control. I am just trying to remain calm while my actual vertigo subsides. I experienced vertigo back in the end of 2019-early 2020 and have been fine ever since except for some residual dizziness but have me doing very well. I am a 24F and was 22 at the time of my first episode. I do not drink and I have stayed away from coffee since my first episode. I will be scheduling an appointment for an ENT in the morning, for it is really late in the evening right now. I am just so shocked cause this came so randomly. I felt perfectly fine and normal for months now without any residual dizziness. What is some stuff you guys try to do to keep calm when having an episode? How have you guys handle reoccurring experiences and how often are they? What are so of your guys experiences? What are some of your guys precautions when dealing with bppv? I am just trying to distract myself and find comfort. Thanks for listening everyone Poor you!!! I would not consider falling over a mild episode, that sounds rough!\nHave you figured out whether one ear seems more affected than the other and have you done an Epley? That always seems to help me... Did you have BPPV last time? I did have bppv last time. It was in my right ear but it was in the anterior canal so the Epley was actually ineffective for me, but I did do other maneuvers that worked. I have done any maneuvers myself though because I just cannot move, moving no matter which direction or how sends the room spinning. I have just been lying still as a statue because that is the least amount of dizziness but it is not the most comfortable making it hard for me to get some sleep and rest Best thing for me is to keep busy and distract myself.  I was fortunate - as I had my balance and could remain active (although I still felt very sick). Running was my savior - as for some reason, I felt best when I was running. And I wished I could just run 24/7.  My first three episodes were within 2 years. I did not know much about BPPV at that point and mostly it went away on it is own.  My last episode was over a year ago and it got BAD.  I sought expert help - and trust me, it took a while to find someone that could/would really help me. It took over two months to resolve, and I was left with a year of yucky residual dizziness.  I still fear every single day, that it is going to happen again. I am also hoping that because I got treatment this last time, that it will stay away longer.\n\nI am a healthy active 51F. I do not take medications or have any health conditions.  I do not drink and caffeine is moderate to none. Vitamin D levels are fine.  No past head injuries.  BPPV is so random.  I wish there was more info/studies to help those affected. And I scrutinize my life, trying to figure out WHY this happened and how to prevent it. There is just no rhyme or reason. And my vestibular therapist says the same. She constantly is going to the latest learning seminars to keep her education current on BPPV.  \n\nI DO take comfort in the fact that you cannot let it rule your life. I now know how to treat it and I have a therapist just a phone call away that I can see to help me. Try to not worry and let the anxiety get to you. The anxiety will feed the monster and make it so much worse!\n\nBest wishes to you. I hope you have a speedy recovery! Your story is so aspiring! The first time I was so anxious and scared but having it to deal with it before makes me very hopeful.\n\nMy first episode I had it for 6 months were I was constantly dizzy but it was not that bad, I could still walk, still work, had most of my balance. Nights I dread though because it was just spinning. No one could figure out was ear it was in even after countless test and the first month of seeing an ent, they did not even think it was bppv because I did not have the eye twitching. Due to it being so long, I had really bad residual dizziness for months following. I felt really helpless and hopeless but I often think to myself that if I got through that I can get through anything. \n\nThank you for sharing your story, it is absolutely wonderful and aspiring. I wish the best to you on the future and hope you do not have another episode. It sounds awful, I hope you get help tomorrow! Let us know how it goes! It sucks because it is the last thing you are really going to want to do but exercise helps. Both with BPPV and residual vertigo.", "My method of dealing with BPPV So, my BPPV started about six months ago and was diagnosed in my left ear only. After going to the doctor to have the Epley maneuver done, I did not feel any relief. My vertigo would come and go and I did not see any pattern of what would trigger it. However, I have found that if I laid on my left side when I slept (or for any long period of time), it would trigger my vertigo. So, every night I sleep only on my right side. I have not had any vertigo since I have done this. I know this is a very simple solution but it is the only way I could find relief. I hope that this will help someone who has it in only one ear.  May I ask how they diagnosed it? Sure. At the ENT office, the doctor performed the Dix-Hallpike test. I was given some goggles (similar to the oculus rift) that have cameras in them and told to put them on while I sat on an operating table in the dark. The doctor came in and moved me all around in different positions. Afterwards, we watched the footage on a monitor. The cameras filmed the movement of my eyes as I was moved in different directions. Because my eyes darted to my left when I was moved into different positions (nystagmus), the doctor said that this indicated I had BPPV in my left ear. He then performed the Epley Maneuver but it did not have an affect on me. He tried it a second time but I still could not feel a difference. Eventually, he gave me a prescription for diazepam which helps with dizziness. However, he said that using that prevents BPPV from healing in the long term, so to only use it in emergencies (such as at work).\nWhich brings me to why I made this post, that nothing really worked long-term except sleeping on the opposite side of my BPPV. Thanks for that information! I did a similar exercise with the mask at a neurologist office but to no conclusion. I will bring this up with my doctor at a future appt. My pleasure. BPPV is one of the most frustrating and terrible things I have had to deal with (particularly while working full time with children), and so I hope you can get some relief. Do not you find it bothersome not being able to sleep on one side, though? I have had BPPV for a month now (maneuvers only made things worse, like with you) and at one point I just could not handle sleeping on the same side anymore \u2014 after a week! \u2014 and so would unconsciously roll over in my sleep.\n\nTurns out this might have been a good thing, because the vertigo was so bad at the beginning and now I can happily roll over all I want. It is like I became desensitized. I still have one triggering position (looking up and to the left), but even the vertigo is not as bad as it once was. Six months is quite long for BPPV \u2014 perhaps you have Vestibular Neuritis as well/instead?  I have honestly become so used to it that it does not bother me at all. Even when laying down to read or watch something will trigger it if I lay my head on the left side, so I am just very cautious to avoid it. And as far as VN, I am not sure yet. If I get another episode then I will see a doctor.  I actually do this too now! I always used to read/watch something towards my nightstand on my right side. Now I make sure to alternate so that I spend time on the left side instead of my problem side (right side). Who knows what is going on inside them inner ears.\n I tend to sleep on my right side and I also read on my right side.\nMy BPPV hit one morning as I got up to go to work...I kept thinking it would pass, maybe just a virus.\nI was so, so sick.\nStayed in bed the whole day afraid to move.\nThe next was no better and I ended  up in the hospital for 2 days.\nNeurologist said it could be triggered by lying on one side too long.\nI make it a point to turn now.\nI am so afraid of it happening again I will do anything!\nLooking back there were two occasions prior to that morning where I had a \u201cdizzy\u201d feeling in my eyes when I turned my head.\nIt scared me but only lasted a few seconds each time.\nThis was about 6 months ago and I am terrified of it happening again.\nIt took a month for me to feel normal again.\nHas anyone else noticed a change in their dreams after a BPPV spell?\nI used to have a very pleasant reoccurring dream but now my dreams are confusing.\nI had never heard of this before and it sucks!", "BPPV and Tinnitus Hello,\nDoes anyone with BPPV also have tinnitus in both ears and if so, have you noticed a spike in your T after an attack or Epley maneuver?

It tends to go hand in hand. I have both of them.. Yes... during and after... ever since I had my first BPPV attack 6 years ago I have had an increase in tinnitus ... Yes and Yes.  I have had tinnitus mildly in both ears for probably 20 years or so.  First bout of BPPV was 3 years ago, and the tinnitus definitely increased in the side that was effected.  Actually - it seemed as though it added an additional 'tone' to what was/is already there.  The tinnitus is for sure worse during a BPPV episode.  Eventually it subsides a bit - but has also left (as I mentioned) other high pitched tones. So it is a bit like an orchestra in my head. Thank you \nI ask the Reddit community because they live with this as I do. My ENT dismissed my symptoms and told me BPPV does not cause these type of symptoms. I was dumbfounded since they started with my attack. LOL - if there is one thing I have learnt about doctors is that they have defined symptoms that they use to box you in for a diagnoses and if you present outside of these symptoms they cannot help you.\n\nI can assure you tinnitus is part of this wonderful experience that some will have, some will not, some have mild symptoms that come and go and some will have it so severe that it may be diagnosed as M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease. \n\nRecommend reading \u201cRock Steady\u201d by the lady over at seekingbalance.com.au I also have had gurgling in my ears, swishing, and fluttering.  All checked by an ENT and I was 'fine.'  These symptoms were dismissed as well as being associated with the  BPPV.  These things only happen around the time of my BPPV attacks.  The tinnitus is always there and has changed with BPPV.  I just always hope that they continue studying BPPV and can make advances with treating it! Thank you for sharing Ever since I started having bppv, that is when the tinnitus started. I have noticed even during the months when the bppv is gone, the tinnitus is still there.", "Anyone know what causes residual dizziness after the Epley? I have had BPPV for almost 2 years now and back then when I tried the Epley, I did not get any residual dizziness.

With this my vertigo and balance issues came back that I resolved when I was much younger. I did vistabuler therapy that helped a lot in getting me better. The doctors never truly new why I was having vertigo but the PT did end up working.\nNow a days my vertigo was accompanied by neck soreness and back pain and now I am thinking my vertigo was cervicogenic and maybe not inner ear related? The doctors said the tension in my neck can cause ear pain and ear ringing wich I have had. And they said that there not directly causing the vertigo but they indirectly make each other worse. Not sure if I should go back and do the same PT as before or if I should try a different place or program. I would normally say do what worked before but back when I was younger neck pain and such did not really happen. Not only that but my legs feel very floaty and weird when I am sitting down or not moving. So I am not sure if my back has anything to do with it.\n\nI have a neck mri coming up wich should show if there are any issues in my neck. But the problem is a lot of doctors do not even believe cervicogenic vertigo exists. \n\nIk vertigo can sometimes be an easy fix but for me it seems to be more complicated than that. \nI had a chiropractic adjustment like 3 months ago that cured my vertigo for 3 days but then came back worse. So I am thinking maybe there is a pinched nerve going on in my neck causing balance issues as well as inner ear but at the end of the day I am not a doctor so I do not know :/ Was your vertigo confirmed BPPV with testing all of your 6 inner ear canals? The brief (less than 30 seconds) of intense vertigo in certain positions with eye nystagmus (your eyes twitching a certain direction) can help diagnose which ear canal to treat. My therapist did many tests and I wore goggles so she could video my eyes.\n\nThere are other types of vertigo that I am less familiar with (vestibular neuritis &amp; migraines). But of you are having neck &amp; other issues.... It could certainly be causing a vertigo different than BPPV. There are some others on this sub that recently talked about some neck related issues &amp; hopefully they will chime in as well. Back when I was younger they did water and air tests in my ears but I freaked out during them so they stopped. I never did any epley maunuvers but I did excersises to retrain my system \nNot a doc, but ive had bppv.  I saw doc, ent and neuro pt x2.  I have had pillows and used tennis balls.  I have done the epley, the bd one and some other exercises.   As you age, you are more likely to get it again.  Or so they tell me.  Go with your gut and  what your doc says.  If something works great!  I would deal with the ears and stretch your neck.  Best of luck. Oh wow right now I am currently having some of these issues.

Hey everyone, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst time poster. I have been dealing with BPPV for a few years, but only got it recently diagnosed. This year has been really weird and it has been happening frequently. Sometimes I feel residual dizziness and balance issues without having a BPPV dizzy spell, but I am not feeling the full BPPV experience. Does this happen to anyone else? I am wondering if its caused by a vertigo attack that happened when I was sleeping but was unaware of it. I have experienced this before. I have had three bouts of BPPV, the last one being about nine months ago. Now and then I will get a feeling of slight dizziness after moving my head a certain way or bending over. It is obviously not a BPPV episode but it reminds me of the typical BPPV aftermath. I believe as BPPV sufferers we are susceptible to these sensations. Whether it is caused by a few floater crystals that are too minor to cause a full episode is something I have wondered about. I have had BPPV for at least a dozen years. I probably average around 3-4 full vertigo episodes per year that are always remedied with the Epley maneuver. More frequently, maybe once a month, I will notice a mild floating / spacinessfeeling, especially when looking at my phone or not moving. This sometimes is triggered when I move my eyes quickly or look a different direction quickly. I have often wondered whether this is a mild form of a full BPPV episode. I think I am starting to notice it is worse in the winter. This happens to me but as sort of a signal that a BPPV episode is on its way. My head gets swimmy when I look a certain direction but it does not progress to full on spins, at least at first. Sometimes, if I focus, I can prevent the full spins from manifesting.", "Feels like I am on a boat still My boyfriend just ran out to get Dramamine for me. Hopefully that helps. Thank you to everyone who helped with my last post. I am so dizzy it is crazy. I also emailed my doctor this morning Hey join the club .I had one but of Vertigo  and it lasted 1 week .But now I am on my 2nd but and it is not leaving .It is my Right side and when I lay dwn or go outside I am on a Boat .It is does not stop  .It is cannot lay on my right side or the whole room spins .It is the been taking CBD oil and it works .Just a thought  ..Hope u feel well and take it easy .It is them an Artist  and thank God  I can still draw . It is my right side also! The room will spin also if I lay on my right side! I took some dramamine yesterday and that helped so I could at least eat. Last night I stopped taking my cyclobenzaprine after taking it for 4 months so I will probably be dizzy from withdrawals also today but I need to know if that is what is causing it", "Walking for exercise and BPPV? I walk 4 miles with my wife 5-6 days a week, for the last maybe 6 weeks I have felt dizzy most of the time. It goes away when we stop, it is very odd.  It actually started a couple of years ago when I used to lift weights, back then I was tested for heart (stress test) and had CT Scan and they could not  find anything.  I switched my weight training  to cable type machines and stuck to cardio, almost exclusively on an elliptical without ever feeling dizzy.  Then we started this \"speed\" walking thing about a year ago and have been fine until recent weeks when I felt dizzy again.\n\nI am prone to motion sickness, boats backseats of cars, etc.  I guess I am just wondering if what I fee could be BPPV?  It seriously only happens when we walk. But with covid, it is really the only exercise I have been doing.  Quit the gym because, well, the covid. From the way you describe your symptoms, it does not really sound like BPPV. But, there is a diagnostic test for BPPV called the Dix-Hallpike. You can find videos or diagrams of how to perform this, it is pretty simple. If it is positive (nystagmus )on either side- you will know you have BPPV. If it is negative, then you likely have something else going on. Thank you! I will check it out.", "Still dizzy after successful Epley I was diagnosed with bppv after having it for two weeks. They did the Epley maneuver on me 5 times and on the fifth time the vertigo stopped and my eyes stopped spinning.  However, I am 5 days out from that and still feeling dizzy. I have checked to see if the vertigo is gone when I lay on my side and it definitely is. I am just still feeling a little lightheaded. Does anyone have similar experiences? I am new to all of this and trying to stay positive.  I do not have this. But others who posted here have said that they still sometimes feel dizzy afterwards. I am not sure why. I know some people experience a type of PTSD after a case of BPPV, and perhaps that is the source of some of it. &gt; I am new to all of this and trying to stay positive.\n\nWhen my first episode hit I was certain that my life was over and I would never be able to function again. That was nearly a decade ago and while I still get episodes I have the benefit of experience knowing that it will pass. \n\nThe light headedness will linger for a while (weeks would not surprise me at all) but it will clear up. It will not be fun but hang tight. \n Thank you for responding!! There is definitely a ptsd element to all of this.   The pt said the dizziness may last a few weeks while your brain learns what normal is again.  Thank you!! It is very good to hear from someone who has had it that it will end. My pt gave me some exercises to do to help my brain recalibrate. She said a couple of weeks and hopefully the dizziness will subside.

I feel completely stressed out, just wish to feel normal again Hello everyone\n\nI am a male, 28 years old, been healthy all my life, exercise at least 1-3 times a week,\n\nI used to fly pretty often (4-6 hours flights) due to work. two days after my last flight I was sitting down and having a chat with family, then all of a sudden I felt like if I try to stand up, I might fall, as if I am floating and getting very dizzy.\n\nI feel totally fine when lying down, though the moment I lift my head up slightly I get dizzy, like the  sensation of being on a boat and losing balance, as if my neck does not  hold my head properly, and my head has the tendency to move backwards with too ease. The moment I look up i begin to float, and when I went  to the shopping mall the other day, i was sitting for lunch, the dizziness and  floating was minimal, then the moment I looked up to stand up, I felt  like I am going to fall, as if the ground is moving, that I lose balance.  it truly takes away the basic and biggest pleasures out of life, I feel  like this may lead to depression, as I cannot go to work, socialize or  do basic things like hangout and feel safe doing so, since it is too  disturbing., and at times I feel like i might fall if I do not calculate  my foot work properly. \n\n**I visited ear doctor, he said it is not Vertigo, and referred me to a  neurologist, neurologist could not see anything either, I spent around 13 hours in  the hospital, had a blood test and CT Scan done, and there was nothing  abnormal they could see there either.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother general doctor I visited prescribed me with AGISERC 16MG (**3 times** a day for **10 days**), though I did not take it. thoughts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will mention that I did use this Posture Corrector For Men And Women for around 4 months, and suspect it might have contributed to my situation? ( Sounds like bppv to me. \n\nIs there a balance and dizziness physiotherapist that you can go see? \n\nThey would be able to diagnose you for certain. Thank you for your response.\n\nI went over and did many of the Chiropractor instructional videos on youtube on how to correct vertigo, and my eyes did not twitch at all, though I feel now more dizzy/floating sensation with every head movement i make, and my right ear has that light 'beep' sound like its slightly blocked, though I hear fine. I have insurance but it seems that chiropractors are not considered \"doctors\", but as \"Alternative Medicine\", so I cannot visit one with the insurance to cover it. Should I visit physiotherapist instead? Why did not you take the subscribed medication? Not judging, just curious. If you try the first position of the Epley maneuver and have someone watch your eyes or use a mirror to watch yourself, your eyeballs will vibrate back and forth (or maybe up and down), that is how you know it is BPPV. This site is pretty helpful in describing some different possibilities.   At first i thought its because of taking hair loss meds regularly such as Finastride, Ketoconazole cream (nizoral), minoxidil, voltaren (diflocenac), multivitamins, though i quit all 3 days ago, and the symptoms were not relieved. I will look at the link now. My ear doctor did these tests and confirmed its not BPPV, he is the one who referred me to do a CT scan. I hope you can find some answers somewhere, it really sucks to have to deal with. Where I live there are specific physiotherapists that treat issues like bppv. \n\nI have never been to a chiropractor to fix my vertigo problem. \n\nPerhaps do a quick Google for balance or vertigo clinics in your area? \nI hope that you are able to find a solution. Im very worried as my signs are clear BPPV, though my eyes arent twitching which makes me anxious as it might be that i have something else. I just cant deal with this nightmare, luckily my family is around to support and give me hope Thanks for the tip, i found a few around here, ill call for appointment. Can you tell me how you dealt with your vertigo? Thanks again. So, a bit of bad news. I visited the physio therapist who is a dizziness specialist,  and she did various tests, and came to the conclusion i dont have BPPV, but another form of vertigo and tinnitus that occurs because of immune system attack/virus/poor lifestyle-sleep habits, or just because., which leads to loss in the number of inner ear hairs which responsible for the delivery of movement information to the brain, so if my right inner ear now has less hairs than it had originally, my brain cannot adapt to the new situation where it gets less accurate information and it creates a lot of dizziness especially when i move my head with eyes open, or have a lot of objects infront of me, such as being in a crowded place like a restaurant or shopping mall. And indeed when i tried to visit the mall and restaurant in the past days, i felt like my vertigo reached a new peak, i felt that I am going to faint/fall from the chair, and on top of that i had terrible headache from all the surrounding noise. I wanted to die. It felt like my body consumed alcohol and marijuana after not sleeping for 2 days. I came home and cried hysterically. I never felt as helpless and hopeless. The physio therapist gave me 2 exercises to perform 3 times a day, to help the brain adjust to the situation. I also went to accipuncture session. The therapist said I have weakness in the liver and kidneys, and in chinese medicine those are linked to dizziness.\n\nLuckily, I have my family to support me, they remind me I should focus on being positive and that we will get out of it, and life will be back to normal again. I have tears in my eyes as I write now. it is really a daily nightmare to live with it, if anyone has any tips for me please do not hesitate to contact me or post here &gt;which leads to loss in the number of inner ear hairs which responsible for the delivery of movement information to the brain, so if my right inner ear now has less hairs than it had originally, my brain cannot adapt to the new situation where it gets less accurate information and it creates a lot of dizziness especially when i move my head with eyes open, or have a lot of objects infront of me, such as being in a crowded place like a restaurant or shopping mall. A\n\nis there a name for the condition you were diagnosed with? this sounds a lot like what im going through now Its my commitment to report here that i fully healed with the help of physio therapist. All it took was 2 meetings to feel huge relieve and get back to normal. She massaged my back (soft tissue) which was firm as a rock. I would never guess it was it, but luckily she checked if the tension is coming from there, as i was wearing shoulders strap for a long time and I am certain it is what caused it. Can you please elaborate on what kind of stuff your physio therapist did? Also do you happen to be in NYC by any chance? I tried a PT place by me and felt no changes so I am looking for somewhere new to go and to see if I can find peace.\n\nCoincidentally, I also wore shoulder straps to try to fix my posture and maybe I totally screwed things up Ok, so obviously this shoulder posture corrector strap is the reason behind our vertigo. I hope this post reach more people who experience the same issue. The physio therapist said it  interfere with the nerve, thus she had to release my soft tissue by pinching my skin &amp; muscle over the upper back, it hurts like hell, i couldnt breathe for the most part, really painful as shes doing it, very sharp pain, she does it for 15 minutes every meeting. though the pain was nothing compared to living with the vertigo, so i looked forward for the next meetings. I am not from NYC sorry, you got to find a good PT, if you got the same issue as me, its like getting your life back. I made a commitment that if i ever heal I will never forget about it, and will remain thankful, make a list of everything i can think of that im grateful for,  every night before bed. Even very simple things that i can think of before bed  put you back in prespective. Since then I feel like a new person, it really brought more happiness to my life.

Looking for a new pair of headphones. About a month ago now I \\ had my 3rd or 4th episode of BPPV in my life. My episodes are severe. Usually 3 days of horrendous vertigo followed by 3ish weeks of tailing symptoms including lingering dizziness, nausea, anxiety.   \n\n\nI am 100% sure my last episode was onsetted (not a word but it works) by my new pixel buds. They are inner-silicone buds and within 24 hours of wearing them for 5ish hours that day, my vestibular system was revenging against me. I also think I have small inner ears (concha/canal).  \n\\-----\n\nNow, since I am back to normal - I am *terrified* to buy new headphones. I have never used inner-ear headphones like my pixel buds (which I returned RIGHT AWAY) and have not had an issue with wired headphones that do not have that silicone in ear attachment in the past. I happen to have an android, so that nixes ear pods.   \n\n\n**Has anyone had the same issue with headphones and BPPV and if so, what headphones did you get/end up with that are safe to use? I would LOVE to find wireless headphones so I can finally work out, I am just so so terrified of buying the wrong ones and onsetting BPPV again. BPPV is like hell on earth as we all know.**  \n\n\nThank you, you lovely humans. My last episode was because I feel asleep with my AirPods in listening to white noise. No headphone recommendations to offer but just wanted to let you know you are not alone! Ugh. That is awful. I am so sorry you went through that. Did you have the pro with the in ear silicone or the gen 1 sans the inner ear piece? My theory is the silicone changes the pressure/vibration. I have noticed the same!! Glad to know I am not just thinking this on my own. I have stopped using headphones and my vertigo went away for a while, but sometimes it still happens even without wearing headphones. I think for the rest of my life I will just never wear headphones. It just sucks. I would love to be someone who can throw on music at the gym and workout, but the damn vestibular system! \n\n:( I have not had problems in the past with some headphones, so I might try again when I get past my fear. \n\nSorry you are dealing with this bullshit too. I am sorry your going through this too. \n\nThere does not seem to be much research about this and doctors do not really have a way of diagnosis. I cannot tell if it is just BPPV or meneries. We also do not  know much about what causes the vertigo attacks, but I hope what I said helps you. \n\nIt is sad not being able to use headphones but I am hoping that maybe after some time we will be able to again. I am not even sure if the headphones causes the vertigo fully since my symptoms started so randomly. Some people said that it has something to do with crystals in the ears or calcium or maybe just stress, lack of sleep. Hopefully things get better for you!", "A bad cold -&gt; A few episodes of BPPV -&gt; My life descending into a nightmare (constant dizziness, headaches, anxiety) -&gt; Possible solution My story: 9 months ago, I had a bad cold, which was followed by 2-3 episodes of BPPV (full-on vertigo and nausea). What came, and stayed, a few days after was way worse: near constant dizziness (different from vertigo) and lightheadedness, with many ever fluctuating symptoms: a very strong sense of imbalance, often light/visually triggered (neon lights in grocery stores would make me almost faint, I was terrified of going out), ever-present pain and tension in upper back/shoulders/neck/head (including increasingly frequent and painful tension headaches) and after a few months anxiety/panic disorder (palpitations, fast hart beat, constant anxiety, and creeping depressive feeling). \n\nI did see my doctor multiple times and all tests (blood, heart ecg/ultrasound/holter monitor) came back okay. She tried to put me on Zoloft to help with anxiety, which backfired and made me 10x more panicky even at the smallest dose. I am currently waiting for MRI (takes months in Canada). I have also tried a variety of physiotherapy, massage, chiro and osteopathy therapies, and none really helped. Overall, I lost the ability to live normal life and was in permanent state of dizzy anxiety and pain. \n\nCurrently I am still seeing two physios (one specializes in TMJ, the other in vestibular rehabilitation) and a massage therapist who does myofascial release.  Nothing seems to help, except for CBD that helped with anxiety and panic - did not remove them, but made them manageable.  I am also currently waiting for a cervical collar ( ( in case that helps with my cervical spine (I developed big postural issues, especially in upper back and neck, as I work in IT).\n\nAnyhoo, as none of the above resolved my issues, I kept googling. I would not recommend it, and you are doing it at your own risk. :) A few days ago I came across a comment by someone saying she resolved her problems by applying hot packs to her neck. I was using heating pads for my back and neck for months, but it never seemed to help. It turns out I was targeting wrong muscles.\n\nFour days ago, I started applying heat to **SCM**, **suboccipital** and **scalene** muscles, as well as side of my face/jaw/under ear and temple/forehead areas. See this article ( ( for a reference, as it mentions other upper back muscles that might be of interest - they are definitely tense and painful for me. I use combination of different heating packs 2-3 times a day, for between 20 and 60 minuts. And just like that, 90% of my dizziness and headaches disappeared after more than 8 months of this nightmare. It might be too early for me to declare this as The Solution, but the improvement is so significant, and explains why nothing so far worked (none of them addressed extreme tension and issues in these groups) that I felt like sharing. \n\nI do not think it was a single muscle that was responsible for my sitaution. Rather, it was a bunch of them working together: over a year of prolonged and extreme work-related stress combined with extremely bad posture (my neck folder on itself, like an S) and 12h+ work days, total lack of physical exercise, bad diet (high in caffeine and sugar) and bad sleep habits. Then a cold hit, probably triggering BPPV initially, and then the entire set of symptoms came down on me like an avalanche. \n\nHopefully this helps someone. It is easy enough and will tell you within days whether it provides any relief. Thank you for sharing this. I was just diagnosed with BPPV and have been struggling off and on with the dizziness and lightheadedness. The doctor gave me Prednisone to help with ear pressure and suggested Meclizine for the motion sickness. My mom also gets vertigo and gave me suggestions for maneuvers (I have been doing half somersault). I am not on Prednisone anymore and would prefer to not have to take the Meclizine if I can avoid it. I do not enjoy the feeling of being on meds. \n\nIt sounds like I have some of the same problems as you, with TMJ and holding stress in my face and shoulders. I also notice more ear and jaw pain now that I am back to work and am wearing and talking through a mask for a majority of the day (I am a teacher and trying to project my voice and articulate through a mask all day has been rough - lots of tension).\n\nI will definitely be trying out the heat to the areas you suggested. Sounds totally up my alley! Thanks again for sharing your story. Fingers crossed, I really hope it helps, and that you are okay soon.\n\nWhen I had my episodes of BPPV, what helped quite effectively was this Epley's maneuver (( \\- skip the first 12 seconds as they try to show the vertigo visually), followed by ( I read somewhere that the cause can be in three different locations of the ear canal, so some variations of the above are needed, depending on your case.\n\nI noticed that the extreme muscle tension can cause water retention in the area, and with other issues it can increase a chance of BPPV episodes. Whenever I feel too tense/bloated around head (sounds funny but I see my face bloating), I use dandelion pills, they are effective diuretics. Also, the usual applies: avoid salt, caffeine and sugar, and make sure you are hydrated throughout the day. Another thing that did help somewhat with fluid retention is lymphatic drainage self-massage: ( and ( I now have the habit of pulling my ears out and down randomly, when they get stuffy, and it feels so good.\n\nMaybe try Gravol Ginger, or just large amounts of fresh ginger in your diet. While it helped me a bit, it did not cause a significant improvement. I tried a dozen other herbs and anti-allergy syrups with no luck. The last thing I will try is Vertigoheel, ordered it from (  It is listed as homeopathic, and while I am not into any unscientific woo-woo, I found their Traumeel (the old formula, before Canadian regulations made them change to 'homeopathic' form) extremely effective for muscle strain and pain, and decided to give it a shot.\n\nAlso, daily breathing exercises and (progressive) muscle relaxation/mindlessness exercises can help with the stress and clenching habits.\n\nAll the best! Thanks for the advice! I will definitely try out the hot pads! I really really hope you feel better soon! Thank you, and likewise! Interesting, I have tmj as well, good to know Hey. Thanks for all the good info. I am on a similar boat as you. Had BPPV about 6 weeks ago. After that, no vertigo - But I have been dealing with residual dizziness and lightheadedness since then. I have also seen my PD, two ENTs, and a vestibular therapist, and none could help much. My last ENT doc said that it is residual dizziness after BPPV, and it is common, and you need to wait until it goes away.\n\nAlthough I should confess that my symptoms are not as bad as yours. During the first 4 weeks, it was really bad (except 4 random days in the middle when I thought it is gone because I had no dizziness). During those 4 weeks, I was laying down most of the time, and I could not even work with my laptop, because looking at it was making me more lightheaded. After that, I started to feel better, and now I am a stage that I can do all my normal activities (work with laptop, walk, watch movies, and etc) but if I sit somewhere where my neck is not supported, I get lightheaded after 30 minutes or so. That is why I think it might be related to my neck.\n\nSimilar to you, I have had extremely stressful days and extremely bad neck posture most of the time. I have heard that upper cervical chiropractors might also help to remove that tension from the neck. But I have not tried it yet.\n\nCan you send me a link to these heating pads you use? I do not have one and plan to buy, but I do not know which brand and what type to buy. Thanks, and I hope the dizziness for both of us completely goes away soon. The worst thing about these symptoms is that they can be so different at different times and for different people, it is maddening. I hope your situation is just a simple residue and you are symptom free asap. This stuff sucks so much.\n\nMy guess is that whatever triggers BPPV can also aggravate an already tense muscle situation and sometimes lead to a whole new set of issues.  Make sure you avoid sugar/caffeine/salt/nicotine and hydrate sufficiently all the time.\n\nIf neck is your issue, you probably want to do some neck strengthening and posture exercises, chin tuck and shoulder strengthening, like this: ( If chin tucks are too challenging (my neck was initially too tense for the basic form), you can do them while laying down, with a pillow under your head, and very very slowly. The goal is to wake up and strengthen your front neck muscles.  Do take it easy with stretches of any kind, especially neck and shoulders. I was making a basic mistake of forcing them when my neck and shoulders hurt. If you want more tips about vestibular rehab, dm me and I can send you some links. \n\nFor heating pads, I am using a combo, similar, but not identical to the ones listed. The wheat bags are easier to use around the face/jaws, but I sometimes roll up the big electric one and press it around an area, with wheat bags sitting on top of my head or on shoulders. The biggest challenge is to be comfortable for a long time period and keep the warmth at as high level as you can tolerate.\n\n* (\n* ( (full back version)\n* wheat bags (square + long rectangular) - these can be microwaved to much warmer than electric pad, and are easier to apply to an area but they also cool off faster Wow - inner ear infection started me off followed by neck, eye, ear, forehead pain, sensitivity to light and large crowds can throw me right off... I just try to \u201cpush through\u201d which has been for 6+ years. Seen so many \u201cspecialists\u201d, spent too much money and do not have any relief other then when my body gives me a good day. Will definitely give some heat pads a shot!! Thankyou!! Ugh, I feel you. \n\nI have been also finding a lot of trigger points in those same muscles, all over my back, neck, shoulders and head (compared to just a few my super relaxed bf has) and been working on gently massaging them. Check out ( and ( (and (\n\nHave you had your cervical spine checked out? I am planning to see a NUCCA chiropractor in a week, even tho I am extremely skeptical of the entire profession due some hucksters encountered in the past.\n\nAlso, consider doing some manual drainage around your head, like these:\n\n* Head: (\n* Face: (\n* Neck: (\n* Neck/ears: (\n\nAlso, from what I understand, short or long-term vestibular issues can cause something called gaze instability. Exercises like ( can help fix it. Finding a really experienced VT therapist is a challenge, for sure.\n\nI hope some of this helps. Fingers crossed. Thank you for sharing this. I am in a similar boat but I am a bit further up the stream I think. \n\nAlmost 2 weeks ago I was sitting in my living room and talking to my wife and watching a movie when all of a sudden it felt like I was spinning and falling and or that I was going to pass out. It lasted only a few moments but what came after was worse. Right after that I could not stand with out help. I thought I was getting better but started feeling sick and that the room was moving and my legs were weak. We decided to go to the ER and as I stepped out the door I proceeded to vomit in my driveways constantly and uncontrollably for almost 5 minutes strait. Not a pretty sight for the neighbors in the middle of the day. Anyway get to the ER... they diagnose me with BPPV, pump me full of Zofran and send me home with a scrip for meclizine and ativan. The following two weeks are just different levels of dizziness. Some days right after my spell I felt pretty good, but if I tried to go for a walk I would make myself sick. I was feeling slightly dizzy then but the nausea from the motion is what I hate worse. It is debilitating. I am cannot walk confidently anywhere. My wife has to drive me to work. I can only go to work if I take the meclizine, which I know I am supposed to be weening myself of off. I am limiting caffeine and alcohol as much as I safely can. I cannot get in to see my PCP until next week and I cannot get in to see the ENT until the end of October. \n\nMy wife is a rock star. Taking care of everyone now (we have 4 kids), working full time at home, keeping up with 4 kids remotely learning, but also having to drive them to their 3 different schools if we decide to send that back to in person learning... All these things just adding to what is already been a horrible year. \n\nAnyway. I will try the heating pad when I get home. Already trying to loosen my jaw. I do clench it quite often. Maybe this is all anxiety related who knows. I just hope it starts getting better soon. My heart goes to you. It is not possible to imagine how these things feel until they happen to you. Hang on in there.\n\nSounds like you have a pretty severe case of BPPV. I had similar experience twice, where I could not even sit (had to lay down), and the first lasted for over an hour, and included plenty of vomiting.  It is normal.\n\nHas anyone at ER told you about Epley's? There are certain maneuvers you can do to help this thing along. Given yours is pretty severe, it might be best if you see a therapist who specializes in BPPV and they can help with it. Sometimes, doing these myself are near miraculous, you have to repeat them a few times but it is so much better afterwards.  \n\nWhile you wait, I would suggest you find a good and really experienced local physio and give this a shot. They can also help train you to do it yourself at home. \n\nThere are three canals in the ear that can be affected, so the kind of exercise that will help you will depend on that (physio should be able to help with this as well).  ( list them.\n\nReally sorry you are going through this, fingers crossed it is fixed soon. Let us know how it goes!", "How accurate is the Dix-Hallpike test? I am now 2 months in with balance issues that seem to match some kind of vestibular dysfunction. This all started when I got out of bed and was so off-balance I could barely stay up (no spinning vertigo). Went to urgent care, they saw ear wax impaction so they flushed it and it felt better. A week later, the same thing happened. This time I saw my GP and she thought it was vestibular neuritis and sent me to a vestibular PT. The PT performed the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to check for BPPV and I had no reaction. Then, recently I saw a neurologist and he thought my onset sounded a lot like BPPV, did the Dix-Hallpike and again, no reaction. I have not had any other 'acute' attacks, just an off-balance feeling and a sense of movement while sitting and laying down. The neurologist mentioned in passing that tests like Dix-Hallpike are not 100% so it made wonder, is it possible to have BPPV while still testing negative via the Dix Hallpike?", "There is a sub for everything. I almost passed out this morning when I woke up and went to take a piss. Cold sweat, feeling heavy in the head, losing consciousness. Feeling a bit nauseous (I did eat some raw beef yesterday). I was like what the hell is wrong now.\n\nAs soon as I got back to bed, I felt better. I took a spoon of honey because I thought it might be the lack of food. That did not help a lot. \n\nI get up the second time, the image goes a bit black. But I remain on my feet, good sign.\n\nThe whole day I am tripping why I almost fainted in the morning. Is it my experimentation with my diet, is it anemia, low blood pressure, could I be diabetic.\n\nI got an appointment with the doctor later in the evening. And by the time I got there I felt quite normal. I explain what happened. He dismissed the low sugar theory, my pressure was normal. \n\nHe asked me to follow the movement of his finger with my eyes and he was like, yeah, I can already see what is wrong with you. I was like what I have a brain tumor.\n\nHe positioned my body and head in different ways and asked me how I felt afterwards, I was like fine, maybe a bit dizzy.\n\nThe doctor and I had to communicate in our non native languages. So he did not explain well what is the matter. He said something about crystals in inner ear causing some disturbance,  it is not a dangerous condition, only if I actually faint.\n\nHe prescribed me some medicine and said to take it if I feel unwell again. I googled the medicine and I got that it is used to treat BPPV.\n\nI want to hear your experiences. How often do this episodes occur? \nWhat to do when this happens in public?\nI read somewhere weed helps. From what you have written, I am not convinced you have BPPV. I think you should read more about it.  When you have BPPV, your head is not just heavy, it spins like you are on a vicious amusement park ride. And the spinning is triggered by a particular head movement, like turning your head up or to the side. \n\nIf you really think you have BPPV go see an ENT, but make sure you find one who speaks your language. Also, these days, because of the corona virus, telemedicine is very popular. You might find an ENT from your home country (wherever that is) who is willing to examine you by skype. \n\nI know what it is like to have medical issues in a foreign country...I am living in one too! Good luck. I did not experience extreme vertigo and vomiting but other symptoms yes.\nThe doctor prescribed me acetyl leucine. Is that something that people with BPPv take? When I had BPPV, I got no medication at all. My ENT showed me how to do the Epley Maneuver. We did it together once in her office and I did it alone once at home. After that, all symptoms were gone and it has not come back. That was about 1 1/2 years ago.\n\nReally, it does not seem to me that you have BPPV. Maybe another disorder of the vestibular system, perhaps? Hello there!\nSorry to hear that you had a rough day. \nHm, I would have to agree with the previous post that  what you experienced does not sounds like BPPV. When I woke up with it, I could barely get out of bed because the spinning (vertigo) was so bad. Literally had to crawl to the bathroom to vomit from the motion sickness but I never lost consciousness. I could barely move my head in any position or lay down without getting the spins. \n\nI am not a doctor so I cannot give you a possible cause...however I would definitely get another opinion. I would not disregard BPPV but I would look for someone usually a balance/dizzy clinic or Physical Therapist who can diagnose it by using goggles to identify the eye nystagmus. That way you can also figure out which ear is affected and treat it with the maneuvers. \n\nI hope you figure out what is causing you issues and you feel better soon. xx", "Modern artificial lighting (dimmed LEDs) caused my wife's dizziness and headaches I drew up a long post on /r/photophobia, but I also wanted to comment here in case it helps someone.\n\nFor the past several months, we thought my wife had some form of vertigo.  All of the tests came back without issue.  We saw the GP, the cardiologist, the ENT, and 2 optometrists.  She went through an ultrasound, CT (or was it an MRI?), some kind of \"table test\", and some kind of torture called an \"ENG\" I think.  Other than a small prescription for her eyes, all tests came back with no issues.\n\nI suggest that if you suffer from headaches and dizziness and have reached dead ends with your medical professionals, try to do some experiments to see if the lighting around you is triggering your symptoms.  A lot of modern lighting, along with some device displays, will \"strobe\" at a level that usually is not perceived by the conscious mind.  Best we can tell, this was causing an overload of her visual cortex.\n\nWe are going to try some lenses tinted to help people with migraines next, since we found some similar reports of strobing sensitivity in those communities.  We probably will still follow up with a neurologist after that, but we are at least armed with the knowledge of what triggers her.\n\nI hope this helps someone else at the end of their rope.\n\nThis is the link to my longer post on the other sub - (\n\nForgive me if I did that wrong, usually just a lurker on reddit.", "Wedge pillow? Has anyone tried a wedge pillow to help with dizziness? \n\nOr what would you say has helped you not wake up dizzy? I have tried a wedge. Did not do any good because I could still turn my head to the side.\n\nWhat worked is sleeping on the couch, wedged in with pillows so I could not shift much. It is not great for getting a good nights sleep, but it is far better than spinning. I have bppv for over 1 year now - on and off. I instruct myself not to toss and turn in bed, and I became very good at this. Sometimes I wake up with neck pain, but no bppv - the choice is simple for me \ud83d\ude05 How do you sleep? Straight on your back? On my \u201cgood\u201d side, aka the side that does not trigger the spinning, and on my stomach. I never allow myself to turn to the \u201cbad\u201d side - it worked so far. I have not really considered sleeping on the back, because I do not like it. It would be better for my spine and neck, though. I use to be a stomach sleeper,but ever since my bppv attack(February) I have not even tried sleeping on my stomach,I am too scared it will trigger the vertigo. I sleep on my stomach with the good ear down. I have had BPPV on and off for 6+ years and found a memory foam pillow with good neck support and sleeping in my back has been very effective in keeping BPPV at bay Hi! Any memory foam pillow? I use this one - \n\nIt took a while to getting use to along with sleeping in my back but it is made a huge difference for me.", "Home treatment or physician, that is the question This is my third time around. First time was ENT diagnosed and Epley Maneuver worked just fine. Second time, just did the Epley Maneuver at home and it worked just fine. This time, I am weighing the pros and cons, after reading about other people's experiences tonight. I prefer not to see physicians, if I can help it. I am pretty sure that this is allergy related and am taking supplements like crazy, hoping that I can somehow reverse this. I am not sure if there is a down side to home treatment. I doubt it. But an experienced physician will know which vestibular canal is effected and which maneuver is best to use. Of course, you can guess and try to do this yourself. But if you can afford it, why not talk to someone who has been down that highway many times before?  It turns out that there are some major down sides to home treatment. One guy here tried the Half Somersault move instead of the Epley Manuever one time and said it made his 100x worse and he was incapacitated to the point of needing an ambulance. And I agree with you...since I have insurance and have already met my deductible this year, why not leave it to the professionals? I have an appointment on Wednesday, thankfully. This is great. However, as I have posted elsewhere, I would not go to a \"generic ENT\". I would go to a balance center of to some ENT who specializes in balance disorders. Even though it is said that BPPV is common, many ENTs do not really know much more about it than we do. Go to a specialist who sees this stuff everyday. Most major cities have balance centers or something similar.  Never heard of this.  I have always heard there is no harm in doing the maneuvers.  Just did the half somersault today in fact and it worked. Really glad that it worked for you! One of the 13 doc offices I talked to today, warned me and I replied, \"why do you think I am calling you?\", lol. If I can find the link quickly, I will add it, because it was quite a story. Well, if the crystals are in a particular canal, a canal that eply will fix, then doing a different maneuver can roll the crystals the complete wrong way, and possibly into a worse canal harder to treat. In your case, the somersault was tied with your effected canal......know what I am sayin Kind Of?  I asked my doctor, she said there should not be an issue.  Also, are they even connected like that?  In any case, I will still keep it in mind. The most important thing doing this at home is viewing the nystagmus, eye movement direction, while in the test position. Otherwise you may be doing the wrong maneuvers for the wrong canals.  Yeah it is strange. If you do the dix halpike test, and you start to get dizzy, your eyes will start moving, either up, sideways, rotational, and that movement indicates the area with the issue. \n\nPicture one of those liquid filled puzzles with a ball in it, you turn it to try and get the ball through the maze and into the hole. If you do it blind, without knowing exactly wher that ball is and how fast it is moving, you can move it much further from the hole, then it will be that much harder to get back. \n\nProperly diagnosing the location is pretty important, or else your doing a maneuver that is not even moving the particles the right direction, or in a worse direction. \n\nSee each position you do, is moving the particles one direction, then the next position moves them even closer to home, then so on. If your doing the wrong moves, then what if you turn those particles into a worse spot, it happens, pretty common, just be careful. \n\nMake sure your doc is experienced in bppv.

Then if he is low, follow the vitamin d protocol. i have BPPV and all of this is true for me too. if i am in complete darkness i can become very disoriented Have you been doing gaze exercises?

Interesting we will look into it. We started at an ENT he threw my wife around and then asked if she was dizzy to which she said yes then said she did not have vertigo. Then after blood work and endoscopy a ultra sound from inside the vagina and a cervical biopsy later we went to a neurologist who did a few tests and told us it was vertigo. Vertigo is a symptom it is not a diagnosis and it can be brought on by many things.

I am not diabetic, just sometimes forget to eat if I have a really busy day and do not take proper time for myself for even a proper snack.

I have came across this sub ages ago and it was the first time I have heard of the condition, and found it very interesting. Fate would have it that I am now experiencing this first hand and came back here for guidance. There is so many great resources and I commend this community for helping each other out so much.\n\nI just wanted to reach out to hear a bit from your experiences as my doctor has not been very helpful in answering my questions.\n\nI had a few brief episodes of vertigo 3 days ago, each lasting a few minutes, and being a few minutes apart. By the 4th or 5th attack, it stuck around and the whole world has been spinning for me continuously for 3 days now. I saw an ENT doctor who said he cannot find any inner ear infection, but prescribed me Serc for the symptoms. I have not seen results yet. When I mentioned BPPV as a possibility he dismissed it saying it would have to be a recurring thing if it were, but it cannot be since it is my first time experiencing this. But I am confused as I am sure everyone had a first time at some point.\n\nTL;DR So what I would like to hear from anyone who has time to share is how it was for them the first time, and how did they know it was BPPV? Do you take any meds for it, and how effective are they? \n\nDoes it make sense for me to attempt to do exercises and maneuvers on my own? as I understand that other than feeling uncomfortable they are pretty safe and do not pose further threats to the condition.

Bit of a vent/rant... \n\nBut I have had BPPV about 6-7 times in the past three years and it is almost expected now (always happens between March - June and then again between Oct-Dec). \n\nThe first time I had it I was panicked and extremely nauseous (body was like: wtf is happening???). Second time was worse by far bc I had it in both ears and could barely walk and promoted a visit to vestibular specialist. \n\nAfter the second time though, I have just become so used to it I will wake up, feel dizzy, know it is BPPV, do maneuver and go back to regular programming. It is become such a casual presence in my life now I almost expect it every 6 months... \n\nI am grateful that maneuvers work to resolve it for me almost immediately. But just wondering if anyone else has this experience too haha (aka getting used to BPPV just being part of your life). Twice a year sounds horrible! I have had 4 or 5 episodes over the past 15 years. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable at this point because I like to read information on anything that is affecting me physically, but I have had it in different canals and different levels of stuck-ness so I still tend to go see a doctor unless it is a mild case. Had my first episode in November of 2019. Woke up to the room spinning at 100mph and wondering wtf is happening. Since then about every 3 months I will have 2 week stretches where I am dizzy and lethargic. The nice thing is there has not been the spinning sensation in the middle of the night. It will just wake up and feel off (slightly dizzy, kind of hard to focus, tired). At this point I assume it is a new way of life \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Vestibular exercises will help with this. Some people get full resolution, others (like me) will have improvement but will never be the same pre BPPV - ie I have days where I am 100% (no dizziness or lightheaded feelings), other days, that residual dizziness creeps back in but not earth shattering severe. \n\nIf you are sick of feeling \u201coff\u201d speak to a PT about the exercises or google them.

This subreddit has been a really good read - thanks to all for posting the suggestions.\n\nMy BPPV simply comes on when things just get a bit much - too much work / computer use / stress and occasionally combined with motion or fast head movements. I kind of have myself to blame because I still let things get out of hand and then Voila, it comes back again.\n\n(As an aside I am really triggered by PWM on some screens...fortunately I can test for this nowadays and avoid the offending articles).\n\nThe dizzyness can subside over a few days but in my case **what really gets to me is the 'residue' which can go on for literally weeks. This is feeling spaced out, withdrawn, low in energy, and just way flat and a very poor version of myself.** I guess it is my immune system being triggered, or maybe the subtle repercussions of the balance system going out of whack.\n\nThis time I am going to try a combination of these:\n\nVitamin D\n\nCalcium tablets\n\nThe 'rollover log' move\n\nThe epley move.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone echos my thoughts, or has anything else to suggest ? Thanks for all this.  It sounds like we have all the same triggers weirdly so it is good to hear there are established patterns. yep same here. too much to eat, too much stress, working too late, a beer too close to bedtime. basically anything that makes me PASS OUT can be harmful\n\nI finally recognized after 15 years of having it there might be a slight bias to my right side having it. so sleeping on my left could be the cause. slept on my right tonight and nothing today after 3 days in a row with residual/bad symptoms after waking up.\n\ni usually try to sleep upright-ish on my back but sometimes it is so nice to just roll over I got that feeling of \"something wrong with my balance\" on random times within 6 months. I got one vertigo attack within that period also.\n\nWhen I had off-balance sensation I thought it was a light-weight form of BPPV (believed that may be just very tiny crystals dislocated?) I started practicing Eppley Manuevers by myself. Since there was no direction and it was not a real spinning experience, I did eppley manuevers to both sides, even headbang (vertical canal) manuever. Then I think I really dislocated crystals by mistake and the real vertigo kicked in. Then went to doctor etc. etc.\n\nMy point is doctor advised me to do neck excercises. This kind of light-dizzness could be because of pressure on nerves due to stiff neck. I realized that when I look at phone or my laptop with my head looking downwards for a long time, I feel stiffness and dizzyness. Try the vitamin d protocol. &gt;vitamin d protocol.\n\nThanks for this - looks interesting. It also confirms my suspicion about capsules being way better than tablets. I must admit the crazy-high doses make me a bit concerned though. 5000iu/day is not crazy high. Also liquid (spray or drops) is better than caps.", "Yoga, I miss you. Been dealing with my latest BPPV episode for about six weeks.

My current bppv episode started while I was doing yoga, it is the second time over the years that has happened, so I am pretty bummed about that. The PT I have been going to said inversion positions are going to be something I need to avoid so I might look into standing series when (if) the vertigo ends this time. Makes sense. Thank you and I hope things level for you soon.", "Will life ever be normal again? I have gotten vertigo 3 times since February 2020 after playing Virtual Reality (VR) on the Oculus Rift for wayyyyy too long and I am so frustrated. Looking straight up will trigger it and make me spin. Getting in and out of bed will make me spin. \n\nSo am I never going to go on a roller coaster again? Never play basketball and look up at the hoop? Never play VR? Relax my head back in a pool float? Never eat salt or drink coffee? It seems like many of my favorite things aggravate this stupid condition. \n\nMaybe I am being dramatic but it is so frustrating and BPPV is so abstract it seems compared to other conditions. So it only happens after using VR? Have you been diagnosed with BPPV? Have you identified which ear canal is effected and attempted any maneuvers to cure it?  Is it the BPPV vertigo with nystagmus that you are experiencing when you move your head into certain positions? After the dislodged crystal in your ear is back in place, the severe symptoms should go away. You may be left with residual dizziness for a while.  My BPPV was active for over 2 months and I WAS working with a vestibular therapist to correct it. So I had a very miserable 2 months. And even after that - dealing with the residual was NOT fun. 8 months later and I am finally feeling mostly 'normal.'  There are different forms of vertigo - and you need to get diagnosed in order to treat it properly. Oh no, the vertigo was triggered by VR originally and now it is triggered by putting my head back too far. I have been to the PT 2 times, Epley was successful, talked to my doctor. They told me it is vertigo, not sure if that means I have been \u201cdiagnosed\u201d. At the PT they said my right side triggered the nystagmus during Epley. However I find that it is mainly tilting my head back that triggers it (no difference left vs. right). Perhaps BPPV and my vertigo are not the same, but I had been working with the PT for about a month before I felt \u2018normal\u2019 again. The last time was debilitating, right now I just feel \u2018out of it\u2019 and similar to what my original residual felt like the first time around. Ugh - sorry. I know, it is not fun. But I am glad to hear you are working with a PT.  This last episode was my 4th in a 2 year time frame.  I am finally feeling normal after 8 months, but wondering when it is going to hit again.  I know from other posts on this forum that there is possibly a different ear canal effected if you get the vertigo when you tilt your head straight back. The crystal CAN shift to another canal, and then require a different maneuver (other than the Epley) to clear it. 8 months is such a long time to have symptoms that must drive you crazy. I have also heard that somewhere, maybe I will bring it up to my doctor. Epley did work last time around and cleared me of my symptoms mostly, but yes I do think it is odd only going backwards triggers it. Thanks for bringing it up again. It just feels like the \u201cbogey man\u201d that could come at any moment. If you are working with a PT and Epley maneuver has helped then it is more than likely been diagnosed as BPPV. It is kind of odd that it is only when you tip your head too far back, usually there is also a reaction tipping or rolling from one side to another. Maybe it is in a different canal, maybe you have residual dizziness? My last episode ended earlier this year but I still get a weird feeling when I move my head in a certain way that used to trigger the vertigo, almost like a phantom dizziness for just a second or two. I am not sure if that makes sense. I also had quite a bit of anxiety with my last episode and feel like anticipatory anxiety is still affecting me, as in I am avoiding any exercise movement that involves laying back flat on the floor since that is when my last episode started. It would be worth it to call your PT and get their opinion on it. Hi, I had BPPV from tilting head back and forward. When I was at the PT when we did the dix pike, it would not trigger any vertigo, but when we did the roll test on my back, we could trigger the vertigo easily. PT thought the problem was in the horizontal canal (Epley is for the posterior canal) and treated me with the BBQ roll. \n\n4 weeks later - I am on the mend. Thanks for giving specifics on techniques you used. I was not sure how to talk to my PT because like you, tilting my head back triggers it. However Epley did mitigate some of it before... so messy lol. I will bring those up to her- thanks! Hope you are feeling better. Best advice is to make sure your PT specialises in balance / dizzyness. I found I needed more then just the bbq roll to fix me as I am also doing gaze stability exercises which has gotten me to 90% better... that being said I still have that lingering nausea feeling. \n\nBest of luck and report back if the bbq roll works if your PT goes down that path with you. I have had it for a month now after having it a year ago for about 2 weeks after a concussion.  You can rest your head.  The dizziness or vertigo goes away after a few seconds if you stay relatively still.  I can still do almost all my exercises still and lead an active life.  It sucks but I am thankful it does not last long enough to give me nausea.  I hope it goes away eventually but I am prepared to have this forever or keep coming back.", "Slight dizziness when stressed? Has anyone else, who has BPPV, experienced slight dizziness (extremely mild compared to a veritgo attack, but still due to specific motions or positions) when they are stressed? \n\nI know this is mostly anecdotal and speculative, unless someone is an expert with the scientific literature, but could stress being causing slight disturbance in the vestibular system? Yes - often - a stressful situation such as just before I am about to present publicly... the dizziness kicks :( Stress tends to exacerbate my dizziness but it is still already there. Yes!!!! Stress and anxiety seem to make that mild dizziness worse. Yep!", "Head movement sensitivity I started getting some weird dizziness Feb 2020 with my right ear feeling blocked, ringing in both ears and the dizziness where every surface I stand, lie or sit on is in a wavy spin. If I get too hot, then I start to see the walls move, but with my eyes closed it feels like everything is moving in a spiral. I took an Epley a year ago with no effect. Dix-Hallpike, Brandt-Daroff same. I had vestibular therapy but couldn\u2018t finish when covid shut everything down. Now the increase in pressure in my ear can be felt if I move my head. I notice if I spin once in a chair I feel the same pressure change. Today, I picked up something off the floor from my breakfast bar and grabbed a towel from the dryer and suddenly I felt like I was at the bottom of a hamster ball. Does BPPV take a while to develop? I am going back to vestibular therapy because my ENT cannot find anything wrong. Thanks for reading. It is so hard to say.  I struggle with bppv and also notice full ess in my affected ear which seems to come and go.  I clear my ears a few times a day and my dr prescribed flonase and singulair for it.  I do not know if it is related to my dizziness or not.  Seems Dr's have a hard time pinpointing what is going on when it comes to this. It can be exacerbated by other issues, is my understanding. \n\nMy first exam showed hearing loss in my right ear and my doctor thinks that in conjunction plus blocked sinuses caused my right eustachian (sp.) tube to become blocked over time, and that can cause an imbalance in pressure that might contribute to development of BPPV. But my vertigo attack was classic BPPV. He explained that maybe having other stuff going on has effected the pressurization between sinuses and ears, which has added up to make me prone to BPPV crystals breaking off and becoming misplaced. \n\nIt is interesting to me that our doctors arrive mostly at the same place but sometimes have different explanations for us; but it is also very individual. Has he checked your allergies with a test, examined your sinuses, and done a hearing test-? Mine said until I get those other things under control then I might continue to have issues; the hearing loss is the most complicated and I probably need a balloon procedure at some point to open up my right ear. I will add to it, that I have adjusted other lifestyle factors in an attempt to get the BOPV to resolve faster and I think they have helped (more water, vitamin D, increase outdoor time and exercise). I had BPPV for 5 months. Actually still have it verrrry slightly. Ringing in my left ear was prevalent.  Anxiety so bad my heart was pounding out of my chest just to go to the bathroom. Could not think of showering. Fast forward to month 7 now. I am almost healed. My therapy was self administered. Doctors had no answers. Forced myself to exercise every day. Started off 5 minutes at a time now up to 30 minutes with good sweat. Liquid vitamin B Complex, 200,00% B12 tri-formula liquid, 1,000 mg vitamin C every day and 100% magnesium pill daily. Done or all of this has almost cured me. Good luck to all\u2026 FYI - I thought I was stuck like that forever. Positive thinking is extremely important. Stay away from stress or learn to stay calm no matter what. I have not had sinus tests yet. My doctors (I have seen Urgent Care, GP, neurologist, and ENT) and only the Urgent Care doctor who identified ETD has a diagnosis so far, but it is not responding to decongestants, even for long periods of time, and I thought ETD lasted a few weeks and I am over a year and a half. I feel like I am in a diagnosis no-man\u2019s land. I am at the age where I heard BPPV can occur 42f, but the description of the condition does not quite fit. Yet. I agree, that over time, some of these things will be revealed. Thanks for sharing this :) I was told my issues were ETD and given Sudafed, Flonase and Nasacort for weeks, but nothing affected it yet. Interesting to know BPPV has other side things going on. I thought it was pure vertigo from misplaced crystals. Thanks for sharing this! This is great\u2014I do notice the world starts to flow fluid when I get stressed out so this is good to know. As my triggers are moving too quickly, getting overworked, I think all of this is related. Thanks for your success story! You might like Joey remenyi on YouTube.  She has some great videos.  Have you looked at the veda website too? I have seen the Veda site and really like it\u2014I will check out the YouTube. Thanks! :) I cannot stress enough how important exercise is. It actually helps you to stay calm even in stressful situations", "BPPV with ear infection? (Sorry for any formatting issues - on mobile)\n\n\nHas anyone experienced BPPV with a simultaneous inner ear infection? I was diagnosed with BPPV mid-December and was pretty well stuck in bed for two weeks, not being able to get up without the world spinning. The spinning has subsided for the most part unless I lay back too quickly or turn too quickly. But there is constant dizziness and underlying nausea, both to varying degrees of severity. \n\nI saw two doctors, the first just said vertigo and prescribed Serc. Three days of taking that and throwing up every time I took it and I went and saw another doctor who diagnosed the BPPV and told me not to bother taking the Serc anymore. I told both doctors that I also had pressure in my right ear and a jabbing pain every once in awhile. Neither one checked my ear. I had vertigo once, 9 years ago and it was due to an inner ear infection and was given an antibiotic that helped. \n\nOnce I was told about the BPPV I performed the Epley a couple times and spun out of control. I did it again last night and barely felt anything, and like I said the spinning has pretty well stopped anyway. But, this week along with the pressure and the intermittent jabbing in my ear, there is also been a intermittent crackling in it as well. \n\nI do have an appointment with my own GP this week but was wondering if it is possible that I had both BPPV and an inner infection at the same time? Has anyone experienced that? It is just been over a month of being miserable and I would like to be back to my full self.", "Did my last appointment today. 27F- Weak/heavy legs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHello! Did my last BPPV appointment today with my PT and I have no dizziness or eye twitches. I hope this means I am cured! AMAZING! The PT saw me three times and did the eply each time.  Now time to solve my leg problem! Congrats to you! Fingers crossed you get some answers to your leg problem! Thank you! Hopefully your doing well \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf89\ud83e\udd73", "Headaches after BPPV diagnosis Folks.  Does anyone else get headaches after bppv?   About 8 weeks I went to emergency room following sudden vertigo wit full nystagmus while rolling over in bed.  The nystagmus happened at ER again and then that night while doing a maneuver.  The ER doctor did not diagnose me.  Just gave me some antivert (which I could only tolerate for two days).  A few days later I went to ent and no nystagmus and then my primary doc a week after that and again no nystagmus.  \n\nI do my vestibular rehab religiously and I do not have balance issues.  My residual dizziness seems to be improving but I get crazy strong headaches almost constantly.   Is that normal? Mine came about with headache. I do not think it is abnormal. My ENT questioned migraine, but without a history of headaches at all he said basically- \u201ccould be\u201d, even though it is not considered typical for them to co-occur. \n\nIf you go on other forums or blogs, you will see other people complain of headache- so maybe studies have not kept up with anecdotal experience, but it does not seem all that uncommon to me.\n\nFor headaches to last that long, maybe it is also a little stress and anxiety related to not being out in the other side of the situation all the way\u2026? I realized the more I fought the idea of this being long term (denial), the more headaches I had; when I accepted feeling sick 24/7 many days, and like I was on a rocking boat and no longer being able to look up at all, then the headaches slowly went away. (Though I still have them intermittently.)", "When I am asked how long a vertigo attack is? I have had a few vertigo attacks over the last few weeks. What happens is for about a minute everything is spinning. It is awful and I am begging for it to stop. After about a minute, for the next 20 minutes or so, I feel kind of dizzy/woozy, where I can walk, but I feel a loss of balance, and if I tip my head I feel like I am going to tip over. But at this point I do not feel the \u201ceverything is spinning\u201d vertigo feeling. And for the rest  of the day or so I feel kind of uneasy, like I can do everyday activities but feel a little dizziness with it\n\nMy question is, when someone asks me how long a vertigo episode is, is it just the first minute where everything is spinning? Is the 20 minutes after where I feel unbalanced part of the \u201cepisode\u201d or is that just a residual feeling after the episode? Or is the episode considerd the whole day?", "Former BPPV sufferer. Vestibular issues? I used to have BPPV for 1.5 years straight before I got the Epley performed by a PT specialist 3 times and had residual dizziness that lasted about a month or so. \n\nFor the past week, I have been experiencing wooziness during the day time at random moments even when I am sitting still. This all started on a random morning when I felt spinning in bed. Since then, there is no more spinning but I still feel dizziness that comes and goes. \n\nI cannot tell if my BPPV is back and it is making me experience other things or if I am having vestibular issues like an inner ear infection or vestibular migraines. When I do the first step of the Epley, there is no spinning though.\n\nAs of the past few days, I keep getting headaches, neck stiffness and pain, my head feels heavy, my ears are popping sometimes when I swallow and it feels like liquid moving inside at times, I cannot breathe completely through my nose, and my head keeps subtly bobbing up and down when I tilt it downwards and let it hang. Some days feel more woozy than other days (today is raining and I feel more dizzy).\n\nAnyone experience something similar? Hmm do you get anxiety or anything? Sometimes anxiety can cause mild vertigo symproms and that is causing you too hyper analyze your body symptoms? If your sure its not anxiety then maybe pop by the doctor and they can determine if its a minor ear infection or something! Not OP, but ever since I had a vertigo episode back in September I developed pretty awful anxiety and now I definitely over-analyze everything that I am feeling and it creates a vicious cycle and I start to feel horrible.\n\nAny idea what the solutions to this are? Before September I never had any issue with anxiety in my life and now I feel awful all the time. I do not want to be on anti-anxiety meds for the rest of my life so I am hesitant to try that. 26M btw. Hmm i would really recommend square breathing ( you can google it) and try to get into the habit of doing that when you feel dizzy and see if that helps and also something I often do which seems weird is I tell myself \" okay worst case scenario i am getting a vertigo attack then I will just leave wherever I am and head home or too a safe place\" and most likely you are not having an attack anyways. but this can help ground you in a \"worst case scenario\". You wont ever be in a situation where you cant just stop or leave if you are feeling dizzy.  Not sure if this helps your anxiety at all but basically try slow breathing and remind yourself that worst case scenario you can leave or cancel what is happening in your life. op, sounds like you should make an appt with a ear nose and throat (ent) dr. most are experienced with bppv, the epley maneuver, and other vertigo issues. Dude go to the doctor and describe your symptoms. I am not sure this is BPPV. neck stiffness in particular with the other symptoms mentions could be something else. Those sounds like some of the symptoms I have been experiencing on and off for the last three months. Have you gone to a doctor or specialist yet?", "Anyone Else? Just to preface this post, I recently moved so I am in the process of obtaining a PCM. My first appointment is at the end of February. \n\nI work remotely and I am in Google Hangouts a lot during the week. Normally in meetings I spin slightly side to side in my office chair and nod my head up and down while I am listening to other people talk. For the last couple of months I have noticed that sometimes when I do this I get really bad vertigo. Once I get up and sit on the floor or couch in my office it stops. I made an appointment with a new PCM but as I mentioned they cannot see me for a few weeks.  Today it happened again and I decided just to go to Urgent Care. They said it was BPPV and gave me motion sickness medicine. I am trying to not spin/nod but I have done it so much it is a habit and I do it without realizing it. \n\nI guess my question is has anyone else had this happen? Should I just move to a regular chair or standing desk? The doctor I saw today did not give me much information at all. Will this ever stop?", "I could really use opinions A little more than 5 years ago, I turned quickly in bed and immediately got dizzy, and then after that I was having periodic dizzy spells, so I went to the doctor.  The doctor sent me for a cat scan, which was normal, and prescribed meclizine. I tried the med but it did not do anything for me, in fact I felt worse. I went back to the doctor, and he suggested I see an ENT.  I saw an ENT, who sent me for an MRI and several other tests. Everything came back fine. The tests occurred over a period of weeks, and by the time I had my final visit with him, the spells had gotten a lot better and were almost gone. To describe how it felt - especially at the beginning - I would say it felt like the inside of my head was spinning very briefly. The more it happened in a day, the more my head felt like it was stuffed with cotton and it was hard to concentrate. I did not get nauseous  or sick. By the time it started getting better, it felt more like the inside of my head was a tuning fork. No sound, but the best I can describe it is as if there was a silent vibration that only lasted a few seconds and got less and less as the episode ended. It is so hard to explain. I told my husband it was as if my head was a bell that was rung  - again no sound, no pain, just this weird sensation. Eventually it went away and I was fine.\n\nI had thought for sure I had BPPV, but after all was said and done the doctor was not completely sure, but said it was possible it was vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis, but my symptoms did not all fit with either one. He said to come back if it got worse or came back.\n\nSince then, it has come back a few times, but never lasting more than a couple of weeks and never getting as bad as that first time. It would feel more like the tail end of whatever I had before - just that weird \"tuning fork\" sensation rather than any real dizziness. I have not been back to the doctor because it went away so I did not worry about it.\n\nThen, it came back again a few months ago. Again I figured it would go away, but it has not. Some days I hardly have an episode, and then some days it happens more often. And then a few weeks ago, a new symptom started along with it. When I get the weird episode, as it goes away, I feel a weird sensation in my left lower leg. I have not been able to put into words what exactly it feels like. Almost like a flush? No pain, no cold or warmth, just this weird \"release\" kind of feeling? It is so hard to describe. Anyway, I know I have to see the doctor again, but I have been putting it off, which I know is SO not good. But I guess I am worried that is it is something bad. Which I know, I need to find out one way or the other. I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this?  Also, I am unsure as to whether to go back to the ENT or if a neurologist makes more sense.\n\nOne other thing to add - and I have NO idea if this is related. Over the last 2 years, my lower legs started bothering me - they had this weird sensation anytime I was not moving. I talked to both my cardiologist (I have an arrythmia) and my regular doctor about it, and both thought it was from not moving enough during the day (I sit a lot for my job). I started thinking maybe it was restless leg syndrome. About 3 months ago, I had my regular cardiology visit and bloodwork and the cardiologist   \n said I was very low in Vitamin D and prescribed a 3-month course of prescription vitamin D (you take one wafer once a week for 3 months). I only have one more wafer to go, and Just recently, I noticed that my legs are feeling better - not perfect, but not as weird. They still bother me when I fold them under myself, say while watching TV. It is like i cannot keep them in any one position for too long.\n\nAnyway, if you have read all this, thank you so much. I appreciate any opinions. Try checking some of the tips found through the two stickied posts at the top of this sub. Hydration and vitamin D are two that have seemed to have helped me! \ud83d\ude42 I get restless leg syndrome with meclizine", "Residual dizziness Been diagnosed with BPPV a month ago, after suffering through 2 months of dizziness. After several Epleys (aprox 6), my condition has definitely improved and I only have very subtle positional nystagmus (I had both my posterior and horizontal canal affected). However, I still experience dizziness and I am always very tired, as if just being awake is a struggle for my body. Anybody got any similar xp? Some journals argue that it takes a while for the brain to re-accommodate to normal stimuli, especially after having lived for so long with an otholitic irritative condition - hence the dizziness and exhaustion. I was diagnosed with Vestibular Neuritis a year ago, which has very similar symptoms to BPPV.  Your experience mirrors mine.   Get exhausted when out in the world and there is a constant deep background of dizziness and loss of balance.  Depression has been a symptom as well likely due to reduced human contact and general suffering this condition causes.  \n\nThey say after 2 years you will be \u201cmostly recovered\u201d which has a different meaning for everyone.  \n\nWish I had some advice or words of encouragement.  It is a pretty debilitating condition. Iv been going on 3 years this month and it seems to be getting worse for me :/ Did you do alot of VRT and did it help? VN or BPPV if I may ask? thanks, that is very useful - however, I thought the symptoms of VN are a bit harsher than BPPV? It is quite tough right now so was hoping I can get some sort of timeline on this. Another factor is just how long one struggled with the condition prior to getting treatment - the longer the time before treatment, the more difficult it is to recover, as apparently the brain gets used to processing wrong signals from the vestibular system. So maybe that is also a factor as well for you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn terms of the depression (and anxiety for me), it is unfortunately something that is very difficult to understand by outsiders - not that I wish it on anybody. What I found helps is just being in a park - nature is soothing + there are many visual stimuli. My doctors said I could elect for Vestibular Therepy but they indicated simply walking up and down supermarket aisles and being out and about, activating your balance system appears to be as effective.  \n\nHonestly, it is just time and accepting you have this pretty chronic injury. \n\nAnd yeah, Vestibular Neuritis is a damaged nerve that links the balance system and the brain so it is a permeant condition.  BPPV is a displacement if the crystals in the balance system that usually corrects itself over time.  I could not find a Vestibular Neuritis sub reddit so I am hanging out here.  ;) my doctor also recommended the same - also said I do these exercises x2 day. Ill just leave them here, maybe they help you as well. :) \n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n( I think VN but no one has been able to tell me I just had a bout of vertigo. Woke up with it at work 4 days ago. This has happened to me about once every 7 years. Past times I got rid of it with the epley. This time with the somersalt. \n\nI have had brain fog and weird wobble feeling in my eyes. Also been super tired in the evenings. I took a nap the other day and it was so hard to wake up, to open my eyes. Had the craziest dreams. Seems to be getting better day by day though.", "BPPV symptoms? I woke up a week ago with extreme dizziness, and almost fell over at a bday party whilst decorating. I have had migraine issues in the past, but this dizziness came on FULL force and it has been extremely debilitating, making me miss a week of work. I have tried several epley manuevers over the past week, nothing has worked. I have tried several motion sickness pills, nothing worked. I might make a visit to the hospital to rule out other things, but the only time I feel normal or not spinning is if I lay down very still and even then, I feel like I am floating. This has NEVER happened before, and my health anxiety is through the roof, seriously anything would help at this point. \n\nI passed out briefly last night and my balance has rapidly deteriorated from yesterday into this morning.\n\nWhat would your suggestions be? Does it sound like BPPV, or could it be something else? Any tips? BPPV generally means vertigo (room spinning around you) and often nausea as well. It should not last longer than a few minutes. Whenever I got mine, I would usually have to lay down and would fall asleep, waking up shaken but without symptoms. Later when I learned about Epley's, that would generally calm it down significantly. \n\nGiven the sudden onset, intensity and the fact that you passed out, I would definitely suggest you visit a doctor to rule out any serious issues.\n\nI totally get the anxiety part, I have been dealing with it too and it SUCKS.\n\nFrom my personal experience (long-term dizziness and near-fainting, not vertigo and neck and head aches), as a short-term solution maybe consider that this could be muscle-related (see ( for the muscles to pay attention to,   **SCM**, **suboccipital** and **scalene** being the most important ones). Try applying heat and see if that helps, or visit a massage or physio therapist who specializes in dizziness (a lot of phisios will claim they have the experience and skills but really do not).\n\nFingers crossed you feel better soon. Thank you so much. I am going to try a prescription strength medication and see if that helps, if not I will definitely go to the doctors. \n\nThank you for commenting, it helps so much. The anxiety that comes with random and new health issues is seriously heartbreaking for me. \n\nI honestly would not wish this on my worst enemy. :/ Thanks for the input and stay safe! 100% with you there, it is so anxiety-inducing. I got to the point where my panic reaction was almost always on. I am taking CBD oil and Ashwagandha for it now, and they definitely help.\n\nFeel free to reply or message me directly if you ever need support or want to talk, I am here.\n\nAnd try to be positive. It sucks while it is happening and it is the scariest thing I ever felt (and I was in the middle of a civil war for 3 years), I understand.  It gets better, fingers crossed this resolves for you super fast. Thank you, I hope you find answers definitively for it as well. I do not feel so alone now! Feeling alone, especially when all medical tests came back okay, is the worst. I was at the point of desperation where I think I would have preferred a bad diagnosis of some kind, it would at least tell me what the hell was causing this.\n\nIt is mind-bogging that after months of doctor and other therapy visits, especially massage and phisio therapists that specialize in dizziness and vestibular issues, not a single one suggested I try heating suboccipital and SCM muscles (which is what helped me), nor they tried to do anything about those.  So disappointing.\n\nIn the end, I stuck to my \"I will figure this shit out, eventually\" and I did find some stuff that helps (my heating of neck/head muscles suggestion), and that was such a relief, I still feel ecstatic about it.\n\nThis will not last forever (or long), stay positive and keep an eye on the anxiety. Yeah, it is frustrating to say the least. Everything leads back to BPPV, but every option that I have tried in terms of treatment is falling through, but I am afraid to go through extensive testing/screening to find nothing? I dunno, I am just taking it day by day and hoping that it does not get worse. Please do not hesitate to contact me as well, incase you need support. BPPV is very specific to the \u201cpositional\u201d part so usually it is related to moving your head a specific direction, because one of your otoliths is loose. It can be fixed with maneuvers to move the otoliths back and figuring out what (inflammation, illness, diet) caused it in the first place. \n\nIf it is not BPPV, it could be a number of other things related to brain or ear that need medical attention.  \n\nSome other OTC things to try are anti inflammatories, decongestants, antihistamines. Thank you for the reply! I took advice and visited the doctors and got scans etc., and it is in fact BPPV in my left ear. It is been about four weeks now, and I am happy to say I am 90% better. I was put on medication and slowly but surely it is going away. I wish that was the case for everyone. Worst thing I have ever experienced, but just lucky nothing else was wrong. Good to hear you are on the mend. If you are 90% does that mean no more vertigo? What move / canal did they use / treat? No more vertigo! And I tried all sorts so I could not really pinpoint what worked for sure. Lots of bed rest and medication. Happy to hear it sorted it self out! I am 3 weeks in since the attack, done a few moves which took the vertigo down from extreme to mild with hardly any nystagmus. Hopefully I am on the mend. \ud83d\udc4d", "BPPV and Sports.

I was hoping this was not the case that tennis could be a cause. I would hate to have to give it up. Maybe I can do Eppley as a preventive occasionally. Sometimes I get vertigo after hot yoga.  I am not sure if that is a positional thing or a dehydration thing. \n\nI also get it sometimes when I am sewing, oddly enough.

That went away quickly but weeks later felt lightheaded all the time. Went the ENT route, did all the tests. BPPV diagnosed by audiologist. My ENT felt is actually vestibular migraines. I could not work. Did vestibular therapy, etc. Took leave until for 7 months until I finally resigned. Symptoms finally went away in November, a year after they started. Went back to work in December. Things were fine, then I got covid at the beginning of April. Dealt with that for over a month. This past Thursday I woke up and knew immediately it was back. I stood up out of bed and the whole room went upside and I dropped to the ground. Now it is back all over again. I cannot do much but rest on my couch. This is going to go on forever.

Fingers crossed there is _some_ suggestion there you have not yet tried! Did you try to see about the epley Maneuver? On my own? No. Hoping to get into physical therapy tomorrow tho to begin the process. Thank you I hope it helps. I have had vertigo twice now and both times were treated successfully with epley. I know not everyone gets that lucky though. Once was with a PT and the second time it came back my husband just treated it at home watching a YouTube video. Yes. I went through six weeks of it last year. They saw me much later after the vertigo started so they were unable to determine where the loose crystals were. So, hopefully now I am in full vertigo mode, they can come up with a solution quickly. Thanks for your help I can relate. I did not go for help until 2 months after dealing with the vertigo. But it was super easy to treat the crystals for them. Good luck my friend! Thank you again. Yea it was like 6 or 7 months before I got into physical therapy. Covid put everything on hold and the waiting lists to get in anywhere we are months out. Not this time- I am getting the ball rolling on this ASAP! Good job :) you got this. You will not be dealing with it nearly as long now. the first case you described does not sound like BPPV to me...it sounds like you had chronic fatigue after a viral infection - which is common.....I also missed work for about 5 months because of this.....but with this most recent case, do you feel a spinning sensation when you look in a specific direction? or are you having more of a balance issue when you stand up and try to walk? I have had all 3 symptoms in the past, all after a viral infection. It is only when I tilt my head in certain directions. Looking down seems to be the worst. Yea when this first started, they called it labyrinthitis. Infection in the ear. This all started like I said after a bad flu or cold I had for a week. so it spins? it is prob bppv for sure this time. if you have not done it yet, I recommend you do the epley maneuver until you do not spin at all while doing the maneuver. faster you get rid of the spins, faster you are going to recover. I did the epley myself for 4 days and got rid of the spins fully in march...still going through residual dizziness that is slowly getting better. I recommend you not wait until you see a professional and get started on this right away. It is going to be unpleasant, but you do not want to sit and wait on this since the residuals you get afterwards is going to go away faster if you act with haste to get rid of bppv. good luck.\n\nhere is a great video, but try to do the maneuver with steeper angles:\n\n( Thank you- yes everything starts spinning with tilting my head up and down.

I will check out the links you sent, thanks again! Good for you. I am glad to hear you are having success with some of the strategies you have mentioned because these bouts (vertigo) can be quite debilitating when they last more than a few seconds. I think one of those links describes 4 different epley techniques", "vision disturbances? Posted the other day. On 3.5 months of residual symptoms. I notice slight improvement every 2-3 weeks. Very slow but sort of hopeful:/ Anyways- I am seeking other opinions/dr visits etc. I have gotten an MRI- eyes and heart checked- all good. I am still having visual disturbances. In the beginning it was weird focusing stuff- I could see but it was like my eyes were in portrait mode on the iPhone. It is been really hard to describe. Now I just see subtle spots- lines in my field of vision. In some lighting it is way more noticeable. Looking for similar visual stuff... Sometimes I see things in my peripheral (bugs/people/shadows) that are not really there. My PT said this was normal. But yeah you are definitely not the only one! Mine have improved over time.

I did go to the eye dr (not a neuro optometrist) and they said everything was fine but maybe I will check a neurologist optometrist out. I already have apts set up w a ent neuro and a neuro that specializes in vestibular migraines. If I recall correctly, it was around the same time as my balance / dizzy issues started (around 6 years ago) when I turned to my wife and said, \u201cwhen you close your eyes, is it pitch black? Or... do you see static noise of black and grey sparkling??\u201d. Her response \u201cwhat are you talking about!!!??\u201d That sent me on a quest of seeing lots of doctors all of which came back with the same response, \u201ceverything is fine\u201d. \ud83d\ude14\n\nFast forward to today where I have significantly less anxiety as I have been learning (and continue to do so) to deal with these ailments and I find the visual snow to be less prominent or perhaps I do not notice or care as much about it. I also think that when my anxiety is at full swing, my body becomes hyper sensitive and I just notice everything which sets me off even more making the visual snow worse. \n\nSo while I have done what everyone else has done ie seen lots of doctors, had lots of tests, had everything come back \u201cnormal\u201d, perhaps this blanket term of \u201canxiety\u201d plays a big part to the associated physical and mental state that just heightens everything to feel \u201cnot right\u201d.\n\nSounds to me you are doing all the right things to cross everything off, but there will come a time where you have to accept this as the \u201cnew normal\u201d, kind of like COVID and for me, once I had (which has taken years \u2639\ufe0f) I have felt much better mentally which has translated to a happier home for my wife and children.", "Is it BPPV? In Summer 2018 I started having ear clicking until today and in October 2020 I started having 24/7, constant dizziness, until today. Does anyone here that has BBPV have constant dizziness (mostly located in my left temple)? I was diagnosed with bppv, and i have constant dizziness or at best a constant discomfort Is the dizziness general or specific? Like, is it located in any part of the head, like mine, located in my left side of head (left temple)? And just to add, idk if you also do, but I also have TMJ-symptoms (jaw-locks, jaw-crushing sounds etc), which, together with the bppv, might be the cause of constant dizziness. The definition of BPPV is a spinning dizziness that is provoke by a change in head position. At rest, there should be no true spinning dizziness, at worst a mild lightheaded or woozy sensation when not moving can be seen in acute attacks. Having chronic dizziness that is constant is not consistent with BPPV. Also, not sure how your left temple can feel dizzy... do you mean more painful like a headache or migraine? I woke up a week ago today &amp; my whole world was out of control nonstop spinning. I could not sit, stand, walk, or even crawl. I have seen my GP twice &amp; just had meds thrown at me. I had a frontal lobe TBI (traumatic brain injury) 12 years ago so I am terrified I have had a stroke (I am only 42 yrs old). Now I am waiting for my stupid insurance to approve an MRI which is ridiculous. If it WAS a stroke or a neurological event, they are seriously hindering an treatment/outcome that could be life changing. Add on to all of this, I already have complex PTSD from a long term serious illness I am just getting over. I went to a remedial massage therapist yesterday who specializes in lymphatic draining &amp; the vagus nerve. The spinning has gotten a little better &amp; it is more of a sway but my eyes will not focus. I cannot watch tv or even read &amp; I feel like I am about to have a complete nervous breakdown (have already had a few minor ones this past week). If I have any luck with the massage therapy, I will come back &amp; let you know! It is just nice (??? Totally the wrong word but my brain is mush) to find others going through something similar. This is the worst &amp; scariest thing I have ever experienced in my whole life\u2026&amp; I have been through some doozies. Hope you find answers soon! In BPPV, the sensation of vertigo usually lasts for one minute or less, although it is possible to feel lightheaded in the aftermath of the actual room-spinning vertigo. vertigo does not occur while a person is stationary; for example, sitting at one\u2019s desk. The disorder is transient and episodic.", "2nd time around...long recovery? TL;DR- Diagnosed with BPPV, 3 months later...still have some \"symptoms\". Common?\n\nSo, I had a spell back in 2014. It went completely undiagnosed. Went thru blood test, vitamin therapy and MRIs. After the MRI came back clear, the symptoms went away. From start to finish...about 3 months. Horrible. \n\nFast forward to Jan of this year. Vertigo hit bad, went to ENT, diagnosed with BPPV. After some antiinflammatories w/ steroids, the vert went away but was left feeling, for lack of a better term, light headed and disconnected. Doc said it takes a while for nerves to reconnect. Well, I am on the three month mark and still feel \"light headed\". Some days are ok, some feel unbearable, like I am on the verge of vertigo. No rhyme or reason. Not dizzy, just..light headed, feel off balance, feel 'disconnected', comes in waves, often gets worse as I walk into a store or building...hard to describe. Starting to severely depress me. Anyone else have the same thing? It went away the first time, but had no treatments or no diagnosis. I can function, but hard to tell someone when a spell hits you, when you look normal. Do I give it some more time, or start tossing money out the window(at docs) again???...no insurance.\nAny advice or anecdotes?  Forgot to mention...did the Dramamine (or script based kind)...did nothing. 44, male..no prior health issues...Last ENT told me not to do any of the home exercises...in fact, when I did, it set off vert big time.  I feel you buddy. Back in I think 2014 I went through a similar thing, took ages to diagnose and me being a hypochondriac did not help things either. I did the MRI, blood tests and everything you did aside from ENT as it was just super expensive.\n\nIt was eventually narrowed down to labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis and took ages to go away with vertigo coming and going randomly for the next few months. \n\nJust yesterday, 4 years on I have got the exact same symptoms again. It is so hard because there is not any real visible outward display to show you are unwell, so nobody tends to pay it much attention. I am only 31 too so people are like pfftt you are young you should be healthy. \n\nMy advice is to go back to the doctor or even see another doctor for a second opinion, you only lose your own time and or money. But from my own personal research it can take a long time for these things to clear and can return as exactly as happened to you and possibly myself. I saw one case notes in which a lady had the above mentioned labyrinthitis and experienced symptoms for 3-4 years on and off before finally coming to a stop.\n\nAnyways just my anecdotal experience, hang in there man. Most people on here will not be doctors and will just provide you with anecdotal experiences or research they have done like myself. There is a reason why doctors spend so much time studying medicine before becoming doctors, it is so they can look past all the red herrings to get to the root cause.\n\nTry to stay calm, eat well, rest when you can and see what the doctors do and say.  as /u/Anna-Nicole-Smith said mostly ...\n\nI had my first vertigo in 2016 and it hit bad ... 2-4 hours of cont. image rotation and dizziness . Then I felt for almost a year light headed. I cannot say for sure when it stopped or when it got better (sometimes i still feel it). I get vertigos from time to time, they usually last 15 sec or less. I got diag from 3 specialist each of them did not knew exactly what it was (since i have a non functional ear from birth). Two of them said is BPPV (but the exercises never worked) and the last one said it might be a light for of Menier or caused from my spine. \n\nFor your lightheadedness:\n1) are you taking beta blockers? - usually i felt really strange when taking this. my lightheadedness was worse. My last doctor told me to take beta blockers only if the vertigo hits bad again. if i have this small episode i should try to avoid them. \n2) is this feeling always or only when you are more stressed out? No beta-blockers. Not quite sure what that is actually. Stress does not help, but it can come on just walking into a store. Certainly worse when stress is building up. The first round, as I said, went undiagnosed. From friends in the medical field that did digging around thought it may be Vestibular Neuritis. Only because it all kind of made sense. Again, that lasted about 3 months. That was definitely the dizzy feeling...first 2 weeks were horrible. Then it shifted to just dizzy with general walking, etc. Eventually, it just kind of went away. The last time and this time, both hit me as I was literally walking down the street. I went to ENT right away this time... consensus was BPPV. After a cycle of antiinflammatories with steroids (6 days), the dizziness went away after 2 weeks...but this lingering is what is driving me nuts. I felt the \"tingle\" of vertigo come on a few weeks back as I was sitting in a class tutoring. But that has just turned into a constant light headed feeling. Mornings seem ok. Worse when I enter work. I will have days (few), that nothing comes on for 5-6 hours, then it hits. ...sorry, I know I am just repeating myself. But as you may know, it is hard to talk with others when they just think you look normal and I am not a complainer. So I suck it up and do not mention to anyone, though it may be hitting me as I am taking to them. I guess it is more about knowing anything. If someone said, you will be this way for 6 more months, then I accept. But the idea that this could linger indefinitely stresses me. I used to like theme parks and roller coasters...I live in Florida. Now, the thought of that makes me ill.  After the first time I stayed away from them for a year, friends got upset. Went back about 2 years ago and was cool. Now...no effing way. I told my doc that I would purposely take drugs for this feeling in my 20's...now I would go bankrupt to make it stop for good.  Did they confirm Vestibular Neuritis with you or just a shot in the dark? I did not end up seeing a neurologist or a ent, but as I said I opted out of as symptoms passed on their own after a few weeks. So yes after seeing multiple doctors for second opinions it was generally decided by most to be bppv (nystigma) was detected or some form of neuritis.\n\nThe symptoms essentially became less and less over time. What is interesting about this latest bout is that I have recently taken up pretty intense exercise and it came on quite strong after a session. \n\nBut even now since it started Sunday night, the symptoms feel far less severe then originally started on the recent Sunday. Thanks a ton for the input! No worries! I think the worst thing you can do is worry excessively and try and keep your mind off of it. Do not Google things because that can lead to even more worry. Like I said let a doctor give you a diagnosis. \n\nI think stress may have had a part the first time I got this and I have got a fair bit of stress in my life currently funnily enough. The first time my wife was about to have a baby and I was having a really hard time at work.\n\nThis time no baby, but we are looking to move homes and are having a tough time with my mother in law who is slowly dying with cancer. Life's hard at the moment so I think it may be contributing?\n\nAlso while it has not gone completely, it is following the same pattern as last time. Severe spinning when looking at certain directions which has now died down and just a general feeling of queasiness and a little lightheadedness. I am expecting this to last a few weeks if it follows the same as last time.\n\nAlso as per what /u/dreadshade wrote, I was originally prescribed stemetil and cerc. One for nauseousness and the other for the whole tilt-a-whirl feeling. I too found that cerc made things worse. The stemetil helped with the kind of light feeling of nauseousness I had. \n\nAnyways I hope this helps in some way. Hang in there man!  Sorry to hear through what you are going. It seams to be worse than i have. And i understand how you feel. Most of the people are saying if it is not from your brain then you are safe. I might be safe but if the dizziness hits while i climb some stairs i am not that safe anymore ... I would not suggest to stop completely trying to find an answer to your problem, but try not to stress out too much not having one. For everyone is different and it might have different stimuli. Maybe try a change in your diet with less salt, try more relaxing (even though i know is hard).\nRegarding ENT, if you will still want to go to another one, try to find a specialist in Vertigo. Not all of them are very accustomed with all types of vertigo, or not all of them have the special equipment to identify your dizziness (i am saying this, though i do not know if the doctor you went had all the expertise and equipment. By this i mean special glasses for nistgamus or special machine that calculates your equilibrium )\n\nOther than that, be safe and i hope it will pass from its own. Try to enjoy life with all the problems that comes with it since all of them are experiences unique in their own way.  So true Dreadshade. That safety factor comes into mind quite a bit. Especially when I am too far from home to walk back. \n\nI have an appointment with my ENT on Friday. He seems smart enough to know when I am just throwing money away and has been generous since I am paying cash. He suggested that if it becomes a balance issue, he would refer me to a specialist. The last time I saw him was over a month ago and suggested it was the nerve thing. But we did not discuss this new constant light headed feature. Haha. Perhaps he may have some new words, theories, or a different referral. \n\nI appreciate the time you have taken (and everyone else) to share. This is the first time I have used the interwebs for any real issues than tech advice. The honesty and candor is refreshing. Thanks!", "Checking if I have actual BPPV Hello, I was looking around for my symptoms online to see what I have (I know, not the most accurate thing in the world), when I came to this subreddit. I have been reading some of the posts to see if I had similar symptoms, but could not find any that matched. So I am wondering if anyone who had confirmed BPPV had similar symptoms.\n\nMy symptoms:  I only feel vertigo when looking or turning my head left. And lasts for less than a second. Oddly, turning me head/eyes to the right does not do anything, only if I turn left. Lying down does not give me vertigo\n\nIt started yesterday when I noticed it during work, when turning around corners would give me the feeling as if I were flinching. \n\nWhen I turn my head left, the vertigo/flinching feeling is there until I stop. If I look far left with my eyes, the vertigo feeling stays until I look straight again.\n\nIs this something that all people with BPPV experience or is it something else?\n\nNot looking for doctors (tho that would be awesome), just looking to compare. Thanks! Some parts sound like BPPV, for example  \"turning my head left\" causes vertigo. This sounds like BPPV. But I am not sure how looking left would trigger it. Also, lasts for less than a second? That sounds quite unusual. Yeah, when I tried to google it, nothing showed. Just having the word Dizzy or Viertigo would show only BPPV related things, so I thought I would ask around, thanks This article might help!\n\n(", "BPPV or something else? Hey guys. I have had an upper viral infection lately just like a common cold but then it started to affect my ears. I went to the doctor and she said it was the start of an ear infection but she told me to continue decongestants before going to antibiotic. I went back a week later because ear was hurting but the doc said eardrum looked fine but had wax. I keep getting these spells that last only for a second or so that seems like vertigo because it feels like everything is spinning. I think it is from fluid/drainage but I have researched and I am not sure. Wanted to get feedback from people that have this. I have gotten 3 spells of it today and it only lasts for a couple of seconds.", "How long after an epley maneuver can I sleep on the affected side again? I have right ear BPPV. I did the Epley twice now  and have not felt spinning ever since the second maneuver 4 days ago. However I have been sleeping on my back and left side. \n\nI find sleeping on my back and left extremely uncomfortable because I am a right side sleeper. I have been having residual dizziness when walking around ever since doing the maneuvers, but hopefully it will go away soon. \n\nI want to sleep on my right side again but do not want to risk the crystals moving yet again. How long until I can stop sleeping so uncomfortably? My doctor always recommended 7-10, just to be on the safe side. I have my first ever enr dr. appt later this month im terrified of the epley maneuver did ur doc give u the option to not do it? Do you recommend it? She did not ask if I wanted to or not; she just had me try to do it. The epley maneuver is not that bad; it is pretty easy to perform with the help of your doctor. What is more irritating is the residual dizziness you could possibly get after doing it though. I have been having dizziness walking around, making turns, and sometimes even just sitting for the past week already. \n\nMy vertigo also came back a week after my doctor performed the epley maneuver on me so I had to try it again myself at home. Good luck! Did you start sleeping on the affected side again after 7-10 days? Did the vertigo ever reoccur? \n\nI cannot tell if my vertigo is even completely gone since I have been avoiding sleeping on my right and have not been making any movements to trigger it. I do have dizziness though, probably as a side effect of the epley Start sleeping on it after 7-10 days, yes. I needed multiple epleys but now positional vertigo is gone. \n\nI strongly urge you to go to a balance centre and only attempt the epley at home if your doc told you to - the only way to know whether you still have loose crystals is to get a videonystagmography, where they track your nystagmus with special googles. How did you know that you needed multiple epleys and that it was not just residual dizziness you were experiencing as a side effect? \n\nWhere can I get a videonystagmography? Is that something I can request from my physician? I needed more epleys because the doctor saw that I still had nystagmus on the VGN - I dont know where you re based, it will most likely be the case that you need to go to a special vestibular centre. Not all ENTs do it", "My recipe for BPPV If I want to get an attack here is all I need to do. \n\nWake up. Do not drink any water. Have breakfast and coffee with no water either. \n\nGo to the gym. Sweat a lot. Have only 32 oz of water while at the gym. \n\nPrepare and eat lunch. Skip water. \n\nAfter lunch notice that I am tired and have an extra coffee. That tasted good. Have a second extra coffee. Be sure not to drink any water. \n\nAt about 2pm get REALLY REALLY DIZZY. perform Epley maneuver (I work from home so I can do this in the middle of the day). \n\nRealize that you had not had any water. Curse BPPV and the horse it rode in on. \n\nTake anti nausea medicine and drink a gallon of water. BPPV subsides. \n\nHappens literally every time I space out on water after a workout and have an extra coffee. Like clock work. Nice! I have switched to decaf and only one cup before heading to the gym, but sure enough, water neglect is a great recipe for disaster! Yes! I am seeing a connection between my BBPV and water too, I think- as in hydration being a problem. Good, simple post! Just came to say, me too. Recently took a long flight where I fell behind on water and predictably had an episode the next morning. interesting regarding the correlation with having enough water. i will definitely keep this in mind after my strenuous cycling activities. i always try to make sure i drink plenty of fluids but... I have only had it a few times, but always in the morning after going to bed dehydrated.\n\nEither way, staying hydrated seems to be the key!  I have now made a habit of drinking lots of water throughout the day (really cemented that one during the PNW heat spike) and keeping a glass on my nightstand.\n\nI have also realized that though I like the taste of coffee, I only need one cup in the morning.  If I have a second in the afternoon, now it is decaf. I have had BPPV for decades. Dehydration sets it off - so does insufficient salt! If I do not remember to put salt on food a couple of times a week, it can trigger a BPPV bout.\n\nMy mom raised me on a salt-free diet as she was on one (her doc was a bit weird), so I never miss the taste of it. And I hardly ever get a salt-filled drive through burger or sandwich, or drink salty, sugary Coca-Colas or similar. Hence, my deficiency. Good tip on the salt. Electrolytes are important. I think last night I did not feel better until I had done the Epley Maneuver, had plenty of water, and also taken my vitamins and calcium supplement. Wonder if I was super short on electrolytes of all kinds.", "How do I keep living with thing? How can I continue being a parent\nHow can I work\nExercise\nAnything Not offering medical advice, not a doctor\u2026 just from my short time living with BPPV:\n\nIf you have access to an ENT or vestibular therapist (often a PT with specialized experience and/or certification), that could help you get back on your feet a little bit; some people also look up You Tube videos of maneuvers.\n\nOther than that, just lots of dietary and/or behavioral changes. And it is trial and error; what works for you might not for another person, but there are some things that many people DO find that helps (many of us have found things like cutting back caffeine, sleeping with head propped under two pillows instead of one are helpful\u2026 but these will be up to you to determine). It is tough. My last episode lasted about two months, with about 8 months of gross, yucky residual dizziness.  I was going to a vestibular therapist weekly during my active BPPV.  She was amazing and so helpful. I am one of the rare ones that was able to keep working and doing all my regular hobbies/life.  But I was SO sick. Yet - a seemingly healthy person cannot possibly be so sick feeling, so I had to just keep on with life.  It is hard. It is exhausting. I was a walking zombie - but I did not miss a beat.  I was training for a running trail race at the time. My therapist could not even believe I could keep running. I learned how to keep my head VERY still throughout my daily activities. But that backfired when it THEN caused 'gaze instability.'  So I had this secondary dizziness going on. I was a mess. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. If you CAN find a good dizzy therapist, it will be super helpful! Get properly diagnosed. Get properly treated. And get exercises that are tuned into your specific dizzy problems. I found keeping busy helped keep the anxiety away. Best wishes to you! Know that you will get better! A lot of us have felt the same and as u/Colmanson1 has pointed out you have to push through while getting help from an experienced PT that specialises in balance disorders. \n\nThere is a guide that was written a while back by u/oceanblueberries that I have bookmarked that I would highly recommend you read as it will have a lot of the answers you may be looking for. \n\n\n\nBest of luck and know that your not alone but there is absolute light at the end of the tunnel! How long have you had it? I had it and it only lasted a week after I did the manoeuvre myself a few times. Thanks for the shout-out, slash5k1!\n\nYes, I think a lot of people hope that BPPV will just go away on its own, but it will not until the crystals are moved out of the canals. The maneuvers in the guide linked above may suck in the short-term--along with any residual dizziness--but relief will come slowly once the crystals are removed.\n\nGood luck, u/Qtredit! I think most people in this sub have been where you are. If I was speaking to myself within the first week after going to the ER for vertigo. Go to a vestibular therapist immediately. Someone who knows how to diagnose your nystagmus. My first visit she confirmed that my right ear was clear, I fixed it on my own in the middle of the night. I thought I was all done. She checked my left and noticed a little movement in my eye and reset crystals in my left ear that I did not know existed. I was in shock. Resetting the crystals in my left ear made me feel temporarily worse for about 5 hours of dizziness with vomiting. But she fixed me in the first visit. You are not alone it gets better, it just takes a little time. But you can take the fast track by getting the correct assistance immediately. My episode was in February it lasted 5 weeks then in the next month or two my balance returned to what it was. I am doing yoga, playing with my kid, golfing, etc. all of these were unimaginable in February. Do not give up.  \n\n1.).  See a good ENT that gives you confidence.  It took me three tries before I found one.  \n\n2).  See a good vestibular therapist - any doctor can prescribe you one.  Find one that gives you daily homework.  \n\n3.). Accupuncture helped me a lot.  \n\n4).  So did massage therapy.  We get tense with bppv. \n\n5).  My ENT said I should take magnesium and vitamin b6.   Not sure why.  \n\n6) eat clean and healthy. \n\n7.). Keep moving and excercising.", "Sudden extreme dizziness and blurry vision. Is this vertigo? I am 33 M. In otherwise good health, very active with triathlon, gym and other things. Not on any medications.\n\nBut... 2 weeks ago I was lying on the couch and experienced sudden extreme dizziness. I thought I may be having a stroke because I almost fell over when I tried to stand up off the couch. Felt weak and had a tingling in my neck and face. I was very frightened. \n\nShortly after, I phoned a public health number, spoke to a nurse, and at their advice went to the ER. Saw a doctor, said my vitals were fine and that it was not a stroke or TIA, maybe just a transient migraine. He said if it happens again to see my family doctor and get checked out. \n\nSince that episode I have almost slipped into the same feeling a couple times. Usually just when laying on the couch, not from sudden movement. It is making me anxious. So I saw my doctor, had blood tested and results came back normal. \n\nNo ringing in my ears. No headache or excessive pressure. No aura. It is almost like i felt a tightness behind my eyes. When I explained my symptoms initially I said it felt as if I involuntarily went cross-eyed. I had difficulty focusing for 5 minutes or so, but no pupil dilation, no double vision. No cross-eyes. \n\nThe episode lasted 2 minutes at its peak, then my vision felt off for another 2-4 minutes, then I felt lightheaded and anxious. A feeling of being high or hungover, even the next day. \n\nDoes this sound familiar? Thank you in advance. This does not sound like BPPV which is typically brought about by a movement of the head such as turning over in bed from one side to the other. You can determine if it is BPPV by performing the Dix-Hallpike (google it) which also happens to be the first step in the Epley maneuver which is a treatment for BPPV. \n\nI have had three bouts of BPPV over four years. All three were sudden onset and were triggered by turning over in bed in the morning. The dizziness is extreme and accompanied by nystagmus (rapid eye movements). Thankfully the Epley resolved it for me all three times. Exactly my thought too. It may be \"Vertigo\". Probably is. But it does not sound like BPPV Vertigo, because there is no head movement trigger. \n\nI do not know what kind of doctor you are seeing, but you probably want to go a \"balance center\" or a doctor who specializes in vestibular disorders. Google \"Balance Center\" and the name of your closest metropolitan area, for example: Balance centers in Chicago Hi love, i agree with previous posters that this does not sound like BPPV. There are many causes for vertigo and dizziness. I would get into a ENT and check for any vestibular issues first. Hope you feel better soon! Sounds like it could be vestibular migraine (not associated with headaches despite the name) Vertigo is the sensation of spinning / moving. \nSounds like your doctor already pointed out the culprit - likely migraine. Get ears checked out at Ears and throat hospital. It can be caused by Middle ear Blurry vision is not typical for BPPV, it definitely sounds like a migraine or something else.", "Does this sound normal for BPPV? Hi everyone:) \nI am 23 years old and apparently I am suffering from BPPV. In May of this year I woke up and the whole room was spinning and when I got up to go to the bathroom it felt like the room was spinning and tilted to the right, luckily I did not fall but I nearly did. I thought it might be because of stress so I slept in the next day and I felt better although I felt a bit off balance when walking etc... \n\nFast forward to the beginning of October, same thing happened again, I.e I woke up at night and the room was spinning. Felt alright the following day. A week later same thing again and it has lasted now for like 5 weeks. Symptoms have waxed and waned but the worst episode was 2 weekends ago where I nearly threw up because of the vertigo and nausea. I could barely move my head in bed without starting the vertigo. Also have a heavy feeling in my head as if it will roll off with the slightest of movements. Other than this I feel of balance while walking and sometimes it feels like the ground is moving and I sometimes feel like my head is being pushed or pulled from behind. \n\nI have been to my doctor and he said that it sounds exactly like BPPV and has referred me to an ENT but I have had to wait like 2 weeks and seems like I will have to wait longer. I have had neurological tests (Testing my reflexes etc) and several blood tests done a few months ago for another issue so my doctor did not test them now. I am starting to feel anxious as it is very uncomfortable and its been like 5 weeks now and I am scared that it might be something more serious. And I also think my anxiety is making it worse...  \n\nIs it normal for BPPV to last for several weeks and wax and wane? It could be BPPV, but it sounds a bit unusual. Please make sure that your ENT is a specialist in vestibular diseases. Not all ENTs are experienced with BPPV and you could be wasting your time. It might be better to find a real specialist or to visit a local balance center. Ok thank you :) my doctor said it is most likely BPPV because I get dizzy from moving my head. I did not bring up all my symptoms in the text above, I do get dizzy when bending forward, to the sides and when tipping my head back too. And In bed I am dizzy for like 30 seconds or so when I roll over in bed, only time I feel ok is when lying on my back. Hopefully the ENT is specialised in BPPV! Sounds similar to me but I have had a neck problem that case with mine as well...still do not know if what I had was bppv or a neck problem...\n\nI woke up with vertigo one morning and for about a month I would continue to get it when I tried to lay down, Or lay on either of my sides. I would also get it when I moved my head from looking straight up to down (chin to chest).\n\nI have gone to ENT\u2019s, Physical Therapists, Chiropractors, and primary care doctors and they all say it is BPPV but others say it is a neck issue (Myofascial pain syndrome, Cervical Vertigo, etc)... \n\nFor the past month I have not gotten the vertigo but also have not laid flat on my back or on my sides. I sleep slightly elevated on my back. The constant dizziness has subsided a lot but I still have the worst neck stiffness and pain. I actually have knots on the base of my skull right on my occipital nerve. Ever since the beginning I would get electric shocking pain from my neck down to my back. This has also subsided this month since I have been taking muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatories but still have the feeling that the vertigo is about to happen....but it does not. It is random, like when I move my head fast. Which I cannot do....my neck muscles on the left side are so tight I cannot turn to the left without pain and dizziness.\n\nI was treated for BPPV by the Pts and I would feel slight relief of the vertigo but it never went away. The constant headache and dizzy/off feeling stayed constant for about 6 weeks.\n\nI am going to a neurosurgeon in a few weeks for an MRI to see what is going on in there. \n\nSorry for the long text and not being able to give you an answer, but I know it sucks and I hope you get better soon! Have you seen a PT yet? Hey! So sorry to hear that you are suffering from this and that you also do not know 100% what is going in... it is so frustrating. But it is good that you have got a MRI appointment booked :) \n\nRight now I get some vertigo when I lie in bed on my right side and when I turn over as well. I just feel weird and off balance, it is a very peculiar feeling so it is difficult to describe, it feels as if my balance is moving slower than my actual movements, if that makes any sense??\n\nI have not been to a PT yet, I have another appointment at my doctor tomorrow as I feel like they need to do a physical/neurological exam because it makes me quite anxious knowing that there is a risk (probably very small, but still) that it could be some horrific neurological disease. I am waiting for the ENT to contact me regarding my appointment which probably will be I December some time... I live in Sweden and by law we have the right to see a specialist within 90 days after being referred, and I was referred 2 weeks ago so I guess I will just have to wait. \n\nTake care :) Yes, I am finally feeling normal. 2 months it took to feel better lol but I 100% understand that feeling. It is a \u201ckind of\u201d drunk...but not really feeling...maybe a slight disoriented feeling. \n\nI am sorry you are still getting the vertigo, mine stopped about a few weeks ago but I know I can still trigger it I lay on my sides and roll over. Lol I have just trained myself to sleep on my back now. ..probably a good thing bc they say it keeps the wrinkles away lol ;)\n\nBut for me, that weird feeling lasted about...6-7 ish weeks. I just continued to do my daily activities. Going to the store was the worse bc it made that \u201coff\u201d feeling so much more noticeable for me but I just kept doing it and going to pt. it helped make that feeling go away. I am sure over time it just kind of went away and my brain adjusted to the signals lol. \n\nI know the feels about waiting, I had to wait for my husband to get insurance through his work so I am only now able to afford the MRI. \n\nGood luck at your appointment tomorrow and I hope you get to feeling normal soon! \u2764\ufe0f It is encouraging to hear that it is gotten better for you. Hopefully I will get better soon. I will take your advice and try to sleep on my back :D thank you\u2764\ufe0f It sounds exactly like my first bout with my BPPV. It is not to go away by itself so you need to get to someone who specializes in this to determine which ear is affected (mine is both) and start treating you for it.  Meclizine will help the symptoms but will not fix the problem.  Good luck. I hope you start feeling better.  I know it is miserable. It definitely sounds like BPPV to me. I have had it twice and both times performed the Epley maneuver with my husband\u2019s help. It is not an easy thing to do because it makes you feel very nauseous but it does work if you are lucky and get it right. I will be interested to hear what the doctor suggests for you. Good luck. Thank you for your replies guys, I have been feeling so hopeless lately...\n\nSo you also get that unsteady feeling whilst walking/standing where it would feel like the ground was moving or like you would kind of drop for a split second as if you were in an elevator??\n\nI have tried the different manoeuvres at home, not sure if they actually have helped and I am not sure which canal is affected so as you said I have to go and get help from a professional. \n\nI do not seem to get any vertigo, only a bit,   anymore but i still feel quite odd, I have brain fog and it is hard to describe but moving around in bed feels weird because it feels like my bed is slightly tilted and floating around :( It is really hard having this as I feel like it affects my entire body and not only when I am lying down. Walking in shopping malls etc it feels like the ground is moving and it is quite scary. Thank you and I will let you guys know what my doctor said :) Yes that is often how I feel when it is very active.  Sometimes the room or just the floor is bouncing.  It makes my vision kind of blurry and it is a lot like walking on a boat. I often tell my Physical therapist I feel like I am \u201clisting\u201d to one side.  I feel like the room is kind of tilted.  It is important you find out which ear is affected before you try to treat it.  Good luck!", "Dizziness in Public Places? I went out to the mall today and everything was fine the first few minutes, but as I kept walking and browsing, and looking around I began to feel super dizzy. My legs became shaky, almost like jell-o. I am sure I looked okay on the outside because I glared at myself through a mirror. Just drove back home and it is dark outside now, my legs still felt shaky at my driveway, but I feel better now. \n\nHas this happened to any of you? \n\nI am a homebody and I do not go out often, and when I do, I tend to go when I know there is not a lot of people out. Was this only an anxiety attack? My heart rate does increase when I feel dizzy after all\u2026\n\nI have not been sleeping well and I have noticed this causes dizziness to flare, and my T to increase in volume.\n\nThanks for your input!", "do you really can do epley manuver daily ?  3 days ago the first day I felt vertigo. at 1 am while sleeping suddenly like a nightmare everything spinning 360 degrees. I even panicked and went straight to the bathroom and threw up. while feeling a 360 degree rotation, it lasts for 5-10 minutes minutes. I crawled on the floor and called my parents. Finally they come to see me realized I had vertigo and advised me not to change positions first. and after not moving head positions for few minutess or hour  I started browsing about vertigo and i read many suggested do Epley maneuver. Then I made up my mind to recover and I started trying the Epley maneuver.  when the movement saw the left side of 45 degrees while lying down, I was already feeling extraordinary vertigo. I had to still keep position until symptoms go away. Then I turn my head to the right and turn around again. then in my opinion this is the most scariest phase when facing down it feels like it rotates 360 degrees but also feels like jumping from a high place while 360 \u200b\u200bdegrees everything rotates. and then sit still with the same effect . indeed after 30-60 minutes I feel good and just a little dizzy. but does this epley have to be done every day and continuously? because to be honest I have only done it twice I have been suffering a lot. i cannot imagine someone said do this epley everyday for few month :(  \nsorry if my english not good . hope you understand. Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* So sorry to hear you are going through this. Everyone here know exactly what it is like and how awful it is.\n\n&gt; does this epley have to be done every day and continuously?\n\nNo. The key is figuring out what ear and canal are affected, and do the appropriate Epley. It might not \"stick\" the first time, and you might have to repeat it some over the next few days/weeks, but this is not a continuous thing.\n\nI recommend you find a Physical Therapist that deals with vestibular/balance issues. They may do a Dix-Hallpike to confirm the BPPV diagnosis and find the offending area, may perform the Epley, but will certainly give you some advice.\n\nGood luck. Yes.  Go see an ENT right of way and then vestibular therapist.  If you cannot get into ENT right away tell your primary doc and get to vestibular therapist. (FYI - vestibular therapists are physical therapists that are trained on balance and dizziness issues)\n\nAs far as the Epley.  My doc said it is ok to do them a few times a day but to wait at least 15 minutes between.  However, if you do not have nystagmus (eye fluttering that makes room spin) it is not doing you any good.  He also said it cannot hurt you either. It cannot \u201churt\u201d you, but performing the Epley with out training may result in canal conversion (crystals moving from one tube to another) which may feel worse. I have been to the ENT doctor in day 3  and they just checked my ears and gave me medicine betahistine and ibuprofen and ginko biloba thing  . If within 5 days my vertigo does not go away and it still hurts, he says come again, and i  I will refer you to a neurologist.  \n\n\nim not sure if i had nystagmus or not cause i cannot see my face while doing that . but when im in doing epley manuver in  sleeping position . and head facing left 45 degrees and looking up. everything i see is spinning  like wheel how to know if the crystal is in the right or wrong tube? Can the crystal be held on the surface of the skin? No. The tubes are called semicircular canals and found within the inner ear. The crystals are made of calcium and when you are suffering from BPPV they are free floating in the fluid found within those tubes. The dizziness you feel occurs when you change head positions, triggering those crystals to move disrupting the normal flow of the fluid. A therapist that specializes in dizziness would place you into various positions looking for nystagmus (eye movement that signifies crystal movement), the direction and severity of the nystagmus would tell the therapist which canal the crystals are in. It would be very difficult to properly diagnose where the crystals are with any kind of accuracy without a specialist. However, the 2 posterior (back) canals are the most common (~90%) which is why the Epley maneuver is so popular and effective. I would say that without lasting relief from performing the Epley several times, a specialist is definitely the best recommendation. glad to hear that. im on searching a vertibular therapist near my area. I want to recover from this strange disease. too many bad thoughts what will happen to me in the future. I began to change my lifestyle and more accepting of whatever God gave me. and keep trying to  heal . This sounds like BPPV, and it also sounds like your ENT does not know what they are doing: Come back in 5 days if you still have vertigo? That is BS. He has never had it and does not know how debilitating it is. Find a vertibular therapist immediately. You will get through this. There will be some bumpy spots, but it will happen. Also, there is evidence that vitamin D and staying well hydrated can help.", "Looking for advixe Hi Everyone!  I will try to make this as short as possible.  Last year, on 6/2, I wake up in the middle of the night and felt really nauseated.  I thought I might have the stomach bug but I opened my eyes and realized the room was spinning extremely fast.  I am not talking, spinning when I moved or something, this was extremely fast and non stop.  My husband had not come to bed yet so I tried to go get him and fell on the floor.  From there I could not move my head at all.  Luckily he was downstairs so I hit the floor until he came up.  I also started throwing up but was so dizzy,  I could not even lift my head to do so.  He called an ambulance and they ended up giving me meclizine and I felt better within a half hour.  Had a CT scan too and it showed nothing.  I took the meclizine for a few day after but felt fine after.  A few months later I got in with the specialist and my hearing test was normal and since nothing had happened since we did not do anything.  There were a few days maybe 2 months ago I would feel the spinning a little when I moved my head quickly but it went away.\n\nFast forward to this week.  5/26 I woke early and realized I felt the spinning every time I moved my head.  It was not nearly as bad as last year but the right side of my head felt heavy and it sounded like white noise in my left ear.  I was able to walk around but definitely felt the spinning when I moved my head, plus the heaviness I mentioned and nausea.   I took meclizine and felt better within the hour.  Last year I took the meclizine for a few days so I have been doing that but less each day and am planning on not taking it this weekend.\n\nSo, I reached out to the specialist who is recommending I do the Cawthorne exercises.  I am wondering if it could be connected to allergies though since the episodes were almost a year apart.  My allergies do not bother me like they used but I am wondering if this could be how they present now?  The doctor (who I love by the way) thinks it just a coincidence.   My right ear has been sore since the incident though and feels kind of blocked. I also have a mild sore throat on that side.\n\nAnyway, I have upped my allergy medicine just in case (was just taking Flonase but have added zyrtec) and will be doing the Cawthorne exercises but I am wondering if anyone else has had success with those exercises.  My only hesitation about them working is that at least the first time it was a one off incident.   If it was the crystals would not I have continued to have symptoms?  I am also curious about the allergy piece. This reminds me a bit of my first 3 episodes - when I really had not been truly diagnosed by a dizzy specialist. The doc told me it was BPPV, but never did any tests - just gave me Meclizine and Zofran and sent me home. My symptoms resolved within a few weeks.\n\nUnless certain tests are performed to truly diagnose BPPV - it is hard to tell if it is really that, or if it could be an ear infection or allergies. The ears play such a huge roll in balance and dizziness.\n\nI have not heard of the Cawthorne exercise, but just googled it.  Typically with BPPV, to diagnose, they start with the Dix Hallpike (which is the first step of the Epley).  For ME - they did it with goggles on me to video the nystagmus of my eyes.  There are 6 different inner ear canals that a crystal could be dislodged in. The direction of the eye twitching can help determine which canal is effected.  Without a true proper diagnosis, it is hard to recommend what treatment should be performed.\n\nMy last episode of vertigo was hell on wheels.  That is when I found a vestibular therapist, as the ENT, ER doc, regular doc, &amp; neurologist really were not' helpful, except to rule out any other serious condition.  The vestibular therapist did MANY tests and we then chose a course of treatment.  And during my active BPPV, which lasted over 2 months, my body somewhat adapted to the imbalance and I could get through life, albeit very miserably.  After the BPPV was resolved, I was left with months of residual dizziness.  \n\nIf it truly is BPPV, you will need to do specific exercises to get the crystal back to where it belongs in the ear canal (the most common one is the Epley maneuver - and it provokes the severe 30ish second vertigo and is horrible to do).  The Cawthorne exercises remind me more of the vestibular rehabilitation exercises I was doing AFTER the BPPV was resolved.  They seem to be more to get your system used to being back in balance again.\n\nYou could try the Dix Hallpike on each side to determine if it is BPPV.  But be warned that if it is BPPV, the side that is effected will provoke the 30ish second severe vertigo.  But at least you would know what side is effected.  Study the Epley maneuver beforehand, because if the Dix Hallpike does provoke symptoms, it will be nice to just roll into the next step of the Epley to start the process of getting the crystal back in place and resolve your BPPV. Hi love!\n\nHm, it could definitely be BPPV and finding a balance center or physical therapist to test you for it would help. Preferably one that uses Electronystagmography. \n\nHowever, Based off your sinus and ear symptoms it is possible it could be Vestibular Neuritis or Labyrinthitis. They have similar symptoms and can also cause inner ear disturbances to cause dizziness. I would look into getting checked out by an ENT specialist as well. Usually BPPV has no sinus/ear blockage symptoms. It is just positional movement causing the vertigo. Just throwing those two possibilities out there as well for you to look into and bring up with your doctor. Vertigo and dizziness can have many causes and sometimes it takes a bit of ruling out to figure out the cause. \n\nI hope you find out and get to feeling well soon! Best of luck! xx Thank you for this!!  I appreciate the advice! It is funny you say that.  When this happened last year I was working for a Home Care Nurse company and the president was a former PT who specialized in vertigo.  I was telling him about what happened and he did not think it was BPPV because easily I could move my head without experiencing dizziness, even the day after.  He thought it was vestibular neuritis but the specialist did not agree.  I cannot remember why he did not think so though. I would get a second opinion. Especially if you treat it as BPPV with the exercises but you continue to have symptoms.", "Vertigo worse when lying on my back? I do not get much spinning when I lie down on either side, but I get more when I lie flat on my back. Also in general I do not feel much spinning anymore compared to feeling off balance. \n\nWhat I feel more is something like putting my head down followed by really slow, moving sensations like if you were on a boat and you can feel your head swaying around little by little. Not sure how to describe it. This happens sometimes when I raise my voice too or lean back in my chair too quickly.\n\nIs this still one sided, regular BPPV? The Epley Maneuver has somewhat helped, but I still have vertigo. I get that too ,but I also have Meniere's disease. Pretty much exactly as you described. We are they able to locate where the crystals are located? I ask because a regular ENT always does the Epley but the problem with this is sometimes it does not work. They are like 4 or 5 other maneuvers that can be done done. They determine where the crystal is located by the type of nystagmus you have. My physical therapist said mine is a right ear problem because when she had me get in the position for the left, there was not really much spinning although it was not 100% normal either. \n\nShe tested my balance and eye movements though and I had a hearing test that seemed normal so hopefully it is not m\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease. \n\nHow were you diagnosed for it? When I had bppv they did a diagnosis based on symptoms. I think they did that Dix hallpike.. where they drop you down and look at your eye movement to determine where the crystal is. \n\nThe Meniere's disease is basically the same. They diagnose you off of symptoms. I had vertigo for many years and progressive hearing loss and nerve damage in my left ear. VNG test confirmed serve nerve weakness. \n\nWhen I had bppv I had vertigo when I laid flat as well. If I remember correctly I think the half somersault technique is what made it stop. You can look it up on YouTube there are several great videos and possibly try them. I do not think you have Meniere's based on what you said so that is a good thing. I just wanted to let you know that there were other techniques and sometimes the Epley does not help. A while back a lady posted on here and i told her about the other ones  half somersault, semont etc..and she messaged me back that her vertigo was gone!  I may be wrong here but I believe (barring this being a different issue than BPPV entirely) the position that triggers your BPPV may be an indication of which canal the crystal is in. Epley maneuver tends to work (again, speaking as far as I know) for left/right positional vertigo. \n\nYou may need a different maneuver depending on the canal (anterior, posterior or lateral) your crystal is positioned in. \n\nFrom what I have read, crystals located in the Anterior canal tend to trigger dizziness when lying on your back. My best recommendation would be to look up \"anterior canal BPPV maneuvers\" or something similar and either attempt them on your own or with your doctor.\n\nObviously I am not a professional, and am only speaking from the tons of articles I read when suffering my own BPPV attacks. (I was equally looking for some understanding/resolve and also fascinated by how strange our bodies are).", "i just had my first bppv attack! wow, it is 4am and i am sitting in the bathroom writing this. i was in bed and i moved my head and boom, felt like I was 12 drinks in with an extreme case of the spins. i immediately shot up and tried to walk to the bathroom so i could see(cause darkness obviously makes vertigo much worse) and i was stumbling into the wall as everything was distorted and it felt as though I was tilted to the left. I looked around at the bathroom and the room was literally moving as if i was on a swing set. I immediately thought I had just pulled a nerve in my brain or something(obv not rational lol). Wow, it went away after 10 or so seconds, though my heart is still pounding. I was even ready to go wake up my mother if this did not go away shortly. That was insane! I looked it up and was absolutely relieved to find out that movements of the head can trigger extreme vertigo, but this has never happened to me. Safe to say i am a little scared to move my head now.", "Help! Just did the epley maneuver for bppv on my right side and WOW it made me feel incredibly sick! It has been 25 minutes since and I am fighting throwing up.  Just took a nausea pill.  Is this normal?? I had bppv years ago and the PT told me to do the epley maneuver at home if it ever came back but I do not remember feeling this shitty before.  Anyone? Yeah, that happened to me to.  The second time I had an episode I did the Epley per the hospital physical therapist's recommendation (following both their pamphlet and YouTube video) and ended up throwing up.  A few days later I went to an outside vestibular therapist who said unless you can do it completely perfectly (hard for non medically trained patients) there is a good chance of getting it wrong and making it worse.\n\nI am constantly terrified to have another attack because the options seem to be ER or wait several days for an appointment with a therapist.  I have no idea what other people do because when I get an attack I cannot stand up and I cannot stop vomiting. It is been months, but this happened to me when given the Epley maneuver. I could not stand up or do much of anything for 30 minutes. It was just awful. You might be having a violent reaction because the problem you are treating is so severe. Perhaps go to a PT and have the maneuver done under safe conditions.", "My first experience I just had my first experience with BPPV 2 days ago. Its scary especially since the whole room starts spinning when I turn my head on the pillow at night. Last night, I just held onto my wife since I thought I was falling off the bed.\n\nCalled the telemedicine doctor today and she recommended seeing an ENT specialist near me. Hopefully it goes away soon since I feel scared to drive or go for a run. It is very frightening for sure.  My BPPV only happens when I roll over to the right or bend way down when shampooing my hair.  Driving is not a problem.  Hopefully you will see a vestibular therapist who will likely be able to correct this and show you how to fix it yourself at home.  Good luck! If your ENT is not able to help you (mine was only able to rule out any other serious issues) - try to find a vestibular therapist (I found mine in the PT department) or a dizzy specialist. Likely you need to have tests done to determine which of the 6 inner ear canals has the loose crystal (if it IS BPPV).  A dizzy specialist will perform all those tests and put goggles on you to video your eye movement, which helps determine which ear canal is effected. They will also do various other tests as well. They can then help you with maneuvers to return the misplaced crystal back where it belongs. Until that happens, you will continue to have the vertigo.  Medications may help you feel better, but they cannot put the crystal back in place.\n\nRunning was my safe spot. I always felt good when I went out for a run. I may be the minority, as my therapist could not believe I continued to train and could run up to 15 miles! So do not be afraid to give it a try if you feel steady enough. \n\nBest wishes to you! I hope you get answers and find a specialist that can help you. There are simple tests and maneuvers you can do at home, if you cannot get in to a specialist right away. The Dix Hallpike maneuver is the main test to determine if it is the most common form of BPPV and which side is effected. The Epley maneuver is what can then be used to help get the crystal rotated back around the ear canal.  The Half Somersault is a less invasive maneuver that does the same as the Epley, but is not as well studied. Just be forewarned that these maneuvers WILL provoke the 30ish second nasty vertigo. It happens every time the crystal moves in the inner ear canal, and lasts up to 30 seconds while it settles. You just have to wait it out as you do the Epley. Unfortunately - most videos and instructions you find about the Epley neglect to say that it provokes the vertigo and many get scared and do not finish the entire maneuver. For ME - it always happened upon laying back (first step - also the Dix Hallpike), and upon the very last maneuver of sitting back up.\n\nKeep us posted on what you find out!", "20 year old female Bppv new too reddit Hey guys i am new too reddit but really hope this helps me find comfort knowing there are more people with this disorder out there :) I hope others to help me and that I can help others!

If anyone has any preventation methods they could share with me that would be amazing, currently I had an episode this morning at 4 am but after throwing up a bunch and preforming the manuver 4 times for my left ear I seem to just be left with residual dizziness, this has been one of my fastest fixes, 2 hours :) I remember that certain factors influence relapse: Low vit D, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, meniere, being a women (cries).

Is this normal when beginning physio? That it may get worse initially?  \nIf you are talking about the balance exercises, I definitely had a similar experience. From how it was explained to me,  your brain, as a result of bppv, starts to district your affected inner ear, and relies on the other side for all balance information which creates this weird overall wobbly, \"off\" sensation. \n\nEssentially you are forcing your brain (from what I understand) to retrust its relationship to your previously affected inner ears, so it will take some adjusting. \n\nI would feel especially worst right after doing the exercises, but I have noticed a huge (as in positive) difference now months later in my overall balance etc. \n\nI went to physio after my second bout of bppv that was MUCH worse than my first (I could not walk without falling over). Turns out I had it in both ears, and honestly, so far so good, I do not have any residual dizziness even after almost 5 months (knock on wood). Whereas with the first bout, even though it was much less severe, I was not the same even after 6 months had passed (no physio). \n\nI hope it helps for you friend! But I would not hesitate reaching out to your physio and asking them about it. \n\n Thank you so much for the reply! My BPPV started 4 months ago. I did not get properly diagnosed until month 3, where they did the Dix Hallpike and I got a positive test for my left ear, posterior canal. \n\nYea, I am doing various exercises such as spinning in circles, head down and up, staring at a letter while shaking my head, etc. It just seems to have really flared up my dizziness overall. It is tough, but I am hoping it is normal. I am no longer getting any vertigo and have not for a while but that residual \u2018off balance\u2019 feeling is with me a lot. I am seeing my physio next week to follow up, but I just wondered if my experience was typical. I am glad to hear things are going better for you now!! I will stick with it and hope it gets better after several weeks. \n\nThanks for the reply! May you never get BPPV again!  My physio did mention it is one of those worst before better scenarios. Maybe depending on the severity/location of the crystal - some of that feeling bad takes longer or shorter? \n\nAlso I forgot to mention, and your physio might have, but if it gets too be too much - mine recommended I take a pause or slow down the movements a bit. \n\nWishing you all the best on your recovery!  I had bppv 2 weeks before getting diagnosed. It is been 2.5 weeks since a successful repositioning via Epley maneuver. I am doing similar exercises and I am finding that I will have good days and bad. I actually thought I was healed yesterday bc id gone 2 days feeling normal again. Then today, I have been super dizzy and fatigued. This is my first experience with this so it is hard to stay positive bc I am still worried that I will feel this way forever.    \n\nFrom what I have read and heard though, the longer you had the misplaced crystals, the longer the recovery.  Hang in there and hopefully none of us get this thing again!!! I am sorry you also have this cursed thing!! I did not get diagnosed properly via Dix Hallpike til 2.5 months after it started. My eyes did the nystagmus thing, so I think that means the crystal was still there the whole time. So I am 4 months out now and started physio a week and a half ago. In general I have had ups and downs the last few months. Initially it was really bad and now it is up and down. Some days are pretty good and I have had days where I thought I was healed, only for it to return. \n\nMy anxiety over it is by far the most bothersome thing. Like you, I worry I will feel this way for forever even though I know that is very unlikely. Still sucks. I hope you recover quickly!!  Yes!! It is the anxiety about it that is the worst.   I think it will end and we will be normal soon.  I think it was just traumatic and probably similar to having to rehab an injury. It helps chatting with people who know what it is like.  Keep up with the exercises.  I had stopped a bit thinking I was well but now I am back at it.  Thank you! I am definitely going to keep them up. Right now they seem to be making it worse but it sounds like that is common. I have had some hard days recently - just when I think it is gone it flares itself. I am trying to think of it as rehab from an injury too and that helps. I think the variance in when to expect getting better is what bugs me - there is such a huge range of normal. I cannot wait to feel mostly normal again! I pray it never happens again. \n\nWhat flares it up for you? I am actually pretty good moving around generally, mine seems worse when I am actually trying to relax and sit and have a convo. When my feet are not touching the ground or I am on my tip toes it is a huge trigger. Also head movements, mostly looking down.  Mine was worse when standing and walking.  And, I have had a horrible cold for about a month, I notice if I take cold medicine it helps some.  I am now at a point where I am having 2 normal days and then a dizzy day. I am seeing the light!! It sounds like you had it a long time before getting it fixed and I think that makes for a longer recovery.  My whole ordeal has been 5 weeks in total. 2 weeks with it undiagnosed and now 3 weeks recovering. I am about 90% now.  Just keep doing what you are doing and I bet soon you will get some relief. ", "Attack from weeding - just seeking sympathy! I can go for months without an attack. But today I was weeding my garden (I am weird in that I love to pull weeds), and now I have just had a BPPV attack. I Epleyed but the after effects have me nauseated and unable to attend our Saturday night sheepshead game. Heck. \ud83d\ude15 stay strong. I wish you a speedy recovery.\n\nIf you have never tried it and you can tolerate it, consider supplemental ginger 500mg up to 2\u00d7 a day or 1000mg all at once. Someone bought it for me this winter by mistake and I took it out of desperation and I am still in awe of how well it worked. Ginger! In capsule form? You have my sympathy. My latest BPPV attack lasted three weeks.\n\nThankfully I was able to locate a physiotherapist (this was my first BPPV attack in my new city) who diagnosed the offending canals and did the proper maneuvers. But it still took three visits to get it 100% cleared. Yes! Like this: \n\nIt started when I tried to send someone to the pharmacy for Dramamine N (meclizine) and they returned with Dramamine *Naturals* (ginger) and since it was late at night and a pandemic I ended up taking it. It does not ease the dizziness like meclizine but it helps the nausea so much. I am actually just prone to nausea without a BPPV attack and I have taken them then, too. It is much more powerful than ginger ale or ginger tea. The capsules are 500-550mg each, take 1 every 6 to 12 hours or 2 once a day. (Not exceeding 2 a day.) When I take 2 at once I get ginger burps and an it gives me a little acid reflux so I spread them out. \n\nThe reason I linked the supplement vs the Dramamine brand, is because price. The Dramamine brand is $8.99 for 18 and the other is that for 100 (without a sale). Of course the brand likely means nothing if you are not in the US anyway but just in case.", "Eye movement vertigo w/sound I have recently stoped taking one of my medications for depression.\nThis has started a bout with vertigo.\n\nIf I keep my head stationary and move my eyes side to side, I get small spikes of vertigo accompanied by short white noise sounds \n\nHas anyone else had this? Is it normal?\nI have tried the various movements that are supposed to help and taken every pill but nothing is working.\n\nIf you have the same situation let us compare notes. That is not BPPV. You should probably check with your doctor, hopefully you are weaning off the medication if it is an antidepressant, a lot of them can cause some pretty weird side effects if you stop taking them cold turkey. Sorry - this does not sound like BPPV - best to see the doctor. I would strongly suggest seeing a doctor. BPPV from what I have read should not have white noise sounds with them &amp; the vertigo should be triggered by moving head position not moving eyes (with head stationary). Hope it resolves for you soon. Take care. that is called a brain zap, typical with antidepressant withdrawal. talk to your doctor about tapering the meds down slowly so you will not have them.", "Does anyone fall asleep mid-epley maneuver? Like after the part where you lay down and move your head from side to side. Usually after that I get super tired and end up falling asleep. No - not at all. I get so sick from the maneuver that there is no way I could fall asleep. And the anxiety of the very last step is all too real.  Honestly, I wish I had the ability to fall asleep that fast!  It almost worries me that you are able to fall asleep within a few seconds. As if something is getting triggered and causing you to pass out. Hope that is not the case. Or are you saying that you get all way through the maneuver and then feel super tired? Narcolepsy maybe? I have never gotten all the way through it. My therapist recommended staying upright for awhile afterward to give things time to settle. If you are falling asleep mid-maneuver that does not seem right. That is vibe I am getting. When the vertigo bits my instinct is to put my forehead on something stable. I think it is usually downhill from there. You need to bring this up with your doctor or PT. My concern is that you could be putting pressure on your vertebral arteries during the maneuver, and that you are not \u201cfalling asleep\u201d so much as you are losing consciousness.\n\nIt is common for me to want to stop and take a nap bc I feel so miserable during the exercise that I just want to hide away and sleep, but not to just conk out midway.", "Doctor mentioned BPPV First time poster...\n\nI had health problems for nearly 3 years. All started with what I thought was a heart attack. Fast forward a few days and I get tingling feet.\nTo cut along story short, I got checked for MS and then they mentioned small fiber neuropathy.\nEventually they ruled that out too. One of my symptoms was nausea/dizziness so I wondered whether it was autonomic neuropathy.\n\nAnyway, one of the things I have had along the way, and probably prior to that is that I often get dizzy when getting up from the couch or floor or when I make sudden movements. I often end up dry retching. Had a bad episode while driving car last week. I also have episodes where I cough a lot and sometimes feel blocked up in nasal area\n\nSince neurologist has no answer for me and I noticed increased dizziness and nausea I went back to doctor. He said it sounded a lot like BPPV. I had never heard of it but some of the symptoms sound familiar. However I never spin like you have with vertigo and I do not have nystagmus. Doctor prescribed me vergo 16 mg(Bethastine). Only been on it 3 days so not sure how effective it is? How long does it take?\n\nI cannot help but think there is more to it because of other symptoms, mainly sensory and sore legs. Is there more that can be investigated to determine whether it is BPPV indeed? Is this a lasting condition or come and go? Any thoughts appreciated with bppv all i have heard is getting vertigo with head movements. another symptom is residual dizziness after an episode. i have not heard the other symptoms be apart of bppv though. for me, bppv lasts a week and goes away. so far i have had two episodes in two months. some others say their bppv lasts longer though, it really depends on your body. i had bppv and nausea was one of my symptoms. not fun. its possible bppv will not resolve unless the proper maneuvers are performed on you by a specialist.\n\ni recommend seeing either an ear nose and throat (ent) dr or a vestibular specialist who are experienced with treating and resolving bppv. i saw an ent who resolved my bppv issue. im very happy i saw an ent dr.\n\nbtw...if youve had bppv for a while it can take at least several days to resolve after seeing a specialist. hang in there. bppv is not supposed to be serious, just a pain in the butt to deal with. Hi there, \n\nI have been struggling with bppv for 8 years, but the first three I went from one doctor to the other that prescribed me new and new birth control pill - because I was always nauseous lying down/standing up. Then when I did the Epley manouver in 2015, my right leg (my right ear had the crystals) felt weird. When I walked, i felt like there where 5 more cm (... 2 inches?) more to come, like when you think there is an extra stair but there is not. My ear doctor sent me to a scan for MS too, but ruled that out (but incidentally found a benign tumor next to my pituitary gland which I had to take ton of other tests for! (doctors decided it was not dangerous)) \n\nGoogle Epley manouver and try it. If you get dizzy spells performing it, I think that is strong evidence that you have it. There are a few standard tests for BPPV. The most common test is the Dix Hallpike (google it).  It is also the first step to the Epley maneuver (which is the maneuver to get the misplaced crystal back where it belongs).  If it is your posterior ear canal that is effected (the most common), when you are laid back doing the Dix Hallpike, with your head turned 40 degrees towards your ear, and laid back with head extended past your shoulders - you will experience a severe, up to 30 seconds, burst of vertigo with nystagmus. You can test both the right and left.\n\nThere are other tests to check the other ear canals.  A vestibular specialist would be able to test all 6 inner ear canals - and also do other tests for other dizzy conditions.\n\nBPPV can come and go. It is a condition that is tied to a crystal being loose in your inner ear canal.  Medicine will not cure it. The crystal may eventually dissolve on it is own, or you can do the Epley (or similar) maneuvers to help get the crystal back into place.  My BPPV was active for over 2 months. I did therapy and the Epley maneuver over 20 times before it resolved, but then was left with horrible residual dizziness.\n\nDid your doctor do any tests? If not, find a vestibular therapist or a place that specializes in dizziness. Your symptoms do not sound like BPPV.  You can try the Dix Hallpike at home - that would be a telltale sign of BPPV if you get the violent vertigo when you lay back. Ya keep pushing to get answers. Go to a different dr, a new specialist. The bppv part does not sound right because of the extra symptoms. I would find an ent who specializes in dizziness as well, on top of trying to figure out your other symptoms also get your Eustachian tubes checked. As you said your nose gets stuffy and they mentioned your sinus issue.  \n\nI have recently found out that my blocked sinuses/irritated Eustachian tubes cause me vertigo but it does not spin, what it is doing is irritating the middle ear canal and pissing off the nerve. That takes a whole other set of things to handle. \n\nAnother suggestion is to wear a heart monitor bracelet or watch. Keep an eye on your heart rate when you stand up. It could be POTS. That can also make you dizzy as soon as you move. \n\nTry some vitamin b-12 and some vitamin D. Lacking in those Those can contribute to chronic dizziness (advice from my physical therapist) \n\nJust a few examples from the gambit ive gone through with this. Thanks. POTS has crossed my mind but my heart rate does not jump. Actually my heart seems to be good. Still exercise at 140-160 BPM where max is around 170. I did measure my blood pressure once when standing up as getting dizzy. At that time it shot up to 202. Most people with dizziness experience a drop in pressure I believe.\n\nAlso, just did, or tried, the two tests everyone is talking about but that did not make me feel bad. Will keep at it and follow up with doctor again. Seems like a ENT is a good idea regardless. Yeah definitely! The Epley did not make me sick or worse either, which brought on the gambit of tests. A lot of ents can be clueless with this so do not get discouraged. I actually ended up with an ent that referred me to an ear specialist to help me with my issue. \nThey did the whole ms gambit with this as well. But when it is your inner ear it is hard for an uneducated ent to figure it out. It took me 3 ents for one to finally refer me. Also mention physical therapy I.e vestibular rehab. A vestibular rehab pt can tell you what is going on real quick if it is your ears or not.", "I meant to google \u201cBPPV test\u201d but mistakenly googled \u201cBOOV test\u201d  O is next to P on the keyboard so honest mistake for someone with blurred vision. Good thing I did not replace the V with B which is also adjacent. ", "Hi friends. Had a big vestibular migraine about 20 days ago. Been dizzy since. Could use some guidance Over the past year I have started to have ocular migraines for the first time in my life. Then I started getting kind of woozy at the computer, not to mention a bit dizzy. Then 20 days ago I had a migraine with halo (no pounding headache, thankfully). I had a panic attack because what was happening too. I hear that panic attack often goes hand-in-hand with PPPD, by the way.\n\nThe dizziness is characterized by swaying, not spinning. No nausea. It is near constant, but when I am relaxed and distracted, I do not feel it much. I also get a sensation of ear fullness and am more sensitive to loud sounds. \n\nAnyway, I went to the doc that day. She gave me a full assessment and ended up just giving me NSAID and coritzone steroid shot, and also some anti-dizziness meds. I have not even taken the meds becaues the dizziness is annoying, but it is not debilitating, and I cannot rely on constantly using dramamine to deal with this.\n\nI can barely work because when I am at the computer (and especially when stressed at the computer), I am in a bad way.\n\nI need a proper diagnosis and some rehab, but I am not sure where to turn. My doc does not seem familiar with vestibular migraine or PPPD. May need to see an ENT specialist. Depending on which canal the crystal is loose in, it can be a sensation of spinning, falling forward, falling backward, or a swaying forward and back, in my personal experience. Try to see a specialist if you can. I know it is hard in these times. Hope you find some help! Thank you for the reply. I did get my ears checked out at a clinic when the dizziness started (I thought maybe I had an ear infection, and then again with the doctor after my migraine with aura. But I have not been to an ENT.", "How many Epley maneuvers? I had a severe vertigo episode 2 weeks ago which included an ER visit and a CT scan. I went to a physical therapist twice for an Epley maneuver and was told to perform them at home. I do it every night, still getting nystagmus. If I am still getting nystagmus from the movement does that mean I keep failing to do it correctly? 1) Have you been given a proper diagnosis of BPPV?\n2) Epley will only work for the posterior canal (there are 3 canals)\n3) are you treating the correct side?\n\nIf you have BPPV I would highly recommend going to a PT to work with you. Home remedies can make BPPV worse. The ER doctor said it was BPPV without doing a Dix Hall. I had to follow up with a physical therapist who said it was BPPV when she performed Epley. It is definitely in my right ear. I definitely do not want to make it worse! I am following up with a balance specialist in March. Definitely not trying to do it alone. In video my nystagmus jumps vertically with a rotation. Like many with vertigo I have consumed a lot of videos of vertigo treatments and nystagmus videos. Sometimes I do not have any lingering balance issues then before bed try the Epley and the vertigo can still be triggered! If indeed your diagnosis is correct and you are treating the correct ear canal (and side), you could just have a stubborn case.  Some people feel instant relief.  Others do not (they have residual dizziness). Often many have to do the Epley (or whichever maneuver is correct) multiple times.  I had a stubborn case and worked with a skilled dizzy therapist for over two months, which equated to over 20 Epley and many half somersault maneuvers. As a reference, I would do the Epley with my therapist weekly.  She would do it once - let me sit a bit, then she would do the Epley a second time. Mostly to test to see if the first time worked (the first step of the Epley is the Dix Hallpike).  If I still had symptoms, she would continue with the entire Epley. Then she said she would see me back in a week. Half way through, when I was not getting better, she told me to do the Epley at home mid week. I was also doing the half somersault, as that was easier and did not provoke symptoms.  Do not be discouraged if it is not resolving right away. Hang in there. You can certainly overdo the manoeuvre but I would have a read of our guide and see if the information helps - \n\nI also found this video to be very informative - \n\nDo not be discouraged by the nystagmus and vertigo not being instantly resolved. My last episode lasted 4 weeks with lingering dizziness for months. \n\nExercises once the BPPV has been resolved will help with residual dizziness but you need to jump into that straight away which your PT will help you with. That is a great video. \ud83d\udc4d Did your balance go back to normal? Either my balance was not effected, or my body   adapted to being off balance. My therapist could not believe I was still running &amp; training... And that I could snowmobile. But on the flip side, after bppv was resolved, it took up to a year to get past a lot of the residual dizziness. Perhaps because my system had adapted to being off balance for so long. The residual dizziness is very frustrating and difficult to communicate. I have been trying to push forward with exercise and yoga to keep my body moving around. But sometimes it is discouraging I totally understand this. The anxiety it caused me just made it worse too. Plus... Wondering when bppv would come back. I just tried hard to be strong and push through the best I could. My vestibular therapist was super helpful in giving me pep talks (along with more exercises to speed the healing process). Also, I just learned of PPPD and my symptoms fit that perfectly.", "Help! I was diagnosed with BBPV (this is my second time that I know of) \nI was told to to barbecue roll maneuver, but it made me feel worse (not just straight after)  so I let it just get better by itself. After a few weeks they could now see that there is not many loose crystal left, it almost looks normal. Instead of getting the typical vertigo when I move my head, now I have this constant boat feeling no matter what. It is very overwhelming and I cannot take it anymore :( \nBefore the clinic left for summer vacation they gave me some gaze exercises, but I feel like they also make me worse. \nI also asked about if I could just live like normal, turn around in bed etc and they said yes since I do not have a severe case. But it feels very severe to me and I have no idea what to to. It is making me desperate\n\nDoes anyone know anything that might help me? Hi!  I have struggled with residual dizziness after bppv episodes.  How long ago was your episode?  Last year mine took 3 months to resolve the dizzy boat feeling and my most recent episode lasted from January until may.  I still have some intermittent dizzy feelings even now, but they resolve more quickly and are not as severe.  If you had crystals for awhile research suggests the residual dizziness can last longer since your brain was compensating and now has to learn all over again.  I like Joey remenyi youtube videos.  If the vertigo is gone that may be what is going on.  They also now call it pppd.  You can look into that too.  Do not worry, this will not last forever.  Part of it is just accepting it and allowing yourself time and be gentle with yourself.  Your brain cannot adjust overnight.  It will get better! I had two BPPV episodes in a week (I think caused by an SSRI because when I stopped taking it I have not had it since), and each time I fixed it on the same day with Epley.  This was in February.  I still get some residual dizziness.  It is really just an inconvenience as opposed to crippling.  I think mine is still around because I am the type of person who does not care how much he throws up as long as I can fix it the same day.  I will not deal with this shit for more than a day at a time.  I did the Epley probably 10 times within a few hours to fix it (which I did) so that is probably why my brain has not caught up yet.  Work on VOR exercises (Youtube) because a lot of it I believe is visual not positional.  My residual is worse on days that I work and stare at a screen all day.  It will go away! It might take time but it will get much better! I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I know it can be debilitating. This is probably not what an expert would recommend, but I tend to avoid things that I know will give me vertigo, especially if I am not able to get treatment right away.  If it is more comfortable I prop myself up with extra pillows or avoid sleeping on one side or the other. Whatever I can to get a good nights sleep without vertigo!", " Vertigo - Possible BPPV or god knows what ... I stumble upon this small community of vertigo sufferers :)\n\nFirst i want to say i do not know what i have. Two doctors said i might have BPPV and the last one said it might be Meinier or because of my spine. I had an eye doctor that said it might even be migraine vertigo.\n\nIt all started 2 years ago when i had a very very bad vertigo. I was just coming from two 2 days in a raw dental work (3h in the chair each day) when i was just sitting on the couch with my gf and watching a movie. I felt like a head ache so i went to take a pill. When i got back to the couch the whole world started to spin counterclockwise. I was so dizzy that i was throwing up continuously and i had to call the ambulance (i fel very scared as well). The whole thing passed in around 2-4 hours. I do not remember. After that i started a treatment for two months with Betaserc and some other supplements. After that episode i had a few vertigo attacks (first of them where a bit longer 2-5 min, now i only get brief vertigos for about 15-20 sec) but all of them once a few months and they keep coming in rows. My last vertigo was 5 monts ago, and now i started having another episode. I mean i usually get 1 vertigo per day out of nowhere and for something like 3-4 days in a raw and then it stops. \n\nWhy i do not think is BPPV. I did some tests myself ... after having my vertigo started doing movements ... first slow then almost like jumping being at a rock concert :) nothing happened. Usually it start when i stay motionless with my head extended and i do a slight movement. Oh and the reposition maneuvers do not really do anything. \nWhy i do not think is Menier. Since this one usually triggers long episodes not just 10-20 secs ones. Though i might be wrong. Maybe is just an easy form.\nSpine and migraine vertigo seems more plausible from my side.\n\nBut i usually have the common symptoms: lightheaded, when i have the vertigo it feels like i get a bat in the head (with no pain though, just a strange feeling) and some light sensitivity (difficulty reading far away text - when i take serc it evens get worse this one). I think that for one year or a bit more than 1, i was really terrified and had even small panic attacks and feeling very down. Slowly i manage to get over this, but i still remain a bit hypochondriac .\n\nWhat other medical conditions i have:\n\n1) I am half deaf - not hearing with my left ear possibly since i was born. That is why is hard to tell if it is Menier or not.\n\n2) Ringing in my ear - i start having this one after i spend some time in the hospital doing a treatment for vertigo ... yay.\n\n3) Vitamin D deficient - big deficiency \n\n4) Poping/ cracking sound in my neck when i swallow - i do not know if it is related but it started appearing in the same period.\n\n5) Tachycardia (usually my heart beat rate is over 100) but my blood pressure is between 12 and 14 \n\n\n\nI did head and neck MRI, multiple dizziness/positioning test (they said i have a Nistagmus in my left eye), blood tests ... \nI am not sure if i should just leave it like this and try to live with it or i should continue doing other appointments. What are your opinions or  let me know if you had the same symptoms as i do. Disclaimer: Not a doctor. Keep seeing an ENT until it is diagnosed and resolved. \n\nHave you considered that it might be more than one condition? Nastygmus is typical of BPPV. You should continue getting the epley manoeuvre until the nastygmus is gone, then focus on ruling out other causes if the symptoms do not go away. If it is migraine based it should be controllable with beta blockers.  What do you mean, more than one condition? Condition that is triggering? I even had a doctor saying it might be mandibular related. Never really talked with a doctor about the migraine type vertigo. That was what I meant... not sure how applicable it is in your case, just a thought. A qualified doctor is your best bet to diagnose.  Question - how common is it to have a ringing in your ear? For example, if I hear a ringing about 4-7x a week, is that 'normal'? Define normal :) just kidding. You can get a ringing only from stress as well.\nI have one as well for more than a year now. I got better at ignoring it. How bad is it? \nMake an appointment with a ENT doc. I would assume is the best course of action. Mine just comes and goes, lasting only about 10 seconds at most. I have been seeing an ENT and neurologist but neither can define what vertigo issues I am having...I have spent almost $2k already so I have sort of given up. My MRI/audiology tests were all normal, so... From what i know and i suspect there are two major causes. One is BPPV, with the calcium crystals in you ear, the other is spine problems that may cause this. I suspect mine to be spine caused and it might help doing kinethotherapy or other sports that would help your spine.\nMy verigo is the same, last about 10 sec and usually i have it two or 3 days .. each day happening once. That i am vertigo free for 2 to 4 months Wow, sounds similar although I have more episodes within a same day period. I will have to ask my doctor about my spine. ", "Cant identify which ear I woke up today dizzy as hell and thought it would go away. it did not and I think I have been able to self diagnose as BPPV. I tried doing the eply at home but i honestly cannot tell which ear is causing the dizziness. \nI tried the maneuver where you turn your head and lie down quickly but neither turning my head left nor right made me dizzy. I only get dizzy when I tilt my head up or down. \nShould I just try to do the eply on both ears a couple hours apart and hope for the best? I am sorry you are having to deal with this. I would not wish BPPV on my worst enemy.\n\nI had my first bout 4 weeks ago, and have been symptom free for a full week. I tried the Epley Maneuver on my own, and had no luck. I went to my chiropractor, and after 4 treatments, it is completely gone. If you can see a chiro, they will be able to closely watch your eye movement during the maneuver, and be able to help pinpoint which ear is causing the problem.  \n\n\nGood luck! If you get dizzy while looking up and down then try the half somersault maneuver. u/shroonn \\- read some of my posts regarding my experience with bppv. bottom line...see an ent dr. Update. I did three epley maneuvers on myself yesterday alternating both ears. Dizziness got much better into the evening and I went to bed propped up on some pillows just to make sure the crystals did not fall out again. Woke up today at 9am feeling almost 100%. Still have some minor unsteadiness but I was told that would reside in a couple days. Thank you all for the help!!", "Got another episode yesterday So yesterday the 29th, I had a pretty bad episode, vomiting, the spins, tingly feeling in arms,hands, mouth,nose. Basically a couple days before yesterday, I could feel the \"begining\" of an episode somewhat. Playing video games or watching them seems to trigger it, and I have known this. I move the character too fast, I zoom in too fast or out and I can get the sensation of being off balance. I slept on stomach, on my right ear, the usual way I sleep, and I woke up fine yesterday morning. After I had lunch, I came back to my room and laid on my reclining chair, but on my left side and a travel neck pillow under my head, and then it started, the sensation of things moving up and down. I went to my bed and did the half-sommersault manuever, it did not help, I sat down in the chair, had to vomit. Spent the next 3hrs in my chair puking and getting hot then I would get really cold. The final time I puked, I felt better, and had some sense of balance back and went to the clinic but they did not attend me. \n\nI could not sleep all that well, my eyes could not stay still it felt like if I left my eyes closed in a certain \"feeling\" I would fall into an episode, I had to find the good feeling, which means trying to keep my eyes focused on something, while closed, so I make an imaginary point of reference I can focus on. If I move my eyes around too much it could lead me to an episode. \n\nI have tinnitus mostly in my right ear, it is always ringing, last night small noises would give it a weird twitch. \n\nLast time I was prescribed Meclinze it was not that helpful (it was the yellow pill version), the blue pill was much more helpful to me when I was 13, I am 25 now, I have been dealing with this off and on since then. \n\nI know I should make some lifestyle changes, spending less time on phones and the computer, no more video games or watching them, and sleeping on my back propped up with my travel neck pillow, bend at the knees. It is just so hard to change, i like sleeping on my stomach and video games. It is like my brain has trouble dealing with moving things, scrolling pages. \n  \nThis is so frustrating.. \n\nWhat do you all do to fight this? I really need to take this serious. I am sorry you are going through this. I know the struggle. \nVertigo sucks.\n\nGood news, vertigo is only a symptom and can usually be easily fixed. \n\nMy best advice for you is to see a Physical Therapist that specializes in Vestibular Rehabilitation. PT can help find the cause and work on trying to fixing it. In my personal experience, PT helped me the most. \n\nBest wishes and hope you feel better soon.", "Possible BPPV? So before I dive into this post, I would just like to say that I am not diagnosed with BPPV, but I have a suspicion that I may have it. \n\nA little bit of backstory, I have Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which bassically means my blood pools to my legs and I get a whole bunch of fun symptoms with it. (Chest pains, nausea, vertigo, lightheadedness). \n\nThe one symptom that I get, which is ussualy triggered by changing positions, is severe morning nausea. \n\nMore info, my first trigger for my insane morning nausea began a few years ago when I was 14. After a full day of rides at Disney, I went on the tower of terror (drop tower) and began feeling very nauseas afterwards. The next morning I was nauseas, and the morning after that, and for months. My nausea slowly got better over time, but it lasted for about 4-5months. Severe morning nausea that got better as the day went on.\n\nFast forward to last year now 23, I joined an upside down silks class. A lot of movement and a constant up and down motion. I got severe morning nausea again for months. It slowly got better, but it took time.\n\nI used to assume it was because of POTS, but after talking to A LOT of other people. I realised no one had the same symptoms as me.\n\nI am naturally prone to vertigo, and get it frequently. I sometimes even get a random ringing in my ear. A lot of POTS symptoms can be similar to BPPV, except the morning nausea.\n\nI am wondering if anyone has ever experienced this?  Does this sound like BPPV? I am trying to find answers, after living nausea for years I want answers. Obviously I will consult my doctor, but I would like some feedback.", "23 y/o male - diagnosed with BPPV 6 months ago, symptoms are not any better. Hello all,\n\n23 y/o male, no health issues in the past.\n\nI was diagnosed with BPPV back in January, i have monitors mounted at work, which require me to bend my neck upwards  to view. One day i came into work, looked at my monitors and bam. Hit with a dizzy spell. I couldnt look up without feeling like i was going to pass out/vomit.\n\nWent to the ER same day, did CT scan, blood tests, everything basically came back and nothing was wrong. Diagnosed me with BPPV. Ever since then i have always felt \"Off\". I do not get dizzy but i just feel out of myself. Bending down, moving my head too fast makes me feel woozy. I also think this is giving me very bad anxiety, as its been 6 months and i have had another incident a few weeks ago.\n\nI have had two real vertigo incidents total. The second incident i woke up laying on my back, looking at the ceiling and the whole room was spinning. Once these episodes hit, i am done for the day. I basically have to lay on my side and sleep it off. The next day i felt better.\n\nI have seen two ENT's, chiropractor, cardiologist, optometrist (generic eye doctor), and i have went to vestibular therapy once. Everyone keeps giving me the same answer \"Just give it time you will feel better\" and that just makes me even more anxious. Because here i am 6 months later still with these issue. Im tired of wasting my money seeing doctors. I have spent over $1000 in medical bills this year.\n\nAdding i have also have had 3 epley maneuvers done, they dont seem to trigger my bppv.I have notice caffeine makes it worse, my eyes kind of twitch if i lay on my back and close them, same thing if i am sitting down and close my eyes, they twitch or pulsate. I sometimes get minor ringing in my left eat but it only lasts about 5 seconds then its gone.\n\nJust trying to get some more guidance on next steps...it has really impacted me mentally. I feel like i have anxiety attacks now, and i cant sleep at night. I am going to see my physical therapist again this week as a next step. Thank you to anyone with suggestions. i really appreciate any guidance. I am so sorry to hear you are going though this. I know just how awful and debilitating this is.\n\n&gt;  Everyone keeps giving me the same answer \"Just give it time you will feel better\" and that just makes me even more anxious. \n\nThis is such BS. Yes, you will probably eventually feel better if nothing is done, but it is going to take some serious time. And it is clear that none of them have ever had a serious BPPV episode because they would not be treating this so lightly.\n\nMy experience has been that the ENTs and DRs are not the best with treating this. Instead you need to see a PT that has experience treating balance disorders. They should be able to do the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to confirm that you have BPPV (and going through this sucks but it must be done), identify which ear/canal is affected, and then do the Epley Semont, Foster, or Brandt-Daroff maneuvers (which can also suck). If done correctly, it usually \"takes\" right away (but you will often feel tender and slightly unsteady for a bit). If your PT does not know about this stuff, find another!\n\nAs for other things you can do, drink lots of water (cut out caffeine because of the possible diuretic effect and slight dehydration) , take Vitamin D (there may be a connection to low levels), sleep propped up with lots of pillows to mitigate the possibility of shifting in your sleep, and move slowly and deliberately: for instance, no bending down and instead bend at your knees to pick something up off the floor. \n\nThis is not fun at all, I know. But keep with it and I am convinced things will improve Thank you for the response :)\n\nI am seeing my physical therapist at a balance center i went to previously. I am hoping something will be able to trigger it. \n\nBut yes not a lot of people understand how it feels, and i think they use my young age as a point to say i will be fine and not to worry.\n\nI do have some vitamin D soft gels i purchased but have not been using them really. I will again now. I used to drink energy drinks daily, for about 2 years. I stopped recently and picked up coffee as an alternative. I usually only have one cup in the AM. \n\nI will post back sometime this week hopefully with an update. Physical therapist who has experience with BPPV, if you have a dizzy/balance clinic in your area that would be even better. It sounds like the crystal might be in a different canal if the Epley does not work. \n\n\nI hope you get some resolution soon, that sucks that you have dealt with it for so long. Thanks for the response!\n\nI actually am going back to a \"Total Balance\" clinic. They seemed decent last time i went, they had me habituate with something called a \"GAIT Circle\" where you walk in a circle and each circle you go inwards. They thought that was my problem since i did a little dizzy. Here are my notes that he left maybe you can make more of it than me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Patient has what sounds like a resolved BPPV and has some lateral beating suggestive of some low level vestib hypofunction that has lead to visual overuse. He had a lot of symptoms with gait circles and none with head shake which strengthens this hypothesis. This is either a vestib suppression due to severe BPPV or a maladapted neuritis based on what was seen today. He will habituate with gait circles. He wanted to call to make the next appt. PT 1x4 weeks\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did GAIT circles for a few days, seemed to not get dizzy anymore. I did not return since i was told just to give it time. But i am going back this week to see if they can do anything. It sounds like you are going to the best place you can for help, that is good. Did they test you with a blackout goggle sort of thing? It sounds like they think you have residual dizziness, not actual BPPV at this point , that can make you feel weird and off balance, kind of like you are moving when you are actually sitting still. But when I had BPPV and the crystal moved from the horizontal canal to the lateral it caused more of an off balance, seasick feeling so it might be worthwhile to ask them about that possibility too. Good luck! Yes! they did put me on the blackout goggles. My eyes were doing weird movements and would jerk to the left i believe (Cant remember the direction) but they would jerk, then return to center kind of like a cycle.\n\nBut yes to me it does feel like residual dizziness, i do not get vertigo constantly. I only had the two episodes of vertigo. The first in January and the last one was a few weeks ago when i woke up on my back. I just have this feeling of being \"off\" all the time.\n\nI will definitely take note of that and ask Do you have an ongoing vestibular physio plan? Personally I was given exercises to do 3x a day every day to strengthen my vestibular system in order to become more resilient against the dizzy feeling. I was given a printout of exercises to help with the residual dizziness, tbh I should probably be still doing them, every once in a while I still feel a little off, like maybe the BPPV is going to come back. It is a sucky thing to deal with. This is really similar to the exercises I was given.  Did these exercises improve your condition? I was given a plan to do the GAIT circles to begin with. I did them until i did not get a dizzy feeling anymore. Which was only a few days. I am hoping next time i go back i can find a different exercise to help. It was hard for me to understand what true dizziness was until i had my second episode, so that could have been part of the problem during the first visit. Thanks for sharing! Have also read here that at least one person had developed gaze instability after having extended BPPV episodes. My ENT asked me this recently and my response was \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37not sure.\n\nI do the exercises when I feel like *something is off* but I otherwise do not do them daily, similar to ( It is a lotttttt. &gt;GAIT circles\n\nNot familiar with this, but everyone is on their own vertigo journey so ask for more regular physio exercises and see if that helps.   \n\n\nI **will** say that ENTs seem to default to BPPV as the initial diagnosis even though there are lots of different causes of vertigo including vestibular migraines which I believe are pretty prevalent and not diagnosed very well. The fact that you have dizziness for an **entire day** and have to sleep it off is not totally consistent with BPPV but more consistent with migraine.  \n\n\nKeep a detailed log of episodes &amp; possible triggers (caffeine, anxiety, sleep quality) in an excel spreadsheet and see. I agree, I have never heard of gait circles before this visit. Even if you google GAIT circles nothing comes up that is relevant.\n\nI do not ever get headaches or migraines unless I am dehydrated. That being said I do not have a history of migraines or headaches. I have talked to other people that have bad vertigo and they said that basically for the whole day they are done for. It is odd is not it?\n\nI am sure my next visit they will give me something else to try if they can trigger my dizziness. Your case sounds very similar to mine. My PT had only recommended the Epley maneuver and that seemed to help but the dizziness kept coming back.\n\nI then learned about the 'half somersault' / Foster maneuver, and started doing the Foster maneuver whenever I felt the dizziness and it seems as though the dizziness is finally fading for me: (\n\nWorth a shot if you have not tried it! I am experiencing the same thing. 27M. last week I was sitting at my desk at work looking at my computer when all of a sudden the room was spinning and my balance was off. it seems to be getting a little better everyday but this has never happened before and i do not know what triggered it. How long did your episode last? And yeah it sucks because I do not know what caused mine either. Any specific neck or head movements seem to trigger it? It started for me on wednesday, so it is been almost 5 days now. Thursday was a nightmare, I got nauseous trying to stand up at all. Now it seems to get a little better each day. I notice that it triggers a bit when I turn my head and look to my left really fast. Its so weird that this is happening to us! I am glad I found someone experiencing the same thing from just looking at a monitor. It can be scary, just try to take everything slow and do not do any rapid head movements.\n\nHave you been diagnosed with anything? Or seen a doctor? \n\nIf not I would recommend seeing a ENT to get a diagnosis, then see a vestibular rehabilitation clinic or balance therapy. In most cases a simple maneuver can clear up most symptoms. Thanks man. I just had a video chat appointment and explained my symptoms. The doctor said it is probably Vertigo. She just said it should go away on its own and suggested I keep doing the head positions that make me dizzy so I can get used to them. I will look into seeing an ENT, seems like that is the best option The ENT most likely will not do anything, but it is a good first step. Also they will do a hearing test to make sure you do not have any hearing loss.\n\nIf you feel like you do not have any hearing loss or other issues, it may be better just to go straight to the vestibular therapy if you feel like it is needed.\n\nI would keep up what you are doing and see if it resolves itself. Which from what I have read in most cases it does. Unfortunately for me I have had residual dizziness for about 6 months. Hoping my next visit to the physical therapist gives me some results. Vestibular hypofunction means one ear is &gt; than the other. Not residual dizziness per se, but apparently, from the notes, yours may have been caused by BPPV.\n\nCompensation (your brain learning to adapt to the faulty system) takes training - so more than one session of rehab and a couple of days at home. Check with the clinic ofc, but stick to your rehab schedule. \n\nRotary chairs are particularly useful for this sort of compensation. Platform exercises also used. \n\nThere are also plenty of exercises for at home  (look at a fixed target for 5 minutes feet apart, then next to each other, then one in front of another, then on smth a bit uneven like pillo, then with eyes closed), stay on one leg, do the alphabet with the other leg, etc etc. These are all static. You can also do dynamic exercises: VOR training, gaze stability, habituation etc.\n\nBottom line if cause is more than smth mechanical like BPPV, your brain will adjust to it, but it is a muscle you need to exercise in a certain way. 29 f, 3 month mark for me. Just spent another wasted day at a second ent looking for help. Got a referral to another physical therapy place. Hang in there. (She says as she is about to lose her mind any second) ENT's are basically worthless when it comes to this. Some are willing to help some are not. I do not really have true vertigo anymore, just a constant feeling of being \"off\" if that makes sense. Everday i just feel bad and not myself. Wondering if it is more than BPPV. Have you tried this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEither way im sure a physical therapist is the way to go for something like this. Hopefully you do not have to wait too long to get in there. Yep I tried that one! And they tried to roll me and everything, could not get the vertigo to start so they considered resolved vertigo but something still going off in my vestibular system/vestibular damage. \nI definitely know the feeling of being off, mines more of a \u201cinside false movement\u201d kind of off and then some nasty brain fog on top of it. \n\nGoing to the physical therapist tomorrow to see if she can pinpoint and take it from there, also got ahold of a balance clinic after the ent basically shoved my out of his office.  That is basically how I feel! It is hard to explain that to people. Out of curiosity how many actual vertigo episodes have you had? \n\nUnfortunately my appointment is not until Friday, then I am on vacation for the following week. So I am stuck with anxiety as my friend for the rest of the week...also feel free to share the outcome of your visit tomorrow. I hope they can figure it out, just try to stay positive \ud83d\ude2c Holy shit dude. You have like, all of the exact same symptoms as I am having. Like scary similar. You are not alone. We will figure this out. I have seen so many fucking doctors at this point. I know exactly what you mean when you say that you have always felt \"off\". I have such fucking horrible anxiety after my attack. It is been 9 months. Someone will help us eventually. Look into PPPD and MdDS, both have similar symptoms and could be the issue if not BPPV.", "Do you all feel the vertigo when you close your eyes? Mine has been internal spinning, and I have medication for it, but I do not take them regularly coz of side effects. It puts me to sleep for nearly 20 hours, and I cannot deal with that. The episodes are more sporadic, like I go 2 months without anything at times. I cannot figure out what the triggers bppv.\n\nRecently I have noticed that I get internally dizzy when I close my eyes sometimes. \n\nDo you all feel this too? Have you tried the maneuvering and stuff? Try figuring out which one of the two years is the problematic one. Get on YouTube and watch some videos on how to do that.\n\nBtw how did ya got yourself into this? What injury was that? *I am afraid that you must have ruptured something in you ear canal*\n\nIn my case, I was given three medicines. One was Stemetil MD for dizziness (I guess it is the same med given to people who board a cruze ship), another was Dompan (idk what this does), another one was for making me fall asleep. They got it under control within a week, but in your case, there maybe some physics injury, have you got it scanned (MRI and stuff)?.. Hi!\n\nMy vertigo gets worse when i close my eyes (it feels like i am spinning or like being pulled or pushed). I also get sick from time to time, depending on how fast the movements are. After Iying down, i always wait 30 minutes before i close my eyes. \n\nI believe it is an inner ear thing, but i am not sure. While lying down with your eyes closed your brain depends a lot more on the information received by the inner ear. So it is plausible to assume, that inner ear damage or even Bppv could trigger this kind of vertigo.\n\nEdit: English is not my first language, please excuse any misspellings and grammar mistakes In certain situations yes, I needed my eyes to stabilize the sense of where I am in space, and opening them would help. Mine is not initially triggered by closing my eyes,  but closing my eyes makes it worse when it does happen. Did you ever try to do the epley maneuver? I had bppv in march. Got rid of it within 3 days...still have residual dizziness but bppv is supposed to be very easy to fix. Yeah, mine is bad either way, but when i close my eyes it feels like im spinning uncontrollably and whooshing through space Balance is somewhat interesting... it requires a few of our senses to work together to make us feel \u201cstable\u201d and if one of them is off it literally puts you into a spin...\n\nEven after BPPV has resolved many of us (me included) find they \u201cdo not feel right\u201d and search for answers. \n\nWhat I have found / learnt is that after a BPPV event you have to retrain your balance system and you should see a specialist to help do this. \n\nIf you do not seek help and just \u201cdeal with it\u201d you will end up with PPPD. \n\nI ended up with PPPD and although I had no BPPV symptoms my balance system had become so reliant on sight that when I walked in the dark I physically felt like I had to crawl or I was going to fall over. ... likewise when I would go to bed, it felt like I was sleeping on a boat... \n\n6 months of balance work with a PT that specialises in balance disorders and I would say I am 80-90% better.", "How do you manage performing the Epley?

I see a professional, I have someone there with me and I tell my self while going through the movements that this feeling is temporary and needed for me to get better. \n\nI think the hard part of BPPV is believing that the spinning and eye movement is temporary and that it is created by mixed signals from rocks in your ears. \n\nOnce you understand / believe this you can do the moves, induce the spin and instead of pulling out to force stop the movement you will hold the position and find at each step the spinning will slow down and stop. \n\nBest of luck! \ud83d\udc4d As u/slash5k1 said, trust that the intense vertigo only lasts around 30ish seconds. Likely not even that long. Wait it out. Have someone there to talk to you. Close your eyes if need be. Try to relax. Jumping back upright makes it worse and prolongs the vertigo. A professional can help you a ton too! The anxiety is real though - so I feel your pain. Perhaps even take a medication to help you relax when doing the maneuver (valium, Ativan) - just to help with the anxiety. Best wishes to you! Do you have someone you trust that can be with you when you do the maneuver?  It is really important to feel safe and supported when going through this.

I had Covid-19 in early march and ever since I \"got better\" I have been having these vertigo episodes and lots of light headed dizziness. Does anyone know if Vertigo is related to Covid-19? Check with your doctor? Lol \u201ccheck with your dr\u201d. I love these groups because our experiences trump the memories of our drs, who do not really have any clue about vertigo (in my experience). These groups that talk about people\u2019s experiences, symptoms, things that help are so much more valuable than a dr. This is interesting about your Covid experience. Sometimes I think I got it from getting covid in Dec after a trip to Las Vegas. But I will never know. Also have you had your vitamin d levels checked?? Check with your doctor because they are talking specifically about having vertigo after having been diagnosed with Covid.\n\nEdit to add I quite often respond on this subreddit with suggestions, personal experience and so forth when people ask about BPPV because I have had several episodes of BPPV over the years, in different canals, starting in one canal and moving to another and an especially stubborn case that the PT ended up using a vibrating doohickey on in order to get the crystal to move. Because each time I have had it it has been different and I have not always been able to diagnose exactly what is going on myself I do suggest seeing a doctor most of the time. It is so interesting. I also had a serious shortness of breath in late march. I did not get tested for covid, but I believe there is a great possibility that it was covid, because I had shortness of breath for about 1-2 months and also dry coughs for the first time in my life. \n\nThen in late July, I got hit with three vertigo episodes on a day (again for the first time in my life) and have been dealing with lightheadedness since then! Is there anybody else with the same experience? Ya, I agree. Tho my experience with almost every dr, specialist and generalist, has been \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Also I have not hear about Covid related bppv yet and I belong to a few groups. But I know there is a lot we do not know, about both issues. Yes it is quite possible. I remember in February a woman who had had Covid was talking on sky news about how she woke up one morning and the room was spinning so Covid can affect your vestibular system. It is really difficult to get into a doctor right now in my area. Its like a 2 month wait list. Ya it was 3 months for me to see an ENT. But get  an appointment, before you know it, it will be time. I would not wait until until you can see them to book, ENTs are always months before you can see them. Get on the wait list, the cancellation list etc. It is possible that vertigo is related to COVID-19. From the scientific papers I have read (I am a grad student), people who have recovered from the virus have reported a variety of effects/ new health conditions after infection such as Parkinson's and epilepsy, although I do not remember reading about vertigo specifically. Hope you get back to normal soon! It sounds a bit like vestibular neuritis.\n\nI was diagnosed with it in August after having similar issues as you. The symptoms are vague, and unfortunately so is the diagnosis for dizziness. Vestibular Neuritis was my provider's best guess. Unlike you, I was never sick (as far as I know. But I guess with covid, some do not ever know they had it).\n\nI have gone through a lot of research and I will tell you, the best place to go is a physical therapist that deals with vestibular issues (they are pretty easy to find). Vestibular Rehabilitation is the only treatment since there are no medications to speed things up. VN can lasts several months without treatment. The brain needs to recalibrate, and I must be an idiot because it feels like it is taking forever.\n\nBest of luck. To all of us.", "I have had BPPV for 4 Weeks... Had a bad episode in my left ear 4 weeks ago. Had the epley done and went to my follow up only to discover it had \"jumped\" to my right ear.\n\nNow, I feel better but every time I go for my follow up and the ENT brings me down the room starts spinning again...\n\nJust went and had my like 5th epley done....what. I to do?!??!? When will this go away!!! I have been dealing with vertigo since January 3rd, I have not had any actual spinning for close to a week now but I still feel crappy and off balance. I have never heard of it moving from one ear to the other, maybe you had a loose crystal in both ears? Having to deal with this for so long sucks, hope you get relief soon. Same to you!\n\nIt is really a bummer, have you had the epley done/seen an ENT? I have been going to a Dizzy/Balance Center about once a week. They started with the Epley, then the crystal moved into the horizontal canal so that needed a different maneuver. Last time I went they thought it was back in the original canal so they did the Epley again. That was last Monday. I have not had any vertigo since then, but feel cruddy off and on and off balance. I am hoping maybe it is just residual and will go away soon, this is the fourth or fifth time I have had BPPV and it is never lasted this long before. I am sorry you are going through that. Yeah, sometimes it takes a few times of doing the Epley. Have you tried some of the other repositioning exercises. Some people find that some of the other ones work better than the Epley for them. \n\nMy first episode back in Septemberast year took me 3 Epleys to correct the vertigo but after  I had residual dizziness for a few weeks. All together it took me a little over 2 months to feel normal again.\ud83d\ude23 Jeez, I am sorry. Hope it gets better. \n\nIf this continues for me, I may have to visit a balance center myself I guess as long as it is normal to take a few trys I should not be too worried \n\n\nLast time I had it, three years I had it done once and it was gone. Guess I was hoping for the same Some episodes are more of a pain in the butt to get rid of but just remember that it does goes away eventually lol just keep trying and do the post reposition instructions and take it easy for a couple weeks.", "Hey guys I need some tips I have been getting really dizzy lately and I need some tips to make it better. I found that the Epley maneuver kind of helps? Idk I just need some tips to not just give up Try the Brandt daroff maneuver 3 times a day and get in touch with a balance clinic near you. I have been suffering for around 3-4 weeks now but I am slowly improving all the time! Did it work for you? I will do anything haha Yea it worked pretty much straight away for me but the thing That worked most was calming the  anxiety that I was struggling with. (I am not sure if you are the same). It is far less daunting when you realize you will not have it forever. dude that is the thing that scares me, like what if it stays forever? That is the biggest problem honestly Yea I had the same thoughts at the beginning. Try the Brandt daroff/semont maneuver and if you can get your doctor to prescribe you some anti dizziness medication. I got one called serc which was basically an anti histamine which I am coming off atm, but it definitely helped! Also do not worry, it is a temporary thing, although it is so shit to go through hahaha. Hope you feel better! Thanks man! I am here if you ever want to talk btw you honestly seem like a good chap No probs haha, Cheers man!! search for my bppv posts. you will see lots of bppv tips. I have been doing the Brandt Daroff for a few weeks now since my last episode. And they have worked wonders. The first time a few years ago I did not do these because I guess my therapist did not think I needed them. But this time with in a few days I was feeling better. Seriously do these. They help so much! Hey have you been going through dissociation with it ? My main issue is feeling dissociated and out of place. I actually tried beta\u201dserc\u201d for almost 2 months didnt help me much. The doctor told me to do the semont manuver for 2 weeks and then check with him again. After how many days you started feeling better ? I just want to get rid of the brain fog and dissociation that causes anxiety Yea I understand what you mean by the brain fog, but I think it is just anxiety that causes the brain fog. The Semont maneuver started working for me after maybe 2-3 days so it was pretty immediate. Serc was also the medication I was using but I was on 16mg 3 times a day. I have gone off it completely now and I am definitely dizzier but I have been told to do some Physio exercises by a balance clinic and I am hoping that I will see some progress in the next week. From what I have read online, this just takes a while to heal. I feel you though it is such a pain in the ass. I get a special dread when it gets bad sometimes but it is important to just stay positive! I am so glad to hear this!! It is crazy how a couple of exercises can help so much.", "Hoping someone here can help. I am desperate for some help. Had vertigo for a few years now. It started after I quit taking an antidepressant cold turkey..one that is notorious for major, long-lasting withdrawals if not tapered properly. My symptoms are: when I am standing or sitting I feel super spacey and out of it and every once in a while I get the spins and a little disoriented. I also have the constant feeling of rocking on a boat. When I lie down or have my head in any kind of reclined position the rocking and spinning become SO intense. It is like I am on a boat violently rocking at sea and spinning in circles at the same time. It never changes until I stand up. This makes it so difficult to sleep and I feel more like I am blacking out drunk every night rather than just falling asleep. It wakes me up during the night and I feel so tired and disoriented in the morning and awake still spinning and rocking.\n\nMy vestibular testing showed borderline abnormal for the sensory organization test. ECOG is normal, ABR normal, rotary chair abnormal due to reduced gain across all frequencies accompanied with asymmetry. VNG was abnormal due to presence of bilaterally reduced responses for caloric irrigations..suggestive of bilateral vestibular dysfunction which may be peripheral or central in nature but no nystagmus. \n\nI do not know what most of that means but neuro sent me to vestibular therapy. The therapist is having a hard time figuring out exactly what to treat as my symptoms present differently than what she is used to. She is trying different maneuvers for BPPV but as there is no nystagmus she does not have a guide to go by. My eyelids actually start violently twitching rather than my eyes moving. This is the same feeling I get when I lie down. My eyelids start twitching and my eyeballs feel like they are going crazy but they are not actually moving. And it does not feel like the room is spinning..it feels like I am rocking and spinning. Sometimes if I am watching TV the whole TV will look like it is moving with the rocking sensation. \n\nBut the therapy makes me feel worse rather and I am not getting any answers.  I am in a complete fog all the time, cannot think straight, and just exhausted. I think I am going to lose my mind if this does not stop. It is having a severe impact on my mental health and I have literally wished for death just to make the violent spinning stop. \n\nNeuro now wants me to go back to ENT because I am having ear pain/pressure that feels more like maybe the nerves are inflamed. She could not see well inside one ear cause there was a piece of wax. So I used ear drops and it just feels like it is irritating things more. My ears also seem to hurt more when I lie down. And every once a while I get this weird whooshing feeling in my head and my hearing maybe goes out for a split second but it is so fast I cannot tell for sure.\n\nIs there anyone here with similar symptoms or any advice on where to go from here? Was it a benzo?   And how long ago? Try going to physio therapy. See if they can help. It was Cymbalta. I was on that and Wellbutrin together and started having scary high heart rate and symptoms of serotonin syndrome so my doctor had me stop Cymbalta cold turkey after being on it for 8 months. I was hospitalized with withdrawals. I have been off going on 3 years now. I jumped off Xanax and got BPPV at same time.  It was hard to know what was causing what.  I had some of the same issues but also just a really bad headache all the time.  \n\nMy vestibular therapist said dizziness and anxiety go hand in hand.  It is hard to know which is causing which.  \u201cYou got to get out of that loop\u201d.  \n\nFor me what helped:\n\n1). I started eating a lot better.  Clean and healthy and some intermittent fasting.  Laid off sugar and caffeine completely.  \n\n2). Excercised every day.  Lots of nature hikes.  Lots of resistance stuff.  Yoga.  Serotonin dies wonders on body and mood.  \n\n3.). Accupuncture.  I loved it.  Helped both the dizziness and the anxiety/stress that comes along with it.   Helped me relax.  \n\n4).  Physical therapy.  Not just going but doing all the homework religiously.  Yes, it can make you feel worse but it is supposed to.  It gave me confidence that I was taking control.  \n\n5). Therapeutic massage.  For me, this put me over the top.  My therapist said I was just really tense in shoulders and neck and that can exacerbate the problems.   I had three or four treatments and some take home work.  \n\n6). For me as well, my dentist said I was grinding the shit out of my teeth cuz of tension.  I got a mouth guard to wear at night.  He said it is all connected.   Tension that gets into jaw screws up blood flow to vestibular area.  \n\n7.). Started taking a good magnesium supplement.  \n\n8). My regular doc gave me Hydroxyzine for sleep.  It is like a stronger version Benadryl.  It helped with sleep.  I guess some also use it for anxiety.  I now swear by it.  \n\nAnyway.  Keep trying.  I felt shitty for about 4 months but the days I felt better were the days I kind of made up my mind to take control of the situation and not let it rule or ruin me. Thanks so much for your reply. I do 16:8 intermittent fasting, cut caffeine, and limited sugar. I force myself to swim for exercise every day. \nI will definitely look into acupuncture. But some things you said have really struck me. I have severe jaw, neck, and shoulder tension too. I was given a mouth guard but it did not work because I do not actually grind my teeth. I do this weird thing where I tense my jaw muscles by suctioning my tongue to the roof of my mouth. I am still able to do that with a mouth guard. I try to catch myself doing it throughout the day but it is completely involuntary and causes so much tension, especially at night. I also have severe anxiety and I have assumed they are connected but just the fact that it gets so much worse when I lie down makes it seem more positional? \n\nThank you again! I will work more on the jaw and neck tension Are you in VRT? I wonder if this could help you.", "Feeling it mentally New here and well I have not been diagnosed with bppv yet but I go aug 20 (the soonest I could get in) to get this ball rolling. I have suffered for about 10 years just waking up not being able to get out of bed and my eyes going crazy. I just usually do the epley then move on. But lately I have been developing a fear of the dizziness. I usually have a little dizziness throughout the day. Not sure if it is brain fog/boat feeling from bppv or anxiety or if I am having problems sleeping. I just wanted to say that sometimes the dizziness well I just cannot take it. I fear when I am laying down if I will wake up dizzy or not. And I usually have to sleep on a certain side or else my head feels weird. Thanks for being here. No one in my family gets it or understands. I know this fear all too well. It sucks! It will mentally get better though with time. Hang in there. 10 years is quite the long time to go feeling that way so it is great that you are getting in somewhere in a few weeks. You are not alone, and you are not at all crazy. A battle against your mental is probably the worst fight to do. Me, this is my 29th day fighting with constant vertigo and dizziness. A friend told me something that is STILL HARD for me but it helps alot. You said you suffered with this for 10 years so you are a veteran. Do not get me wrong I never want to be alone out of fear but one thing I always tell myself is that every time I get this vertigo it will not kill you. It is annoying and super scary but you are not alone in fearing it. I still fear it. But it will not do anything physically to us. It takes time to control your fear but you will be able to. Everything takes time. Dont let the fear control your life. Let the dizziness come, wait for it to finish and continue your life. Sweetie, I am sorry you have been going through this for 10 years. You are so brave for getting this all checked out now so you can get back to health! I have read about plenty of people who dealt with this for as long as you have, or longer, and they were able to get relief. I completely understand the fear of the dizziness, as I am struggling horribly with anticipatory anxiety. Have you always mainly felt the dizziness in the morning when you first got up, and just recently you have felt it more throughout the day? What type of doctor are you going to be seeing on August 20th? That is the day after my birthday, so I will be eating a piece of cake for luck for you! ;) \n\nEveryone here has been very kind and understanding, and we all empathize. If you ever feel like you would like to reach out, feel free to send me a chat or DM. Would love to hear all about your progress in August, too! Be well, and be gentle and kind to yourself. xo i guess this is the right mindset for bppv. i am always trying to think like this when my vertigo attacks, it kind of helps me mentally and chills me down. It is hard though, when the vertigo happens I literally cannot think anything but holding on to something, only after the initial dizziness is when i can actually think and tell myself im okay. yeah i cannot even open my eyes when it hits and that is really tough situation to set a chill mindset lol Really for me its the complete opposite!! i cannot close my eyes. I feel as if i close my eyes then I would just be spinning and spinning. You are brave ! i guess that is my own strategy to my vertigo lol. when i close my eyes i can trick my brain like it is not happening but when i move or touch anything my brain tries to calculate my position and i feel bad again.\n\nbtw what do you use for med? i use dramamine when i feel so dizzy. I do not take anything, they gave me meclizine, hated it so i just take the blows you should ask for dramamine to you doctor. that is one hell of a life saver. it dodges my nausea when the world is spinning like crazy. Is not that motion sickness medication?? yeah but it mostly effects the nausea feeling and helps you not to vomit when vertigo hits. Honestly have not really got nausea yet with it. I mean most I have gotten was like super flush and feeling like I could faint but that is it. But im sure that is because I would stand up when I would get the vertigo oh then our vertigos can be at different stages for sure, so the medication should be also different for us.\nhope we all get better my friend, stay safe.", "Just got a cervicogenic vertigo diagnosis - now what? Hello everyone! After finally having ENTs rule out an inner ear condition (Meniere's, BPPV, etc), and now two neurologists ruled out vestibular migraine, I have been given the diagnosis of cervicogenic vertigo o  account of a severe neck strain due to scoliosis coupled with poor posture. The vertigo I experience all the time is rocking on a boat and only happens with sitting or lying down. I also get severe headaches, head heaviness and tingling in my face and tongue. \n\nMy question is - now what? Unfortunately all the specialists have told me that this is not their area of expertise, but have not advised what to do next. All I have been prescribed with is a muscle relaxer.\n\nFellow cervical vertigo suffers, what have you found helpful in your recovery journey? What are some of the next steps taken?\n\nThank you in advance! \ud83d\ude0a How did they rule out vestibular migraine ? Neurologists said that typically vestibular migraines patients have a history of migraines and motion sickness both of which I do not have, and also based on diagnostic imaging tests they ran. As well, anecdotally, the headache pain I have is in the typical cervical area (I top of neck where it meets your skull) and when I had to go to ER a week ago they pumped me with migraine meds and the pain did not ease, also deducing it was not a migraine. Ahh okay. Did anyone recommend physical therapy? I was already in vestibular physiotherapy when I started getting dizzy a couple months ago (original diagnosis was Meniere's) but when I mentioned cervical vertigo the PT seemed kind of unsure of how to approach it :/ Ahh, I mean like manual therapy, not vestibular therapy. Did they say it was due to CCI (craniocrvical instability) or SCM pain (Sternocleidomastoid), etc. My physical therapist told me I had some trigger points that were aggravated and they did some dry needling and it helped me a lot. I have heard a bunch of things - I have heard that I have instability due to a forward head posture and scoliosis, but also a couple different PTs and RMTs have identified my suboccipital and sternocleidomastoid as problem muscles because that is where I am getting my pain.\n\nThank for the info, did you only do the dry needling or other things too? Oh sorry, I have had a little bit of manual therapy mostly on my back and shoulders for the scoliosis. I had a chiropractor do soft tissue release of the suboccipital but that was incredibly painful and actually made my vertigo worse. Did you have a standing upright MRI? That is usually how they check for CCI. \n\nYeah, I also had trigger points on my SCM and suboccipital. I had this headache that literally lasted a whole month 24/7 along with the dizziness and vertigo. Also had a tingling scalp? Lol I was in a bad car accident a couple years ago and I guess the damage took a couple years to catch up to me....I also have some health issues that could cause me to have issues with my muscles as well. So... I could have had true BPPV as well as neck issues but I am not sure lol bc I had some relief from the Epley\n\nI did dry needling, physical therapy, trigger point massages, vestibular rehabilitation for gaze instability and eventually was prescribed muscle relaxers to take at night. Took me a few months but now i am okay. I had to adjust my sleeping habits like sleeping on my back to help my neck.\n\nNow, I no longer have vertigo, headaches or pain from my neck but I can tell if  I get the gaze instability and slight wobble dizzy feeling when things are getting tense. I will massage it or go get dry needling done and I am fine.\n\nHope this helps. xx Thank you so much for this incredible reply, I am so happy to hear that you were able to control and manage it. Literally we have the exact same symptoms. The ER doctor and neurologist were so shocked I was not in a car accident because they said I am presenting like a whiplash or concussion patient.\n\nThis is so incredibly helpful, I will tell my massage therapist and vestibular therapist all these things and see if my treatment plan will be similar.\n\nThank you again, this is so helpful! You are very welcome. I hope you get to feeling better soon! Happy holidays! xx Thank you, same to you as well! Stay safe out there.", "Is there any other way of curing BPPV then the maneuvers? + A feeling of dizziness when trying to focus the gaze I have bleeding vains in my eye and I cannot be doing any rapid motions and so because of this I cannot have the maneuvers done. Is there any other way to put the otholits back in their place? \n\n+Do you guys also feel like you cannot focus your gaze and when you try you get dizzy?", "A question about continuing Epley exercises I developed positional vertigo feeling 5+ days ago, perhaps from hitting my face on a bookcase, or a dentist trip earlier in the week.\n\nHad spins every time I moved my head some ways, or lay down, that lasted up to a minute, and strong nausea and a feeling of dizziness.\n\nMy eyes did the slow drift one way, fast flick back, which I understand now is called nystagmus.\n\nThanks to information from a member of this sub, I learnt about and tried the Dix Hallpike manoeuvre and worked out what side was affected. \n\nThe Epley exercises made a difference the first time, it improved about 20%, the next time even more. \n\nNow it is day 2 and after a 3rd session it is settled down almost completely, and I can do most activities again with only very minor dizziness.\n\nHow long do people think it is helpful to continue the exercises after the nystagmus has settled down?\n\nIs it likely to reoccur now it is happened once?\n\nI value your input as you are people who have actually experienced it.\n\nMine seems to be resolving pretty fast so probably a very mild case. \n\nI will be seeing my doc soon for my flu shot, will get him to check me over to be sure there is no underlying problems. I am glad you were able to find help from this forum! The info I am going to provide, is what I have learned from my vestibular therapist. There may be other advice and options from others. Once you can lay back with the first step of the Epley (which is the Dix Hallpike), and be free of the 30ish seconds of extreme vertigo and nystagmus - you can stop doing the Epley maneuver. Many have questioned if it is helpful to continue the exercise. So far - the general consensus is that once the crystal is back where it belongs, there is no need to do the Epley any longer. It is controversial whether you still need to be cautious for a while by keeping your head upright, and not sleeping on the effected side.  Just to ensure the crystal does not creep back out into your inner ear canal and cause problems.  My therapist told me I could immediately go back to all normal things and not worry about head placement. She said this is what the newest studies are showing (this info was from February 2020). Nonetheless, I was careful for a few days - just to be safe.  As it is a small gesture to do, to help ensure BPPV does not strike again.\n\nUnfortunately BPPV can occur again.  I have had it 4 times in the past 3 years. It was only this LAST time that it got super bad and I got more proactive about seeing a specialist. I am hoping since I truly cleared the crystal this time (versus letting it get better on it is own), that it will not come back! Fingers crossed!  Others have only had it happen once. There seems to be no rhyme or reason with most cases.\n\nHopefully, since you caught yours right away and corrected it - you will not have residual dizziness.  If you do - do not let it scare you.  Mine has lasted 3 months (and I had BPPV for 2 months and did the Epley 20 times over the 2 months). The best advice for the residual dizziness is to challenge it to help your system get re-balanced more quickly. Like - if looking up/down makes you a bit dizzy, do it 15 times in a row - 3 times a day. Eventually do it while walking.\n\nKudos to you for researching and getting yourself back on track! And it is still very smart to have your doctor check you over for any underlying conditions and to make sure you are healthy! Thanks, it is actually your advice that helped me, and I wanted to credit you, but I had a blank of your user name while creating the post.\n\nI do have some residual dizziness but it is not too bad, and seems to be getting less fairly quickly so I think it will be gone soon. \n\nI will follow what you have advised regards just being a bit careful for a few days, just from an abundance of caution.\n\nIt is definitely a relief not to have to watch which way I move my head, have balance issues already from a neuromuscular disorder, so the vertigo and dizziness caused me a few problems.\n\nYou have my empathy, having to go through this multiple times would be highly unpleasant. \n\nThanks again for your help, saved me a lot of time and suffering. I am so happy that my info helped you! That warms my heart.  Best wishes to you! Different doctors have different protocols, my PT recommended not doing the Epley every day. They had me do the maneuver a couple of times through, then wait at least 3 days to see if it made any difference. During those days I avoided quick head movements. At a certain point the crystal moved to a different canal and the Epley no longer worked (lucky me) and I needed to use a different maneuver. I think the reason for waiting a few days is because if you successfully move the crystal with the maneuver there is a chance it could move back out of place if you do the maneuver again. That is definitely good to know thanks, I will stop doing it and be careful for a few days now it has mostly improved.\n\nBetter than chancing it moving around again.\n\nHas yours resolved altogether now? It sounds more complex to manage. Mine is resolved now, it took a couple of months because of the crystal moving to a different canal, plus they said I was a stubborn case. They ended up using a vibrating thing on my head right behind the ear. Lol. I have been good for a few months now although I am still paranoid about it coming back. Hope you get yours resolved quickly. I did the eply 2 times. One session every week with a PT. I felt immediate relief after the first and waited a week to see if it would settle. I did not follow post exercise instructions and it came out again so I had to go back and do it one more time. After the second time I no longer had the vertigo and went back a couple more times to do vestibular rehabilitation exercises for the residual dizziness.\n\nFingers crossed that you got the otolith settled! \n\nLink for after treatment instructions, this is important. I slept on my side after my first treatment bc I misunderstood what I was told and felt so much better I thought I was good to go lol :\n\n My therapist actually just had me doing the Epley once a week.... (during therapy) but we would do it twice. Essentially the second time was to test it to see if it worked. Eventually she told me I could do it mid week as well (as mine was stubborn too). As passesopenwindows mentions, there are different opinions on doing the Epley. My therapist did not want me to overdo it (plus it made me so sick). Others say to do it often &amp; daily. Thanks and that is really good info cheers!! \n\nI have of course gone straight back to laying on affected side and shaved with head up and extended lol\n\nI will try for the other side and be careful shaving and hope I have not stuffed up.\n\nIt is interesting that even though the otolith is settled there is still residual dizziness for a bit. \n\nI am still a bit dizzy today but it seems to be improving a bit more every day which is a positive sign :-) I had a bit of a stubborn bout - I apparently had some fine dust still floating around. At my highest I did the epley 9 times a day - that is very extreme though. In any event, if performed properly, the epley cannot actually cause harm, I.e it will not displace new crystals, might just jiggle the already displaced ones. \n\nRecurrence - studies are divided but I think it was smth like 80% relapse over 5 yrs, with 50% of recurrent cases developed in the first year. Having said that, there are predisposing factors that will make it more likely to get it again - vit D deficiency, high blood pressure, high glicemia, being a woman Those are not great odds that is for sure. \n\nThanks for this info, it is helpful to have some idea of the possible outcomes and to know about the epley. \n\nMy health history puts me at risk them, but at least I now know what to do next bout. \n\nI never knew about the ear rocks until this happened, I am guessing like a lot of us that get it.\n\nIt must have been a lot of work to get dust to settle, how long did it take for you to recover? A while, but I had other vestibular issues, so it is not conclusive what was down to BPPV. \n\nHey, odds are just odds! Plus do not forget that most people do not even go to the doctor to treat it - so presumably those studies are done on people for which it was \u2018serious enough\u2019 to see a doc, so probs more than mild cases. You cannot have those studies be representative enough, especially with relatively small sample groups. Same goes with this subreddit imo - it is probably more complicated cases that lurk/post here, not just the mild one that discount it as just the \u2018dizzies\u2019. So do not feel discouraged! \n\nSo stay positive and take care of yourself! Thanks, I appreciate your response.\n\nI am used to unfavourable odds and not anxious that the bppv symptoms will come back. \n\nI have a rare peripheral nerve hyperexcitability disorder that the odds of getting are about a half million to one.\n\nIt is like winning the reverse lottery lol \n\nMy balance is not great because it affects my entire peripheral nervous system so having the head spins as well was a problem.\n\nThankfully the epley worked so far for me fairly quickly, I got lucky getting only a mild bout.\n\nFunctioning with those bouts of head spins long term sounds pretty unpleasant, the nausea is no fun at all either. Update please! Thanks for asking, I am doing really well with it at this point, I have not had any more bad head spins, which has been great.\n\nI still have a little bit of dizziness and nausea here and there if I tilt my head way over to the left to look under something.\n\nBut that is not something I have to do much, so does not happen a lot. \n\nOff to see my doc in a few days, and see what he thinks, but it is pretty much settled down now I am hoping.\n\nWanted to get there sooner but have not been well enough, so this community was very helpful. Hi, just saw this post from a months ago from you. Just wondering if you did any exercises at home for balance stuff when you had this?\n\nNot talking about the epley, but exercises. Thank you so much I had a bunch of exercises to retrain my balance &amp; vestibular system. Each week... My therapist added on more &amp; increased the difficulty.", "New to having BPPV question Hi all, I have recently been diagnosed with BPPV and have been getting through it okay. This bout lasted for about 2 weeks when I would tilt my head a certain way. Been to my GP and was told it was BPPV which is what I expected. It went away and left me with tinnitus in my affected right ear which is still ongoing. I have been free of the vertigo for the last 2 weeks after it slowly went away with no treatment.\n\nTonight I looked up and sideways and have felt a moderate amount of vertigo again. While it does not feel like it is back completely I am wondering if a small relapse is normal for someone with BPPV. Is it normal for it to come back so fast or am I still in the stages of waiting for it to go away and this is just a small relapse? I am really not sure how it works completely. I suffer from anxiety and depression and this has impacted my mental health quite badly. I thought it was getting better and now that I have felt it again it is put me back in a slump. I have had it on and off for 12 months now. Annoying as fuck, but keep getting told it is not dangerous. Just unlucky that it keeps coming back. Worst case lasted for 6 weeks straight. Thanks for the response. I never talked to my doc about what would come next so I kind of expected it to just go away once it began to wane, I guess it is a bit different to anything I have experienced before. I had it for 3 days, then nothing for 25 days, and now its been back the last few days.  So far it seems mostly unpredictable, I cannot figure out when it is going to come back.  But I think tracking it on a calendar will help to see what you personally are experiencing. Did you get the epley manoeuvre? Did you see a vertigo specialist? Most ENTs are not experienced enough, not even to mention GPs I have not had the Epley yet, I will be looking at going to see a neuro-physio in the near future if it does not go away. I have a muscle weakness disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy so it takes me a while to be able to leave the house to go and do things which is why I have not gotten onto seeing anyone sooner.", "Best things to do while waiting for an appointment with ENT? I had what I believe to be BPPV about a month and a half ago.  Vomitting and dizziness -- you know the drill.  Urgent care doc gave me meclizine and  ondansetron.  It became manageable.  I got an appointment still with primary care a couple weeks ago just to talk through it.  The trend has been better and better so he was like give it two weeks, if it is still there than see an ENT.  Well last night I had the feeling I got the first time while laying in bed (laying in bed and looking onto my left side I think is the pattern that triggers it).  I woke up this morning and feel the nausea coming on (watering mouth sensation...feeling before puking).  I took some of the leftover ondansetron from my first prescription and seem to be feeling better but still feeling a little weird in the head.  I plan on taking the ondensetron until I can get an appointment probably.  I have one days worth of Meclizine that I did not finish the first time around to have some in reserve in case it comes back again and it will give me time to get another prescription...cuz that first bout really sucked.  I have sent a request to a ENT doctor for an appointment and waiting to hear back.  Should I take the meclizine?  Or try to take the least amount of meds as possible so doc can see almost full effect of BPPV...also considering I do not know when I will be able to get an appointment?  Should I try to get a refill on meclizine? If you need some more meclizine in a pinch, you can take Bonine, which is OTC. You may need to do the epley a few times to get it to work. I also did not realize it, but I was not doing it long enough. I would shoot for 30-60 seconds and make sure your keep your head upright all day and sleep on 2 pillows. The last time I had an episode it took about 2 weeks for me to go bs k to normal and 2 Epleys. Oh thanks, I will keep Bonine in mind especially since I am traveling soon.  Just to clarify, are you trying to say that you would have solved your previous episode faster if you would have done more than two epleys?  I was planning to do one a day. Probably but I was being a baby and did not want to do it again. The second time I did it and held the positions longer it was gone within 2 days. got it thanks!", "PT said there is a 50% chance of it happening again within 5 years. What is your experience with this? I am F27 and I also have vestibular migraines. (Found out in the same visit.)\n\nI am terrified of this happening again, I have never felt so bad in my entire life. It sucks. I would suggest having a good management plan in place - ie, a pt who you can go to immediately as soon as you start feeling symptoms (and also to really learn what your symptoms are, sometimes they can be deeply confusing) and friends/families/other caregivers who can be aware of what you may need to support you. Since prevention (outside of living a relatively balanced lifestyle - and for me, minimizing stress and sleeping well seems to be crucial in that) is not really an option, a contingency plan is key. I do not hve any advice for migraines, I apologize! \n\nThis subreddit is also pretty good for advice on symptom management. Wishing you the best of luck! My therapist said the same.  But she also said the first time is usually the worst.  Got that going for us. My dad has had this condition for a long time and gets episodes many times a year, but was told by his PT that it is likely so bad because for years he never got it treated. My first episode was a year ago and I have yet to have another one but I got treated by a PT immediately. Fingers crossed. It took 7 years for it to come back for me. I thought it was in the past, part of my history. Nope, it is more intrusive now. Best of luck I have had it three separate times. First time was far and away the worst. The other two were not pleasant, but they were all aside to resolve. Hopefully I experience this too next time.\nI felt like I was dying\u2026 \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb I read online that ear infections can cause this and I have been having them on and off for a little over a year now\u2026 so maybe getting that under control will help my go another 7 years! Stress is always the hardest thing for me to manage.\ud83d\ude13 Same for me the first time! I wish you the best! Yep. I have had 4 episodes altogether, maybe 5. First one was roughly 18 years ago. The first one was the worst, although my last one was pretty bad simply because it was stubborn and took a while to get resolved. Two were brought on by yoga, one by sit-ups so now I am paranoid about doing any exercises that involve laying down on my back. Ears for sure. Eschuan tubes (sorry idk how to spell it) issues can be a cause. For me I have narrow ear canals that also do not go straight to the drum but rather have a curve to them, and that also causes me to be prone to heavy ear wax build up. Ear issues can affect balance, which can affect vertigo, which paired with pressure on the ear drum that can cause migraines, makes for a hell of a life. Lol.\n\nI really got to get around to typing out my entire condition on here and see what others think it is and what to do about it. I was diagnosed with BPPV by my primary, but he is not the greatest doctor at all, and did not offer any treatment. You know that sounds similar to me. Narrow canals and quick, heavy wax build up. Have you ever heard if the elephant ear irrigation system? Absolutely game changer to own one. I can clean my ears at home for free (lesser hydrogen peroxide costs) whenever I want, and I have gotten many a large wax out in the past. (Should I have put a warning before having said that?)\n\nAnyways, ( Never heard of that but definitely going to look into it! Haha it is like grossly satisfying to get all the wax out. I just edited my previous post to add a link. $30 and I have gotten full on jelly beans out before. Has reduced the number of migraines I get. Haha jelly beans. I have not tried this one but did try something similar last winter and the spray hitting my ear made the room start spinning! Might not be able to. Ahh, I have an important question to ask then! Was the liquid you sprayed in cold/cool by chance? Or even slightly below room temp? You need to use lightly luke warm liquid in order for that not to happen. Too cold and your equilibrium will be thrown way off. I use fairly warm water mixed with hydrogen peroxide as it mixes to end up a luke warm solution thay works great.\n\nSometimes I like it specifically warm too. But not hot obviously. I do not really remember. My PT said the same. Because it happened once, you are sub susceptible to it happening again. \n\nMy first episode was winter of 2019. My currently episode happened earlier this year. Was a breeze compared to the first time. I get BPPV several times a year.  It is not very scary anymore, just more of an annoyance.  Once I knew how to tackle them with the maneuvers and knew that the episodes would always pass, I felt a lot more at ease. \n\nI definitely avoid triggers though and get nervous if I am in any position that can bring it on.", "Tips to find out which ear is the culprit? Hey all, I am having a BPPV thing again. But this time it is a lot more faint and I cannot tell for the life of me which ear is the problem. I did the whole \"lie on it and see\" thing but I cannot tell.\n\nAnyone got any tips? Thanks. The Dix Hallpike test is the most commonly used technique to test which side is effected.  This detects if the most common ear canal is the culprit.  If it is one of the other 4 canals, there are more specialized tests - and also specialists use goggles to watch the nystagmus of your eyes, as the direction they twitch help indicate which canal is effected as well.  Google Dix Halpike  - it is also the first step to the Epley maneuver. Close your eyes and move your head around while standing. Took me years to figure out it was mostly on the right since any direction give me dizziness when I have an attack Yeah, this is the one I tried a few times but I could not tell. It was a lot more holistically awful (?) this time. When I tried to sleep I discovered I could not lie on my right side because the world started spinning so that is how I ended up figuring it out.\n\nI am mostly back to normal but I have the hugest headache. Yay. Anyway, thanks for the help stranger. This whole thing sucks but it makes me feel better people like you are out there. With this, you would be able to tell because the world would be spinning clockwise (towards the right)? I kind of have a general feeling of awfulness and it is hard to pinpoint things in that state. I just \u201cfigured It out\u201d based on the intensity. Move my head to the left with eyes closed, pretty dizzy. Move it to the right, more than pretty dizzy. Mine is not as isolated to left or right as most though. Alright, thank you. I will try that next time. Glad you are feeling better!  BPPV sucks. No doubt about it. I was super fortunate with my last episode to find an awesome vestibular therapist.  I saw her weekly for over 2 months. It took THAT long to correct my stubborn case.  I learned a ton from her, as she continued to test me (in case the crystal moved to a different ear canal), and treat me. Hope that headache subsides soon!  Thanks for checking back in.", "BPPV? Pregnancy a trigger? I have been experiencing a sensation lately that feels like motion sickness, but it lasts almost all the time. I have only had the \u201croom spins\u201d once or twice and it is only for a few seconds. The motion sickness sensation gets worse when I tilt my head. Oddly enough the few rooms spins I have had happened while I was seated and looked down at my phone without moving my head. Do you think this is BPPV? Ive been dealing with this since the birth of my first child 3 years ago. It improved but came back when I had my second child 7 months ago. Is pregnancy a known trigger? Thanks.  No one can be sure of course, but I do not think it is BPPV. BPPV would probably not be triggered by eye movements alone. It is triggered by head movements that make the crystals in the labyrinth move. Eye movements alone should not cause that.  You do say that tilting your head makes the motion sickness \"worse\"...but you do not say that it triggers the episode.  Frankly, from your description I am not sure what you mean by motion sickness. Is that feeling the room moving but not spinning?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo one seems to know what is a \"trigger\" of BPPV. I feel strongly that mine was caused by a flight I took and I have heard a few people here say that. But I have not seen anything written saying that flying increases the chances of BPPV. A flight I took also triggered mine! I already slightly had it, but I took a flight with a sinus infection (I did not have a choice) &amp; it just has not been the same since.  What I mean by \u201cmotion sickness\u201d is that it feels like I have been in a car on a Windee road and I am feeling woozy. There is no spinning, but it is a feeling of uneasiness and being slightly off balance. I have never fallen, though. What you describe sounds a lot different than my BPPV experience. Of course I can not be sure you do not have it. Just does not sound like what I experienced.  Interesting. Others have said the same thing...but I never seen any medical literature suggesting that flying is a risk....and today I flew with a sinus infection.....", "Very weird symptom/feel like my head is never in the correct place! Hey everyone. I started getting nausea with movement and some dizziness at the beginning of this year. Now for some reason, once I lay down or even if I am walking it feels like my head is not really in the \u201cright\u201d place or something and I have to tilt it down to feel comfortable in space so to speak. Or if I am laying down I feel like I need to sit up and look down for my vestibular system to feel comfortable. It can feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable when it is at its worst and feels like I never have a second throughout the day where I do not feel off. I know this is a very odd symptom but I just wanted to see if anyone else experiences it. Oddly enough, I used to dry heave all the time with nausea and the nausea has improved greatly since then, but now I just have this every off/dizzy feeling.

Keep a diary of your symptoms and if it continues make an appointment with your doc/ent.\n\nThings to keep a diary of on a daily basis:\n- length of attack\n- symptoms (rotational spinning, nausea, ear ringing, pressure in ear, hearing loss) \n- if you have any ear symptoms, Mark which ear, L or R\n\nNot all of those symptoms are bppv-specific but encapsulate some things under the umbrella of vertigo.\n\nEye focus issues might signify migraine if that may be applicable to you. Although your dizziness/vertigo does not seem similar to my diagnosed BPPV - I did develop gaze instability because of the length of my vertigo and my lack of moving my head and eyes to try to avoid it.  I saw a vestibular therapist that specializes in dizziness.  She did tests to my head movement and eyes and saw gaze instability, very similar to what you mentioned.  Because of this, I had almost constant dizziness (along with the positional BPPPV) when I was just sitting still, trying to watch TV, just closing my eyes, or looking at things. She gave me exercises that helped tremendously! You can google it and try those excercises.  Also, please go in and get checked out by a doc or therapist if you can. I also agree that it could be migraine related.  The spectrum of migraine's and their symptoms are way bigger than I ever imagined! Not always just a 'headache.'", "Your symptoms of bppv Im curious to know about other peoples symptoms, escpecially the psychological ones. Please share your expirience with this illness, it would help me to have someone to relate to. I have had mine for 4 months now.

I feel almost the same as you . I performed epley at the clinic 3 times .I am on the boat while writing my comment .add that I do not have any support as this bppv is not common in my community .I do not go out completely I am afraid \ud83d\ude1f The room would spin for me. I was bedbound for about 4 months. \nI was vomiting constantly so I was on constant gravol so I slept a lot. \nBeing up things were spinning and wooshy... kind of like you put on glasses that do not belong to you. \nI was depressed, I felt like it would not ever stop. I started to get very suicidal ideation towards the last month because I felt like I would never get better. \n\nNow I believe I have some ptsd over it any time I get a little wooshy or light headed I panic that its coming back and I start to have an anxiety attack. Im scared every day that it is going to happen again. \n\nI also put on a lot of weight because I was bed bound and could only do take out cause I could not cook. So I am not loving myself right now. Cannot stand to look at myself and avoid the mirror. Its impacting my relationship not on his side. He does not care about that by any means and he is been super supportive but my confidence and self esteem is completely trashed. \n\nI also still cannot be bent over for more than a few seconds and I cannot be up high like on a step ladder or anything other wise I get lightheaded/dizzy. \n\nIts been almost a year since I first got bppv. We do not know why I did. It came out of no where. I just remember that a few days before the room spinning started I was not feeling the best and then bam it happened. Has anyone had tinnitus or their tinnitus got  louder in both ears after a BPPV attack? Thank u so much, i really appreciate you saying that. That sounds awful. I had to take over a month off school cuz I was not able to leave the house, mostly because of the anxiety that this illness caused me. I have been going to physical therapy for about two months now, and slowly having less frequent attacks. Still struggling with the brainfog and derealisation. That is very closely related to how i feel. Especially The thing about the glasses!! I have been saying that for weeks! Did that make you depersonalised? Did you feel like you were \u201cnot inside your body\u201d almost? At it is worst i could be so derealised that it felt like my dreams were more real than reality itself. I think this stems heavily from the severe anxiety i have been experiencing. I actually lost weight when i first got it cuz i was so anxious and nauseous that I was not able to eat properly. So sorry u had to go trough that. Do u feel totally normal now or do u still struggle with residual dizziness? Sometimes. I have pulsatile tinnitus that gets triggered when im stressed for long periods of time. I have not had that in over 2 years, but it came back when i got bppv. I have experienced normal tinnitus during or after attacks, but only a few times Sometimes I felt like I was not in my body and sleeping was an escape because I was not dizzy in my dreams. \nIt got really hard because sometimes I would need to go pee so bad and because of slow I had to go there were a couple times I did not even make it in time. It was very dehumanizing. \n\nI still get a little like if I roll over a certain way or if I get up on a step ladder or if I am bent over too long. But its so fast and resolves so quickly that I am gaslighting myself. \"Did I actually feel that? Or am I just so scared to feel it that I am imagining it\" \n\nOnce I found something to kill the nausea which was gravol I was able to eat. But I could not do anything else so for 4ish months I was in bed on my left side because it was the only side I could be on and eat but it was all take out but take out is expensive so I would go with the cheapest which was fast food so it did not help. \n\nBecause it was the very beginning of lock down for us no one could come help. No one could come bring food. No one could come cook. My bf came when he could but it was not often. And I have a kid that needed to be fed as well but he is too young to cook proper meals himself. \n\nI am scared every day. And as that year approaches I am get more scared. Is it going to come back? Am I going to have another bout. Am I going to be bed ridden again? \nWill I be all alone again? Will my kid suffer again? I feel crazy half the time and on top of that no one really understands how bad it was or how bad it still affects me. Because you do not know and you cannot know until you have gone through it yourself. You know? Some people think I should not be still having some residual affects or that I should not still have anxiety about it. But I cannot help that. It was one of the worst 4 months of my life and I have been through hell before but I would not wish this on my worst enemy. It completely effs you up. And people do not get that unless they have been through it. Are you positive you have BPPV? Your symptoms sound like it could be another Vestibular disorder. I do have close contact with my doctor and a physical therapist, and both have checked me multiple times and diagnosed me with bppv. He also said that i had \u00abvery typical bppv\u00bb and that the fact that treatment is making it better is a clear sign that it is in fact bppv I have had BPPV for a month, but last week cleared one ear, likely cleared the other in the last 2 days. The only random attack I had was the first one. But I felt really depressed week 2-3, had severe headaches (also stopped coffee at that time), my hearing has been sensitive. With the depression came a lack of energy and a loss of appetite. I am already anxious and BPPV skyrocketed my general anxiety. I am probably going to leave all the forums soon. Searching obsessively was not helping me. My balance was off, but it is improving. I noticed that when I successfully relocated crystals I felt horrible the next day. My PT last Friday performed an Epley on my left side and moved a crystal and I was really off balance for 6 hours. I vomited 2 hours after the procedure. I did Epley for 3 weeks with no change then did the BBQ roll in the middle of the night and cleared my right ear. Things are getting better for me. Do the exercises, see the right people, you will get better. That sounds awful, and you have my deepest sympathy. One thing i would say is try to not let the fear of bppv returning stop you from living your life normally. Im very interested to hear more, Could you go more in depth about how you felt while expiriencing bppv? Did you feel it all the time? How did you feel mentally? How did you know that it was getting better? Well I woke up one day just sick, physically sick and the room was spinning. Just completely out of nowhere. I went to sleep the night before as normal and woke up dizzy and puking. I felt off for about a week prior but no slight dizziness, no nausea or anything. Just bam. \nI did not know what was wrong. I thought I was just sick. So I stayed in bed and for about a week kept puking and dealing with the dizziness and room spinning. If I moved the room would spin worse. My left side was the only way I could lay without dizziness but I would still be puking. \nAfter a week I went to the hospital. They gave me gravol and did blood work. Gave me IV fluids because I was severely dehydrated and told me it was bppv and sent me home with a prescription that was supposed to help reduce or get rid of the dizziness. It did not.\nAnother week later I went to physio. They confirmed it was bppv. They did the epley (sp?) And it did not work but she said she is never seen any body's eyes move as much as mine. Or whatever the eyes do. Idk she did not specify. \nI went to physio maybe 6 times? The second to last time I went I noticed a slight improvement. But it was still bad. Then I went the last time and still had symptoms but before I was due to call and make my next appointment it eased off and I was able to be up. I had a hard time moving or doing anything. I had to have help with a lot of stuff. I still need help with some stuff and its been almost a year since I first had symptoms. \n\nMy symptoms were constant. It never eased. Never went away until the second last appointment when it started to ease off. It took its toll mentally. I had already been off work for about a month or so because I needed to regulate my mental health. I had hit a bad low with my bipolar. But then the bppv started and I was off work for a good 6 months I think start to finish. At first mentally it was not so bad. I was upset because I did not understand what was going on or why and I could not fix it. I felt bad because my son (10 y/o) was basically on his own to do things. The longer it went on the more depressed I got because it felt like it would never end. Especially once I started going to physio and it was not helping. I kept thinking \"if this does not stop if I have to live like this I cannot live like this I will kill myself if I have to live like this\" \n\nOnce I started to recover and was able to be up and try and do stuff like my mom took me to get groceries but I had to walk very slowly, was out of breath quickly and would break out in a sweat and I would have to stop and sit. I could not lift anything heavy so carrying in groceries was a no go. \n\nThe only reason I knew it was getting better was because there was a reduction in my symptoms. The room spinning was not as bad. The room spinning eased up and I did not need as much gravol. I was awake longer periods of time. I was able to do things I enjoyed more. One night I was able to slowly roll onto my right side and once I settled as long as I did not move then I could stay that way. Before I could not be on my right side at all otherwise the room would continously spin. \n\nNow I still have wooshy moments on occasion. I cannot be bent over very long. I cannot be up high. I put on quite a bit of weight because all we could eat was take out. My son put on weight because I could not get him outside and all he ate was take out. So I have a lot of guilt about it. My lower back feels like it is going to give out if I am standing too long. Sometimes if I roll over it almost feels whooshy but I am not sure that its actually happening. Because I put on weight its hard to do things. Walking a lot is hard or doing anything physical is hard and wears me out quickly. If I go get groceries that is it I am done for the day. I work a 4 hour shift ( work from home) and I am exhausted. Everything feels like it takes so much more effort. The weight has had its toll on me mentally as well. I was already overweight and so I feel worse about myself. Hate the way I look and cannot even stand to look at myself. Hate being touched. \n\nI am slowly trying to work out a plan to help myself lose the weight but I am scared the exercise will set me off. So I will take it slowly which is okay. I just want to be healthy and want to set a healthy example for my son. \n\nI logically know everything will be okay but the ptsd is real with this so it will be slow going to normal. Im so sorry that you have to go trough this, but my experience is very much like yours, so you are not the only one. My bppv was not sudden at all. I just started feeling \u201coff\u201d and dizzy. I had the worst anxiety of my life, thinking i was going absolutely crazy. I have never had anxiety before in my life. I was off school for a month because i woke up every day with anxiety and I could not eat or sleep properly. Maybe a few weeks of this getting worse i started  Having dizzyspells (only a few times) and those where another kind of horrible. I started puking a lot, and again, was not able to eat properly. I realised then that i probably was not crazy, and that something is actually happening to my body, since its reacting like this. I started new medications at the same time my bppv startet, so i thought maybe that was it. I stopped taking it instantly after my to first puking spells, and had to power trough the symptoms of that as well as the bppv. I had close contact with my doctor at this time and after two weeks he said that it is probably not the medications that is doing this, and tested me for bppv. He told me the best way was to \u201cwait it out\u201d, so i did. After two months of trying to let the bppv \u201cburn out\u201d i realised that i needed to see someone who could do something about it. I have been to physio since. He told me i had very typical bppv and that statement helped me a lot mentally. I still struggle with anxiety a lot and the feeling that it is never going away. I got motbidly depressed at some point, thinking \u201cif i have to live like this, ill kill myself\u201d over and over while crying profusely.  \n\nIt is been 11 days and I have not had a dizzy spell since i met my physical therapist last (which is a lot) and i think that means im recovering. I still have the dizzyness and \u201coffness\u201d which scares me but i try to think that it will subside as well. As you said, i also feel as though i can enjoy things more, even though the symptoms is not gone. I will probably never be able to live life like i used to again mentally after this. It completely fucked me up and i really thought my body was giving up or that i was just going crazy. This feeling probably stems heavily from the anxiety. In many ways ill say that it helped me a lot as well. It made me think about my life, my values, and most importantly what i should use my time and energy on, since i all of a sudden had so little of it. It may seem dramatic to some people but im 19f and I convinced myself that people my age does not get bppv and that it is probably something way worse. I was petrified. I dont know what i would do without my boyfriend by my side. I would probably loose it completely Yeah your experience sounds a lot like mine. It actually was not till you mentioned it I would forgotten.  I had been off work for a bit cause of mental health and my dr had started me on 3 different meds. An anti depressant and 2 for sleeping cause I had not been sleeping. I had to come off them when  I got sick too but because it kept going she said it was not the mess but did not want to start me on any other meds I needed incase it made the dizziness worse. \n\nTrust me when I say the symptoms will ease off but will still be there for a while. It took months for me to feel \"fully\" better after they started easing off. And like I said even now sometimes I move a certain way or I am bent over too long I get the whoosy feeling but its so slight that I am not sure if I actually felt it or if I am just scared of it coming back again. \n\nYour symptoms will continue to decrease it just takes a long time. Kind Of like watching a snow globe? You shake it up and that is the bppv full on. But then majority of the glitter falls to the bottom but still have quite a few sparkles floating around. That is what you are symptoms first started to improve. Then all that is left is like a handful of sparkles floating around unable to land. That is what it was like for me for a good few months after I first started getting better.", "Very bad episode after physio I had a 1st session of vestibular physiotherapy today after starting my 5-6th episode of vertigo, 10 days ago. My 1st episode (in 2019) was very intense and may have been caused by an infection. \n\nDuring the session, she did a few tests and the Dix Hallpike manoeuvre which I had done myself in the past. I was feeling a little dizy after treatment but not too bad. I laid down about 3 hours after treatment, turned my head and BANG. The room is spinning for 2 hours now. One of the worst attack I had. I feel like my head is going to explode. \n\nAnybody had a similar reaction to physiotherapy? I have not personally.  Did you test positive for bppv when you went today?  Did they do the epley?  I would take meclizine if you have it and call in the morning to get back in.  Sometimes they can accidentally move a crystal into the horizontal canal when they do the epley which may mean you will need to do the log roll to move it out.  Hang in there it will get better!  On the positive side, bppv is not life threatening.  It is very scary, but it will be OK.  Same with menieres or inflammation in your ear.  Is serc for vertigo?  You might want to ask for mwds for nausea too.  You can always go to the hospital if it does not start to resolve.  I have read that labrinthitis can cause vertigo for hour too I think.   They could give you anti vertigo meds and steroids.  If it resolves when your head is still and then starts with head movements it may be bppv.  So sorry you are going through this.  Try to relax and do some breathing.  It will not last forever! If they just did testing (which typically provokes the intense vertigo), then you likely still have BPPV (if that is indeed what is going on).  And that is why when you laid down, you got that wave of vertigo again.  I attended therapy for a few months, as it took a LONG time for my BPPV to resolve. And every time the Dix Hallpike, Epley, or other maneuvers were done, I felt worse for quite a while.  Moving certain ways causes the crystals to move around the ear canal, triggering the vertigo.  Therefore, unless it is resolved, you are going to feel a bit yucky. Also, for ME - once the BPPV was resolved, I still felt HORRIBLE for quite some time with residual dizziness.\n\nHopefully your therapist is GOOD and they can help guide you through this and you can find relief quickly!  Maybe give them a call if you are still feeling bad today and get back in to see them.  I will keep my fingers crossed for continued healing and success for you!  I was starting to freak out bad when I thought I had Meneire's (my grandma had it). So when I tested negative for it and was confirmed BPPV, it was a relief.  But when it started to take over two months to resolve, I worried again. And THEN, when it was resolved - I still felt horrible.  Almost worse.  I kept making my therapist test me for EVERYTHING over and over, just to reassure me.  BPPV is not fun. And although it is not life threatening - it sure can make you miserable.  Especially when you cannot find relief.  Most other things in life you can somehow find relief through medicine, surgery, or other methods. Not BPPV. Ugh.  On a side note - I had surgery for a herniated disk (L5-S1) quite a few years ago and am as good as new!  Back doing all sport hobbies and as active as ever.  I cannot imagine getting hit by a bus on a bike. YIKES! Sorry you are dealing with vertigo. I had BPPV for about 2 weeks a month ago. Took 5 straight days of doing an Epley everyday before all the crystals got back to where they were suppose to be and tested negative on a Dix-Hallpike.\n\nCurrently, I have been dealing with residual dizziness that has lasted 3 weeks. I have a good day and then a bad day. Good day then bad day...But I do not have vertigo, just dizziness, lightheadedness, fogginess of the brain sometimes. I went to PT today and my therapist said that I am getting better, so there is always hope on the horizon.\n\nYou mentioned 2 straight hours of experiencing vertigo, that does not sound like BPPV, but I am not a doctor. Anyway, I hope you feel better. Having BPPV has certainly changed my perspective on life, its very scary. I just wanted to chime in and say that you are not alone.   If you experienced vertigo for 2 hours straight, are you sure it is BPPV? Who diagnosed the BPPV? Usually vertigo from bppv lasts less than a minute.  There are other disorders which cause vertigo, some which can cause long lasting episodes of vertigo. have you seen an ENT who is familiar with dizziness? How familiar was your physio with BPPV and vestibular issues?   I am sorry to hear that. I wish your doctor would just refer you to an ENT. :( ENTs have more specialized knowledge. But a physio should be good. Is your appointment soon? Please heed this advice if possible - find a physical therapist who has experience with vestibular disorders. Call around and ask them if they have experience treating BPPV. I am not sure which country you are in, but if by chance you are in the USA and near a large city, it might be useful to google 'balance centers' in your area. There are physical therapists who exclusively deal with balance disorders. This can make all the difference to get a good physical therapist. I am so sorry to hear what is going on. Try not to worry too much - it is going to get better. See your physical therapist and see what they have to say. Yeah with BPPV it could be that even just slight head movements are causing these problems. But if you have full on vertigo attacks that are lasting for long periods of time, and it is the same attack, I would really encourage you to see an ENT. Can you contact your doctor back and ask if they are willing to refer, if you mention that part? (When you say your head feels spinning for 2 hours - are you actually experiencing vertigo that is resulting from a single head movement? Like you move your head accidentally, and it triggers vertigo, and that vertigo is lasting for multiple minutes? or it is just constant dizziness?)\n\nIn the mean time - if you can, I would advice to stay away from any caffeine. Stay very hydrated if possible.\n\nYou might want to check out ( (My physio told me to look in to it even though it is BPPV I had). It is about stabilizing fluid levels in the inner ear.\n\nDo you have any medication right now to help deal with the dizziness and/or nauseousness? Antihistamine for dizziness (something like dramamine) and anti-emetic for nasea/vomiting (like zofran, reglan, something of that nature) is what I used. But that is me specifically and your doctor might recommend something different, so always take their advice. FYI - Do NOT take dramamine before going to your physio for treatment - it suppresses actions of the vestibular system and will prevent them from properly diagnosing what canal the crystals are in. (There are 3 canals in the ear, and they can determine which canal the crystals are in based on the way your nystagmus - eye movements - present. Dramamine and the like can suppress this preventing proper diagnosis. The repositioning maneuver they do can depend on which canal the crystals are in. Anti-emetics (drugs that stop nausea and vomiting) will NOT mess with the vestibular system however and you can take those prior to going in.) This is another reason it is a good idea to see a physio who is familiar with these disorders. Some of them have just seem to know the epley maneuver and that seems to be the extent of their knowledge. But there is more to it than that.", "Drink Away Vertigo With Water \"Water is not a cure-all for vertigo. Rather, symptoms\u00a0of dehydration *include* vertigo. Hydrate yourself to eliminate dehydration\u00a0as a possible cause.\"\n\n( lol I kind of laughed at this post but then remembered that the last time I got vertigo I was hungover, and I will occasionally get it when I wake up in the morning.... soooo regardless, I am going to go drink some water now. I would have laughed a month or so ago. But since then, I was busted by my massage therapist for *looking* dehydrated and I already knew that I had not been hydrating like I should. I thought the cause for this latest time was allergies, but all my signs are pointing to this now. It is a cheap and easy fix, so cheers! I do not get drunk very often. But every year or two or three, I will get some virus that causes a fever. And I am often surprised at how quickly I get dehydrated by a fever. Keep in mind that you have to at least double your fluid intake when you have a fever. Fever combined with diarrhea sucks the water out of you like a vacuum.  ", "Just had my very first BPPV happen. I got to tell you, I have had a litany of health issues since I was a kid. I flatlined because of a heart problem. Had another heart problem that got my BPM to 200 and had to get surgery for it. Had breathing problems that needed ER visits. Got anxiety attacks because of all this shit. \n\nAnd BPPV is still the most debilitating thing I have ever experienced.\n\nToday, I wake up and the room is spinning. I am confused as hell. Never happened before. I try to walk to the bathroom, I cannot. I am crawling. I wake my wife up, I legitimately think something is deeply wrong in my skull. My awesome wife calms me down, looks up maneuvers and I do a few and I am back to normal-ish right now.\n\nIt is the first time this has happened and but holy shit. This felt insane. I could not function at all. I also threw up, which probably did not help. What did people do when this happened to them in the 1600s and no internet and doctors who could figure this out? Did they just fucking give up on life?\n\nI hope my asshole ear crystals are going to be chill from now on. My heart goes out to you if you are dealing with this chronically. Take care and I hope you have a great day. &gt; And BPPV is still the most debilitating thing I have ever experienced.\n\nYup! People who have never had it have no idea just how debilitating and horrifying it is. \"Oh, I have had vertigo after a night of drinking\". Nope. This is a whole different thing!\n\n&gt; My awesome wife calms me down, looks up maneuvers and I do a few and I am back to normal-ish right now.\n\nAnd that is insane, is not it!??!? It is a like a rebooting of your body.\n\nWith my first experience I had gone to bed early and my wife stayed up late and then went in the guest bedroom so she would not disturb me. I turned over in bed and the room started spinning and would not stop. I crawled to the bathroom to vomit. Then I crawled to the other bedroom. We went to the ER, and finally got a Physical Therapist who did the Epley maneuver. I vomited after the first time. After the second time I was feeling much better. After the third time I was like \"Hey, I am kind of shaky but I could go into work!\"\n\nI am delighted to hear that you have an awesome wife. Doing this alone would have been awful. I am sorry to say that this will happen again, so I highly recommend you going to your Dr or ENT to get checked out, but then really focus on finding a Physical Therapist who can teach you how to do this right or be on call: there were times when it hit me bad and I was nervous about screwing the maneuver up (cause it is like leaning into a punch) and I was able to barge in without an appointment because it only takes a few minutes in the hands of an expert. \n\nYou will also want to take it really easy for a while. No yoga. Move slowly and deliberately so you do not move your upside down accidentally. You may want to sleep propped up on your good side.\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck! Avoid quick head movements for a few days and sleep on your back propped up if you can. It sounds like you had a quick result with doing the maneuver, that is awesome. Same here with the numerous health problems. \n\nVertigo is still the most maddening  I have ever experienced and I have popped out kidney stones.\n\nCurrently fighting the residual dizziness after a 3 day vertigo attack. I would rather have more stones than have any second longer of this crap. Damn man. Yeah, it knocks the shit out of you.\n\nDo you know what causes it for you? I have looked up and it does not look like people know exactly what triggers it. Yoga has been a trigger. I used to go regularly, had an attack so quit for a while. When I felt brave enough I went back and was fine for many months. But then on the very last move of a 90 minute session it hit. I quit again for a couple years, went back, and there have been a couple mild episodes so I have given it up for good.\n\nOf course it has also hit rolling over in bed so go figure.\n\nDrink lots of water (it is good for you for all sorts of reasons), and there may be a connection to low vitamin D so take a supplement. Ha. Alright. Well, best of luck to both of us I guess. Would not wish it on my worst enemy. I think you might want to keep doing the maneuvers. The Brandt-Daroff are the ones that work for me, easy to do by yourself and they are less dramatic than the epley. I had my very first case last Thursday, it scared the bajesus out of me. My laptop hard drive also decided to shit the bed, so I could not even \"Google it\", for around 15 minutes, because I had to boot with my other hard drive. I was in a panic to find out why everything was spinning, I was tempted to put my fist through the screen, lol. \n\n\nThen on Saturday night, after buying some cruise ship Nausea medicine, I worked up the courage to do the exercise alone, because nobody wanted to help me. Worked perfect, within a few hours the room stopped spinning, even on my \"bad side\". Now I just feel a bit light headed  but much better.\n\n\nI am scared to death of that shit coming back. It is traumatizing. I dunno which is worse, this shit, or a panic attack, because I have had both, lol. I am sorry. Yeah, I have panic attacks too. There was a lot of physicality to this that a panic attack does not have for me. Like I could not trust my own body. I get cold and weirdly shiver when I have panic attacks but at least I can lie down and let it subside. When I lied down with this BPPV thing I threw up.\n\nWell, welcome to the club fellow human being! This is my first day with bppv. Just woke up this morning with it. 33F, otherwise fit and sane etc. I laughed at \u201cdo they just fucking give up on life\u201d. :)) It crossed my mind as well. It is horrifying. I see that it is a good idea to go to a specialist for that maneuver, though I would do anything to avoid that horrible spinning and the loss of control. I wish all of you well.", "First time this has ever happened to me I woke up this morning at about 3 am and as i sat up to get a drink of water I became extremely dizzy and fell back into my bed. Then as I looked to my right, the world began to spin and I had to close my eyes for a minute or two to get it to go away. I immediately new something was up so I looked up the symptoms and concluded that I might have BPPV. I tried to do the eply manuever and when I turned my head to the right the world brgan spinning again violently. After I did it, it became worse, the world stopped spinning, but nausea began to kick in. I decided to try and sleep it off but I have now woken up and though I do not feel the spinning sensation, I still feel dizzy and super nauseous when I walk. I am fine if I lay down in bed however. Can anyone in thisplease subreddit help? It is extremely debilitating and I am scared. Sounds like your right ear is affected. Please look up the half somersault method and give that a try. I find it much easier than the Epley and more consistent. Just make sure you do it in a place you can hold on to the sides of you feel dizzy when starting. I do it between the bed and wall so I can put my hands on one on each side. \n\nIt is normal to have some residual symptoms while your body readjusts to \u2018normal\u2019. Is there a physical therapy clinic in your area that helps with vertigo? Call around if that is an option for you, a professional can perform Epley and give you tips for your specific case. Wow! after trying this method only once a majority of the dizziness was gone and I was able to walk without tipping over. The nausea is still there and I still am a bit dizzy but it was recommended I do a couple more repetitions. Thanks for the advice! You are welcome. I have dealt with left ear vertigo for 8 years so I know what you are going through. It is difficult, but I would try very hard to not move to your right side. I do not do anything on my left side anymore because it always sets it off. Out of curiosity - what do not you do on your left ear anymore? I am in the same boat with my left but I have no idea what I can do to prevent getting BPPV again other then, not to sleep on my left ear...\n\nAny tips would be greatly appreciated \ud83d\ude43 Sleep, side planks, leaning to the left when I am looking for something in a low cupboard.  I am just very cautious on how I move. \n\nI also found out snorkeling is a no go. I think it is the water in my ear that made me so sick. Maybe ear plugs would help. Interesting. I had my first bout of BPPV 3 years ago which passed within 24 hours and no exercises. At the time I did not realise it was BPPV but within a week i had forgotten I even had it. 3 months ago I got hit again, but knew what it was and went to the PT the next day but it had already passed. 4ish weeks ago, hit again... ugh so I was able to see the PT straight away but this time it is taken a solid 3 weeks to resolve but has made me a lot more fearful of moving my head in case I upset the crystals \ud83d\ude1e", "Scared of trying Brandt-Daroff So, I have had positional vertigo for about 13 years now, although I have not had a proper full attack in years because I know which positions to avoid, but I know I still have it, as I have tried to push my limits and noticed the vertigo coming in. I will spare you of the bad stories I have had with ENTs for years trying to diagnose what I have and not being able to run any test at all because of said vertigo.\n\nAnyway, the other day I went to the doctor and this time he suggested me to do the Brandt-Daroff exercises as they are running out of things to try with me. Now, I really want to do something about this, but just the thought of triggering my vertigo, having to stay in positions that trigger it for a few minutes, thrice a day for a few days makes my eyes teary. Even writing this is painful to me. Back when I did not know how it was triggered and rolled in bed, I would have attacks that would leave me extremely nauseous for about 24-30 hours. Just existing was agonising, and I could not entertain myself with anything. Watching TV, reading, listening to music, standing, being in bed, practically everything made my nausea worse. All I could do was sit and daydream my day away. A couple of times I did not have the luxury to do that and had to attend class/exams, and they are some of the worst experiences I have ever had.\n\nSo, with those kinds of memories in mind, just thinking of constantly triggering it for days in a row makes me extremely nervous. I am not sure what my goal is with this post. Perhaps I would like to listen to people with similar stories who decided to go with it, or get some insight on whether I should try at all, because this particular ENT does not really pay attention to what I say, and has made mistakes in the past, such as saying that I could get a head scan at the hospital without lying on my back (nope), so I am not fully convinced by his words.\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading this wall of text.", "Qestion for some advice Hey, so a few days ago I started getting all the symptoms for BPPV ( minus the nausea ) I watched a lot of clips and researched BPPV and with the help of my aunt ( she is a nurse) I was diagnosed with it at home. The symptoms kind of diminished a bit, but some are still present. I wanted to ask the reason why the BPPV happened. So my history is like this: I got a bad knee injury 4 years ago and since then I am not able to run ( only fast walk at it is best) I am overweight so I know running might be possible only if i lose weight ( so I will not damage my knee even more) but a few days ago I was forced to run ( I was chased by a couple of angry street dogs and was only a few meters from my house) so I just ran to my house ( when I was running my whole body was in alert mode I felt light headed, dizzy and feeling tingling and preasure in my head, ears and tingling through my whole body for a few seconds and then just stopped when I reached a safe space and stopped running) \nMy question is: do you think the fact that I ran for the first time in 4 years might be the cause of my inner ear crystals dislocating and causing the BPPV?", "Does BPPV affect your vision? Is Bppv having an effect on the eye? because after a month of vertigo, I developed eye problems; sometimes I notice my vision is shaky even when I am not dizzy; I have difficulty focusing in between; and when I look at something close to me, it appears that my eyes are in focused camera or portrait mode. \n\nthen I fell asleep drowsily and when I woke up I was cross eyed, my eyes also glitched. my eye doctor said it was just dry eye, and now I notice it happens when I close my eyes very sleepy or not properly. \nnow I am often concious if I am closing my eyes properly Go see a doctor. It might be something more important than bppv For me my primary manifestation of BPPV was nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) and nausea. No feelings of dizziness at all... until the dix-hallpike, and the Epley maneuver. \n\nFor me the eye twitch was when trying to fixate on a target after a head, or series of, eye movements. Sometimes it would happen just while looking at my phone (and still does, it is my big hint that it is time to go reset my ears before the nausea kicks in. Happens when I sleep on the effected side, and a couple other triggers). \n\nBut you should see an ENT if it is been going on this long. If it is BPPV it is an easy fix with the Epley maneuver and if your doctor has not mentioned this it is new doctor time. Are you sure it is BPPV and not a bout of neuritis, because that would cause oscillopsia(unsteady gaze) and would respond to gaze stabilization exercises. Neuritis and bppv cause coming dizziness in the beginning My doctor who diagnosed me with BPPV said I have nystagmus in one of my eyes.  She did a test that video'd my eyes and could see one of them twitching.   \nI have noticed that some times in my peripheral vision objects will warp - it is hard to describe really. Vestibular dysfunction can absolutely affect your vision. The inner ear controls so much. As to your exact problems, I am not sure. Focusing issues are no uncommon with vestibular disorders or following major episode(s) of BPPV even. But always see a doctor especially if things do not get better.\n\nBPPV/vestibular disorders can also cause tremendous anxiety which can make you acutely aware of things in your vision that may be normal that your brain just filtered out until your episode(s). Optic neuritis??? really aaaaa noooo im only 14 (turning 15 this year) .but I dont have unsteady gaze its just.. i cant explain it Thank you! Yes thank you!\u2764\ufe0f oooo i see thank you \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc9d Thank you! \u2764\ufe0f Edited Vestibular neuritis. Can happen at any age.\nAlso would look blurry or jumpy worse with quick head movements. oooo okaay thank you", "So\u2026this is just his life now? My husband was hit with severe dizziness, nausea and vomiting yesterday after a lunch out and some birthday cake.  Room spinning every time he sat up. He vomited all evening.  I was worried he was having a stroke, so I kept checking his blood pressure but it was normal, temp was normal.  I checked on him all night, he slept quietly beside me.  This morning I took him to the doctor in our van so he could lay down in the in the back with some emesis bags, I had to wheel him in because he cannot see from the spinning,  and she prescribed him meclizine and zofran, these knocked him out, and he still vomits when he sits up.  It is been over 24 hours, no food, cannot keep much water down.  I bought him some Gatorade.  This is unreal.  He said that if he had to live like this, he would just end it.  He missed work today of course, will probably miss his band practice this week.  He is literally flat on his back.  \ud83d\ude1e So sorry this is happening.  I am new to BPPV and have only had one bout which lasted a couple of days.  Mine was only when I tilted my head to the left (especially when lying down).  It slowly went away after a couple of days.  I do not know exactly when because I just did not tilt my head during that time because it was the worst dizziness I have ever had.\n\nI did the Epley maneuver to try and move whatever particle out of my \"ear tubes\"; sorry to get so technical on you.   Not sure if that is what \"fixed\" it, but after a couple of days of keeping myself from getting in to the position which caused the dizziness, I was mostly better.  \n\nGive it a day or two and let us see what happens.  I remember thinking the same thing; what if this is the new normal.  It was awful.  \n\nSorry I could not give any help, but wanted to acknowledge his suffering and let you both know we are hoping for his wellness.  Keep us posted. Thank you.  I appreciate your post.  I will get on him to keep doing the Epley, and the Brandt daroff.  He said he feels too queasy to try the half somersault.  I am hoping it gets better or he will need iv hydration after too many days of this. If it is BPPV, then this is not his life. Mine got better after doing the Epley Maneuver several times by myself at home. Your husband\u2019s case sounds more severe, so maybe a therapist is in order. I have had my BPPV for over a year. I think it is going to be an on going issue, but it is manageable! Thank you.  Yes he is already talking about calling an ENT doc.  I also think physical therapy is in order if he is going to have more than 2-3 days like this.  It is awful. You just described my life in the first month after I got it! I had never felt such horror before! My parents helped me through it They literally dragged me to the bathroom, and fed me themselves! My brain was hardly working from all the dizziness! It is like the evolution clock went back from being human to whatever was before it! So fucking scary! All I can say it takes time, and he will get better in time. But full recovery in my experience will take a long time. Just hold on for his sake. I am glad he is not alone. No one should suffer this alone I had to go to a PT to do their maneuvers. They looked at my eyes and the movement indicated which maneuver to do. \n\nIf it is BPPV, I would go as soon as you can. It is unbearable and I recall telling my bf I could not live like that.\n\nHope he gets it fixed and better!! This does not sound like bppv.  Do they think it is vestibular neuritis or something acute?  Bppv spinning stops within 30 to 60 seconds.  You then can feel dizzy and off for the day, but not generally unable to do anything. I, by no means, have been diagnosed yet. But a similar thing happened to me in late November of 2017. I was out for two weeks. I am talking - I would move my eyes and the room started spinning - bad. I was 20 at the time, I have learned to live with the ups and low, low downs that vertigo brings along. Give him time, I trust that your husband will retake control of his life as many of us have. There are times I do not even notice the vertigo anymore. \n\nI do not want to push anything, but faith and prayer and God\u2019s grace have put me back on my feet. \n\nYou two are immensely strong and resilient. Not sure.  Doctor said, \u201cit is vertigo.\u201d  It just happened yesterday, I am sure we will find out more if he is still bedbound after a couple days. Thank you, it is good to hear you moved past it.  This is just crazy.  He was fine.  It just hit him out of the blue yesterday. Thank you.  I am glad you are better.  I cannot imagine him being alone.  :(. I am glad your parents were there to help you. Please look into the manuevers that can heal him. If it is true BPPV, The Epley Maneuver is extremely fast acting as it moves the \"crystal\" in his ear around to a fixed position. This would solve the balancing/vision issues he is having.\n\nFor me, I saw an ENT Doctor, who eventually had me visit a Physical Thearapist that correctly diagnosed me with Vestibular Neuritis.\n\nIt took doing eye exercises at home for about 2-4 weeks to fully recover.\n\nHave him go to an Optometrist after he fully heals to take a vision test to see how his eyesight has been effected.\n\nIt was probably one of the scariest moments of my life. You truly do feel like you would rather be dead as you truly cannot enjoy anything because your vision, balance, and eating habits are all completely F'd up. You feel like you will not ever recover, but if it is BPPV/Vestibular Neuritis, you should relatively quick.\n\nJust know, and tell him that it will get better. It is truly the kind of BS you just got to deal with for a month or so.. We all know that feeling! Everything seems so terrible when you have vertigo. You really cannot imagine living like that, it is so uncomfortable. My dad and I both get it, and he is such a sad sack when he is affected! Tell him he is not alone \u2764\ufe0f \n\nI used to have 24 hour vertigo stints and I would usually lie in bed on whatever side felt the best\u2014 and not move, and take a gravol and pass out or watch Netflix. Sleep was a big help. It is important to not panic\u2026 anxiety can enhance whatever is going on in your body. It is unlikely this will last forever. \n\nThere are so many causes of vertigo. Maybe he is like me and it is migraine related. Maybe it is something totally different! If this persists, a dizziness clinic is your best bet. I went to multiple ENTs before getting proper help at a dizziness clinic, they run lots of tests and can see a lot more than an ENT can.\n\nHopefully this is just one stint and he does not get it again (it happens) but if he continues to get episodes like these, document everything you can about them so you can drill down what type of vertigo he is got. Do not trust any one doctor with an answer, they often will tell you it is BPPV when it is not. Thank you for this.  I have been after him all day to continue the epley.  It would be good to have PT show him the maneuvers as well though, we went through it pretty carefully and at first he did not see much help but tonight, he was able to sit up a bit and ate a little soup I made for him.  Sounds like we need to see an ENT. Thank you for this input.  A dizziness clinic\u2026.interesting.  I will look that up.  Unfortunately, my husbands type seems closely correlated with a lot of nausea and vomiting, which has gotten better tonight, after a couple doses of zofran today.   It is been one of the roughest 24 hours he has ever had. I would like him to go to a PT!  If he is still miserable tomorrow I will ask his doctor. thx! it never really goes away the after-effects can be really ... challenging ... but at least I can now work, live, and think clearly like any other human being, which I am thankful for.    \nwish your husband speedy recovery As others said, if it is BPPV this is definitely NOT how his life is. The residual dizziness can be annoying and can last a long time, but it is usually not something that stops you from having a normal life. The vertigo itself should go away pretty quickly with the right maneuver. In my case it goes away in a single day, then I feel off for a while (maybe a week), but I can still go to work and conduct most activities.\n\nA doctor should be able to diagnose BPPV pretty easily (it took an ER doctor a good 30 seconds the first time I had it) and suggest the right maneuver for his case.\n\nBy all means, it feels super scary and you think you are going to die the first time it happens, but after a correct diagnosis and some experience doing the maneuvers it is manageable in the vast majority of cases. Yeah It is the nausea that is unbearable! If he stays in bed and does not move his head too much during the episode he should be able to avoid the puking. I would just get up to go pee.\n\nAnother thing that might help is vestibular therapy, I have not read all the other replies to see  who is recommended this, but this is something to look into with a physiotherapist that specializes in balance/vertigo. Again, I would only worry about this if the vertigo returns a second time. He should start to feel back to normal soon but if not, come on back to this sub! I do not want to freak you out but it is important information. If it continues for more than a week without any improvements, I would go to the doctor again and beg them to do a brain scan. I am in the US (fuck the capitalistic mess that is the US healthcare system) and had to call my insurance repeatedly so they would approve the scan to rule out any tumors. Thankfully for me that was not the issue but I know someone I met through treatment had a \u201cBPPV\u201d diagnosis for a few months before finding out it was a tumor. Hope your husband improves soon! It really is the most demoralizing and hopeless condition. Every time I have an episode I sink back into depression and have some disturbingly dark thoughts. Hang in there, both of you. Yeah, I am a nurse; I definitely know it could be something more sinister.  He is a little better today, thankfully. Thank you.  He is better today, thank goodness.  He actually walked downstairs, ate something at the table before going back to bed.  No vomiting today.  Vision is a little better.  He is still doing the exercises when he can. It really is, it struck me out of the blue, too. But it happened when I was asleep which is weird, I got tinnitus too, it is an \u201cEEEE\u201d sound that never stops lol. I have gotten used to it though. But oh well, I have chosen to grab the bull by the horns and toss him to the ground. Best case scenario it is a simple inner ear infection. \n\nHere is a link to a list of vestibular disorders. I think it helps people understand their symptoms a little better.  I recommended doing the exercises and lie on the pillow higher than usual. And do not sleep on your effected ear side You are very welcome, and do please keep us updated. This is quite the rare subreddit, and anything people can read to help them through it or know what worked for others is quite comforting as there is really not much of a community online for these illnesses. Update:  he is better.  He is downstairs for short periods, made himself some food and kept it down, talking with us a little, etc.  lots of dizziness and the room canting around when he tries to focus, it gave him a headache so he took Advil yesterday.  he was still in bed for almost two straight days.  He said it is exhausting to be downstairs.  This is his third day off work.  He missed the outing to look at a venue for his big event at the end of October (he is a bassist as well as an IT manager), he also missed band practice.  Today I pushed him to message the doctor for a referral to ENT.  I believe he needs a physical therapist.  My husband has a very full, active life.  He does not sit around.  This has stopped him in his tracks, it is not like he was just doing nothing and can just be disabled now.  This is insane. Hoping he is able to continue to improve.  Thank you for all your support!  :) This is wonderful news!  So glad he is seeing some improvement and hope it continues to get better.  Sounds like it is still tough, but better than it was.\n\nEdit:  meant to reply directly to your update.  Keep us posted on his progress.  You are very kind to watch over him. What do you mean by \u201cit never really goes away\u201d? How is he doing now? I, too, stopped by for an update. Hello!  Well, he is back to work, and back to band practice.  Started driving again.  He said it has not gone away, he still has headaches, and he developed pains and aches in his upper shoulders, back of the neck, enough so he ordered himself a massager but it does not help.  He is on week 2 of waiting for the ENT to call him back for an appointment.  He is better, but he is afraid he has something more serious,  although he cannot get into the doctor so I guess he will never know.  \ud83d\ude12 So glad he has recovered a bit of normalcy; wish it was more.  Hope the doctor calls soon; it can be frustrating to get In the door.\n\nThanks for the update.", "Random attack of dizziness? I am a 30 years old male. Not that healthy, but not unhealthy either, with slightly low BMI. \n\nWhen i was 15 (student), one midnight when i was using the toilet i was hit by intense feeling of spinning. I fainted and hit the wall hard. Weeks after the incident I would feel spinning on daily basis. I could only sleep on one side because it was less dizzy on that side. Went to a few clinics, some said it was vitamin B lacking, some said it was due to lack of sleep, some said i was faking it to skip school, etc. None helped. But it eventually went away after weeks. I am still able to recall those weeks so clearly in my memory. \n\nEver since that, I have been haunted by constant dizziness (not spinning). There were days when i  was totally fine, and there were days when i was dizzy for a few days, totally unpredictable. And there was no early symptom before the attacks.   \nAnd sometimes (also at random), I had this serious spinning sensation when i laid down trying to sleep. I had to sit up immediately and hold onto something and turned on the light as it will ease the spinning a lot. I will in a dizzy state whole day the next day. \n\nSometimes (randomly) the spinning sensation came when I was using the monitor (for works, movies etc).\n\nAll these seems to get worse in recent years, with some minor changes in patterns. I get this dizziness almost every morning now. And most of the times it only happened when I woke up early (like 7am). I usually sleep at 10.30pm-11pm.  It will have a sequence like this: Woke up7am (feeling OK) - breakfast (feeling OK) - go out for work (feeling slight dizzy) - at work (feeling dizzy) - lunch (feeling dizzy) - the rest of the day (feeling OK until evening) - on my way home (feeling slight dizzy) - at home (feeling OK).\n\nFrom time to time, im unable to walk in a straight line.  I tend to walk toward the side further away from the road. (i.e road on my right side, i tend to walk toward my left)\n\nBesides the dizziness, sometimes i got hit by symptom similar to panic attack.  It happened out of nowhere, at random time. Dry mouth, serious dizziness like fainting, lose of appetite, blackout vision, shaky, etc.\n\nI also started avoiding to go outside because im afraid of all these issues strike me at random time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to general hospital and had my blood taken for check up. Everything came back healthy (thyroid, blood sugar, mineral etc). I have a higher heart rate though, roughly 85-90 bpm at my age. \n\nNow should I go for mental checkup? or ENT? or others? Which should I go first to eliminate each possible causes one by one? Have you been checked for BPPV  Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo. If you go to a physical therapist that specializes in this or ENT DR. They can do the Ellet maneuvers to help you. You can google it and see what I am talking about Easiest to diagnose and easiest to fix would be BPPV, so if you have not been tested, start there. I went to my primary care office and the doc did the diagnosis but not the treatment. He told me to look up how to do it on the internet and that if that did not work he could send me to a therapist. So far, so good, keeping my fingers crossed. \n\nI just wrote in another thread about a problem with my heart's electrical system causing random bouts of spinning/almost fainting, and actually I had a few panic attacks that in retrospect were almost certainly caused by intermittent heart block.  Basically, you might put a cardiologist, or better, an electro-physiologist on your list if nothing else pans out. When the episodes became more frequent I wore a monitor and they were able to correlate symptoms and what my heart was doing (or in my case, not doing!) and I got a pacemaker to fix it.\n\nThe spinning caused by the BPPV felt very much like that, which was kind of frightening until I realized that it was happening only when I moved my head in certain ways.", "Off balance feeling after vertigo So in April I got pretty bad vertigo attack, i cannot eat until one of my hand is on my head and if I eat I vomit. Long story short, i am on the ambulance, they did the Ct scan, Mri, blood test and the doctor concluded that it is BPPV.\nI did 3 maneuvers that works for me, one is the Half Sommersault. My mind is so so spinning to the point that when i go to the toilet trying to find an empty room to do this maneuver and I am surprised it works right off. After that, my partner did some Epley and I did the BBQ Roll myself.\nHowever, up until now is 3 months and i still feel the residue, like sometimes your body is falling to a side or i am standing on the boat. Not sure if anyone got the same problem? It is common to have residual dizziness after an episode. I find sleeping at an incline helps me recover, as well as doing gaze stability exercises. You could also try repeating the maneuver that works for you, maybe there is still some slight issue in the ear canal. Make sure you stay hydrated as lack of water can make it worse or trigger an episode for me. Hope you feel better soon! You might want to see a specialist, I had that on a boat feeling when the crystal moved from one spot to a less typical spot. The dizziness clinic I went to used a different maneuver to fix it and it ended being very stubborn and hard to get rid of. I have had vertigo problems for the last 8 years, and I had another bad episode myself in April and had an epley done and it made it worse, so they are thinking I might have menier's disease, however I do not have all the symptoms.  Finally after 3 months, I feel comfortable driving again, but still have the spins on my left side when I lay on it at night.  I feel like I am floating sometimes, or like I just got off a carnival ride sometimes, but am certainly doing better.  I keep hearing from people that there is nothing that the doctor's can do, which I did go to an ENT in May, and all I got was a \"I am sorry\" and gave me water pills.  So I am not real sure if I want to pursue it further and just pray it gets better every month.  Not sure this was helpful, but wanted to let you know there are others out there, and you are not alone. I have constant vertigo throughout my day and i am on day 21. I have seen an optometrist, chiropractor, ent, urgent care, mri, and my primary doctor. so far only diagnosis i got was oitis media (middle ear infection) from the urgent care. so i went on 7 days of antibiotics the liquid went down but they say most cases of inner ear infections can last 6 weeks. im half way (if this is truly the remnants of middle ear infection). You are not alone when i get my vertigo, i try and focus on one spot but i can slightly see that everything im not focused on is kind of swerving or moving around, and even walking is hard. I have not driven, watched tv or gamed. It is just hard to get by but you are not alone. Im sure it will clear up in time. I got BPPV three months ago. It took 2 weeks of finding out why I had vertigo and then a week of doing Epleys everyday to get my crystals back in place. I am currently on my second month of residual dizziness. My symptoms are: feeling like I am on a boat, feeling dizzy when I turn my head too quickly, eye fatigue (especially when I look at the computer screen for too long), brain fogginess. All my symptoms have gotten better, if only slightly, week over week. I have been going to PT with a vestibular specialist every week to help with my recovery. She assures me, as have many people in this community, that the residual dizziness will go away. It just takes time. I hope you feel better soon and I hope you feel better knowing you are not alone. Guys, updating my vertigo, the residue feeling has subsided a lot when I cut off my caffeine, it is hard but I am getting there", "Severe Episodes, Anyone? Hi, everyone! \n\nThis is my first post. I got my first vertigo spell four years ago and it lasted for three whole days. I did not have another one for a couple of years, but this year I have had eight (!!!) severe episodes. I have been to regular doctors a number of times and in a month I finally see an ENT for the first time.\n\nThese episodes basically consist of 30-60 hours of the room endlessing spinning and me throwing up every couple of minutes. I become absolutely incapacitated. Cannot walk properly, cannot sit up straight without the room turning in circles. I get zero warning as to when these attacks are going to take place! I do freelancing here and there and have family support but I would like to return to full time work. I feel as if I cannot manage this until I get these vertigo spells under control! \n\nHas anyone else suffered from such extreme episodes? Do you guys have any recommendations on how to handle this while I wait to see my ENT? I have tried exercises for vertigo but they only seem to do so much.\n\nThank you, and be well. I had it for the first time this year and I had to spend 2 nights in the hospital. It was very severe, much like the symptoms you explained above. It was terrifying. It is discouraging to hear you have had follow on episodes, I really hope it gets better for you. Do you find yourself having severe anxiety about when it may come back? I am so sorry you had to go through that! I hope you never have to deal with that again. Some people only get one or two episodes, or less severe ones, so you may be in the clear! Sending good vibes your way.\n\nFor me, I have gone past anxiety and moved right on to irritation. I know that sounds funny, but it is so miserable and the episodes are so extreme it feels like you are dying even though you are not, so knowing that I am actually going to be okay I kind of go, \"Really? THIS again?\" I just try to get through each episode. It is disheartening to know another one is likely coming until I go for treatment - physical therapy or whatever the ENT decides. So for me it is much more of a major bummer than a source of anxiety. When you stop moving you head for 1-2 minutes, is not it stopping? As I know, BBPV is related to dislocated crystals in inner-ear semi circular canals (3 per ear) and wandering freely in those (usually one of these) cannals. When those stones hits the surface of these tubes, it creates fake movement messages and confuses brain. According to that, when you stop moving totally, the crystals will finally hit the bottom of that position and stop making dizzyness. If it does not, I think it might be something else. You probably have seen \"Epley manuevers\" in youtube. Those manuevers purpose is to re-insert the roaming stones back to original place (utricle). Even after that there is a recovery period. In this period, brain recalibrates the sense of balance. Probably your doctor will apply this manuevers and yeach you how to do it. Mine told me to do it until I get rid of the episodes totally. If you go for the manuevers, it is not that hard, but ask for help while applying. I watched it together with my wife to do it properly. First you need to determine which ear it is then apply the right manuever. The right ear is the one at the direction when you turn your head and it spins like hell (comparing to other side). Have a look into it if you already not. Good luck. Thank you! I hope it never comes back but when it does I will know and will not go back to the hospital. The reason I asked about anxiety is, from my experience, that it almost feels like the anxiety starts to take over and I start tricking myself into thinking its coming on. This has happened quite a bit lately for me but I just close my eyes and keep my head still and then realize its all in my head. \n\nI really hope it gets better for you. Stay safe out there. I have had 24+ hour episodes and thought I had bppv but after seeing a neurotologist realized I had something different \u2014 the second most popular cause of vertigo, vestibular migraines.\n\nWhat is ur age/sex? Any history of migraine or motion sickness? That is the odd part of the whole thing! When the episode first starts, I cannot seem to get into a comfortable position without feeling sick, although I do get breaks in between being ill if I lie COMPLETELY still, but eventually I will throw up again. Usually as time wears on I do much better if I hold still and lay on my side, either with my head on a pillow or on by using propping it on my upper arm and not moving. The maneuvers have lessened it some at times but other times I struggle to get it under control -- or even if it lessens I still have to wait many, many hours before it completely goes away. I see an ENT early next month and I cannot wait for answers. Thank you for your reply and be well! I am a 27 y/o female. Do your bouts come with any pain at all? I never get any severe pain in my head -- sometimes a light headache from dehydration/straining when throwing up but that is usually after quite some time has passed. I do get a feeling of fullness in my head while it is happening, though! I used to ride roller coasters or do high speed activities with no issue. IDK how I would respond to that now but I never got motion sickness traditionally -- 2016 I had my first 3 day vertigo episode triggered by nothing in particular. They have lessened to 1-2 days but increased in the amount of episodes I get per year. I am finally recovered from my latest spell but I have no idea when the next one will hit. I see my new ENT early next month -- only appointment they had available for an ENT that treats vertigo, as I would have preferred an earlier appointment. How did they diagnose you if you do not mind my asking? Thanks for your reply! I do not get any pain, personally. Mine started when I was 29, and I am also F. \n\nYeah I used to love rollercoasters and going tubing lol. I do a lot of cycling now without issues. Was just curious because motion sickness is a big migraine indicator but there are others, like being \u2018hangry\u2019 and a whack of other things you might not necessarily know. \n\nThe best thing you can do is diary your episodes as much as possible. Dr shin beh is a good resource for diagnosing.", "Someone close to me has been diagnosed with BPPV  You are a kind sibling. \ud83d\udda4\n\nDoes your sibling have another adult that lives with her? Someone that can care for children (if neccessary) or that can care for her (being a physical support or someone to clean up vomit) if the BPPV is very bad? Can you be this person if needed?\n\nYour sibling likely will not be able to drive for some time, can you pick-up groceries or go to the pharmacy if needed? Or drive her to appointments?\n\nLike many medical conditions, I am sure everyone is experience is different. I have had BPPV last a few hours, a few weeks and more than a month. In the worst of it I need someone to hold me while I walk and have needed help cleaning up vomit. I like electrolyte drinks and ice pops (popcicles) to stay hydrated, if I can stomach food it is soup, hot cereal, yogurt, and maybe some pudding (chewing during BPPV is nearly impossible for me.)  When it starts getting better it is easy to make those simple things for myself but there have been times when I cannot even manage that.\n\nOnly she knows what she needs. You should ask her how you can help. Ask her what help she needs or if she needs food or medicines picked up.\n\nWhen I was having a BPPV spell this winter it happened a week before Christmas and it did not get better until the end of January. I was scared it was not going to get better, I was sad I missed Christmas shopping.  But it would have been nice to have someone to voice all that to. My sister and I have not been close for awhile and I do not really have friends. If this turns into a long-lasting event for your sister it might be nice if you can be there in an emotional sense if you are close like that.\n\nI hope your sibling has an easy time with BPPV and this is just a blip. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask them and if I can offer any answers I will try. Get you sibling to a PT to resolve the issue. Meds will not work and waiting it out is not a guarantee. Otherwise, I agree with above! Support around gone is most helpful. Do the epley maneuver..and keep doing it every couple of hours until she stops having vertigo...its bad but its not the worst thing. She will be fine. Thank you for your comment. I will try this with her! I appreciate the advice Wow thank you so much for your response. I have no words, thank you for your kind advice. I agree with doing the Epley, but I was cautioned against doing it more than once or maybe twice a day at most. Really? My PT did it with me today 3 times! Still no response on my end. Now looking down is worse than ever and before it was just my right side issue...", "Getting Diagnosed. What to Expect? This is the best subreddit I could find for this, as my condition is still unknown. I have been living with an imbalance disorder for a long time, after a head injury. Through my own stubbornness and stupidity, I never saw a doctor, until now. \n\nA week from tomorrow I will be seeing an ENT to get properly diagnosed. I imagine that my first visit will be a discussion with the doctor about symptoms, triggers, history, etc. They seem to be well-equipped with diagnostic tools, such as videonystagmography, auditory brainstem response, electrocochleography, dynamic posturography, and a rotary chair. I am unsure if a caloric test will be performed, as well.\n\nMy biggest fear going in to this is that the tests will trigger severe symptoms, especially after my symptoms have worsened the last few days, but I am also tired of feeling this way, and I am hoping for a proper diagnosis and treatment. You have done your research which is great! Some tests will trigger your vertigo - e.g the caloric test if a nerve is involved or a certain position if BPPV. Unpleasant, yes, but knowing what you have is so worth it. plus, the effect will probably only lasts up to minutes. \n\nCertain things they do (e.g. a repositioning manoeuvre) night make you more dizzy for up to days. I am not saying that is the case for everybody. But this was the case for me - and I wish I knew this so I would not feel desperate as to why the treatment is not working. That being said, for some people, the relief is instantaneous. \n\nAlso - would be best if you had somebody with you, just in case you feel more wobbly afterwards. Thank you for sharing.", "feeling hopeless today i went to an ent and was given a hearing test. the results showed no hearing loss, i was told i had perfect ears, then i was left to speak to the doctor. he did the dix-hallpike test, results were negative for both sides. he says, \u201cwell it sounds like you have bppv, but yours is kind of abnormal.\u201d \n\nfor some clarification, i have episodes around once a month (room spinning, nystagmus, nausea) randomly while lying in bed for around 5 mins (still feel very nauseous afterwards) and once i fall asleep i feel better the next day. my nystagmus turns clockwise or counterclockwise (i feel like it switches maybe?) and i have a buzzing tinnitus that i only hear with certain head positions. \n\nhe gave me no advice because he is not sure why it is happening to me. he handed me a paper on the brandt-daroff exercise,then told me that he does not think it will help me with my episodes.\n\ni just do not know what to do, i just want to be normal again!!! should i go somewhere else for help? I have Exactly the same. Buzzing tinnitus in one ear, episodes when laying down that is not exactly triggered by movement, only that i also have pulsatile tinnitus in the other ear (i can hear my heartbeat. It started when i got bppv, but im uncertain if it isrelated to it). Doctors and physio says i have bppv, no advice as to what to do about it though weird, ours sound so similar. my vertigo problems started after getting the nexplanon put in, i believe it could have something to do with hormones but my doctor said it is possible but unlikely due to the type of birth control i have. i can hear my heartbeat sometimes as well in my bad ear. completely forgot to mention that i also have tmj issues due to anxiety that is also on my bad side. Really weird. Have had balance issues for about 7 months now. have a iud inserted and have had in since i was 16. im 19 now. never had balance issues before, and never really thought that could be the cause, but maybe? I dunno. I also have had problems with cystic acne this last year which i have never had before in my life. Maybe hormones are at fault? could be. i have looked at a few study cases on it &amp; i have read that female hormones can somehow mess with the inner ear. i guess i will know when i get mine taken out lol I will try and Google to find the forum I came across a couple of months ago, because I do not know it off hand\u2026\n\nBut it is of people with TMJ and jaw issues whose dentist(s) found that once they corrected the TMJ the vertigo went away. If ENT and PT do not work, ask your dentist- they know quite a bit about nerves in the head and neck that might be an issue causing yours. In a million years I never would have guessed, but when you think about it it kind of makes some sense. Ok, so a Google search returns a ton of results for you to look at\u2026 I am not sure I am allowed to drop links here??? But lots out there about TMJ and like I said, forums exist out there with this exact concern of a connection between the two in mind. Never once did my EMT say to consider dental/jaw issues, but I am getting that checked now too. (Several months of balance issues and dizziness here still not completely resolved.) that is actually very helpful, thank you! when i was younger i constantly clenched my jaw in school and when i got nervous. my jaw started clicking about 7 years ago. never really experienced any pain unless i had been clenching for a while. i had no idea it could have something to do with my dizziness! Keep me updated, so i know if that is what i should do next! Find a reputable specialist. Travel if you need to. BPPV is the worst. \n\nThis was my specialist in Newport -  I agree. I was fortunate to find the Vestibular Orders clinic in Dallas, which is part of the UT Southwestern system. \n\nI had a physiotherapist who treated nothing but BPPV and related disorders, and quickly diagnosed why my vertigo would not resolve (my otolith crystals were not just displaced - they were STUCK in the wrong place). &gt; my otolith crystals were not just displaced - they were STUCK in the wrong place\n\nSame. I had to sit in a specialized \"Chair\" that turned me up side down where the crown of my head was at a 45-degree angle from the ground bc that is where they identified the olith blockage. Almost instantly i got severe vertigo, but that was because the olith was rolling back into its proper resting place. As soon as they sat me back up, the fuzzy, low latent spinning feeling I was feeling for months ended. \n\nYou can fix it. It is a pain in the ass, but do it. hi, i just wanted to update you and tell you that i had my hormonal birth control removed today &amp; i got the copper (non hormonal) iud put in. could just be placebo effect, but i feel better already haha. i will update you in a month or so and let you know if it made any difference! :)", "Dizziness when I move my eyes, not my head ? This cannot be BPPV right? What else could it be ? \n\nIf I move my eyes to the far left/right I get a spinning sensation that lasts until I move them again. \n\nDoes anyone know what this could be or if this might still be BPPV ? If you did have BPPV and kept your head very still for quite a long time, you may have developed 'gaze instability.' I developed this and it really sucked. I had a vestibular therapist diagnose it &amp; she gave me a bunch of exercises to do.... Increasingly making them harder each week. Google it &amp; see if the symptoms fit what you have going on. Definitely not BPPV if your head is still. \n\nI would see an optometrist first. But dunno obv I was just went to a dizziness and balance institute and was diagnosed with Labrynthine Dysfunction...my right ear and receives and interprets physical, auditory, and motion input at a slightly different time than the left ear causing dizziness and imbalance. Are you doing therapy now? No, it was too expensive. My deductible has been met, the initial tests were $600. The prescribed 7 weeks of treatment costs $3000- I cannot afford this, especially with only an 85% success rate.", "Posting again: I want to share what I learned about BPPV that might help you prevent, understand, or manage it I shared this about 9 months ago, and wanted to post it again, in case anyone new is browsing this forum who it might help. Below is an exact copy and paste. I hope this helps someone.\n\nHey guys. I had BPPV ~~last fall~~ in Fall 2019. It was completely debilitating in my case. The experience was very traumatic, and I lost much hope in my life at first. However, over the course of several months and many doctors visits, I began to learn a lot of useful information to understand, manage, and prevent it. I want to share this info. My heart goes out to all of you suffering. But I believe this can be managed and do not lose hope. Please take everything in this post with a grain of salt as I am not a professional. I would recommend seeing a professional.\n\nA little back ground: i had BPPV very severely. After a lot of struggle, I finally found a physical therapist trained specifically in vestibular disorders who was able to correct it. After this, I also had an appointment with an ENT. He specializes in dizziness, and also himself struggled with BPPV. I learned a few things from both of these resources, that I did not know before, that were invaluable to me. I hope this information might help somebody else, too.\n\n\n******************************************\n\n#What I learned from the ENT: Things to help prevent BPPV.\n\nMy ENT was amazing.\n\n**He told me to specifically avoid 3 things if I want to avoid BPPV: caffeine, high sodium, and nicotine. These can bloat the inner ear and cause the crystals to come loose. As in, one single sodium or caffeine spike can cause a BPPV episode.** (I think with nicotine actually it restricts flow of a blood vessel within your ear, I do not know the mechanism there). About high sodium he told me this: \"do not change your whole life up. But if you bite in to something and it is very salty, spit it out, and drink a lot of water\". In fairness, I did change my entire life up. I have not had a drop of caffeine since he told me this, and I have not eaten over 1200mg of sodium even one day since. (I do not know what amount to use, and this might be obsessive, just explaining that I carefully regulate it.)\n\n**I want to provide some anecdotal evidence to support this**.\n\nFirst is myself. After my ENT told me this, I thought back to what had happened in my case. Now, I tended to eat the exact same thing every day with no variation. (I ate nutritional supplements for 100% of my nutrition, so it was very regimented). But **the night before I got BPPV badly, I had an entire frozen pizza and some popcorn.** I remember it distinctly because I actually thought I had food poisoning at first because of the pizza and even contacted the company. (Sorry company...) I had the foods that afternoon and evening and in the middle of the night I got BPPV...\n\nSecond piece of anecdotal evidence. I know someone else that struggled with BPPV. He was getting it about once a month. When my ENT shared this with me, I immediately shared the info with him and his parnter. When I did, I learned that they had already noticed a link to caffeine: apparently, he was occasionally drinking energy drinks (those drinks with tons of caffeine) to get through his night shifts, and they had started noticing a few months prior, that his BPPV kept happening the days after he was taking the energy drinks.\n\n**I wanted to recommend to all of you to simply cut caffeine entirely out of your diet (that can only benefit you anyway), and also to watch your sodium intakes. I sincerely hope this helps someone**.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n#What I learned from the physical therapist: General info about BPPV, habitual symptoms that can occur TEMPORARILY after it is cured, and exercises you can do to help manage them.\n\n\n1. **The inner ear has three canals (horizontal, posterior, and anterior). BPPV can occur (the crystals be loose) in any one of those 3 canals (though the majority occur in the posterior canal). The treatment/ maneuver to fix BPPV depends on which canal the crystals are in.** ( This is one reason why it might be useful to seek out a trained physical therapist who is trained in vestibular disorders, rather than trying to handle things on your own. Something else interesting: The nystagmus (those rapid eye movements that occur for some people when they are getting vertigo) actually help identify which canal the crystals are in, based on the direction the eyes move. This, I believe, is one reason the physical therapists advise you NOT to take an anti-motion sickness pill prior to treatment; it can limit the nystagmus and prevent proper diagnosis.\n\n2. **Even though you should not take motion sickness pills prior to going in for treatment, you CAN take an antiemedic (pills which prevent nausea and vomiting, like reglan or zofran).** These pills are incredibly effective, believe me. It does not just prevent vomiting but prevents the sensation of nausea. (\n\n3. **Once BPPV is resolved, you can still experience residual symptoms for a while (dizziness, unsteadiness, etc. not vertigo itself.) THIS IS TEMPORARY, DO NOT LOSE HOPE.** For a layman like myself, they described as \"'this is like your brain re-adjusting to correct orientation\". (My neurologist also said this was a fine explanation so it is backed up by more than one professional.) **So if you have eliminated your BPPV, but are still getting lingering dizziness, do not worry or lose hope. These symptoms are TEMPORARY, EXPECTED, and pass on their own.**\n\n4. **There are habituation exercises you can do to lessen these residual symptoms once your BPPV is cured**, and make them vanish quicker. (\n\nIn case anyone is interested, ( Please heed the warnings given at the top of the comment, such as, not doing this the day you get treated for BPPV, not doing them too quickly, and realizing that these particular exercises and instructions might have been tailored specifically to my situation... I do not want to do harm when I am trying to help. Either way, maybe it will help someone as much as it helped me. Good luck to you..\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hope this helps someone. Good luck and do not lose help. This is manageable and it is not the end of the world (like I thought it was). Another thing I want to add, is I believe there might be a link between lying down for very long periods of time, and BPPV. When I posted the thread last time, several people mentioned this to me. Later, I encountered a day where I was in a lying position for roughly the entire day (probably close to a 24 hour period), and the following day I encountered (albeit very mild..) vertigo. This is purely anecdotal but I am adding it nonetheless. Thanks for sharing! I would like to add for me not enough water and creatine have also triggered BPPV episodes. I am saving this post for the future! Thank you. Yes, staying hydrated is incredibly important. I know at least my ENT mentioned if by chance you ingest too much sodium, to drink a ton of water to balance it out. I do not know enough about the biology of the inner ear to know the best words to describe this, or what precisely is going on. Yes people, please stay hydrated. Prior to BPPV I drank very little water, I make it a habit to drink water all throughout the day since then.\n\nNever heard of the creatine thing, thanks a ton, I am going to look in to this. I think it is reducing the ability of the crystals to float normally in that liquid in the ear. Creatine changes the water balance by drawing more water to the muscles. I quit using it for some reason and could not go back on it without getting BPPV.\n\nWould be fascinated to hear if you turn anything up. I have also been interested to learn the exact reason and your explanation makes sense to me. (I am hesitant to speculate though because really I do not know!) It is something I will try and dig around with to get more info. Really interesting about creatine and water balance. Googling this and looking in to it now, i will not forget about it. Yes, I often wonder what are other dietary things that can have a similar impact on water balance. The sodium and caffeine stuff was the only one my ENT mentioned (and ones I definitely related to), but I imagine there must be more.\n\nIt is unfortunate because i never really see this written anywhere. I am not sure there is been proper studies regarding this. I have searched rigorously for research articles on BPPV causes. I have only been able to find weak evidence about what causes it. The most researched ones have been sodium balance and weather (times of weather flux such as stormy spring/autumn are correlated with a spike in cases in some areas). yeah i have seen really week studies too. I remember a paper where when you looked at the sample size they were studying it was something like 30 people. it was so frustrating. This disorder just does not seem to be all that well studied. It sucks because so many people are left in the lurch. I never even saw any studies regarding sodium balance. had my ENT not mentioned i would of never known. I would like to add, that I have been told to also cut out alcohol. Alcohol already affects balance and and the ears. But it can also bloat the inner ear and cause an episode. I am young, especially when I had my first episode, but I did not mind. I was not a heavy drinker. Every know and then I will have a small drink at a party or event but for the most part, I do not drink alcohol along with no caffeine I have read about avoiding alcohol with regards to the miniere's diet. I am aware it can affect balance/dizziness and that is why this is recommended, but was never quite sure the reason. I always got the impression it was just because alcohol effects balance and dizziness in people in general (i think people who get super drunk can get vertigo, but a vertigo that is caused by reasons other than what is going on with bppv?). Was not aware it had the potential to bloat the inner ear and trigger bppv however. Interesting, i will have to look in to that. luckily i am not a drinker so i cannot comment on personal experience with it regarding bppv That is what my ent told me at least. To avoid it along with caffeine. I did not realize it was mineres related too, but it makes sense as well interesting, thanks for sharing this, i had no clue. also im happy to hear that another ENT recommended not to consume caffeine. I remember contacting a vestibular orgnization some time ago and asking if caffeine was OK to drink with BPPV, and they said it is fine. Then my ENT told me all this and I was floored thinking, wow this info just is not out there. i am happy to hear it might be more widespread knowledge than i was assuming. Technically speaking, my ent told me to only avoid these things and be on a low sodium diet while experiencing dizziness and bppv. When I went 6 months after for a follow up appointment, they said that with my young age I do not have to be so cautious because my body easily bounces back and takes care of it is self. But bppv is so debilitating that I personally take precautions. Although some days I am bad with low sodium and go out to eat, which I am sure what I am eating has loads of sodium. All in all, it sounded like from my young age I did not have to avoid foods and drinks but I still choose too I think you are wise to be cautious. I am not sure why young age would have an impact on the swelling of the ear canal but i am not a doctor or a biologist so maybe there is some reason it would? I am also pretty young myself and BPPV is rare in my age group but my ent did not mention age should come in to play in terms of the physical effects these things would have on my body. Did the ENT mention this (swelling of ear canal) was the reasoning behind avoiding these things? or did he just tell you to avoid them in general? The reason I ask is because caffiene, alcohol, and others are commonly advised to avoid for people suffering from dizziness issues (many types, not just bppv). But the reason rarely seems to be given in my experience at least, and various things get lumped in to this list that are just about making dizziness more tolerable (vs. things that actually cause bppv to happen). even my physio told me to avoid these things but it was more 'well they can make some people dizzy so best to avoid them if you are having an episode as it will make it worse'\n\nsorry for all my posts, i am eager to understand more about this, and what other people are told. i am curious if alcohol actually has this impact of swelling the ear canal and causing the crystals to come lose, or if it is just another one of the dietary recommendations to avoid because it can cause general dizziness (which would clearly make bppv worse, but would not necessarily cause it to happen.) either way, i think it is great to avoid anyway as it is so bad for you. No worries. I have asked why, and why we get bppv. But I have been told there is not a definitive reason. No one knows. I know there is a correlation with head trauma. My physical therapist asked when I went with the first time and the second time, if I have experienced any head trauma. I know fast and sporadic movements can also come loose. My first episode was shortly after I came back from a vacation and I was asked a lot if flew by plane and if there was turbulence. Although the exact causes are unknown there does seem to be correlation to certain activities/events. \n\nBefore I forget my most recent episode (March) my physical therapist said their is a correlation between a lack of calcium and vitamin D and people who get bppv. The crystals are calcium\u2019s deposits and they become loose and smaller without enough calcium. I have been taking vitamins supplements for calcium and vitamins (with my doctors approval of course). Vitamin d I think helps keep them in place or something. I just know my physical therapist said a good majority of her patients are people who have long in door jobs (ei, casino workers, office jobs, etc) and a lack of vitamins d seems to possibly also not help with bppv. I also work inside all day with minimum sunlight exposer. \nHello! You have made the mistake of writing \"ect\" instead of \"etc.\"\n\n\"Ect\" is a common misspelling of \"etc,\" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase \"et cetera.\" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&amp;c.**, **&amp;c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as \"et\" to \"and\" + \"cetera\" to \"the rest;\" a literal translation to \"and the rest\" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. \n\n(\n\n^(I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Comments with a score less than zero will be automatically removed. If I commented on your post and you do not like it, reply with \"!delete\" and I will remove the post, regardless of score. Message me for bug reports.) That is one of the things that frustrates me about bppv tbh. My physio told me this as well - that no one quite knows why this occurs. But my ENT had a different answer for me, which is what prompted me to post this. His answer was that, there is various reasons (head trauma being one), but that the swelling of the inner ear is another reason, and can cause it to occur in people prone to it. and so various things that swell the inner ear (such as sodium and caffeine) should be avoided. when he told me this, i looked back on my own experience and realized every one of them occurred within about 12-24 hours after ingesting large amounts of sodium (as he suggested to me.) similarly, i have a friend who used to get BPPV regularly; his episodes always came the day after taking caffeine pills that he was using for work. of course these are only anecdotal but it was enough for me to convinced by what my ENT had told me. (maybe when they say no one knows why - they mean, no one knows why some people are prone to it and others arent? vs. not knowing the physical reasons why it happens in those folks?)\n\nby the way - i am sorry if my post appeared like i was being combative with what you suggested about alcohol. or if it sounds like i am trying to act like i know a whole lot, because i certainly do not. i am just trying to get a grasp on this myself. i am on a sort of mission to discover things that actually cause BPPV to happen so they can be actively avoided. so i am just trying to distinguish between things that can cause it to happen vs. things that aggravate dizziness. i appreciate your patience with me and following up with all the responses.\n\np.s. what you mentioned about air flight - strangely enough - my physio once mentioned they had a patient who used to get severe BPPV. He was free of it for quite some time, until he took an international flight. since then i have always been spooked to fly. yours is the second time i am hearing that someone got bppv post-flight. it makes me even more curious if there is a link between flying and bppv and why. yes, the sudden movements from turbulence, i had not thought about that, but it makes sense. i know they say folks who get long dental procedures who have their heads tilted back and have the machines gyrating in their mouth for long periods of time have reported getting BPPV. My first episode actually was not caused from flying. I drove to an from my destination, it was just a state over. My first episode seem to come out of know where and because of my young age (I was 22 at the time) the doctors could not even figure out what was wrong with me. Even my physical therapist at first thought it was bppv because I show no physical signs of it (like nystagmus). My second episode I believe is cause from getting my eyebrows done in the heat of her busy hours and moving my head too fast to get in and out of the chair. I know if you get bppv once you are more prone to it happening again. Like you said bppv is very frustrating because it is debilitating and no one know what exactly causes it. So no worries I understand, we are all here in this subreddit to support each other and understand bppv a little better. \n\nIt all affects our body differently. Like when I intake a lot of sodium I am perfectly fine the next day. My mother in law, travels and flys all time inspite of her bppv forcing her to retire early because she physically could not work cause of it. My husband always says that worrying only makes it worst. Life if too short to worry, just enjoy it. ah thank you greatly for clarifying about the flight! so just to clarify - you are saying you did not get BPPV after taking a flight (that the docs misunderstood when you said 'vacation' and just assumed you would been on a flight)? i would like to make sure i am understanding\n\nabout the like is too short to worry though. i do not want to give the wrong impression. i am not sitting around worrying about this (anymore - surely i used to), and not encouraging others to worry either. stress is only harmful to health. but i do believe there might be some simple things people can do to avoid this, or at least lessen the frequency. i do not mind doing those things (even if not all of them work for me). given how debilitating BPPV can be, it is a fantastic tradeoff in my mind. i do recognize it is going to be on a different scale for everyone though. i do not mind forgoing sodium and caffeine for example. it is a change i was more than happy to make and i never deviate from it. but maybe someone else would not want to give that up. perhaps i should do better about keeping that perspective in my mind, and seeing that from other people's eyes. i guess i am just trying to figure out some things that can potentially trigger BPPV, and share that with others. then at least they have the knowledge and opportunity to avoid it if they would like to (or do with that information what they would like). i just know i wished i would known this stuff back when i was dealing with it. I could not agree more. I believe they were asking just in case. I strongly believe a lot of this is also stress related. Stressing can potentially bring it on and it definitely does not help either ok i get you about the flight then. thanks a lot for clarifying that because i was a little worried after i read that! i have also read about the stress component with BPPV, and i would not be surprised  if it is linked. i know my bppv episodes coincided with perhaps the highest stress i would encountered in my life, an ongoing period of constant stress that lasted 2 years, and it came at the tail end of that. it could very well be a coincidence but i often wonder if it contributed to whatever set things in motion for this to happen to me personally. since bppv i have spent so much time eliminating stress, getting better sleep, seeing life from new perspectives and not worrying about trivial things. and handling stressful situations differently. my life is so much calmer now and it is like my life changed as a result. i have learned that stress can be very harmful on the body since this happened. wish i would known many years ago because i never thought about it before bppv. (plus the experience of life is just so much better without stressing.) thank you for exchanging your thoughts with me. With my mother in law, she was the most stressed in her life. Her bppv may have forced her to retire, but she was extremely stressed out with work. Once she retired things got better rapidly. I would not be surprised if stress plays a bigger part in this than we realize", "Does anyone here do yoga? I love yoga so much and it is my preferred workout but I live in fear that it will trigger my BPPV due to positions where my head is partially or fully hanging upside down. Just wondering if anyone out there successfully still yogas and if there is hope for me \ud83d\ude0c I used to love yoga, unfortunately two different episodes of BPPV were triggered by yoga for me so I quit doing it for the most part. I still do yoga because ironically, it helps my BPPV by training my brain to get used to head movements. But I avoid following the positions to a T. Like, I avoid bending my head or back too low like in Forward Fold. And I do not hold positions for very long. I prefer vinyasa/flow, which has faster transitions and more standing positions, to yin yoga, which is the opposite. Yoga helps my bppv. Love yoga I currently practice yoga once a week for now and will increase once I train my brain that I am not Fn dizzy I think Kundalini Yoga brought my episodes on, after my first class I was dizzy till I had a full BPPV episode which continued for months.  No more Kundalini \ud83d\ude14, or caffeine.  I think my ear crystals were just knocked around from the yoga.", "Had Eply done, still lingering dizzyness and today felt a little vertigo So woke up with full blown vertigo in Tuesday and was fortune enough to see an ENT and have the Eply done on Tuesday as well.\n\nHave been slowly recovering and just felt light headed and a bit woozy over the past four days.\n\nThen today morning I felt good, but a few hours ago I was putting on a jacket and the room sort of shook a bit. Was not full blown spinning just shaking and I had to grab the wall for balance.\n\nSince then I have felt a little worse then when I was recovering.\n\nWhat is happening? Is this normal? Should I be worried? I am not an expert since I had my first bppv attack two weeks ago, but that sounds a lot like my experience. I had slight vertigo for about 48 hours after Epley and then felt like I had a BPPV hangover for the rest of the week. Are you all better now? Yes! I did the Epley maneuver for 10 days, 3x a day. I am back to sleeping on both sides and no more \u201cBPPV hangover.\u201d I am sorry you are going through this...it totally sucks, but it will get better. Yes! I did the Epley maneuver for 10 days, 3x a day. I am back to sleeping on both sides and no more \u201cBPPV hangover.\u201d I am sorry you are going through this...it totally sucks, but it will get better. This is normal, this happens to me if I have not done the Eply maneuver in a while, usually takes a day or two for the lingering dizziness to go away. Just make sure you do the Eply maneuver daily, the ENT specialists that I saw recommended that you do it at least 3x a day. So glad to hear you are better!\n\nWait holdup? 3x times a day for 10 days? \n\nI have only had it done once by the ENT. I have had vertigo before, three years ago and it was only done once back then as well My ENT did not say anything about doing it multiple times. He just did it once. I had no clue it had to be done mutliple times on your own.\n\nDo you just do the Eply even if you do not have Vertigo? Thanks! Yes, the wobbling sounds about right. I felt like I was near swaying down the hallways if that makes sense. Certain movements with my head would also trigger me, and sitting up too fast led to some disorientation.\n\nI had Epley done once in the ER and it made me violently ill. But then I started doing it at home on my own, and I kind of worked out a good method. It was the next day and I felt like it everything \u201cclicked\u201d back into place. Still had the BPPV hangover for awhile, but the acute vertigo was done after that. It is funny, different places must use different guidelines. I was told NOT to do the Epley more than once every 3 days or so. You could still have vertigo, it is also possible that the Epley fixed it, sometimes people continue to have symptoms for a little while afterwards. Or your crystal could have moved into the horizontal canal (like I am currently dealing with) and you need to do a different maneuver, Epley would not be effective. Looking straight up is one way to find out if you still have vertigo that the Epley will help. If you are still feeling weird by Monday you might want to get a recheck. That is a relief\n\nYeah, I lie back or look in the direction of where my vertigo was the worst and nothing is spinning.\n\nSo hopefully it is just BPPV hangover. I do have a headache thou\n\nHopefully it will be gone soon I look in every direction and nothing is spinning, which is good\n\nI just feel off, lightheaded and wobbly. Got a headache too.\n\nI have my follow up Monday so I guess we will see then.\n\nThanks for your help! You are welcome! If it were me I would not do the Epley or any maneuver until your follow up, especially if you are not having any actual spinning. It is normal to feel off for a few days, even if the crystal is cleared. Good luck! There is a certain amount of anxiety and over attention given to balance after an attack. For me it felt like I was walking on a boat for a few weeks. Eventually it just passed. Yeah I definitely have some anxiety. Even when I had the attack I was sweating uncontrollably\n\nNow I am analyzing how I feel constantly Residual dizziness is totally normal. I had an episode and did not get the Epley done until a couple weeks later. (I was hoping it would go away on its own but ended up going to a PT to correct it.) because I waited so long the residual dizziness took weeks to go away. All gone now. Just take it easy, for the next few days. \n\nDid you follow the post Epley instructions? Like sleeping elevated for a few days after and not doing any motions that could cause the Otoliths to come out again? Thank you, you are reply is reliving. I continue to sleep on two/three pillows. I think I made the mistake of rotating to the bad side for a little bit but I will not be doing that again. Maybe add some pillows on your sides to help keep you from rolling over on your bad side until your symptoms subside. Also adding a pillow under your knees will help your lower back if sleeping that way is uncomfortable. Sleeping elevated made my lower back hurt so bad lol Oh man that is a great tip. My lower back is killing me and it is why I rolled over lol.", "BPPV and the epley maneuver So about a month ago my doctor diagnosed me over the phone with BPPV and instructed me on how to do the Epley maneuver and it does not seem to do anything, I get a little better then without doing anything the symptoms go away for a week or so and then come back out of the blue and I have no idea why\n\nMy dr also prescribed me Betahistine but I have not taken taken it because I get nervous about taking new meds with my IBS\n\nI duno what i am doing here maybe just looking for some helpful tips or guidance? I have never had this issues before.\n\nThanks for listening How often do you do it once you get an episode I try to do it 3-4 times a day Oh shoot. Was wondering if maybe you were only doing it once or something. Have you tried any of the other exercises like the Brandt Daroff or the half somersault one? Never heard of the other 2 to be honest and I partially wonder if i am not doing the epley properly I have not found a reliable way to self perform Epley despite numerous demonstrations and I have been told that is not uncommon Makes me feel better that i am not the only one So I had BPPV symptoms for probably 6-7 months after my first initial incident.\n\nEpley maneuver did not trigger it, no balance or vestibular problems.\n\nI went to a new doctor and he had me take a bunch of stuff to try and clear out the fluid in my ears. Prescribed me Flonase, Allegra (generic allergy med), had me do a sinus rinse daily, and auto-inflate (hold your nose closed with your fingers and try to blow out of your nose, makes your ears pop).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found after doing this for 4-5 weeks my symptoms went away, so i take the Flonase daily and it seems to have done the trick.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmay or may not help you but i figured i would share, i wasted hundreds of dollars trying to figure out what was wrong with me. Hmm that is interesting I will have to give that a try thanks! i had bppv for about a month. went to an ent (ear nose and throat) dr who had a specialist in her office that performed the epley properly on me. my symptoms were finally resolved.\n\nattempting to perform the epley on your own is hit or miss. some are successful some are not. id find a specialist who knows the maneuver. You should schedule an appointment with a physical therapist that speciliazes in Balance/BPPV issues.   They can perform the epley manuever so you can see 1st hand how it is done properly.  FYI - it took 2 manuevers \\ before my BPPV showed up on in my right ear on the 3rd try.  And when it did - the technician said it was text book BPPV.   She performed the manuever 2 more times which helped reduce the severity of dizziness but did not get rid of the BPPV completely.  I had to go home and lay down with my head elevated \\ for the entire day to help reduce the chance of crystals falling back into the wrong location.  \n\nIf you cannot get an appt with a physical therapist - An alternative to epley maneuver that has helped me int he past is this - much easier to perform:\n\n( Try the Brandt Daroff maneuvers. I found the epley only works when a pro is helping you. So i am finding! Thanks I will give that one a shot Thank you for sharing this alternate BPPV exercise method.  My doctor told me to use Epley at home.  Unfortunately I cannot get more than 15 seconds in (left side) before the spinning becomes so violent (perceived by me) that I have to fumble to sit up to get the spinning to stop.   \n\nMy question (if anyone knows or has experience in this) is \"how long should I experience the spinning, and should I fight through it to reach the 30 second exercise recommendation for better results?\".  If this is something I simply need to fight through - I do not mind it.  But the dizziness makes me anxious and nauseous.   Any help or shared experiences are greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance! Yes - you have to \"fight\" through the dizziness and hold the position for at least 30 seconds.  Here is an alternative /modified epley maneuver that might be easier to perform:\n\n\n\nI have done the epley maneuver at home and it took A LOT of effort to actually start the maneuver.  The room and my stomach was spinning but by the 3rd try the room stopped spinning.  :) Wow it worked after just 2 rounds!  Thank you so much for the information and letting me know I had to fight through it!  Totally worth it! Glad to hear!   Just wish there was a less anxiety ridden way to either prevent crystals or move them out of the ear. :)", "Hi everyone, my roommate is experiencing dizziness and is really needing some advice on what to do. Please bear with me because this will be long. Back in May of 2019, my roommate went on a road trip to California. Halfway to California he was driving in the middle of nowhere and started to feel extremely dizzy. He pulled over at a gas station, thinking it was because he needed something to eat, he bought food and ate it. The dizziness did not subside but he had to keep going and pushed through it. Once he came back home he was still experiencing the dizziness. He has been to 2 ENTs, one sent him away with ideas of places to visit which he did and the other prescribed him anti seizure medication for migraines because the doctor thought that what may be causing the dizziness. He has been to 2 physical therapy places both telling him nothing is wrong. He has been to an eye doctor and nothing was wrong with his eyes.  He has been to an audiologist and got a hearing test done, everything came back normal. He has gotten bloodwork done. He has been to a neurologist and got an mri, an eeg, and a prolonged eeg. He recently even went to the cardiologist and still nothing could explain why he is dizzy. Today he went to an allergist and also is going to a chiropractor right now. He is starting to lose hope and can still not find an answer as to why he is experiencing dizziness. \n\nPlease if anyone else has the same experience or suggestions as to what he could do please please let me know. He just wants to get to the bottom of this!! I see that he is had a fair number of tests, but has he had any vestibular testing done? Yes he had a few different types of vestibular testing and nothing has come up Hmm. Not a doctor, but in that case I would suspect that maybe it is migraine and they just did not get the right medications to block it yet? That is not terribly uncommon with vestibular migraine, from what I have read. \n\nAnyways, two more sets of questions that might help narrow it down: \n\nFirst, how does he describe the dizziness? Is it constant, or episodic? If it is constant, does the intensity vary at all? And what exactly is the sensation of dizziness: vertigo (room spinning), or a general sensation of imbalance/\"on a boat\", or lightheadedness? \n\nSecondly, have *any* medications he is tried helped at all? No medications have helped, it is not room spinning but it is an internal feeling like someone is shaking his head. It is constant however the intensity changes depending if he is in the car it gets worse, the vibration from a fan it gets worse, a loud noise it gets worse, and working out makes the dizziness worse. Some days it is easier to ignore but it is always constant Yeah, considering the duration and the otherwise clean bill of health, I would recommend trying to see a doctor who specializes in vestibular migraine, if only to rule it out as a possibility (it sounds like only one medication was tried for this, which hardly rules it out). Another possibility (to bring up with a doctor, of course) might be ( since his symptoms sound kind of similar to that. He will definitely try to see a doctor who specializes in vestibular migraines. Wow I just read about PPPD and his symptoms sound very similar to it, he will bring it up to his doctor. I really cannot thank you enough for your help, this gives him hope!! No problem, hope he feels better soon. I am not a doctor so keep that in mind.\n\nSomeone has mentioned PPPD which is a possibility since it gets worse in motion. Usually though PPPD is precipitated by a vestibular event like migraine or some peripheral vestibular problem. Your friend just suddenly started experiencing it in the car, right? Maybe look into mal de debarquement as an option, though with mal de debarquement I believe symptoms improve when in the car. Migraine is also another possibility, though I believe it is episodic but I could be wrong. Does your friend experience dizziness all the time or just intermittently? Did your friend visit a neuro optometrist? Most ophthalmologist or optometrists do not have much experience with binocular vision disorders (how your eyes work together). Check this out \n\nOther ideas: cervical vertigo (did he also get a cervical mri that might show nerve compression)? There are also tests that can show muscles imbalances (that might throw off proprioception, which in turn throws off balance) - in the case of stiff neck. \n\nHead CT to ensure sinuses are clear? You mentioned he went to ENTs but not sure the extent of the testing they did. Some sinus infections can cause dizziness without many symptoms\n\nAnd of course PPPD as other posters have noted - but do bear in mind this is rare. Usually develops from an acute vestibular episode in people who suffer from other comorbidites such as anxiety and/or depression. \n\nApart from that, the general principle is that we use visual, proprioception and vestibular input to maintain balance - when one is off, we feel dizzy. The key is ensure each systems works well independently and sends the correct signals - and then make sure they integrate correctly We are trying to figure out what doctor he should go to for possible PPPD, do you have any recommendations on the type of doctor we should see? I am afraid I am not sure, but if I had to take a guess I would probably look for either an ENT or a neurologist who really knows their stuff on vestibular disorders.", "BPPV,vertigo, noise, loud sounds. This is my reply to another thread, figured it could help others...........\n\nHey, I hope you see this......I get bppv and it sucks, however I had something else going on like what you describe. I will get to the point so I do not bore you then you can read the rest if you want. Ended up being my occipital nerve, that runs through the muscles at the base of your skull upper neck, the nerves go all over the place. Now...........\n\nSide to side head movement seemed to bug me and be lagging. I was not able to get my right ear to pop hardly like my left. If I sat still, and pushed my jaw forward I would get slight dizzy. If I moved jaw to the left, I would get slight dizzy. To the right I would feel fine. Sounds like clanking dishes, other loud bursts of sound, ppl voices, even my own voice, would start making me dizzy, like my eyes would twitch to the sound. The upper right side of my neck under the base of my skull would feel tight. I started to massage the muscles under the base of my skull, occipital area, next day it seemed a bit better. I headed to my chiropractor and he said it is my occipital nerve, he did an occipital lift adjustment and it cleared everything up.\n\nEvery night I would lay on my side with my head propped up on my hand, he told me to stop that crap lol.\n\nI have had to do it 4 times in last 6 months. It works every time.\n\nSo, google and YouTube occipital lift for vertigo.\n\nI can bet you that is what is happening.\n\nLet me know. Good luck.\n\nGo in your kitchen and tap a couple plates together and see if it makes your eyes blur or feel dizzy. Keep in mind what I describe above, is not about my bppv, it is an additional issue I have on top of the bppv I get now and then. ( **Superior canal dehiscence syndrome**\n\nSuperior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS) is a set of hearing and balance symptoms, related to a rare medical condition of the inner ear, known as superior canal dehiscence.  The symptoms are caused by a thinning or complete absence of the part of the temporal bone overlying the superior semicircular canal of the vestibular system. There is evidence that this rare defect, or susceptibility, is congenital.  There are also numerous cases of symptoms arising after physical trauma to the head.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 Yes I have looked into that. Luckily mine was the occipital nerve causing it, and the occipital lift from the chiropractor cleared it up. The vertebrae that meets the base of the skull and all those muscles under the base of the skull can do very strange things to us. \n\nHopefully I never have to face the condition you listed.", "BPPV or something else? Hey guys,\n\nMy mom (70 years old) started feeling dizzy 3 days ago. I actually ended up calling an ambulance because she looked so terrible and exhausted. She looked like she was going to collapse and I had to help walk her to bed. I thought it was a cardiac issue as her heart rate felt irregular when I palpated it (I am a nurse). They ruled out any cardiac issues at the hospital and was diagnosed with BPPV. I am just not sure if she is fitting the criteria. She told me this morning she had a dizzy episode while laying in bed that lasted 6-7 minutes. I am reading on UpToDate (an app that doctors use with current diagnosis information) that BPPV should only last for up to 1 minute at a time. She also gets quite dizzy lying down. And it happens randomly even when she has not moved her head. She also gets dizzy when changing positions or when bending down to pick something up etc. But I am worried she has something more sinister like a brain tumour or something since the episodes are lasting so long. Or maybe Meniere\u2019s as her hearing has been getting worse but I am not sure if that is just due to aging. But with Meniere\u2019s it seems like the vertigo episodes can last 20+ minutes. Just wondering what your guys\u2019 opinions are. i had bppv back in march. once i saw a ent (ear nose and throat) dr and their specialist did the epley maneuver on me twice i was cured in a couple days. some say that you can try the epley at home. i tried and it didnt work. only when it was performed by a specialist was bppv cured.\n\ni suggest your mom see an ent dr. Take a look at these, and then if you can observe her eyes during a dizzy spell see if she has nystagmus. \n\nThe fact that she had a 6-7 minute episode is unusual, Bppv vertigo usually only lasts maybe a minute or so. The heart stuff and fatigue are not BPPV but could be anxiety, did she get a covid test? Try giving her some vitamin d.", "Vertigo spinning looking straight up, what maneuvers could I try? Hey everyone, got another bppv issue this month and my bad ear was on my left. I used the epley maneuver and it fixed that side, but I cannot figure out the vertigo looking straight up. I have always had this looking up vertigo alongside the bad left ear, I just thought the epley would fix that too. \n\nI have been doing research for days now and I cannot figure out what maneuver would work for my specific vertigo. The odd thing is that laying on my back and looking straight up does not case vertigo. I have to look up and slightly arch back for it to happen. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks! So you do not get dizzy rolling to either side? No I have not experienced serious vertigo on my sides anymore the day after doing the epley. This morning I woke up and it took me less time to adjust to getting upright. Perhaps it is just residual effects that I am working through.\n\nI am at work right now so I cannot risk to get dizzy and feel off for the next few hours. Later tonight I am going to test some positions and see how I react. I do not know if you have seen a doctor and I know different doctors have different protocols but mine said after doing the maneuver to give it a few days before testing to see if it worked. In the meantime I was told to try to sleep on my back or the unaffected side as much as possible and to avoid quick head movements. The reasoning is that it takes time for the crystal to settle back in place and if you keep doing the maneuver once you have done it and it is worked you could end up knocking the crystal back out of place. \n\nAnother possibility if you are not having the dizziness as much and just feel \u201coff\u201d is the crystal is in a different canal, which happened to me. When it happened the Epley did not work at all, it just made me feel really sick the whole way through. I also would get a sensation like I was moving when I was sitting still and kind of felt like I was on a boat. They used the barbecue roll on me to fix it. \n\nHonestly the best thing you can do if it does not resolve quickly is see a specialist because it is so hard to know which canal it is in. Barring that, have someone check your eyes while you are dizzy, that can let you know which canal is involved. This is a good source of info   Appreciate the detailed response. I read up about letting things \"settle\" as well. Right now if I turn my head too quickly to the left, while lying down, I get a very very small sensation of spinning that quickly goes away. I then do the bbq roll just in case if I feel that.\n\nI will purposely sleep on my right side for the next few days though just to see what happens. I am currently avoiding any quick head movements too. Today has been better so far so I think I am progressing.\n\nMy closest bppv specialist is an hour away and does not have an appointment available for 2 months. It really sucks, I wish I could get a doctor to see the eye twitching but luckily that was fixed (hopefully) with an epley towards my left side. I know for sure a specialist would diagnose this in a second but I have no one nearby that is readily available.\n\nAlso I stopped taking the meclizine in hopes that my brain \"rewires\" itself. I heard that taking too much of that medicine is a crutch and prolongs the healing process.\n\nThat was a really informative link too btw, thanks for that. You are welcome! I know how awful it can feel. My specialist clinic is about an hour away too, luckily I got my last bout resolved just before everything shut down (I am in the US). The only thing I know about meclizine is that they told me not to take it before an appointment because it can mask the symptoms they use to make a diagnosis. I am not sure if it actually helped me feel less dizzy but it did make me tired so I could sleep better. Good luck, I hope you get it resolved quickly. I perform the foster maneuver for vertical nystagmus. This maneuver right?  Yep! Appreciate it, going to give it a try later today. I still feel some slight vertigo sensation on my left side when I lie down so I have avoided sleeping on my left. The Epley to my left has not resolved it though plus looking straight up gives me the vertigo as well. Finger's crossed for this maneuver. this is so me :( i just went to that youtube link and have never seen that maneuver before. i have done plenty of epley maneuvers and for the past year or two ive always had a slight vertigo feeling when facing towards a lower right or left lying down or sitting. because i know what a good bppv attack feels like i have not done the epley again even though ive continuously felt it on/off. i think i may try this carol foster maneuver and see what happens! thanks for posting the link! It works well, at least for me. I think I am back to 100%. Seems like the maneuver helped...", "What happens if you do the at home Epley maneuver on the wrong side? I have been having extreme vertigo for the past week and recently learned about this technique. However, upon the Dix test on my own, I found neither side to be worse than the other, rather leaning down or looking up being the issue. So I went ahead and did it on the side that I think creates the most dizzyness. It is been about half an hour now, so what should I do? And yes it is 2AM so my options are limited.", "Had a vertigo attack when I woke up this morning. First time experience. I woke up a few hours after going to bed this morning, had not been drinking, but had been awake until very late. I faintly remember turning from side to side in the bed a few times before I opened my eyes and experienced an immense feeling of vertigo which after a few minutes turned into nausea. The type you get when you have been drinking way too much.\n\nI rushed into the bathroom and vomited just a tiny bit after which I sat on the toilet to try and regain my composure. After about 5 minutes I went into my bed again and tried falling asleep again, but every time I would slightly move around in when I would relapse into the vertigo. After a bit of experimentation I figured out I could only sleep in one specific position without getting dizzy. \n\nOne strange experience which led me to do some research online today and the symptoms of BPPV sounds very similar to what I experienced. I hope it will not repeat and will be drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated this evening.", "Saw a PT , how long before you felt results ? It is been a week and I definitely feel better in some respects. My main complaint was dizziness, disorientation, and feeling like I am falling over \n\nMy PT said that because I did not respond to the Dax halpike (or Whatveer it is called ) but did have some vestibular balance issues so she gave me some exercises. \n\nDoes this sound right? I will not need the BPPV maneuvers anymore because my vertigo has been gone for a while ? Yeah, it sounds kind of right. \n\nIf you have BPPV and the Dix-Halpike can identify the ear and cannel, then a proper Epley (or Semont, Foster, and Brandt-Daroff) should make you go from \"my life is over as I know it\" to \"I am not feeling great, but I will make it\" immediately.  \n\nHowever, it is very common to feel residual effects. I call it \"floating\", where I am a bit unsteady and take special care when going down stairs. You should be thoughtful about how you move by making no sudden movements, no bending over, etc for a while so things can settle down. \n\nDo you still feel dizzy and disoriented? If so it may be fruitful to talk to the PT again. Some days no, some days yes. It is been a roller coaster of \u201cwow today I feel normal\u201d then the next a little dizzy . Do you ever get an after effect feeling where when you lay down and close your eyes after a minute or two your eyes will want to twitch or move a certain way? The first episode I had a few months ago that was happening constantly before I figured out how to do the maneuvers...this time around I got on top of it right away, but I am still feeling a small eye twitch sometimes when I lay on my back and close my eyes for a few minutes. \n\nLast time I did the hallpike it was my right ear, this time it was my left. Had the nystagmus both times so I am 99% sure it was bppv. Both times started from sitting up in bed. I have felt that way for several weeks after a bad episode. I have had this and I hate it. I usually sleep propped up for a while after a BPPV episode It took me 7 days to get back to normal last time, but I had vertigo 3 out of the 7 because I did not know how to treat it. This time I am on day 5 and I do not feel as bad as last time but still having the after effects. It is been about two months , I had two episodes in a month. I feel better but not 100% I have had BPPV on and off for 6+ years. During this time I have had a mix of feeling better straight away after seeing the PT vs taking months and months and months of rehab to starting feeling better. I honestly believe it is not something you can fix overnight and each episode leaves your body in a different state. \n\nOne thing I can absolutely recommend is doing the exercises! For years prior when I did not realise I had BPPV I just pushed through and lived with it (was horrible) which left me with PPPD. When I found a PT that knew what I was going through her exercises changed everything for me. This was me.  Keep banging out the homework the therapists give you.  Do not miss a beat.  A few other things helped me with the residual dizziness.  \n\n1). Keep active.  Do shit.  Excercise.  Your brain needs to habituate.  \n\n2.). Accupuncture helped me.  \n\n3.). Massage therapy was great too.  We get anxious and tense in neck and shoulders from vertigo/dizziness.  Get neck shoulder massage therapy.  \n\n4.). Sleep well.  \n\n5.). Manage anxiety.", "Developing vertigo I  went on a cruise ship last December and developed some sort of vertigo, as if I was still on the ship even though I was on land. It lasted an entire week and it is just a really unsettling feeling. I get nauseous here and there, but I do not vomit. Just this past weekend I was on a boat for an hour on Saturday and a few hours on Sunday. Now I still feel like I still am on the boat! I just do not get what is going on with me, but I do not like this feeling. I just took a dramamine hoping these effects will temporarily go away, but please I am seeking help. What should I do?

So I have read so many people in here say their symptoms come and go, or are temporary and never return, but very few seem to have what I have every single day.\n\nI was diagnosed 20 years ago with BPPV, and I know many of my triggers, but they are *ALWAYS THERE*.\n\nIf I ride in a vehicle with anyone other than myself driving, I get a vertigo episode within minutes. Especially if in the back seat.\n\nIf I ride in any boat (including cruise ships) for any length of time I get an episode of vertigo.\n\nBoth of those scenarios trigger my most violent episodes where I usually either throw up from the nausea of discomfort and spinning, or in extreme circumstances I have even fainted.\n\nIf I look at the ceiling directly above me with my eyes open I am *usually* fine, but if I do it with my eyes closed I immediately get an episode of vertigo, but it goes away within about 5-10 seconds. If I do it often it will lead to a headache.\n\nIs anyone else here similar to me with this?\n\nI am perfectly fine on a roller coaster or at a water park though, and am perfectly fine driving 6+ hours if I am the one behind the wheel (leading me to believe that *seeing* where I am  is an important element of my symptoms.)", "Residual Dizziness I first had a very bad bout in July, then twice in August - now it is roughly 2 weeks, but yesterday I got this \u201calmost spinning\u201d-feeling while walking in the kitchen - not the fullblown vertigo I am used to with BPPV, but more like the feeling of \u201cfalling\u201d right before falling asleep omg. Afterwards everything is wobbly. I tried to the half-sommersault and checked Dix-H, but nothing like the regular spinning - just kind of like the room is tipping or always just about to spin. I think I tried Sommersault at least 5 times but could not provoke an episode. This morning the feeling came back while looking slightly down - I made epley with my dad, and even did the BBQ-roll to rule out the crystals should be in the wrong canal. I get very uncomfortable/dizzy when sitting upright afterwards, but still no spinning, just intense pressure and that \u201calmost spinning\u201d sensation :( \n\nI visited my ENT and left an hour ago, we checked my canals and did the Epley - she said that there was slight movement with my right eye, but nothing that got worse after testing twice + Epley. So she said to come back in a week time if I still feel off, but we agreed that she probably got the crystals back in place - if they were ever out :( \n\nSo in conclusions I am very anxious and scared.  I have also gotten checked late August, where they found no signs of nystagmus either - so I am beginning to think that I have gone very paranoid and am mistaking the residual dizziness for a new episode. \n\nWith this in mind, is there anyone who has a similar experience? Will the room keep tilting when doing the Epley for you, even after it has successfully returned the crystals back to where they belong? Do you get these weird \u201crushes\u201d? I am used to RD being very boat-like, but none of the sort this time. \n\nI am so scared and hope this will all end soon. :(  Hi,\n  I am a newbie to BPPV, too. I wanted to offer my support and let you know that I have had residual dizziness on and off since my initial vertigo episode. The more I pay attention to how I am feeling, the more I feel the \u201calmost spinning\u201d feeling you describe. Everything I have read says that this is very common after a true vertigo episode and eventually it will wear off. Someone will come along on this post with more experience and can offer you more advice. I just wanted you to know that you are not alone! I was diagnosed with BPPV a week ago in the ER and it scared the daylights out of me, so you are not alone there.  My ENT follow-up sent me for physical therapy and I did my first Epley yesterday.  The ENT did not see nystagmus but I had been taking Antivert which might have masked the symptoms.  I stopped taking it and yesterday, the PT got my eye(s) to bounce like ping ping balls.  \n\nI feel worse today than before therapy, but residual dizziness is common (40-50%) and could be the result of your brain \"resetting\".  I read that the RD can last a few weeks after a successful repositioning.  My PT said to keep moving, but it is hard when you are walking like you are  drunk.  Good luck! I had bppv end of June. I went to physical therapy twice and the second time was so dizzy I had to get a ride home. Since then I had another dizzy episode at work and had to be driven home just from looking down. I still to this day sleep on my adjustable bed with the head raised. If I let it go too far down to normal, when I get up I feel dizzy. Not the vertigo type dizzy, just dizzy and it is just for a couple of seconds. I have heard this whole scenario can last about three months or so. It will be three months for me end of September. I cannot wait to lay down in bed again. I feel for you but hang in there and hopefully we will all get through this at some point", "Overly sensitive vestibular system following BPPV? I cannot tell if this is just hyper-vigilance or something on its own. But, does anyone else feel they are super sensitive to motion in both feeling it and viewing it?\n\nFor example, I was in the car the other day and my friend  was at a ride light and moving towards it very, very slowly (snails pace). I was looking out the window and immediately thought I was having a dizzy episode not realizing the car was actually moving. Tough to really describe. Just super, super sensitive/aware of even subtle movements. I have not had an episode in a few months, but my last one lasted at least 3 months. Since then I have felt that my balance has been permanently affected. There are times when I am super tired, if I close my eyes I feel a quick sensation of vertigo, but if I open them the room is not spinning. It is very strange. \n\nBut also, after any typical episode I am very sensitive to movement even minor ones.  I tend to have an incident and then reminding, fuzzy dizziness or vertigo for a week to a month. I do think having it once or twice makes you more sensitive, but that is just personal feeling. I think some of it is gaze instability as it seems to improve somewhat with gaze instability exercises. Can check that out maybe. Good luck and hope you feel better! Have a look at the ( at about the middle of the Treatment section. Some folks complain of prolonged dizziness, which may be persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD).\n\nAll the best, OP! We are rootin' for you and others. As I understand it, your brain begins to adapt to the incorrect signals it is been receiving during an episode of BPPV. As a result, once BPPV is cleared, many people deal with residual dizziness and other symptoms as their brain re-adjusts to normal signals again. Longer lasting and more severe episodes I am assuming lead to worse residual symptoms as the brain has had longer to adapt. I am not sure if that is what is going on with you but thought i will share this. When i realized this, it gave me a lot of comfort because i understand what was going on (At least in my situation.). \nThe residual symptoms lessened and eventually went away. I hope you do know there are habituation exercises that can be done to help with these symptoms - they help your brain re-adjust more quickly to the normal signals again.\n\nStrangely, the one thing that never went away for me is dizziness when i lay down. It is incredibly mild for me, but indeed when i roll over or lay down at night, i do get strange few moments of dizziness, and occasionally sensations of vertigo if my eyes are closed (and then yes they go away if i open my eyes).  it is so mild for me however that it is not more than a small annoyance (nothing at all like when i had bppv.) i am not sure if it is a real thing i am experiencing or what. OP - I want to reiterate to you what I mentioned to another user in this thread. As my physical therapist explained to me: During episodes of BPPV (Especially prolonged ones), your brain begins to adapt to the poor signals it is being sent about position. As a result, once BPPV is cured, many people experience residual symptoms, that are happening as your brain has adapted to the bad information. These symptoms can lessen and go away as your brain slowly adjusts to correct information. There are habituation exercises that can be done to help speed up this process.\n\n\nAn interesting corollary to this might be something like strabismus (when one of a person's eyes turns in or outward, such as being cross-eyed in one eye.) Folks with this condition see from both eyes, but their brain adapts over time by ignoring the vision of the drifting eye. Or another interesting take - there are studies in which folks were given inverted glasses (so they see the world 'inverted/upside down', or with their vision off by a specific degree). The brain slowly begins to adjust to the incorrect spatial information so that when the person reaches their hand out to grab something, they end up grabbing in the correct direction. I am just giving these as examples to try and explain what (I understand at least) is going on - brain adapts to faulty information so we can continue living as normally as possible. Imagine now those glasses studies for example - if the person takes off the glasses after a very long time, their brain has adapted - if they try and reach out and grab something, they will reach in the wrong direction, as their brain now has a different understanding of spatial relationships. And it will take time for them to readjust to normal vision.", "Performing Epley worsened the condition Woke up to the world spinning few days ago, I noticed sleeping/turning over to my right ear caused the vertigo to violently erupt.\n\nI performed Epley for the first time (targeting the right ear), it did not alleviate the right ear problem and introduced more issues. I finished the movement with my head looking straight down before returning to a seated position.\n\nI had a very dizzy/foggy/unstable feeling constantly afterwards, especially when I walked. I felt like I was \"floating\" and side to side body movements felt very off.\n\nAfter some time, I performed Epley again, this time took longer and reclined my head back further. I finished the movement at a 45 degree angle downwards instead of looking straight down like before. Right ear problem is now gone. I can fully lean both left and right so my ear is touching the ground without symptoms.\n\nHowever, I still have this overall sensation of dizzyness and instability from before. Leaning back and forwards now give me vertigo, I tried doing pushups with my head positioned straight down and now feel really sick.\n\nCould this be a problem with my anterior canal? Did I somehow transfer the crystals somewhere else? Is this type of thing common? It is been about 10 days total, maybe I should wait it out and see what happens? If I can lean all the way left and right without issues, and only get vertigo from forwards/backwards then what kind of BPPV do I have? This thing is driving me crazy. I had the same thing happen to me and also tried the right ear Epley. I have been dizzy on and off for over a week with extreme vertigo 2 of those days. I literally could not even get out of bed and I can only lay on my left side. I believe mine is worse from the weather and I also have been told I have M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease however this last spell felt only like BPPV to me. I think you have to adjust ypur expectation about a return to normalcy. I felt dizzy for a week and a half after my onset of bppv and felt \"off\"; foggy, tired, dizzy, for a month. Do the brandt-daroff exercises 5x a day and it will likely speed things along. Good luck! As long as you know what ear is affected, performing Epleys cannot hurt - at worst, you will transfer otoconia to the horizontal canal. If this happens, they will reposition themselves in one day, with normal head movement from right to left (if you Google the anatomy of the horizontal canal, you will see why). Anterior canal is very unlikely (2-3%) + if you get dizzy when looking down/up, it is posterior. However, maybe watch different videos so you are sure you perform the Epley's in the right way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the other posters mentioned, it is normal to feel a bit off - you need to retrain your brain, i.e. habituation. Brand-Daroff exercises do work and are great - but be advised that some articles found that they increase the risk of cupulolithiasis. Alternatively, some doctors prescribe 3x3x3 Epleyes (3 Epleys, 3 times a day, for 3 days). If you struggle with your balance, you could also try vestibular rehabilitation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a person who was in a dark place for some time, it will get better - do not jump to conclusions that is Meniere's or anything like that. Best of luck!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLE: do try to see an ENT if possible - getting appropriate help as soon as possible shortens the recovery period for BPPV I had my first bout of bppv - starting exercises today. I want to be able to go back to work but I am afraid of spells happening while at work. I obviously cannot take a month off, do you work even though you are still a fall risk? You should not be a fall risk unless it happens when you are sitting or standing. Mine only happened when I rose from a supine position or turned my head while supine so I was never in danger of falling. I drove 600 miles four days after my episode! I felt kind of dizzy and lightheaded on &amp; off afterward for a while but not as though I was going to fall or pass out. It was more akin to being ill, or having a hangover. Being scared about the way I felt was worse than the feeling itself, I will tell you that. Seeing an ENT soon, it seems that I may have Mal Disembarkment syndrome, primarily triggered by tilting my head downwards, but I will find out for sure. I have not experienced any vertigo symptoms for a few weeks now, it is just turned into false sensation of movement. Get's worse with things like coffee, walking with my eyes closed, or looking at bright phone screens.", "Flying with BPPV? Hi everyone!\n\nI am in the thick of my first BPPV episode that seems to have been brought on by a long viral infection. I am currently discovering how bafflingly difficult it seems to be to get a referral to see an ENT/specialist given how debilitating this condition is\u2026 but I digress!\n\nI was wondering if anyone has any experience with BPPV and flying? I am supposed to take a short flight (~1.5hrs) in the coming weeks. My doctor said that this would be fine, but given that I saw her google BPPV on her phone, I am concerned that this might not be the case and that the pressure changes might make things worse. I would really appreciate any insights! I have never flown during a full-blown episode but I did fly during a minor episode (constantly having the \u201con a boat\u201d unsteady feeling, but no full-on spins) and it did not make it any worse. I did take meclizine before the flight though (my ENT told me it would thin the liquid in the inner ear and keep the spins from getting too bad. He also said a super strong allergy med may do virtually the same thing if you do not have a meclizine script)\n\nGood luck! I had my first episode and flew a few weeks later. What a mistake. We circled before landing and that is when it started. Within about an hour I was vomiting nonstop. Cleared after 24 hours and drugs but then I had to come home. Took almost 5 days to feel \u201cnormal\u201d Did you end up flying yet? I had an episode on Wednesday and I am supposed to take a short flight a week from tomorrow...super nervous about it. Hey! I just saw your comment. How was your flight? I am flying soon and Im super nervous I was totally fine! No problems at all.", "Would It Be A Good Idea To Just Ask My Doctor For A Referral To A Vestibular Therapist? I have been dealing with feelings of off balance, dizziness, and very brief vertigo spells since July 2020. I suspect it may have more to do with my neck posture, muscle tension, or even a pinched nerve more than inner ear. But it may also be BPPV because sometimes when I do lie down whether it be on my left or right side (more right than left it seems) I do get brief vertigo but without the nausea or rapid eye movement and it subsides rather quickly. I know there are ways to see if it is really BPPV or not but I do not really trust myself to do them correctly. \nIf anything it seems like my neck is the main culprit behind what I am feeling. Whenever I turn my head side to side or up and down I get dizzy and feel unsteady. \nSince my main issues are dizziness, unsteadiness, and brief vertigo and going by what I have read here it seems like the best idea is to seek out a vestibular therapist or a physical therapist that specializes in dizziness and balance issues. \nEven though I understand why a doctor will want to run tests to rule out anything serious I am pretty sure it is either BPPV, cervical vertigo, or a pinched nerve in my neck rather than any deficiency or psychosomatic. \nAlso considering it will almost be a year suffering with this and how it has pretty much derailed my life I do not have the patience to deal with additional obstacles if it is going to wind up concluding with what I already know. \nThere is also the issue with insurance, I do not want to risk racking up medical debt due to many tests and doctor visits. I would rather just go to a place or specialist that can help me nip it in the bud from the get go.\n\nI apologize for the long text and I appreciate you taking time to read it all and giving me advice. Thank you I had BPPV for 2 weeks and each doctor I saw during that time would only push pills on me. I would highly recommend going to a physical therapist, they cleared up my vertigo in one visit and I am working with them now on my residual dizziness. I hope you feel better. For sure see a vestibular therapist or PT that specializes in dizziness. They will help you a TON!", "Confused about the epley head angle Some videos show people turning their head 45 degrees the whole times, and others have people basically looking over their shoulder the whole time, even making a point to mention making sure you look over your shoulder.\n\nWhich one is better?", "Guys I am desperate for advice Hey guys. I am 32 and have always been healthy. A little over a month ago, I woke up in the morning and went to the kitchen, upon which I got intense virtigo and fell in to the floor. I was not able to stand up, and was dizzy for about a half hour after it ended. I thought I just had not eaten enough and so went on with life and forgot about it.\n\nLast week I woke up at 1 am to the most intense virtigo i can describe. i puked my guts out to the point of dry heaving. i could not even sit up on my couch. i went to the er. where they pumped me full of anti emedics but could not do much else.\n\nAfter a bit of reserach, I stumbled upon bppv. It turned out that I knew someone with this, so they called me and told me about the maneuvers (Epley, and the newer one where you sit on your knees).  I tried these about 9 times but it only made it worse. I ended up back in tthe er.\n\nI am 5 days in to this now, and i still can not move my head. I am still sleeping sitting up. They have put me on antibiotics because they said maybe it is an ear infection, as my ears had been in pain for the past one month if i listened to music (like a dull stabbing pain in my ears). i just took my 5th antibiotics (i take every 12 hours). i noticed this morning, i do not get virtigo if i look up, but i still get it if i look to the side.\n\nI am going to be honest, i am a wreck. this has completely immobilized me. for 5 days straight i am sitting in bed unable to even do basic tasks in my home. i cannot bare the thought of going through this regularly i feel like my life will not be worth living if you really want the truth of it, it is that miserable.\n\ni read there is a surgery if the maneuvers dont work but, the maneuver is so godamn awful i do not want to live like that. can you just get a surgery? i do not want to go through this every month Hold on please. It does subside. I was in your shoes not so long ago sitting at night crying and wondering if this is what my life will be like from now on, in and out of the ER not knowing what to expect. It took a couple of weeks but it went away for the most part. I still cannot lay on my right side or I will start to feel slight dizziness and I do not want to take any chances. Sometimes I think I have ptsd from that initial night when I woke up spinning so bad I could not walk. I am also waiting to see an ent for a possible sinus issue but they are pretty sure it is bppv. Your best bet if your cleared of the ear issue, is what my next step would be and that is to see a balance specialist. Hang in there. To both of you, I do not suggest visiting a regular ENT. I would go to a balance center, most major metropolitan areas have one. You need to see someone who is dealing  with vestibular problems everyday. The first ENT I visited was professional enough to refer me to a colleague who had spent a year working in a vestibular clinic. She diagnosed the correct canal where my  crystal was located and prescribed the correct maneuver. Mine went away almost immediately. If you do this on your own, or with someone who is not so experienced it is possible to make things worse. thanks guys, i am planning to go to one. the reason i want to see an ent is because honestly i want to explore the possibility of surgery. i dont intend to live like this thanks for your kind message to me. the reason why i am very confused and why it does not entirely bring me peace to read your experience, is because i keep reading about people who, yeah it goes away like you mentioned but it just keeps coming back. i read the google reviews for the balance center and it is like people having this constantly.\n\ni called the balance center yesterday, they said, if you start getting it frequently dont worry we will teach you the exercises to handle it on your own. guys i dont even want to go through the exercises. this sounds fucking miserable to me this thing is terrifying me and i think i have it severely. before the crazy vertigo hit, i had to falling spells. i fell in to the wall and then floor from a quick vertigo spell. then a couple weeks later i was just walking and i didnt even get vertigo i just fell in to the table and could not break the fall and fall in to the floor breaking the stuff on the table. i didnt even feel dizzy from that one. then this thing with the vertigo and physical effects. Yeah i had a similar situation. 31m - Sudden vertigo out of nowhere and then a lack of balance when i moved my head. I used a neck brace for months just so I could keep my head still. Eventually your brain adjusts and it gets better.\n\nI would recommend going to an ENT who specializes in balance issues. They will probably have a diagnosis or some medication. I had to take Valium for a month or so where I just slept for 18 hrs a day. But I also had other complications.\n\nJust stay still, take care of your health, control the symptoms, and go to a good ENT. It will get better if you avoid triggering it with your head movements. Most likely lose crystals (canalynth) in ear canals giving your brain weird signals and your brain freaks out and thinks you have consumed poison so it pukes or shits out everything in your stomach. This is the natural response.  \n\nTake it easy, let this be the priority in your life, do not worry about other things. Talk to an ENT and you will be fine.\n\nSurgery adds other risks with limited chance of improvement. If they do not even know what the issue is no point in just operating. From what I understand the ear canal mechanism is extremely delicate and tiny so there is not a good way to diagnose it except by freaking out your brain and seeing how your eyes move (nystagmus). There is also epley chair that they use to diagnose and fix the issue.\n\nBeen dealing with balance issues for 2.5 years in case you are wondering how i know so much. thanks for your response. what you describe is exactly what is happening with the puking. i guess i am having a hard time thinking about going through this repeatedly. for example, if this turns out to be bppv and i keep getting a re-occurance once a month, even if i can go in to the physical therapist and get this awful maneuver done, seriously, with the severity i am experiencing, i simply will opt for surgery or nothing else. to me i cannot live like that. thanks for your response. i do not even know how i will be able to see an ent for months. i never knew how fucked our healthcare system was in usa until this experience. i feel horrible for how fucked it is i also want to say, i am sorry if my messages are coming as harsh or dismissive. i am normally such a positive, cheerful person. this is just destroying my outlook right now You are absolutely fine, not harsh or dismissive at all.\n \nTo stop the puking etc there are simple pills that can help - Valium, meclazine, etc. A good ENT would give you those to bring the symptoms under control. You just have to buy time for your brain to adjust.\n\nI remember having no conception of normality and weird thoughts entering your head because you do not even know what to think.\n\nWhat i have found after visiting several ENTs, one neurologist, allergist, audiologist, couple of physical therapists, and tons of other kinds of doctors, is that there is quite a bit of variety in how doctors' treat their patients. You have to find what works for you. \n\nI have found that I wanted someone who would listen carefully to what I said and was patient. Luckily I found a few who were like that and then my recovery began. It is really hard when a basic system on your body has a problem. I feel for you, but the road ahead exists. \n\nMy condition has not yet being diagnosed so nobody has discussed surgery because they would not know what to fix in there and how. BPPV is often over-diagnosed where a lot of other issues get classified as BPPV at first. Things like Meniere's diseases, vestibular neuritis, etc.\n\nMine was also termed atypical BPPV at first but later changed because symptoms did not match the description. Yeah definitely way worse than it should be. But on the bright side there are lots of options and tests, medicines, etc that are available that are not there in many other places. So yeah there is that bright side.\n\nI think getting a GOOD ENT is crucial in our situations. For me it changed the whole course of my condition for sure and it gave me hope. So use whatever resources you can find a good older experienced ENT asap. thanks for all your kind responses. i do not want to sound dramatic but it is just a feeling of pure hopelessness here. i do not have insurance so i do not even think i can see a good ent. i do have the anti vomiting pills but i am just eating these all day. i am afraid this is going to bankrupt me on top of ruining my life and yeah i have no idea what to think. i keep randomly reaching out to friends, since i cannot even do basic things. most of them blow me off and it is clear do not want to get involved. fine. guess i just realize i do not have my friends either at the same time. it is like the whole godamn world is crashing in on me thanks man. fighting for an ent is the only thing on my mind right now. it feels like such an upward battle because i do not even have the energy to do basic things. and none of them seem to take the state insurance which is what i can afford. you are right and i am grateful stuff is here. Not sure if this helps but for some reason this whole thing has not cost me that much. Surgery would cost way more. The way my ENT was able to control symptoms was to just give your body enough time to adjust by making you go to sleep w/ Valium etc. So it is pretty cheap if your ENT gives you that. Going bankrupt is not the best thing to happen, but health is way more important. You can earn all the money back if you have your health, so I will not worry much about the costs. At least you are able to browse the internet so you can find additional resources and stuff to look for help in your local area. Call a medical helpline near you and see what they can do. thanks man. i have savings which i am holding tightly to in case i might get a surgery. honestly, i would just go to another country and get it done if i cannot get it here. i know it might sound dramatic to some, but this is so miserable and i would trade many things to be free of it.  i just do not want to go through my life controlling these symptoms. maybe i am just a giant pussy or something. or maybe it is striking me worse than a lot.  but i would gladly give my hearing away for this\n\ni am glad to know it has not cost you much and that is kind of promising. thanks for that perspective on the money. you are right health is what matters i literally just realized you are the one who has responded to almost everything i wrote in here. i want to say that, thank you for taking your own time to give me all those responses. i appreciate that you did that Happy to do it. That is what this community is here for. This has been my life for the past 2.5 years and absolutely the worst thing that has happened to be so far. I have learnt a lot through the experience.

(I am not a native English speaker)\nFirst some backstory: \nI have for years struggled with fatigue, headache  and feeling like I am on a boat. Last year I also experienced the typical carousel feeling and was diagnosed with BPPV for the first time. It went away with epleys maneuver and then it has returned a couple of times since then. I have not had an episode with the carousel feeling since July. But I do struggle with vertigo, it is so bad that I feel like I am falling backwards and that there are huge waves on a boat.\n\nI went to see a chiropractor that specializes in bbpv and dizziness. \nHe said that I have nystagmus when I am lying on my left side and when I am leaning forwards and that I most likely have an atypical bbpv, and that I am probably very dizzy because of my brain gives signal to my eyes that I am moving to the left (nystagmus) \nHe also said validated all of my symptoms and gives me exercises. For the first time I had hope \n\n\nToday I went to see an ENT doctor and he told me that I have to stop seeing the chiropractor because you should not do those sort of exercises unless you have an acute attack with carousel feeling, and that it also might make it more chronic and even worse because of over treating it.\nHe basically said that I was perfectly fine \n\nI have no idea who to trust or what to do.\nI think my country also may be a bit behind when it comes to knowledge of bppv Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary.

People who have this cab feel even worse in big stores, on the highway, and driving at night.  \n\nI am not sure if there is a BVD doctor in your area, but worth looking into.  I found my info at isitmyeyes.com Thank you so much for the reply. I had never heard about BVD before. Is a BVD doctor the same as an eye doctor? I am just recovering from 3 month bbpv and 4 month residual dizziness. Vor exercises help.  Might think of trying to see a vestibular specialist. Or a clinic that deals with dizziness.  Emts are terrible at helping with residual dizziness. Thank you so much for replying. I feel so alone.\nThe chiropractor\u2019s I was at is actually a clinic that specializes in dizziness, so I was so glad to have found them and they giving me exercises and validating my symptoms.\nAnd then the ENT scared me and said everything is fine/normal with me so I have to stop doing exercises:(\n\nGood luck with your recovery by the way Different doctors have different opinions on how often to do the maneuvers. I had a general practitioner tell me to do the Epley 3 times in a row, twice a day (I could not because it made me feel so sick) and when I told the dizzy/balance physical therapist she said they would never recommend doing it that often. I have not heard of it making things worse but I do think you need to give the crystals time to settle after doing a maneuver and giving it a few days. Then if you are still getting vertigo you could do it again. I would suggest getting an mri domes and having a spinal specialist look to make sure none of your nerves are being compressed in your kneck/cervical region Your ENT sounds like he does not work well with others. If the chiro was helping and things were improving, it seems worth pursuing. If you truly do not have BPPV per your ENT then there is no down side to doing exercises, you cannot create BPPV. I highly doubt your chiro can make things worse. My best guess is that your ENT could not find anything wrong with you, so now blames your chiro for your problems. However you were dizzy before you started seeing them.. so it is unlikely. Thank you so much for your input. This really calmed me down. \nYou are absolutely right Kind of!  Most optometrists do not know how to look for the subtlety of BVD or any misalignment under a certain amount.  There are specially trained optometrists called NeuroVisual Medicine Specialists who are experts in this work. Hi! Do you feel these dizzy sensations even when lying in bed or being completely still too? How do you feel when you are in passive motion, like in a car?", "Unsure if it is BPPV 22 F , first time I experienced it was about a year ago went to my PC and she told me it was most likely bppv. Gave me some exercises and it would go away on it is on. Came back in February, went to an ENT and she told me it most likely was not BPPV. Gave me a balance test and a hearing test. Said my perception in my right ear was off but basically told me to change my diet and get better sleep. I went back to my PC and she told me I have TMJ (temporomandibular joint) and that was causing the vertigo. I wear a night guard to sleep. Yesterday I got super lightheaded and basically had to lay down all day. My symptoms are not super intense but enough for me to want to lay down all day. The best way for me to describe it is it feels like I am on a boat. Looking for some clarity \"Being on a boat\" is more like the after effect of a BPPV episode or a mild version and not full on BPPV. Believe me, you would know if you had a full blown episode. \n\nBut that being said it is clear that things are not right and I do not like the advice you are getting. The issue with your ear and TMJ could be related to your lightheadedness.  What you can do at home is stay hydrated, get plenty of sleep, take Vitamin D (there may be a connection), eat right, and exercise (put avoid yoga or anything else that results in your head moving around a lot). Also, be slow and deliberate with your movements so you are not moving your head around a lot.\n\nAre you in a position to get a second option? Either a regular doctor or a physical therapist who may be able to run you thorough the Dix-Hallpike to get a positive diagnosis for BPPV.", "How to treat BPPV that is not one sided? My bppv symptoms are only when laying back or sitting up.  No nystagmus.  They resolve after 5-10 seconds.\n\nAlso oddly brought on when looking at a screen after just reclining.\n\nAny exercises for this?  I tried Brandt-daroff and bbq roll to not avail. How do you know it is BPPV? I would strongly recommend seeking a professional physical therapist that specialises in balance disorders. \n\nThey can test you properly and make the call if it is or is not. From there they will determine which ear, which canal and then start treatment. Everywhere I read (outside of this sub) says you should get instant relief after the first session... \n\nHowever for me when I woke up last week, it felt like no matter if rolled fo left or the right, the world was spinning. \n\nHad a treatment on the day of the event, the PT thought it was my left horizontal that was the problem. We did the BBQ roll and at each 90degree step I had pretty intense vertigo that would last 30 seconds then stop as we moved to the next 90 degree motion. \n\nSince last week (have another treatment tomorrow) I can slowly lay back and have a brief spin, roll to my right have a brief spin, but rolling to my left brings on a prolonged (10-15 second) spin but no where near as severe as when I woke up a week ago. \n\nI guess what I am saying is that, home remedies, home exercises, etc without having a professional diagnose it is BPPV, which ear, which canal will probably cause more panic and anxiety as you try to figure it out your self. \n\nHope you find somewhere to go, good luck.

I am looking for some advice on where I should go from here? Here is a list of my symptoms day by day:\n\nDay 1: Went to work as usual, feeling a bit brain foggy and a bit nauseous. Started to get dizzy around that evening, went to bed early. \n\nDay 2: Woke up extremely nauseous, very dizzy. Continuous dizzy sensation upright and laying down. Vomited several times, was able to sleep through the day though. Thought it could be a stomach bug? Slight ear pain.\n\nDay 3: Doctors appointment. Was diagnosed with BPPV and put on Ondansetron for nausea (this stuff is great) and Meclizine for dizziness. Last time I was nauseous \n\nDay 4: Continuing to take meds, nausea is nearly nonexistent but dizziness is still pretty bad. Unbalanced when walking, double vision when I wake up. \n\nDay 5: Dizziness could be getting better? I might be getting used to it.\n\nI have had a history of ear infections as a child, so this is not entirely surprising. However I have never felt this before and it is been hard so out of the blue. Was doing lots of house work before this so it could have been a possible trigger. \n\nAny advice? Been looking into the Epley Maneuver, anything else possibly could help? \n\nThanks!! Get in with a physical therapist to perform the Epley maneuver. If you cannot get in to see one right away, there are great YouTube videos to check out. The Epley and PT is what helped me the most. There are basically two channels that loose crystals could be moving around in.  The more common BPPV is a really fast spinning sensation that comes from moving your heat at certain angles.  Once it finishes spinning, you should generally feel okay until you happen to move your head again in a way that makes those crystals move, such as rolling over while lying down.  The ( is basically a miracle cure.  Do it once or twice, stay well hydrated, sleep upright that night, and the vertigo should be gone.  I have had that twice, a couple years apart.\n\nIf you are feeling continuously off and nauseous, and every step feels uncomfortable, it could be the less common horizontal of BPPV, which I have had once (more recently).  The ( solved it for me. Unfortunately the maneuver also triggered more nausea, and I felt awful for the entire rest of the day.\n\nOne thing I noticed with both kinds of vertigo is that my brain seems to stop trusting the data it receives from the inner ear for a while, so you may feel a little off balance even when there is nothing wrong anymore.  This will gradually get better over about a week.\n\nI also think there is a correlation between being dehydrated when going to bed and waking up with vertigo, so staying hydrated before bedtime may help prevent reoccurrence.", "Headphone usage I have been using noise cancelling headphones for a more than a year now and I got BPPV two days ago (Im 19). I do not think the headphones caused it but should I avoid headphones whilst I heal? The cuff on the headphones might make you a but uneasy, you can use earphones though. If the vibrations in your ears set you off then I would not use them until you have recovered. \n\nSee a specalist to speed up the recovery and read historic posts. 2 days in and I am actually feeling a lot better. Headphones do not set it off but I would like to avoid any unnecessary damage. BPPV is a mechanical issue that cannot be made worse or better. You may never have it again, it may end up happening every 6 years or maybe weekly (let us hope not)... no one knows when it will strike but one thing everyone agrees on is that once you have BPPV you are more susceptible to having it again.\n\nThere is nothing you should avoid... just live life and accept / understand what is happening when it does strike again to minimise the anxiety of it all. Can I ask you a question I am a 26 year old that suffer with intellectual delay so I do not understand stuff well and use text to speech. But I got told I had bppv and it is been 8 days and I still feel a bit off. But not like when I got it from the start.

Is this still part of the bppv and normal as this happen in my right ear. I am able to foucs now on my TV and walk a little easier but still unstable abit but the main strong feelings are gone Sure. Happy to help. \n\nBPPV is the diagnosis that people arrive to when they move their head and it causes two symptoms:\n - nystagmus (rapid eye movement / beating); and\n - vertigo (the room spins, rolls, etc uncontrollably)\n\nThese symptoms (both need to be present) only happen when you move your head and if you do not move your head as the symptoms start it will subside after 30 seconds. - most people panic and do not keep their head in the aggravated position as it can be somewhat terrifying (it certainly has been for me) but should pull you out of the vertigo. \n\nYou can also get secondary symptoms such as:\n - lightheadedness which people describe as dizziness\n - tension headaches\n - nausea\n - anxiety (this one is pretty common)\n\nBPPV is caused by signals being sent from your ear that are muddled up caused by these pesky crystals that your vestibular system needs to determine if your looking down, up, rolling over, etc. these crystals can somehow get dislodged or move into areas they should not in the ear canal which causes these horrible symptoms when you move your head. \n\nThis is a mechanical issue that cannot be resolved by surgery but thankfully there are 2 ways to resolve BPPV.\n 1) ride it out - I would not recommend this approach as there is no set timeline for resolution. Sometimes people resolve in 24 hours, others take months or even longer where I have heard of people \u201cjust living with it\u201d\n2) see a physical therapist who specialises in balance disorders where they will diagnose you formally and do exercises with you to reposition the crystals or move them away from where they are causing problems. - lots of reports where people are fixed right on the spot OR those that needed multiple sessions but eventually were fixed. \n\nThe shortest time I have had BPPV is half a day to 24 hours. The longest I have had it for was 3 weeks. \n\nIf you have not seen a physical therapist I would highly recommend doing so. If you want to learn more, lots of good information already posted here but start with googling \u201cEpley maneuver\u201d\n\nHope this helps Thank you so much.

Slash5k1 covered a lot of it already, but there might be some other information there that you will find useful! BPPV is a mechanical issue, but there are a lot of things that can set it off and avoiding those things might help. I have stopped using headphones and I noticed a huge difference. Loud noises, loud music, anxiety can all set it off. It is only a pathway that can be triggered by external factors.

Being active and specifically running was the only time I felt good.\n\nAfter my BPPV was cleared, I still continued to run, but was then (and still am) dealing with residual dizziness, which is a whole different monster.  Part of my therapy was doing vestibular exercises that were turning my head left to right (15 times, 3 sets).  Then I would do it walking, then running. Then I would turn my head up down and do the same stuff (first while being still, then while walking, then while running). This all was to retrain the brain to not be dizzy after I was rebalanced.\n\nActivity is the best thing to get you back on track. So, go out and give it a whirl. Start slowly and see how it feels. It took me a bit to be able to get back into running, but once I did I think it helped the most to get rid of any residual dizziness I had left.\n\nThat was last year and I am still running and doing fine with no residual symptoms Iwent running this week and screwed up my progress... the shaking on my vision is back :(", "Stephen Colbert is diagnosed with BPPV Open SmartNews and read \"Stephen Colbert Reveals He is Dealing With a Condition Called Benign Positional Vertigo\" here:  \nTo read it on the web, tap here:  He is from the same part of Charleston my family\u2019s from - sorry to see we also have this in common as well! its not fun, ive had it, but its not supposed to be a serious ailment. hope he gets over it soon. Oy. The residual effects can be terrible, especially any of the residual dizziness. Welcome to the club... the more that people know about BPPV the better! Maybe one day there will be a treatment to help reoccurrence and the residual dizziness. interesting - I went to the same high school he did (did not know him though). I have BPPV too.", "Weird residual dizziness after Epley? After I did the Epley twice (once with a PT, once on my own) it seems like there is no more spinning going on. For the most part I can lie down and get up without vertigo anymore. However I had residual dizziness which has gotten better as the days pass. \n\nThe weird thing is lying down on my right (the affected ear) makes my head feel extremely heavy with a lot of pressure (along with dizziness) while lying on my left, I would occasionally  get a floating feeling that passes after maybe half a minute. Turning from my left to my back also has a slight dizzy sensation for maybe 15 seconds. \n\nWhat is going on? Based off of personal research, I think that is normal. I have read that a residual dizzy or lightheaded feeling can persist for a couple weeks. I think the brain and ears are just trying to get back into sync. Lol here is a study that talks about it. Hope this helps:\n\n\n This happens with me too. The Epley maneuver will stop the severe vertigo so I can function, but I am just not \"right\" again until about a week later. In the meantime, I take everything slowly and carefully. It is been a few weeks for me so maybe it is just taking longer to go away. Did you also have a heavy pressure feeling in your head when lying down on one side? \n\nI have been lying down on my left because my right ear was the affected side but I am naturally a right side sleeper. I do not know what to do though because lying down on my right makes my head very heavy and I feel more of the dizziness compared to lying on my left when sleeping I am having a very hard time with the Epley the spinning gets so intense that I cannot finish the maneuver, does anyone have any advice Maybe try closing your eyes when the spinning stops and I do not think it is necessary to go down that quickly either. I had a PT help me with the Epley. You can try that if you have not already Thanks for the article. Do you think I should just continue doing normal activities as opposed to avoiding certain movements that trigger the dizziness? this vertigo just started yesterday, my wife is helping me, I was able to turn my head and lay back and turn my head to each side, but once I was supposed to lay on my left side with my head turned I got intense spinning, I tried to let it pass but after 20 sec of spinning I was about to throw up, and my wife said my eyes were jerking around side to side Yeah the jerking eyes is apparently normal for vertigo sufferers; it happens to me too. Try not eating a few hours prior to doing it. The meclizine might be helpful, good luck Yeah. I do not see why you cannot do normal activities. I would still avoid the movements that could cause those crystals to fall back out for a little bit but the residual dizziness should go away in a couple weeks or so. No heavy pressure feeling for me. Only dizziness/vertigo.", "Question: How do you know you did the exercise right? I am 22 and I am probably on my 20th mini episode of bppv over the last 4 years. I was not diagnosed by an ent but given the exercise instructions by a doctor, but that means I do not know really what exercise \u201ccures\u201d my specific situation and it is very trial and error.\n\nI have had some luck with the epley manoeuvre but sometimes it seems to do nothing at all. Somersault is better (in terms of when it works well I can feel better fast) but it is hard to tell if I am residually dizzy or it is only improved not fixed.\n\nSo yeah. Should it always trigger your vertigo at some specific point? Is there a way to \u201ctest\u201d if you have successfully done it and if your vertigo is residual?\n\nAlso can you overdo it? Like if I do an extra somersault maneuver because I am desperate to not be dizzy for work, am I undoing the good of the first one? Residual dizziness and the intense 20ish second vertigo with eye twitching (nystagmus) is different.  My info comes from working with a vestibular (dizzy) specialist for over 2 months and doing over 20 Epley and likely just as many Half Somersault. The 'test' to check for BPPV is called the Dix Hallpike.  And that is also the first step to the Epley.  When you initially lay back with your head turned to the effected side, you get that brief intense wave of vertigo with your eyes twitching.  With my therapist, we would always do the Epley (Dix Hallpike) once. Then wait a few minutes for me to recover. Then she would lay me back again. If the intense vertigo was there - we would continue with the entire Epley. After that - she would have me wait a week before coming back and trying it again.  During the Epley, I only got that intense vertigo while laying back, and then again while sitting up.  When I did the half somersault at home, I never got the intense vertigo (therefore, it was easier for me to do and did not bring on anxiety).\n\nMy vertigo was stubborn.  I have no idea exactly WHEN it cleared. There was no defining moment. I know towards the end of month 2 - my therapist had me doing the Epley at home myself mid week.  I also still did the half somersault randomly.  Then during that one appointment, she laid me back - and no vertigo.  I still felt like crap.  I made her test me again. Still in the clear! That is when I learned about the residual dizziness.  It was there a LOT.  And it was gross.  I checked back in with her a week later and told her I was positive I still have BPPV, as I felt horrible. She actually retested all 6 ear canals with the goggles on to video my eyes. Still - every ear canal was clear.  It was just that darned residual stuff (that actually lingered for 8 months).\n\nI was much like you - and desperate to clear up my BPPV. I would wake in the middle of the night and do the half somersault, because I was dizzy trying to sleep.  Honestly, I wish I knew which maneuver and which time cleared mine. I was also snowmobiling (fast and hard) with my head bouncing all over.  Perhaps that did it?\n\nI also know that many people suggest after a maneuver - to stay upright for at least 24 hours to let the crystal 'settle' if it was indeed moved back to the proper area. My therapist had just come back from a conference and said the latest studies showed that is no longer relevant. You can go about your normal routine immediately and not worry about keeping your head upright.\n\nLong story short - it is the Dix Hallpike that will show if you still have active BPPV. If one of the less common ear canals is the one effected, there are different tests to show that as well (your eyes will twitch different ways). I saw a physical therapist 3-4 times and he cured me. Have you considered seeing a pt? Definitely going to be looking into it after I get some money together. Ok cool. So I am mostly struggling with residual dizziness. Thank you so much for all the info! Yeah for me it saved me. I was terribly ridden with dizziness and could not even drive. Save up some money and go to a PT. if you have insurance its cheap. only cost me 18 bucks a session.", "My BPPV/PPPD experience I want to put all of my experiences in this one post and then to be honest, I will probably never look at this subreddit ever again lol. The anxiety, hopelessness, fear-inducing, overall negative energy on here set me back in my recovery probably for months. \n\nI (20f) would get vertigo when I tilted my head downwards to eat sometimes, other times if I was laying on my bed looking at my phone, and then once I woke up to the spinning sensation and it was bad enough to make me throw up. I felt crappy until I went to a vestibular therapist and she treated my left ear, I left and felt good for about a week. Then I felt dizzy again, not vertigo, but enough for me to do the epley on myself and figure it out. This time it was in my right ear. I decided I did not want to go back to the PT and just manage it on my own. That was a mistake! That month of trying to \"live with the dizziness\" I experienced every symptom in the book, even the ones that people on here will say are \"definitely not BPPV\". I had regular high pitched tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus in my left ear, a few ear aches, headaches, dizzy sitting still, sleeping was a nightmare, and on top of that I run for my college's cross country team, so I was running 5-10 miles a day for this. Also the anxiety that came with all of it, the google searches to figure out what is wrong with me, it just makes everything worse. I went back to the ENT to make sure it was not anything else, he said no but forced me to go back to vestibular therapy. She treated my right ear, and since then I have not had any more vertigo, tinnitus, etc. (this is a good time to add that if the epley eases symptoms then it is BPPV, but if it does nothing then cross it off the list) There was still residual dizziness, and my balance was horrible, so she gave me exercises for that. \n\nAt this point, I am comparing it to the last time I had BPPV in my left ear, and how I felt better immediately and had no problems afterwards. So since the recovery was different this time, it created an anxiety problem for me that it would never get better, and I was permanently going to feel dizzy even though there were not any more loose crystals in my ears. So I go on another google search (are you noticing a pattern emerging here? lol) and my anxiety skyrockets when I come across PPPD. My opinion is if you are scared about having PPPD, you probably already have it because it is literally a manifestation of your anxiety, in the form of something that is previously caused you distress. \n\nSo here is where my advice comes in, for BPPV: go to a doctor, and get referred to a vestibular physical therapist. Even if the doctor gives you some pamphlet to do the maneuvers on your own, insist on the therapist. After you are treated keep your head upright for 48 hours, even when you go to sleep keep your head propped up like you are balancing a book. \n\nfor PPPD: LOG OFF OF REDDIT, first of all. Take it from me the \"chronic dizziness\" posts are an anxiety attack waiting to happen, and they will convince you that you are going to feel dizzy for the rest of your life if you let them! You WILL NOT! Trust that. Let us say you are like me and have no more signs of vertigo but still feel dizzy. That means you are improving! Period. Keep doing exercises with your physical therapist, and let them help you. Then when you get home, what helped me was making an effort to go in the positions that I would previously avoid. I would never lay flat and stare at the ceiling, so I started doing it to prove to myself I was fine. I would never do stretches where I stared at the ground, so I started doing that too. I would spent so long avoiding certain tasks to prevent vertigo that my body would go into a panic mode when I started doing them again. The more I did it, the less my body reacted. Closing your eyes and breathing, let your body feel all of the false senses of movement. Sometimes it would feel like I was on a rocking boat that was so violent I would get nauseous, but slowly I built my tolerance until I did not feel it anymore. The more you work with your physical therapist and stay present during the exercises, the more you will improve. It is true that sometimes it takes months to a year, but that is ok. Yes, PPPD is real dizziness and you are not crazy, but it is fed by your anxiety. Stop giving it fuel, and remind yourself you are improving everyday. \n\nAs previously stated, I am not coming back on this subreddit again so I will not see any replies lol. It is for mental health purposes! Thank you so much for this. This is the last post I am reading about this, going to the doctor next week.", "BPPV and Acupuncture? I had my first bppv attack. It was horrible, frightening. I have been to the ER, had catscans and are seeing a very good trained therapist.

I am set for two more PT sessions in the coming weeks nd hoping for the best.\n\nI also have late onset Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) another balance related neurological disease. I had acupuncture sessions for the CMT will some success for the pain. Together, the bppve and CMT put me is a precarious place.\n\nHas anyone had any experience with acupuncture?

For the past almost six months I have been experiencing severe dizziness, lightheadedness upon standing up and even moving positions when sitting/lying down, and severe vertigo but not the typical room spinning vertigo but a boat/swaying/floating feeling, and also a feeling that I am constantly being pulled back and forth. This happens typically when I am still, lying flat on my back or sitting on a chair, also when I am stopped at red lights when driving. I have a VNG test coming up and heard that it triggers vertigo during some portions of the test, my only worry is that since I am feeling vertigo 24/7 will it make my vertigo worse, what should I expect from this? I have never had the typical room spinning sensation that many have experienced and am very nervous to get this feeling during the test. Thanks guys! I answered this on another Reddit but did you have your VNG yet? If so, how did it go? Hello there! My VNG test is this thursday, I will message you on the results/updates of everything! crossing my fingers for you! I look forward to hearing how it goes.", "Anyone here with PPPD?

And I have been very dizzy at work... but I kept going to work every day (dizzy for 10 months now). Dizziness just kept getting worse, too. So if going to work would make me less dizzy at work... well that has not exactly worked. Were you diagnosed by a vertigo specialist? Maybe there s smth more to it All my vertigo tests came back negative. And there is no spinning sensation (vertigo) just swaying/tilting - like being on a boat. Or walking on something soft, like loose sand. \n  \nThat is how they come to the conclusion that it is neurological, by ruling out all the inner ear type stuff. My BPPV was also like being on a boat - that is why it took so long to diagnose. But they did manage to catch my nystagmus on a videonystamography. That is why I wanted to emphasise just how important it is to go to a specialist and get a proper diagnosis. \n\nHaving said that, it does take time anyway - I am on month 3 of doing vestibular rehabilitation. So just stick with it. Having said that, another way to treat PPPD is to also take some sort of dopamine based medicine to try to rewire your brain - you could look into that and ask your doctor. But I deffo remember reading that by far the most efficient treatment course is vestibular rehabilitation. Yeah, I did the VNG test, too - everything came back normal, though I was *super* sensitive to it, and felt sick for hours afterward. \n  \nI just started an SSRI today actually, for the PPPD. So hopefully this, combined with rehab exercises and habituation will help! Then you re in good hands and time + hard work will surely do the trick!

I had to go to a physical therapist. It took sometime for my therapist to get my crystals reset and a lot of patience on my part. I even felt worse before I got better.   I think\nI saw where u had tried the Epley  maneuver on yourself which is good BUT u can over do it as well. The Semont maneuver did better for me. You tube it But when u r done make sure to keep ur head level. No looking up or down and sleep inclined for 24 hrs. I still have tinnitus always have had it. Can not sleep with out a fan or some sort of background noise to fall asleep because it is so loud. Hope this helps. It is awful and you feel like you r losing your mind but u will get better.

Sounds more like Menier's Disease than BPPV to me:\n\n( you are not rambling and i appreciate your response but i cannot do any of this on my own. i am getting worse. i cannot live like this. i dont even have insurance. i have never felt so hopeless in my life. if there is a surgery that corrects it i simply do not understand why a person should have to suffer with this, that is the part that confuses me. i understand they have these maneuvers but they are terrible to go through. i do not care about losing my hearing. i cant even wear my damn glasses any longer because it just makes the motion sickness worse, i have horrendous vision so i can barely see without them i thought too but i was reading today and 15% of bppv folks report an onset of tinitis Hey! Sorry to hear that you are going through all of that. I am in the same boat as you unfortunately. I woke up with intense vertigo one morning 3 weeks ago. At first I thought it was from stress and anxiety ( I have been under a lot of it recently.) but it continued to happen when I lay back or on my sides. I attempted the Epley Maneuvers on my own but they made it worse. So I went to a ENT and he told me I had BPPV and sent me paper instructions on the Epley Maneuver. Tried it and it still did not work. Through out this whole thing, I have the worse headache and head pressure and no sleep. So, I pretty much suffered through it another week and went to a GP and they gave me steroids. I was not able to take those long enough to see if it worked because it caused insomnia. Which made the symptoms worse. I even went to a Chiropractor, but nothing seemed to work. It is been the most depressing month I have ever had in my whole life. Pretty sure I have PTSD now bc I am too scared to lay on my side to see if the crystals have settled. Fml. However, I had a bad episode of vertigo yesterday that gave me lingering dizziness and unsteadiness. All day. I could not take it anymore so I called a local Physical Therapy center and begged for them to see me ASAP. They were able to see me and I saw an amazing physical therapist who walked me through everything and did some different maneuvers. I walked out of the office feeling so much better. I had to sleep sitting up last night but I do not have the lingering dizziness. Just some head pressure/headache. I am actually functional today. Sorry for the long text, but I see that you are struggling and just know I was there too. I also do not have insurance but I just self payed. I hope this helps, and let me know if you have any questions. Just hold on. This will go away.  May take some time but it will go away. I am still not 100 percent but I go back to PT tomorrow and everyday I improve. Feeling low and having anxiety will only worsen your symptoms. I was even having panic attacks when this first started and man did I feel like total crap after those.\nBest of luck and wishes of good health. :) i sincerely appreciate all your words. i do intend to see a physical therapist but i am terrified of the possibility of this just re-occuring frequently, especially as i had so many episodes in a short time. did the PT discuss that sort of thing with you? If this is a re-occuring issue, I would just prefer a surgery with the risks and complications. this has sunk me in to a depression and i do not even want to try any longer I understand completely. I also felt that way but once I continued to have it and it keep me debilitated for weeks something just clicked in my head and made me push through the maneuvers. I am scared that it will come back too but my PT told me chances are rare, and if it does...you will know what to do immediately. I think a lot of my suffering was not knowing what was wrong with me and how to fix it. However, I would not dread on the \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d. All we have control over at the moment is right now. Going to the PT and having them do the maneuvers is going to suck, but you have to push through it and I promise you will feel like new. :) once you experience it and get it treated correctly, the fear of possibly having to go through it again kind of fades. Hey, you are stronger than this. I know it is just words on the computer but what helped me was sitting in the shower and relaxing. I know how you feel, vertigo really really sucks. But hey, it is not forever. I promise. This kind of thing happens, but we figure it out. You can always message me if you need any tips. I found that using a ice back on the base of my neck helped my neck muscles relax so the constant unsteady feeling calm down. Also helped the headache. :) Oh! I also forgot to mention that I also had tinnitus on and off. However, the constant stress and tension of having to sit and lay a certain way caused me bad neck/shoulder tension. This cause me to get mild Migraines. Once I started using heat and ice, I noticed the tinnitus would go away. Hope this helps too. i really want to thank you for this message. you are right, i think half the problem is the uncertainty. to be honest, i am usually such a level headed, unemotional, and logical person. i think now i have been getting panic attacks over this each morning as the medication begins to lose its effectiveness. it has been clouding my judgement. \n\ni spoke with a friend of mine today and he similarly shared perspectives with me, and it gave me a new way of seeing things.\n\nthe thing for me is that it is not the vertigo that really bothers me. it is simply my body's reaction to it. what happened last week my god i never want to experience that again\n\nanyway i dont know how to say it but just thanks for sharing your perspective. i think you understand my fears well and i appreciate your sharing what made you fear less. so do you literally have a constant unsteady dizzy feeling all the time, even when you are not in a time where you are getting vertigo? that sounds awful wow. i didnt see this one until now. how interesting about the heat and ice. im also making my neck stiff because i am just keeping it so straight. i am trying this out tomorrow as soon as i can get my hands on that.\n\ni completely hear you about the sleep deprivation. i think actually. its the one place i am lucky. i really do not move in my sleep. the first few nights it felt like my body was screaming at me to lay down flat and sleep but now somehow my body has adjusted to sitting up and i just pass out and sleep 7 hours. i feel really lucky for that part. the first night i got a full nights sleep after this, i felt so much better the next day (not the vertigo but i guess just my body in general felt better.)\n\nthanks again man. for yours and everyones responses in both my threads I did. It was a constant feeling. I am not sure if it was the migraines or sleep deprivation doing that to me. But the vertigo only happened when I laid down/rolled on either of my sides/or turn my head too fast or weird way. ok hey i think i misunderstood you. are you saying that, during the time this was going on (few weeks , etc.) you had the constant dizziness. but, you do not have it now right? i am in the same boat right now where it is constant but vertigo only happens with the head movements. but the dizziness goes away at some point right? Yes. The constant dizzy/unsteadiness would happen usually if I had a vertigo attack. It would linger a few hours to a couple days then settle down...until I moved my head in a way that triggered the vertigo lol \n\nHowever on Monday the vertigo happened and after the vertigo settled I had the constant unsteady feeling again so I went to a PT and they did the maneuvers on me causing the vertigo but once it all stopped the constant dizzy feeling went away completely immediately. It has not come back since. I have a very slight unsteady feeling but it is normal as your vestibular system gets back into sync without a darn crystal messing everything up. This may take a couple weeks to get back to being 100% normal. But I go back to PT this afternoon to check if everything is settled down and crystals back to where they should be. :) that is great to hear. both for your sake and my own anxiety lol\n\nbut seriously i am very happy to hear you are feeling better my wish is that this never visits you again! Lol thank you and me too. \nI know you will be feeling better soon. Just get yourself to a PT as soon as you can. \nYou got this! You may feel a little off and not great after your visit, but once you go to bed and have a good sleep you will wake up and be like \u201cwhoa! I am feeling so much better, hell yea!\u201d Let me know how it goes. Sending love and good vibes your way! You are a great example of what happens to people when they do not see the right person. BPPV is horrible, and easily treated. But only by someone who knows what they are doing. I am sorry you had drag this out before seeing someone who knows what they are doing.\n\nThe first ENT I went to openly said \"I am not the right guy to treat you. Go see my colleague who has experience in this\". I am thankful that he did this instead of trying to do it himself. I went to her the next day. She did the eply maneuver with me in her office and sent me home with instructions on how to do it myself. By that evening, I could no longer trigger my vertigo. That was almost a year ago now and I am fine. \n\nBut there are so many people in this forum who go through what you go through. That is why I am telling everyone here, \"Go To A Balance Center\".  \n\nSorry about the PTSD, I can certainly understand it. The only thing I can tell you is that now you know exactly who to see if this happens again.  Knowing this helps me a great deal. Exactly. I went to an ENT first and they did not even try to do any test or maneuvers on me. Just sent me home with a printout on how to do the Epley. I did it and it got worse. Probably because I was doing it wrong. FINALLY went to a PT who specialized in vestibular rehabilitation and vertigo is gone. But I have balance issues now from leaving it untreated for almost a month. Now I know what to do if it ever happens again, just need to get through this recovery period. Thank you for the reply. I am glad you are still doing well after a year. :)", "my daughter just got diagnosed with BPPV she does not know im freaking out for her.

Should she be concerned about frequency or duration ? She did say it happens daily for a few seconds.\n\nAny insight or recommendation is really appreciated. Hi. I have had bppv on and off for 15 years. While it is really annoying, once I found out the cause I understood it is quite benign. So do not worry too much. \nThe key is learning the exercises.

Every couple of years, when my symptoms return, I go to Busch Gardens in Florida ( from Maine) and repeatedly go on the rollercoaster Montu, then symptom free for a couple of years. It is an inversion coaster with six or something flips, must be the sequence and directions that make it effective, I do not know. Maybe someone else from down there could try it and see if it helps and report back here to see if I am on to something.  Just be careful when you get off the ride because you will not be able to walk straight. Sounds like you are doing the epley manuever on a roller coaster :)  What I think may be happening is instead of gradually moving through your ear that the crystal\\ are being jerked at high speeds out of the wrongs place\\ :) Interesting This is fantastic.

And I feel when I wake up, I know straight away if I will have a dizzy day or not. The best way I can describe it is if you are a glasses wearer would be if you put your glasses on, take them a few cm from your face and move them side to side, that is the shaky feeling I have, and if I moved my head a certain way (figures 8), it triggers dizziness. \n\nI had to phone out of hours because I went to grab some shopping yesterday and walking through ASDA, and I felt if I moved my head id fall over. I got an appointment, and they did another laying and standing BP test with no issues, and then she said it sounded like BPPV or labyrinthitis, and I was prescribed prochlorperazine. I have taken three so far but with little effect, so looking to see if this does sound like BPPV to those wherewith it and if there is anything you suggest to get out of this dizzy phase as I work with athletes so a lot of movement and heavy weights etc. Sounds like maybe bppv.  You should find a physical therapist or vestibular specialist that knows how to diagnose and do the epley maneuver.  With bppv it can vary like you say.  There were days where I felt like I was leaning to the right when walking, like unbalanced.  Good news is that if they do determine its ear crystals and do the epley you should feel noticeably better in a few days.  Do not be surprised if there is some residual dizziness since you have had it awhile.  I would suggest keep doing pt or vestibular rehab for a few weeks to gain back your balance and heal quicker.  Good luck!  Do not worry you will not feel like this forever! Look up the Epley maneuver. If it is bppv doing the first position (try left and right) should trigger the spinning sensation. If it does, finding a specialist would be your best bet, either an ENT, physical therapist, or dizziness and balance center. If trying the Epley does not trigger anything it might not be bppv, or it could be a crystal in a different canal - when I had that I did not have much actual spinning, I just felt like I was moving when I was sitting still. So basically a specialist would be better at finding out if it is BPPV. The other thought I had was maybe you need a new glasses prescription? Yeah I looked it up as tried it but it did not seem to trigger anything. \n\nIt is a strange sensation to describe accurately. It is say its like putting on someone is glasses and the prescription is just off a slightly so when you move your head things seem a bit wobbly almost like your eyes take a few seconds to focus properly. Accompanied by a constant headache also I wonder if it could be your vision then, you mentioned wearing glasses, maybe you need to update the prescription?", "BPPV has stolen yet another opportunity from me. I am going to be honest, I am angry. I am devastated. I want to give up. \n\nI have dealt with BPPV for 3 years now. And over those three years BPPV has stolen time with my new born daughter, my dignity as a wife an mother, and many missed family moments. On top of that it stole my ability to work.. but also not recognized as a disability. \"Benign\".. not harmful. I would argue that BPPV can most definitely be harmful.  \n\nI had worked my butt off with VRT and finally got to a place where I had more good days than bad. Then eventually got to a point where I have been living a mostly normal life. Though I have been super careful about how I move and go about my days, here I am again. Being a mom trying to work and live a normal life I have been working towards my CDL license and school bus certification. And I have been doing great! I was ready to go for my state exam. Well, I smacked my head off of one of the cross view mirrors and I woke up this morning the day of my exam with the room spinning. \n\nDefinitely cannot drive. I am so nauseous. And I have to be home alone with my young daughter while dizzy and sick. I worked for MONTHS to prepare for this test. I was doing this so I could have more quality time with my daughter to make up for so much time lost to me being bed/couch ridden. And to make up time working a shitty retail job that keeps me away from her most nights. I have been pulling double duty training for bus during the day and having to take her to a babysitter then pick her up and drop her off with her dad for the night while I go to work until 11pm. It is been hard for her and me to be apart and today was the day to change all of that. But BPPV stole that from me. \n\nI do not know how to keep going right now. I feel like I am preforming a role in a movie just trying to get through it all. I am trying to be strong. I do not want my daughter to see me cry. I feel like a failure in life. I am trying so hard to better myself so I can provide for my family and be there for them too. But I this shit keeps pulling me back. I am sorry for this rant. I feel like a burden to my family because everyone is disappointed inme right now. I just really needed this off my chest and maybe someone with BPPV will understand what this feels like. My heart goes out to you. I get it. I truly get it. Stay strong and know that there are better days ahead! Thank you for your kind words. I am trying my best to keep it together. I am so sorry you are having a hard time. You have every right to feel this way. I am also sorry your family does not understand, but *you are not a burden* BPPV can happen to anyone and there is nothing *you did* that caused it. If your family cannot get on board and see that, that is *their* problem. \n\nYou are literally doing all you can do and it is amazing that you are trying to work and take care of your daughter without the support of your family while having BPPV and working hard to make it better. That is truly awesome.\n\nKeep going for your daughter. Keep taking care of you and taking care of her. Show her what it is like to be strong and to fight but also let her see that tears are okay and we do not always have to be strong.\n\nEverything went wrong *today* and but tomorrow is the gift of a new day and a fresh start.\n\nIf you need more emotional support or resources call ( and speak to a trained crisis worker. This is what they are there for to be your support. I see your tears. I feel your pain. I feel your frustration. It is really a different kind of discomfort that vertigo poses. \n\nI admire all the hard work you have done to try and provide something better for you and your daughter. Keep doing what you are doing, keep fighting, keep giving 110% of you, keep grabbing the bull by the horns and keep tossing him to the ground, keep winning, keep a tally of your victories, and disregard your few losses, and keep your head up. Love as hard as you can, through the pain, show love to yourself and to your daughter and any other loved ones you may have. \n\nGo outside in the night and gaze at the sky, and reach out, and scream, and laugh, and cry. But keep loving yourself, because if you do that, your daughter\u2019s future will be bright.\n\nDo not lose that beautiful blinding light in your eyes, and let them shine for the world to see. \n\nDo not lose faith. Believe in yourself. You are not alone. You will succeed, as you have been. I just wanted to take a moment and say thank you. I know it is been a hot second since I posted this but I have read your comments over and over the past week or two. It is really helped me get through some tough days. Today being one of the worst. My symptoms have been worse today and I preformed the Epley maneuver. Which always seems to make me worse before I am better. I am thanking my stars for Zofran today. I have been in a dark place with this very long lasting episode. But I have found a therapist. Also I am trying to do VRT and sleep sitting  up. Unfortunately my anxiety has gotten the best of me a few times with this one and I have been waking up with the room spinning feeling like I am going to chuck. I am really and truly grateful for the group. It helps so much to know I am not alone and there are others out there who know what fresh hell it is to live like this. I would cut off an ear tomorrow if it would fix it. Thank you again.", "Does vertigo effect vision? By vision I mean if it looks like the world is spinning or is the dizziness more like internally. I am curious about this because I am not sure if I have this, all I can say is that when I am laying down and staying still I do not feel dizzy but when I suddenly get up or change head position, I get dizzy before it weakens and becomes faint or disappears. My moms sister and including her all have vertigo from time to time, my mom said it is almost like it is hereditary, did I get it from her? Also one more thing, can vertigo cause insomnia for people? Because this gives me hard time sleeping this dizziness. Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Do the dix hallpike test and figure out if you have eye nystagmus + vertigo. You need to have both for this to be BPPV. Also have someone watch your eyes for the direction of the nystagmus Yes I have insomnia as well due to the vertigo! I also get dizzy when I turn my head or move. I am not the worst when I am sitting there doing nothing", "Is this BPPV? I (24, F) have not had very many spells in my lifetime so I have never looked into it, however I had my longest one yesterday night that held over to this morning.\n\nA few years ago I had one where I felt like I was being pulled to my left while walking during job training. Went away pretty quickly. That was in a casino, I was super buzzed on nicotine just walking through there.\n\nSometimes when I lay down to go to sleep I feel like I am spinning but it is so mild it does not bother me too much.\n\nWell last night I was sitting with my head tilted left on my hand and it *hit.* The dizziness itself did not last too long. However, I did feel pretty off and just went to bed early at 9PM. I got up around 8 this morning and after breakfast I did get a little spin and still felt off.\n\nIf it is an ear, I feel like it would be my left for sure. The maneuvers do not trigger anything as far as I know (if i am doing them correctly). I cannot see my doctor because of COVID so I thought I would ask here and see if anyone had any input or good at-home treatments. I start working for a school district in August so I would like answers in case it happens again. Thank you so much. It may be because of some ear infection, also ear wax can also cause dizziness. Sit on the edge of your bed, turn your head about 45 degrees to the left, keep your head in that position and quickly fall/lay on your right side. You will be looking up at the where the wall and ceiling meet, or thereabouts. Give it a minute and see if you feel any dizziness, it is also helpful if someone else is there and can watch your eyeballs, if it is BPPV they move back and forth during the vertigo. Then straighten your head, sit up, wait a minute to see if you get dizzy and repeat on the other side. OP, you can do this but there are YouTube videos demonstrating it so you have a better idea of how to do it.\n\nYour case sounds mild.  It is when the crystals in the ear get dislodged and out of position.  You can have \"left BPPV' or right or both.", "Nervous about seeing doctor for bppv... Today I woke up, turned over, and suddenly the room was spinning. It happened a couple times and was accompanied by pretty strong nausea....but seemed to go away after a few minutes. Freaked me out but I went about my day as normal.\n\nA few hours later I bent down to pick something up and again everything began to spin and I felt like I was going to throw up. Had a couple more bouts that were pretty mild, but have been slightly nauseous and dizzy for hours now. After some googling it seems like I might have bppv?\n\nFortunately I have a doctor appointment for tomorrow, but honestly he is not been a great doctor. I am worried he is just going to recommend I see some specialist without giving me any kind of referral or helpful information. I am hoping so badly that this will be all gone somehow when I wake up :/ I had the same problem last year. It ended up not being bppv but an inner ear infection. Have your doctor refer you to an ear, nose and throat specialist to eliminate that possibility as well. Thank you, I will keep that in mind! I am actually beginning to feel some discomfort in my right ear, and it seems like laying on that side is making the dizziness worse. How long did it take for the dizziness to go away when you were treated? 2 months ago I developed BPPV and it is the worst thing I have ever been through. I didnt know what to do until my pharmacist actually told me. \n\nIf you are not sure about the doctor you are seeing you can also see a vertigo/balance specialist it is usually at a dizziness/vertigo clinic also most physiotherapy places have someone on staff who works with patients who have BPPV and they may be able to better advise you. \n\nGravol will be your best friend and help so much with the nausea and help you be able to keep liquids down and help you be able to eat. \n\nGood luck. Many of us have found that general doctors (and even ENT and neurologists) are not super helpful if this IS BPPV. There are a few simple tests any doctor can do - to at least test for basic BPPV (The Dix Hallpike maneuver), but many do not. They just give you Meclizine (anti-vert) and an anti-nausea med and tell you to wait it out.  The meds will not fix it if it IS BPPV - but may help you feel better as you tackle it.  Moving the crystal in your inner ear canal back to the proper place is what needs to happen. The procedure (most common is Epley maneuver) is NOT pleasant, as it provokes the vertigo. But if it works, it is worth it!\n\nI agree, that finding a vestibular therapist or dizzy specialist will help you SO much more. It is always good to be checked out by a doctor in case it is an inner ear infection or something else. But if it is a form of BPPV - vestibular/dizzy therapists can do a multitude of tests by tipping you certain directions and watching to see if your eyes have nystagmus (twitching) and which direction your eyes are twitching (tells them which ear canal is effected). You can do some of these tests and maneuvers at home, but if you can get guidance and help - that is a benefit.\n\nBPPV is horrible - but take comfort in the fact that you are getting on top of it quickly and with proper professional help, you could have it resolved right away. I found my vestibular therapist in the physical therapy department.  She was a godsend. I would not have made it through this last episode without her - as I had a super stubborn case.\n\nBest wishes! Keep us posted as to what you find out. There are many on this sub that can offer support and help if you need it. The dizziness went away as soon as the antibiotics kicked in but I felt a residual \u201cweakness\u201d I guess you could call it for a couple of months.  After that I was fine.  I was tested for BPPV by my ENT also but she could tell right away that was not the problem.  This may be TMI but they put a tube with a camera at the end up my nose and was able to spot the inner ear infection.  I guess inner ear infections are rare in adults which is why you need to bring it up with your doctor. Thank you everybody who gave me some input and shared your experiences! Surprisingly, my doctor said he knew exactly what was wrong with me, and gave me the BPPV verdict. He went over the head maneuvers with me and had me do them in the office, and I already feel a little better. I was surprised that they did not actually trigger much dizziness. He told me to continue doing them three times a day until the vertigo is gone. Fingers crossed it will go away soon! If things do not improve then I guess my next step is to find a vestibular therapist. I am glad you got such a fast diagnosis! That is interesting though, my vestibular PT made me keep my head upright for 4-6 hours after a maneuver and would not perform a second maneuver for 24 hours after the first one. She said the crystals slowly fall back in place and if you do the maneuver too soon you can inadvertently knock them into the wrong canal and cause more problems. I wonder what others are being told\u2014is it common to be self administering multiple times a day? This is what I learned from my therapist in January/February (and she is continually going to seminars &amp; conventions on dizziness). She said that staying upright for a day (up to 24 hours) after your epley is no longer proven to help. If the crystal is back in place... It will stay there. Studies show no difference in staying upright vs not worrying about it (example... Sleeping flat or on your side) She told me to get active as much as I could right away. I will admit I was still careful for at least 24 hours because it is a simple thing to do &amp; if it could possibly help... Why not?\n\nI had weekly appointments and my therapist would perform the Epley once then wait about 5 or 10 minutes and do it again. The second time was basically to test (Dix Hallpike) to see if the first time worked. If symptoms were present she would continue the full epley.\n\nAfter 5 weekly visits with her (10 total epley - 2 per visit) and us not making progress... She allowed me to do it myself at home, as I knew exactly how to do it, mid week, in between visits with her. Only two reps though.\n\nI did the Half Somersault on my own as I was desperate for something to work (and it is easy).\n\nWhat sucks about BPPV is that there needs to be more research done. Nothing is set in stone. What works for some, does not work for others. And it seems all therapists do things a bit different. I do not know if there really is a right or wrong treatment. I value every single bit of info I read here that people share from their therapy &amp; journey. I know this will happen to me again &amp; I want to be prepared to kick it to the curb as quick as I can!\n\nThe info you shared from your therapist is certainly valid &amp; I will remember that 'next' time. I am seeing a lot of mixed messages about how often you should do the maneuvers....my doctor himself just got instructions printed from somewhere, no idea what the source is. I have tried to do it myself a few times now but it is honestly a little difficult on my own because I keep moving my head when I turn. I think I feel better than yesterday, but definitely still feel a bit dizzy and off.... Thanks for sharing, it is really interesting to hear what others are learning! I have had 4 different maneuvers (epley, Gufoni, BBQ, one I cannot remember) so perhaps that is a factor in the wait time. She does the same thing you are describing where a few minutes later she does the first half of the maneuver as a test. But then if the next day I still had vertigo I would go back in and get the other canal treated with a different maneuver. And I am with you on that\u2014no right or wrong treatment as long as it makes the spinning stop! I hope you can get your dizziness cleared up! Do you have anyone who could come over and help you do the maneuver? Thank you, as well, for sharing more info! It certainly helps to know others are in the same boat.... And hearing other options &amp; situations are helpful.", "Please help I apparently have bppv, it seems to be on the right side but it has gotten worse over the last few days.\n\nEvery morning when I wake up I have double vision for a few hours and have to shut one eye to see. Did anyone else have this with bppv?\n\nI am so scared in dizzy EVERY second of the day and doctors are not much help How do you know you have BPPV?\n\nDouble vision sounds like something to do with the eyes not converging properly. Doctors assumed I have it because I have had it before, I also went to the physio and he seemed to think I had it as well. I thought I had it at the start because the dizziness was only when I looked to the right but now it is getting worse e.g double vision ect. I am going to see the doctor again today in person Is it vertigo with nystagmus? Those symptoms while doing the dix-hall pike is what confirms you have BPPV. \n\nFrom there you have manoeuvres available to you to help resolve BPPV. \n\nEveryone here who has had it and had it resolve will suggest you have a PT or a specalist that knows what they are doing to guide you through the moves as it brings on more vertigo, can be somewhat distressing but you need to push through it.\n\nResolution can take multiple trips but it will resolve providing you locate the correct ear and canal. Yes do not do it yourself, can make things WORSE. Either go to a doc or sit up straighter when going to bed and try not to lay on your sides for a couple days. Usually resolves itself in time. (Have had it for 15 years) Yeah - fantastic advice.\n\nI would not do it solo ... however you read here that people do and have instant relief. \n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f 50/50 chance. Maybe I have not found the exercise that works for me but I have tried a few and simply getting up and moving around/walking is the best fix.\n\nThe more active you are the fast your body fixes itself I am not as bad as that, but I definitely can relate to what you are experiencing. It \\*is\\* awful to be hit with this, and I am sorry. I have had small relief by performing the exercises that are shown online for vertigo. Whatever works for you is best, IMO. (Note: I am not in any capacity a health care worker). Update: I went to the doctors and he was not happy with my neurological symptoms so he called me an ambulance. I went to the hospital for bloods and CT scan. Test results were fine but now they want an MRI which is very scary for me but fingers crossed I am okay. Did not really get any answers from the hospital Hope you get some answers and find relief soon! Please keep us posted. hope the MRI goes okay Turns out I have MS Oh my gosh! I am so glad you got some answers.... But that was not the answer I was hoping for. Hopefully now you can get proper treatment &amp; get some relief. Thank you for checking back in. Wishing you the best! Thank you for caring, yes not the answer I wanted either. Very depressed right now but hopefully treatment can get me back on the right path", "Could this NOT be BPPV? Friday morning, woke up, dizzy, eyes doing nystagmus, could not get out of bed or barely move without triggering the nystagmus. Decided come hell or high water, I would do the Epley first thing this morning. I slept on an incline, just like I did Friday night. Woke up this morning and did the Epley first thing. Nothing. No nystagmus, nothing. At all. BEFORE doing the maneuver. Can the crystals find their way home on their own somehow? Or did I not have BPPV in the first place? Should I call my doctor in the morning? I am 100% back to normal??!! Trust me, I am grateful beyond words the vertigo stopped, but am so confused since I was convinced it was BPPV. Mine has gone away on its own. The last time I had it, it was a few months after a month-long episode, so I was devastated. It came in the middle of the night when I rolled over. I tested it again while still laying down just to make sure and yep, I had it. Tried to calm down and told myself the only thing I can do is make an appt with my therapist in the morning. I felt totally fine the next day and just figured I had a mild case that time, but when I went the therapist and did the Epley, nothing. So it went away during the night I think, same as yours. \n\nI have also had a couple other times years ago and it went went away with no intervention after a day or two. Good to know! I am not going to call my doctor in the morning then because Covid, no time for clinical testing, BPPV is cause of vertigo around 93% of the time or something, so statistics, etc etc. Thank you for sharing :-) It came roaring back like a vengeance this morning. My Dr said to try Epley so I did and NO!!! I had nystagmus looking both ways that never stopped, I waited 30 seconds, felt like forever, and then the turning over was NOOoOOO! Even worse. It did not stop. Crawled to toilet. Puking. It kicks in just moving my eyes now. She prescribed Zofran and OTC meclizine. This is beyond the beyond. I really thought I should go to the ER and she assured me, like everyone else has, that that is normal for vertigo. When you say month long episode, does that mean your world spins the entire month?? I cannot do today again for a month. There is no way. Ugh, I am sorry! You should make an appt with a vestibular therapist if you can, they can really help. \n\nBPPV is positional, this is how it differs from other vertigo. In my experience, I only got spinning when I had my head in the first position of the epley, on my left side. All other times I was dizzy and nauseated, but no spinning. It was a long month. I tried the epley many times (which was rough) at home, before going to a therapist. If you are experiencing spells of vertigo that do not seem positional, or also include tinnitus, ear pressure changes, etc, it may not be BPPV. Hmmm, yes to tinnitus, yes to ear pressure in my right ear, and yes to not positional. Spinning is triggered by even looking to the sides, not tilting. Darn it. And yes, spinning for much of the day, not dizzy. The moving sensation, room spinning, eyes doing nystagmus spinning. I just emailed my Dr asking if I should make an appt to see her. Thank you for your help! I am crossing my fingers my world will stop spinning soon. I really will lose my mind if I have to do this every day for a month. Insanity inducing. Thank you, again. I appreciate your help. I hope you get some answers and feel better soon! Went to the ENT today. Hearing loss and I  go back for a VNG soon. It is either Labarythnitis, Neuritis, Meniere's Disease or a tumor but not the life threatening kind. So, thank you for your help! It is not BPPV after all. He had no guess as to when the spinning would stop. UGH. Best of luck to you and I hope you never get BPPV again!! Thank you for the update! I hope the spinning stop soon for you, I am glad you at least got some direction though, now at least you will not be torturing yourself with maneuvers for no reason.", "Recently diagnosed with BPPV Hi, two weeks ago, I had an episode of spinning that lasted all night every time I rolled on my left side (I had flown on an airplane earlier in the day for the first time in 7 years).\nI flew back a couple of days later and noticed that I could not hear out of one ear (I think left?).  This past Friday morning, I had a brief episode of vertigo but ignored it and carried on.  That night, I had the worst episode of vertigo in my life.  I had to hold on to the bed because I felt like I was flying off.  It continued all night that night and every night since.\n\nOn Monday evening, I went to urgent care and they threw around a lot of scary diagnoses but basically said it had not been long enough to worry about yet.  I was prescribed meclizine and Valium, neither of which did anything but make me drowsy.\n\nYesterday, I saw a physical therapist (I work out at a physical therapy place, so have quick access), and tested positive for BPPV on the right side, although she said it could possibly be the left anterior canal?\n\nShe was also concerned about possible central nervous system involvement and/cervical involvement. I have had severe migraine like symptoms in addition to the vertigo and have a history of both basilar and vestibular migraines.\n\nDo many of you with BPPV also suffer from migraines?  There seems to be a correlation to me.  Also, would that possibly complicate/prolong the recovery?\n\nI am lucky in that, since I work out at the  physical therapy place, both my coach and PT are working closely together.  I do power lifting and have been distressed to not be able to bench press or do anything involving the valsalva maneuver, but they are working together to come up with a plan I can do in the mean time, so that I can retain as much strength and fitness as possible without aggravating/prolonging the vertigo, until everything resolved.\n\nI have to say though, this is about the most miserable I have ever been in my life. Funny. You are the 2nd person posting here who said your BPPV started after a flight. That is what happened to me and I am convinced that the flight had something to do with it.\n\n  \nI do not get migraines. I do not really even get headaches. My BPPV was cured within a day by doing the epply maneuver.  \n\nI wonder what this means \"although she said it could possibly be the left anterior canal?\" She is not sure?  Question...does your PT specialize in BPPV? If not, or if your BPPV is not cured soon, I strongly recommend visiting a Balance Center. Many PTs and ENTs do not have a lot of experience with BPPV. Balance Centers see vestibular problems everyday.  She actually does specialize in vestibular issues.  She is the only PT at the place who will take the more complicated issues.  I think the migraine and central nervous system component is making it more complicated.\n\nSo as far as the anterior canal, she said that nystagmus on the right side usually points to posterior canal on the right side, so that is what she treated for.  She said there are some unusual cases though where nystagmus on the right indicates anterior canal on the left.  I think the protocol is to treat it as right posterior in the beginning.  She did treat the right side.  The thing that made her more concerned is that I am having issues more on my left side and I had thought that was my problem.  Again, the central nervous system and cervical issues also make my condition more complicated.  She said it was one of the worst cases she has ever seen. Ok, but I will repeat. If it  is not cured quickly I recommend visiting a balance center. Most major cities have one. At least get another opinion there.  Ok, I will Have you tried the epley maneuver yet? I saw a physical therapist who did that on Wednesday and am going back again today.  I think there has been an improvement.  I did not spin when I got up this morning although I do feel very unsteady and light-headed.  Im sorry. For me, Epley is the answer whenever i get a flare up.  So you do not get sick during the maneuver?  The PT thinks I have some central nervous system and/or cervical involvement, which are making it worse.  I feel encouraged that there is some improvement, but then I hear about people like you who are cured after one round of the Epley maneuver and feel great afterward and wonder what the hell js wrong with me?!? No I do not get sick during it, nor do I get migraines. I have only had to do it 3 times though, it seems my symptoms are much more manageable. This is speculation but perhaps the power lifting is compressing your spine/cervical joints/discs and pinching nerves somehow. I am not a doctor so I do not know. I am so sorry you are suffering. I am sure it will not last forever, and if it does you will manage. , . It will subside and if it does flare up you will have gained tools to cope. Keep learning and moving forward, keep gaining tools to cope and you will make it through. &gt; Life is weird. I also have IBS and naturally dangerously high cholesterol even though I live pretty stress free and healthy.  C'est la vie. If you already have a history of vestibular migraines.... would not that be it? \n\nI did read once that one can sort of trigger the other. That may be true in my case as well; my audiologist believes I have vestibular migraines while my osteo thinks I have cupulolithiasis (some rare bppv). Still have not quite figured it out. Weight lifting used to be a primary trigger for me, so take it easy. Does not mean you will not be able to get back to it eventually. I actually am responding to the Epley maneuver.  I saw the physical therapist again today, and she repeated the Epley maneuver and I only got minimal vertigo and nystagmus from it.  \n\nShe said my neck is super tight though and that I actually present as though I have a concussion.  I have been asked multiple times if I got hit on the head.  I am still have feelings of waving or unsteadiness, which she thinks are from my brain trying to process the information.\n\nI definitely am having vestibular migraines with this, but have BPPV on top of it.  I do really feel like I am improving though.  I am allowed to get back to some light exercises this coming week, and she said I will probably be back to my regular training program by next week. Oh good. Yeah from what I read months ago, it is common to get both. As long as you are responding to the Epley... that is a good sign. \n\nMy audiologist, re: the vertigo, was like \"Oh, you are a 30-something-year-old woman with a history of migraines... my money is on vestibular migraines\".  Sooo, seems like this is a common issue, perhaps particularly with women...  \nDo you take anything medication-wise for your vestibular migraines? I am going to my doctor next week, my Osteo recommended potentially taking triptans to rule out whether its migraine or not. I do not take anything.  I have done better overall with them (current episode aside) since I did food sensitivity testing and took out foods that I am sensitive to.\n\nA good diet and good sleep hygiene have helped as well.  I do take quite a few supplements for general health (collagen, probiotics, calcium/vitamin D, fish oil, Myosedate (contains valerian, which is a natural muscle relaxer).\n\nMy migraines are triggered oftentimes by running in the heat and sun, so I make sure if I am going to run to do it early in the morning and stop at the first sign of any symptoms.\n\nTaking an Aleve at the first sign of headache, rather than waiting until it is severe is also helpful.\n\nI hope this helps and I hope you are able to find answers for yourself.  It is miserable to feel bad and not have any control over it. hey with you mentioning the migraines, look into your occipital nerve, and talk to chiro about occipital lift adjustment, and working those muscles at the base of the skull in that area, i have bppv now and then, but i also get dizzy from loud sounds, head movement and jaw movement, ear wont pop, then chiro does occipital life for effected side and bam, all gone. Look it up. good luck.", "History of vertigo I am 22 and have a history of getting vertigo, usually when I am extremely stressed or because of the way I am sleeping. This morning I was sleeping on my side, woke up and rolled over onto my back and the entire room was spinning for at least 30 seconds. If I opened my eyes, my eyes would follow the spins (if that makes sense). I have never felt it that severe before and screamed for my roommates. I am freaked out because I could deal with the mild vertigo from time to time but this episode really has me extremely anxious that it is going to happen again that severe. I have never been to the doctor for it because my mom has the same thing so I have just followed the exercises that they gave her. I still have not sat up from my bed because I am terrified it is going to happen again that severely if I sit up. Is it time a see a specialist? What kind specifically? Check out vestibular physio therapist just google the city you are in Definitely see someone that specializes in dizziness.  I saw a vestibular therapist (she was located in the regular physical therapy department). They will help diagnose your dizziness and help show you maneuvers to fix the dizziness. You  may  need to do different ones than your mom. They can also give you exercises specific to your condition -as there are different types of vertigo.  A loose crystal (otolith) can get into any of the 6 inner ear canals and cause trouble. Best wishes to you! Please let us know what you find out. I have had three attacks and while it seems like there is always some extremely minor residual dizziness (nothing life-impacting), each of my attacks has been less severe than the previous one (the first one was the absolute worst, hands down).  Not sure if that is usually the case or not.", "Discord? Does anyone know of one or part of one?", "What makes certain people get BPPV for no reason?

Thank you for posting this information. Thanks so much for the information, I very much appreciate it! I got my first attack the morning after I did an evening yoga routine. I did these super warrior poses \ud83d\ude05\n\nMy next attack was 17 months later. I slept on my affected side of the head.\n\nAlmost all of my aunts in their 60s+ have BPPV. And similarly, it takes me months for the residual vertigo to disappear.\n\nI am always dehydrated, I love my coffee, and I love salty junk food \ud83d\ude33 From my person take I do think vitamin d plays a HUGE role supplementing vitamin d makes any lingering bppv go away for me if I forget for a week it starts to come.back I supplement again two days later it is gone. This is just my experience but I really do not think it is not worth your time to try buying a 10$ bottle of vitamin d and trying it out for a week or two worst case it does nothing best case it helps with your symptoms immensely", "Feeling worse after PT- epley. Not so long ago I made a post about reoccurring BPPV. When it initially started, PT could not see me until yesterday. In the meantime, my chiropractor was seeing me doing other maneuvers. Anyway, yesterday, PT did the epley in it is entirety. At the end of it, I sat up and went into full blown vertigo. Therapist helped into a chair and timed the attack at about 45 seconds to a minute. It felt like 10 in all honesty. Today, I feel horrible. Headache, nausea, slightly more dizzy than the past week. Is this a common response with the idea \u201cit gets worse before it gets better?\u201d\nThanks for any replies in advance This has happened to me as well, sitting up from an epley and suddenly not only having severe vertigo but feeling like I was falling through the floor. I cannot remember the term for it but the PT told me it was due to the crystals falling back into the canals, the maneuvers moved them but not all the way back to where they were supposed to go, and instead everything was shook up like a snow globe. I always felt worse afterwards. My BPPV has been very resistant to treatment, unfortunately. I have more success with multiple rounds of the half-somersault maneuver than the epley. Not to scare you, because this is not most people\u2019s experience. But I have this often. Like, sometimes multiple times a day. I have gotten used to it and it is not scary at all anymore. I brace and prepare for it, and I even sometimes laugh at how silly it all is. The point of me saying this is not to prepare you for my reality... but to say that if you do have to deal with this to some degree throughout your life, it will get better. The panic and discomfort that goes along with it. And all of the symptoms the day after that you describe. I do not get any of that anymore. I am sending a big healing hug your way and I hope that you feel better tomorrow. Ginger tea is your friend! When I do the Epley (and when it was performed on me by a professional over 20 times), every single time I laid back, I got the horrible vertigo/nystagmus and then also it would happen again as I sat up. Sadly I think that indicated that the crystal fell back into the ear canal and it was not corrected. I studied the last two steps of the Epley over and over trying to get the correct position - because obviously it was not working. It was over two months of doing the Epley this way. Then finally it worked. And yes, sitting up was the WORST for me and I would feel quite sick after. M therapist would always perform the Epley twice. The second time was essentially to test to see if the first time worked.", "Epley Maneuver and spinal issues? I used to have BPPV for 1.5 years before getting it cured with a specialist who performed the maneuver on me. \n\nA few months ago, I felt spinning again so I decided to do the Epley Maneuver at home. Since then, I have been having extremely bad nexk and back pain with numb, tingly legs. I get headaches, my body rocks around sometimes, and my entire body feels weak. I cannot lie on my side anymore without feeling like my hip is pulling so I need a pillow between my legs now.\n\nCould I have misaligned or injured my neck or back doing the maneuver? If you are relatively healthy I do not see how you would injure yourself doing it, but it is possible. If you already have neck or back problems your chances of injuring yourself are greatly increased. But yeah either way it is possible! Sounds like a nerve may have gotten pinched or moved when you did it. That can definitely cause numbness sensations all throughout limbs.", "Home Epley - not working? When I get to the last step and sit upright, the spins come on for a few seconds then settle.  \n\nIs the last step supposed to be totally normal no vertigo? In my experience the third step was the most violent one, and fourth step had one too. During sitting upright I noticed the vertigo came when I turn to the side and looking downwards and standing up. After 10 mins of sitting, it went away and never came back. If it doesnt work right away, I might need to do a couple sessions until you will not feel any vertigo left. For ME - the vertigo would come when I initially laid back, and then again upon sitting up (and it was HORRIBLE when sitting back up).  I Spent over 2 months and the course of doing 20 Epley trying to correct the BPPV.  I studied the maneuver over and over and discussed it with my therapist, trying to figure out which step was not getting done right and how to fix it.  Realistically, the step before the last one of sitting up (where you turn to look down at the floor), is the one where the crystal makes it around the top portion of the canal (making the big turn).  So, sitting back up should be the crystal settling down into the safe spot.\n\nSo that horrible vertigo that comes from sitting up - I am not sure if it is the crystal falling way back down into the ear canal in the WRONG spot - or if it is made it around the bend and is falling into the 'safe' spot where it will stick into the correct spot.\n\nI posted a question a while back, asking for everyone is experience while doing each different position of the Epley - to try to help determine this same thing. I did not get much response.  I DO know that the last Epley I did that seemed to be the cure - I had a horrible 30ish second of vertigo upon sitting up.  Three days later when I tried laying back again - the vertigo was gone (and this was Epley #20).\n\nI will be curious to hear other people's experience on this.  As so far, in my experience, the last step has had vertigo. I never had much vertigo with the third step, as /u/shaz82 mentions, and I felt that should have been a spot that the vertigo hit hard. So I kept trying to slightly adjusting my position with that step. I DID have help from my therapist doing the maneuver for at least 16 of them. There is a Youtube video with a PT that says the 1st and 3rd step SHOULD elicit the vertigo, but if the last step (sitting up) presents video, the maneuver has failed.  Of course this is just one PT's opinion.  I cannot find many other videos explaining what should happen on each step.  I agree with your comment that the 3rd step, facing the floor should have symptoms, but mine never do as well.  I have tried face to matress, chin to shoulder, but nothing seems to bring on vertigo in that 3rd position. I had seen that too... And was always so bummed when the 3rd step did not do anything for me. Then sitting up.... Was horrible &amp; I figured the crystal went back to where it started. I honestly do not know at what point it cleared for me. Might have been while snowmobiling &amp; doing some fast fancy moves! I am still anxious to learn more.... As I know bppv will strike again! Well mine came back today after trying epley 3x last night.  That 3rd step is probably the key. Oh dang! Sorry to hear that. Hang in there! Let me know how things progress.... I am going to try again tonight but this time when I sit Up at the end, I saw a video suggesting to keep chin to shoulder for an additional 30 secs and then looking forward.  We will see. Please report back as to how it goes. I do recall keeping my head in that position for a bit. But the vertigo was often so intense, I was swaying &amp; had to try to hold my head (it probably just felt like I was falling). My therapist often helped hold me at that point. Ugh. I give you credit for being able to do it so many times in a row. Two times was enough in a day for me. Made me so sick. Then a few days to recover &amp; hope it worked &amp; that the crystal was settling. I also read that doing it in evenings is best because you can sleep elevated on your good ear to help keep the crystals in their place.\n\nI did it once tonight and barely noticed sound when sitting up and actually felt a bit of spin on my side so I hope it works! I am finally going to see a physical therapist tomorrow. Obviously these whole maneuvers are not working. Oh good! You may need a different maneuver. Your crystal may be in a different canal. And sometimes it is just stubborn. I worked with a skilled therapist for over 2 months... Before we had success. Please report back as to what you find out. I will keep my fingers crossed for you! My PT ran me though 3 cycles of the BBQ roll for right sided horiz. canal bppv.\n\n\n\nhere is a video of the technique.  SO far SO good.  Give it a try! I am glad you got some answers &amp; help. Seeing a specialist is always good.... To help determine which canal is truly effected. I am happy this 'hopefully' worked for you! I know my weekly visits with the therapist... She constantly was checking other ear canals, as we just could not get in top of it. My therapist was actually online researching what moves to try on me.  We went through a total of 3 before triggering the symptoms and then stuck with it.", "Feeling dizzy when looking left Does anyone notice when they are having an episode when the look with just their eyes, not necessarily whole head, they feel dizzy. I noticed looking the right I feel fine but to the left I feel dizzy? Yes.. when I was having a vertigo attack from head movement, I would find that my eyes could trigger slight dizziness. In fact note that the positional vertigo has stopped, I still have this lingering dizziness that seems to be triggered by eye movement. \n\nI think this is where gaze exercises come in to play to help rehab head and eye movement.", "Vertigo with or after panic attacks anyone else?

Magnesium, B12 Tri-Blend, B12 Complex in the morning and 1,000 vitamin ac at night. All liquid vitamins except for magnesium. Vertigo is gone now. The reason for panic attacks was because I think the vertigo had me feeling so off that it was freaking my subconscious out. Relax and except it and SLOWLY force yourself to start getting around.

Basically over a year ago, laying in bed moved to my right and had my head tilted back. Had vertigo, where my eyes went to the back of my head and I actually could not move my eyes down until I say up. Iv been dealing with constant dizziness since, but NOT vertigo after the first time. \n\nRecently tried VRT , made me more motion sick so I thought it was working, did not do it for a few days and now I have relapsed. I had vertigo AGAIN laying in bed, right side, head tilted back. \n\nIs this bppv? I can provide much more info and IV tried if needed. \n\nI have had MRI, CT scan, 2 vngs (12% difference in my r ear), tried VRT for 3 weeks, tried a few meds and nothing has helped.  Iv noticed that i can not lean my head to the right whatsoever, even sleeping on that side will cause bppv for me.  I also have to get straight out of bed once i wake up i can just chill in bed once i awake or that will also cause my bppv. When i first found out about bppv i was taking ibuprofen like candy then i found out about ginger pills and they have helped me so much!

It is been a week almost.", "Every had unspecific BPPV? I know that is not a medical term so I will explain. For the past 24 hours it is back, but it effects me in every position. So if I go from laying to sitting up/standing it starts up and eventually evens out after a minute or so, and then when I lay back down it happens again and then evens out after a minute or so, and when I change positions it happens again and then evens out after a minute or so. Anyone else ever have it like this? Yeah sounds like BPPV. It is in the name, Benign Proximal **Positional** Vertigo. The evening out of your balance after a minute or so are your ear crystals settling it sounds like. Try the epley maneuver and see if you can get them back to their normal \u2018homes\u2019.\u201d :) I know it is BPPV, but I am saying has anyone had it where it is not one certain position; but numerous positions effect it? Yeah, if I even turned my head when I had BPPV I got super dizzy. I could not even stand. It is very normal to get dizzy when changing positions and being in different positions. I have had it well over a decade now. I get it like once a month give or take now.  It is annoying, but I have gotten used to it as far as dealing with it. It stinks and I hate it, but I cannot really change it. Only thing that I am scared of is that it has gotten worse over time and I am only 34 right now. I feel like by 60 I will be incapable of functioning. Yeah I am only 26 and got it when I was 23.

No. About as much as the hamburger I ate giving me a heart attack. All righty then Yikes! I have been thinking a lot about the vaccine but never thought to ponder it inducing possibly inducing vertigo- good question. I did read headaches listed as a side effect, but have not seen dizziness listed as one. No - as BPPV is a mechanical issue in the vestibular system. It is not going to bring on vertigo.  Idk but I had a severe BPPV episode about two months ago that lasted over three weeks. I have never had it before and was diagnosed by my ENT. His explanation was I have a weak left ear which I though was a BS explaination. \n\nI found it weird because I know about twenty or so ppl that had first time vertigo episodes all within a week or so of mine. I thought maybe it could have been a side effect of covid itself possibly. Some sort of viral infection by-product possibly. To my knowledge I did not have covid tunless it was way earlier in the year when I was sick before covid was a concern. \n\nJust found it very odd out of nowhere all these ppl I knew were going through the same thing. A lot of people got covid \u201cout of the blue\u201d and \u201cfor the first time\u201d this year. I did in December I have also read someone tested positive and his only symptom was vertigo. I too am suspicious of vertigo being covid related. I have read lots of people who tested positive have vertigo. It is also a symptom of a viral infection. Also vertigo is a symptom of vitamin D deficiency..which is also, they are saying a factor in covid symptoms. Correct - vertigo is a symptom\n\nSymptom being the key word and you posted in the BPPV forum. \n\nAll I am saying is that the vaccine cannot cause BPPV. But inflammation? The first time I had my (major) BBPV episode, my GP said they suspect some of it can be viral because they see clusters of people with vestibular issues (including BPPV) show up at certain times.  It is quite possible that some viral agent, and there are so many , can cause this in certain people. Also B12 deficiency is one of things they test for right away, at least here, if you complain of balance issues. Yes I actually upped my vitamin C and D when all the maneuvers did not seem to help. Once I did that it was gone in a few days Not sure but when I had COVID a few weeks ago I had the worst BPPV ever. It was awful. \ud83d\ude29 Had you had bppv before?? Yes!", "Worried I get really bad Vertigo when I begin working out or make head movements. When I am sitting down I feel just fine. I have checked my blood pressure and my readings are normal.

Lots of factors to consider!\n\nGood luck! \ud83d\udc4d", "How does dehydration cause BPPV? Does anyone know why dehydration can be such a strong factor in triggering BPPV? Recently I have become quite susceptible to this and I do not understand the mechanics, if that makes sense. Like why does dehydration cause the ear rocks to move? Or is dehydration-fueled BPPV something mechanically different?\n\nWhat I have experienced is that if I become dehydrated, my BPPV lasts for about two days. I do the Epley and Semont, and that makes it marginally better, but really it is just time that resolves it. Which makes me think that dehydration BPPV is caused by something other than ear rocks... My physical therapist told me that the rocks are settled into a sticky gel like area in the inner ear.  As we age, it gets less sticky and less gelatinous.  Dehydration compounds the problem dramatically. It will not *cause* it, but it *will* trigger an episode in many cases. Not eating a proper meal could do it also. Interesting.  And I guess there is no way to make the gel more sticky and more gelatinous, is there, by either medicine or supplements or whatever?\n\nGetting old sucks. :( Got it -- so going by the previous commenter, because I am dehydrated, it makes the gel even less sticky and gelatinous.  Which means then the rocks are more easily able to escape and cause havoc.  And because the gel remains less sticky and gelatinous for the duration of my dehydration (just because I do not feel thirsty anymore does not mean I am already re-hydrated -- it takes time for my body to actually be fully re-hydrated, at least a day from my personal experience), I am way more susceptible to BPPV.\n\nI never had to consume water before I go out for a 5K run, but last time I did not, and I paid for it with 2 days of BPPV.  Going forward, I am going to pump as much water as I can stand before running... I dunno.  I have read some folks on here swear by ginkgo and vitamin d as preventative.   A vitamin d deficiency has been established as making it more likely to get I have read.  I think ginkgo has something to do with blood flow to inner ear.  Not sure tho. If you overhydrate before running you can upset your stomach. Just drink a reasonable amount, and perhaps take some on your run. Thanks -- I am going to run a sweat test (weigh myself before and after running) to see how much fluids I am losing.  If I can drink that much like 30 minutes before running, I figure that should at least mitigate the issue. I think that is a great approach!

Luckily it is fairly mild but is super annoying. Going to the ENT this week.\n\nAnyway, I was working out today and afterwards felt much more dizzy than I had been. I decided to go in the hot tub for about 20 min and for the last few hours my dizziness is extremely reduced! Anyone have any ideas on this? Maybe my dizziness was actually from tension? \n\nI did a few maneuvers this morning with little luck but maybe they actually worked and I just had residual for a few hours. Are you certain it is BPPV? Have you done tests to confirm it? If not - it is possible your vertigo/dizziness could be from an inner ear infection or sinus troubles. I only mention that because being in the hot tub - the heat/steam could have opened up some of your sinuses and helped drain some fluid - and that could make the dizziness go away.  Also - as you mention, if it is not confirmed BPPV (crystal loose in the inner ear canal and severe brief vertigo with nystagmus caused when performing the Dix Halpike or moving your head in a certain direction) it could be tension and just relaxing made you feel better.\n\nI will be curious to see what the ENT says.  Please report back with your findings! Best wishes to you. Hope you are on the road to recovery! I felt pretty certain it was BPPV as I have had it in the past (confirmed) and this was very similar. That said, this time around it sort of felt like it was coming from my lower back at times. I do not exactly know how to describe it. \n\nYesterday I did some maneuvers in the morning which did not help much. I also did some sit ups before the hot tub so my head was going up and down. This morning my dizziness is 95% gone.\n\nI will definitely report back after I see the doctor tomorrow. I agree with you, maybe it was an ear infection or sinus thing. Interestingly enough, I had been at the beach with my family for the week and mid week my sons ear started leaking. He ended up with an ear infection. Maybe something with the water affected both of us? Who knows!", "BPPV after flushing ears with water? I had an ear infection about a month ago and the nurse told me to clear my earwax with carbamide peroxide and water after the infection ended. After cleaning out my ears I have had vertigo ever since. I am seeing an ent in a few weeks but I am wondering if there is anything I can do before then to help myself. The epley maneuver does not seem to be working.", "Horizontal / Lateral BPPV? What do the symptoms feel like? What triggers the feeling? Horizontal (lateral) BPPV is found with horizontal nystagmus that changes direction depending on the ''down'' ear. So like when you roll over on your sides you will get an intense spinning sensation (vertigo).\n\nIn my case, I had it in both lateral and anterior so rolling onto my sides and laying back/moving my head up or down gave me vertigo. When I roll from my back to the sides, I get dizziness and some slow moving sensation but I do not see any spinning going on. Do you think that might be residual dizziness? It is worse on my right than left (I used to have right ear BPPV). \n\nDid you also feel symptoms when sitting up and turning your head to the sides or just when laying down and rolling to the sides? I think it is just residual but I would have a vestibular specialist check it out to be sure if it continues.\n\nI do not feel any symptoms anymore. But when I did, it was when I laid down, turned onto my sides,  bent over and tiled my head up and down. Lol I had it bad tho and it took months to get to a functioning state. 6 months later I am perfectly fine, I just cannot sleep flat or on my sides anymore because I got used to sleeping on my back and I also read it may help stop reoccurrence from happening possibly. Whether that is true or not idk but now I cannot get comfy on my sides lol Did you have residual dizziness for about 6 months? \n\nWere the BPPV symptoms happening only when you are on a bed or even when sitting? No, I had residual dizziness for about 2ish months. It is been 6 months since my first BPPV episode back in September. It gradually went away. Like each week felt a little better till I felt normal.\n\nAnd the BPPV symptoms during the episode before treatment happened when I layed down and even standing up/ sitting if I moved my head wrong or bent over. Oh I see. How can you tell the difference between BPPV symptoms and residual dizziness? Because I think residual dizziness sometimes makes you dizzy when you turn your head or look up/down too right? \n\nThe only way I know how to tell the difference is that BPPV involves the room spinning BPPV symptoms was vertigo (room spinning) for me. I never got the vertigo again after treating the BPPV. Residual dizziness was a constant off balance, woozy, drunk-ish kind of feeling. I also had this lag feeling like my brain and balance were off sync. I see. I am getting that sometimes too, but the woozy feeling is much worse when I sit slouched in a chair, especially if the back rest of the chair is slightly curved instead of straight. I also have a lot of neck pain and back stiffness lately. Do you think this could be neck related too? Or did you also experience a lot of neck tightness and pain when having residual dizziness? I had a lot of neck pain as well. I still do and experience dizziness occasionally. I started working on my posture and it is helped with that. So slouching in a chair would definitely not help with that. I attributed the neck pain to tension from the BPPV episode. Maybe stressing to stay and sleep  in certain positions to avoid the vertigo put a lot of tension on my neck.", "An update and a thank you I posted here a couple of weeks ago after onset of bppv, or that is what it seemed to be.\n\nThanks to u/Colmanson1 giving me some helpful advice I was able to successfully treat it and stop the nystagmus occurring.\n\nI followed their advice, and was able to quickly determine which side was affected and after several days of Epley exercises I had improved greatly.\n\nI still have some minor residual dizziness but only with the left side if I have it at an extreme angle, like looking under a table for example.\n\nI finally got to my doc today for my flu shot, and discussed it with him, he agrees it was BPPV and he said he thought I was clever to figure it out for myself.\n\nSo I told him about r/BPPV and how it was actually this community that helped me figure it out.\n\nHe did not think I needed any further tests unless it keeps happening.\n\nHe did mention some of his patients being quite reluctant to do the Epley due to the return of symptoms.\n\nThank you to all of you who contribute your knowledge and experiences here, it is really helpful.\n\nI could not get to the doc until now, because my car was out of rego for a week, and then I was not up to driving, so you have saved me a couple of weeks of living with it.\n\nAnd that is pretty awesome :-) Hells yeah!!\nGlad you are feeling better love!!\n\n-I would insert Leonardo DiCaprio cheers gif here if I could- :) Thanks heaps, appreciate it :-)\n\nLife without nystagmus is much more bearable :-D I am so happy you found relief!  Hurrah!!!!  Thank you for sharing your journey.  It will surely help others in the future.\n\nAnd I agree - the fear of doing the Epley is horrid, as it reproduces the intense vertigo/nystagmus symptoms.  Many will not do it, or refuse to even try, because of this fear. But once you learn you need to suffer in order to treat it and make it go away, it is worth it.  Does not make it any better or easier - but at least you know there is eventually a reward. Thanks again for your help, it really made a difference :-)\n\nIt was definitely worth going through in my case, but I think mine was probably a fairly mild episode, if it was worse I might feel reluctance.\n\nMy doctor treats a lot of older people so he is dealt with it many times in practice.\n\nAnd thanks to you, I will be ok to handle it myself in future.", "Would anyone be interested in a free Vestibular Rehab Program?

Currently, I am experiencing residual dizziness and did the Epley and it seemed to help No - the residual dizziness is from your eyes and your vestibular system not being in sync. \n\nBest thing you can do is gaze stability exercises which your PT can help design a program for you. \n\n Thanks for the info im not a dr but...i would add that if you only perform the epley when that crystal in your ear is out of place. you dont want to cause that crystal to become out of place by doing the epley.\n\nrecommend consulting with you dr just in case. Per info from my vestibular therapist, the Epley only helps move the crystal back into it is correct spot. It will not do any good in helping prevent.....as the crystal is either where it needs to be or it is out in the canal (giving you vertigo).  There may be cases (rare) where there are even smaller crystals left floating around (producing mild vertigo), so there have been times where the Epley 'could' help with those. But those extra tiny crystals are so small, that often doing the Epley will not help, as they do not weigh enough to get momentum to move around the inner ear canal. On the flip side - the best thing to do for residual dizziness is to challenge the dizziness and move around as much as you can. So perhaps the head movements of the Epley are helping your system recover. But you would have to do a lot of them to make a difference (I am just thinking outside the box here).  The gaze exercises that /u/slash5k1 posted are many of what I had to do to recover (along with other vestibular exercises). And it took reps of 15 each, three times a day, for weeks - to help my residual dizziness. \n\nAlso - my therapist recommended NOT doing the Epley right away again once BPPV has been corrected. Especially not for a few days. Once things have settled down, it should not make a difference.\n\nSadly - there is not much a person can do to prevent BPPV from happening again.", "diagnosed w/BPPV - finally resolved hi all\n\njust want to provide my experience with bppv. ive never had it before and hope i do not have it again, although i know its possible it could return.\n\nim m/55+ and in excellent health. im a cyclist riding 75-100 miles/week.\n\nits been about 5 weeks since my initial symptoms came on (2/22/2020). it totally knocked me for a loop. by not having extended dizziness/lightheadedness before i was not sure what was causing it.\n\non saturday 2/22 in the early evening i began feeling dizziness a couple hours after a pretty intense 30mile ride. i thought maybe i was dehydrated. i went to bed saturday night expecting the symptoms would resolve by the morning. i awoke sunday with the same dizziness.\n\ncome monday morning 2/24 i had the same symptoms so i made an appt to see my primary care dr for monday afternoon. my primary care dr thought i had labryntitis (inner ear infection). he gave me an antibiotic (in case it was bacterial) and a diuretic. big mistake to give me the diuretic. i wasnt dehydrated but the diuretic made me very dehydrated and by that friday 2/28 i could barely get out of bed. i went back in (my wife drove me) to see my primary care dr. on the afternoon of 2/24.\n\nnow it gets worse, i thought. my usual dr doesnt work on fridays so i saw the female dr in office. she didnt think i had labrynthitis. she did an ekg and thought she saw some \"blips\" in the results. she suggested i might be having a mild heart attack and to get to the hospital immediately. lovely!.\n\nthe hospital does a bunch of tests including another ekg, cat scan of my head, chest x-ray and blood tests. ALL come back normal except for being very very dehydrated...due to the diuretic. i got 2 iv's and then was sent home. did i mention iv bags are great if you ever need to re-hydrate? anyway, i still have the dizziness. so now i give it about a week and im still having the dizziness. i make an appt to see my dr again on 3/16. my dr finally asks if i have ever seen a ear nose and throat (ent) dr. nope.\n\nso i go see an ent on 3/18 who suggests almost immediately that i have bppv. the epley maneuver is performed on me twice for my right hand side. i was told to only sleep on my left side for at least 5 days and give it about a week or so and things should subside.\n\nfinally, i can say my symptoms have subsided and i feel for the most part 100%. there are occasions that i can feel the unsteadyness but i was also told that i could feel that way for a while as my body works to resolve the issues.\n\nthis whole ordeal was horrible and a bit scary as i had no idea how long i could have the symptoms. i also had to completely shutdown exercising until the symptoms resolved. i can say i back to cycling and feeling fine. whew.\n\nhopefully this info above helps someone with the issue. keep positive as your issues will resolve in time as long as an ent dr diagnoses you with a similar bppv issue. What is missing from your discussion is if your dizziness was triggered by any positional changes. One of the Ps in BPPV stands for  positional....did you experience this? Usually people mention it straight away. Thank you for sharing your experience. I think this also continues to show how many doctors are unfamiliar with dizziness.  The Dix Hallpike (first step to the Epley) is such an easy procedure to perform to test to see if it IS truly BPPV. Finding which inner ear canal is effected by the severe vertigo that is reproduced and the direction of the nystagmus of your eyes is key to treating BPPV.  It took me 4 episodes of BPPV to finally get officially diagnosed and get proper treatment.  And I also went to see a LOT of specialists. The docs all say I had it, but none did the test to find out exactly where the crystal was (which would determine which procedure to perform to clear the crystal).  The vestibular physical therapist was the one that performed all the right tests and put goggles on me to record my nystagmus.\n\nI think this forum is great for sharing experiences!  BPPV is such a common thing, yet there is not a lot of real life documentation out there. Just a lot of studies, in which many are outdated and do not share how horrid this condition really is!\n\nFingers crossed you continue to feel good!!!!  I am still feeling residual dizziness after a successful treatment February 12 (my 20th Epley maneuver).  So I love hearing success stories! I have had bppv for over a year and when I went to the doctor the first time it occurred (which to date was the worst it ever was now I just get slight dizziness every now and then) the first thing my doctor suggested was that it was vertigo/bppv so I am surprised how many tests and appointments you had to make just to come to conclusions that it was bppv. Glad to hear you have it resolved though! I did the maneuvers at home and went away right after. Thankful for this! Yea I am a little upset at my dr for not telling me sooner that it could have been bppv. I have been going to my primary care dr for about 30yrs. He is been spot on every time until this incident.", "Feel dizzy? Check inside your ears : Healthcare Asia Daily News ", "First time completing the Epley manoeuvre at home - quick question Hello,\nI got diagnosed with BPPV 2 months ago and my dr sent me to the physiotherapist to do the Epley manoeuvre. He gave me pamphlets on how to complete it myself the next time it happens, so it does not cost me an arm and a leg each time.\n\nI woke up this morning with vertigo again and the pamphlet says to do the manoeuvre 3 times per day until the vertigo is gone, and after already completing it twice today, I feel as if I have got onto it quite early and am felt less dizzy after the second time.\n\nMy question is - do I need to sleep at a 45degree angle tonight? Or is that only if it is a really severe episode? The first time took about 2 weeks to subside.\n\nSorry for the ramble, my brain is a bit fuzzy. Some doctors still recommend sleeping upright and trying not to roll to the side, others say it does not matter, to just avoid quick head movements for a few days. Also, some doctors recommend waiting a few days to try the Epley again in order to let the crystal settle into place. Thanks, I will sleep upright tonight just to make sure. I agree with /u/passesopenwindows.  My vestibular therapist would have me do two Epley during a session. The second one (after waiting 5 or 10 minutes) was basically to check to see if the first worked.  If you do not get the vertigo/nystagmus upon the first position of laying back with your head slightly turned - you can assume it worked.  If the vertigo was still there (we would continue with the entire Epley)- she told me to wait a few days before doing it again.  She also said the latest studies show that staying upright/sleeping upright for a period of time does not matter. Regardless, it is an easy enough thing to do for a day and if for some reason it would help, I would do it! I never had an 'ah ha' moment of when the Epley actually worked. Each time felt horrible. I only knew when I went back for my 8th appointment and she laid me back and there was no longer vertigo/nystagmus! I still felt like crap - but that intense spinning was gone.  Many months of residual dizziness remained though.\n\nBest wishes to you! I hope you caught it quickly and can resolve it. I have found that sleeping on the affected side can definitely make it come back and I sleeping somewhat upright helps me. 7 months from my first episode and I am still sleeping at an angle. I have occasionally napped without the angle, but I just feel more secure sleeping at an angle.", "how can u tell if you have BPPV or Labyrinthitis ?  \n\nthanks . I would advise to get a diagnosis from a doctor", "3/31 - First visit with Vestibular Therapist So today I went for my first appointment with the therapist and while she was nice and confirmed that I have an inner ear issue, she was not able to work out what was causing it. She put goggles on me that recorded both eyes and did the Dix-Hallpike maneuver several times. The problem is that none of the positions triggered any sort of dizziness and there was no visible nystagmus.\n\nShe went through a bunch of different exercises with me and the one that was the most telling was how I could balance ok with my eyes closed on hard ground but when I had my eyes closed and was standing on a piece of thick foam, I could not balance at all as I did not have the feeling in my feet to help me balance and was relying solely on my inner ear which is not functioning.\n\nI am supposed to stop taking the meclizine and go back on Monday to see if the nystagmus is more pronounced. My hope is that the meclizine was masking the nystagmus and she will see something on Monday.\n\nI guess my one question for fellow BPPV sufferers is - Is there a specific position that triggers dizziness for you?\n\nI am going to see once the meclizine wears off if I can find a specific position that triggers it. I just saw this, I responded to you on a different post but yes, definitely meclizine can mask the nystagmus. I was told not to take it for... I do not remember exactly, maybe 12 hours before any appointment. Good luck! this is not a trigger but for me, after visiting my ent dr and they performed the dix-halpike to determine which side was affected, the right side for me, and then the epley to resolve the issue i was told not to sleep on my right side for 5 days. yes seemed long but i am clear now. Yeah they did not tell me not to take it but a thread on here that I read convinced me to skip my lunch dose but I do not think it was enough. Hopefully on Monday after I have been off of it for several days, they will see something. Absolutely. Most recently, looking to the left - especially looking at things above my head - triggered dizziness. \n\nThis was obvious when my doc did the Epley on me yesterday, although I may have to go back for a second maneuvre (mine can be stubborn).\n\nI should point out that I have been definitely diagnosed as having BPPV... Good luck, I know it is frustrating to not know what is going on. Thanks. I am hopeful though. She said they are going to send me to another doctor who is supposedly a genius when it comes to this sort of stuff if they cannot find anything on Monday which was also encouraging. I have been off the meclizine for about a day now and for sure I am experiencing more dizziness/motion sickness effects which hopefully means that they will be able to get a better read on what is going on. your not supposed to  take meclezine before an evaluation. Also u may still have BPPV and no eye rolls if its a minor case. Yeah I know that now. No one told me anything and so I just happened to read it a few hours before my appointment. We will see what tomorrow's appointment brings.", "Duration of first BPPV attack? I am curious what other experienced.\n\n( I do not understand the poll? An attack of BBPV is a mechanical issue that brings on nystagmus and vertigo. These are short lived experiences that will continue to occur while the crystal(s) in one (or more) of the 3 canals (that fell in there) causes mixed messages to be fired to your brain whenever you move your head. \n\nIf you experience vertigo with nystagmus that is brought on by head movement that goes longer then a minute ie you roll over in bed, the vertigo starts with the eye movement and then does not stop after 30s-1m (hold your head in that position) then I would highly suggest it is not BPPV.\n\nWhat tends to happen is that people roll over, the vertigo hits all of a sudden, you freak out, go back to the original position and the vertigo will slow down and stop until you move again. \n\nIf the poll is looking for answers on how long until BPPV resolves ie the crystals move out of the canal and vertigo with nystagmus stops from head movement, then you will have a range from 24 hours all the way to 6-12 months depending on treatment.\n\nLots of posts in this sub that details treatment options with a varying range of experiences including how to handle residual dizziness - highly recommend that if you are new to BPPV, spend the time reading the historic posts. Spot on! The reason I am asking is my ENT commented about the duration of my BPPV attack. I said it lasted 6 hours but in reality the aggressive vertigo did not last more then 10 minutes. But I had significant imbalance for 6 hours. Yes... Exactly this! You are right. I did not know if I was alone in that the first BPPV incident was much more significant then the BPPV brought on by positional changes like Epley or rolling in bed. The first time I vomited three times after the vertigo stopped and I was just dizzy. Being left dizzy / off balance / not quite right is \u201cnormal\u201d as BPPV completely destroys your brains understanding of the world around you with the false signals between your ears and eyes. \n\nIt is for this reason you need to resolve BPPV by doing exercises to move the crystal(s), followed by rehab exercises to retrain your vestibular / balance system. This is quite true to my experience, the onset of BBPV for me lasted for 2 weeks, attacks lasted anywhere from 30s-1min, then the residual effects remained and gradually subsided 2 weeks after. During the recovery period, i was still feeling quite light headed and light footed, had trouble finding and regaining my balance again and through my own experience I also found it was especially even harder to be grounded when my eyes were closed, my internal compass went haywire, and would easily get lost in the darkness and lose my balance (this took years for my brain to control).  \n\n\nThe whole ordeal lasted 1 month.", "Had bppv, self diagnosed, 20 hours later it is gone.

Did a fair bit of research on the internet and found the \u201cEpley manoeuvre\u201d May help. I essentially performed this on myself 3 times. After this I nearly puked up - and then promptly fell asleep/nearly passed out. Woke up a few hours later and it appears I am cured.

Yeah I threw up my first time but never even came close the next few occurrences. The exercises/maneuvers help a lot. Now when I get some spins, I just stay there and tough it out cause it will go away. Where are you with it all now? What is your history with this thing?\n\nI have been trying to sleep upright (finding it quite hard) - one of the times I accidentally moved my head a certain way and my head started spinning so I quickly moved it back. It is really utterly weird. I have cleared it whereby I do not feel it anymore if I move my head about - but if I move it (for example - to change my shoelaces) it will come back. So I would assume the crystal is at the bottom of my ear canal - and I need to try to keep it there until it disappears? Had my first one earlier this year. Very nauseous that morning and I threw up. Was in bed the rest of the day as well as most of the next. It faded away after a few days while doing some of the exercises. Since then i have had three or four occurrences but each weaker than the last. They all just feel like a few day migraine. But I have been using the help of the ole devil's lettuce to help take some of the edge off.\n\nBut now whenever I got spins, I just need to take a few seconds and I am able to power through. The last one was pretty crazy tho. I was on a high perch maybe 15-20 ft off the ground looking up to fix a light and it instantly just came flooding to my head.

(For this reason, I have been low key terrified that if I get covid I will just be in vertigo world for the whole run of it). \n\nHas anyone else noticed a correlation between BPPV and flu shots or viruses in general? I have noticed nothing like that. My bppv has never been related to a flu shot. That being said a quick google confirms ( I have never noticed a correlation to any vaccines I have received (and I get the flu vaccine yearly and have already received my 1st dose of the covid vaccine), but I have had bad flare ups with viral infections. I suspect it is that even if the virus is not attacking your ear specifically, your body's inflammatory response as it is fighting it off can cause changes in the inner ear that trigger BPPV symptoms. No, and it would not make any physiological sense. I second this opinion... inflammation can mimic BPPV My doc has discussed with me that vertigo can be caused by the viscosity of middle-ear fluids changing during immune reponses. I started getting it after HPV vaccine, directly after.", "Three months of hell, but is it BPPV? (I am sorry if this will get long, and for my english)\n\nSo first off my history with bppv if that will help clarify things. I first got bppv around summer last year (woke up with it), absolutely horrible experince. I went to the doctor and he said it sounded like bppv, so he told me i should see an ear doctor so he could do the epley maneuver. There where 2 months waiting time so I just searched youtube and did it myself, so i guess i did not really got confirmed 100% if it was that. but after about 2 weeks and doing the maneuver everday it was completely gone!\n\nNow a couple of months later i got it again on the same ear, did the maneuvers, and again gone after a couple of weeks. \n\nThen all hell broke loose at the end of last year, and it came with blasting force 300% worse than the other times on the other ear. I tried to do the maneuvers but it was so horrible i screamed and had to stop, and vomited the rest of the day everytime i moved my head an inch. I got really scared because it was so much worse than the other times, but i really did not dare to move so I did not see a doctor. after about a week or two it only came when my head where below my neck, so regular head movements where fine thank god. after about three-four weeks it was also gone.\n\nBut on the 5th of January i woke up in the middle of the night, heart pounding and room spinning again, and i could not sleep again because my whole body had some kind of anxiety attack from this and woke me up every time i was almost asleep. After this I have gotten anxiety about sleeping as it always happened when i moved from one side to the other in bed, and it feels like it is not completely gone, but it feels different than the other times because it only really happens when i lay down. During the day i just feel kind of off but not dizzy in the same way, and I have been sleeping on like 4 pillows and a neck pillow to not lay my head down and not move around (which i normally tend to do a lot). But a couple times a week it feel like my head is heavy, feels off, and making my heart pound and that shock through my body when i move the slightest while in bed. I am so scared of sleeping but I cannot tell that a specific ear is affected because it just feels like my whole head. And again it is really only when i am lying down, during the day it is just that small off feeling that I guess i have gotten used to know.\n\nBut it is now almost been three months with these symptoms and I am freaking out, does it sound like normal residual dizziness after the last really horrible episode of \"real\" bppv or does it sound like something else? You should see someone who has experience with BPPV, it sounds like maybe the crystal could have moved to a different canal which would explain the reaction to the Epley. If it is not in the same canal Epley will not help at all, just make you have really bad vertigo. I am not sure about the tingling, I did not have that at all but it could be anxiety? You are best bet is getting checked out by a doctor, there are other things that can cause vertigo besides BPPV. I am sorry you are having a rough time. It sounds like the BPPV was not resolved the first time and came back. \n\nEither in another canal or just got loose again. I recommend seeing someone who specializes in vestibular rehabilitation especially when it comes to doing the maneuvers and figuring out which canal and ear is affected. \n\nIn my experience, I tried to do them myself and just made it worse and ended up seeing a Physical Therapist who specializes in Vestibular rehabilitation. My residual dizziness lasted about a month but it gradually got better. \n\nI know it sucks but it will get better!\n\nBest of luck and I hope you feel better soon! xx Your story is very similar to mine.  And my first suggestion is to see a Vestibular Therapist (a physical therapist that specializes in dizziness).  Mine was a god send. I learned so much from her and she talked me off the ledge many times. You need to have all ear canals tested to see where the problem lies.  The nystagmus of your eyes needs to be watched, as the direction the eyes twitch indicates which ear canal the loose crystal is in (along with the direction they lay you back in the Dix Hallpike maneuver, which is the maneuver that tests which ear canal is affected).  The Epley is not going to work if you are treating the wrong ear canal.\n\nThe anxiety is so common. The residual dizziness, along with other accompanying dizziness before the crystal is back in place feeds off anxiety.  I too - was scared to sleep, and ended up being scared to do ANYTHING. Because I basically shut down my life for a few months, it caused this horrible secondary dizziness from not moving.  It was to the point where I could not escape the dizziness.  There was a positional dizziness. And also waves of dizziness as I sat still, and even when I shut my eyes.  I was SO sick!\n\nAnd as you mentioned, it takes forever to see specialists.  As I wanted to see an ear specialist, a neurologist, and even once my regular doc, as I needed something to help me get through my day.....I got more and more scared that this was something more serious than BPPV.\n\nAll these docs eventually assured me I was healthy as a horse, and my therapist (who has experience BPPV and the anxiety that goes with it), weekly reassured me to look for the tiny positive things as I healed.  I had many set backs, which provoked the anxiety again as well. It is a long process for some.  But I learned with my exercises to challenge the dizziness.  There are gaze instability exercises that helped a ton.  She told me to keep running, keep snowmobiling, and keep living.  Do not be scared of it! It is not life threatening.  But then again.....feeling so incredibly sick from day to day makes it hard to not be anxious.\n\nI had the Epley done to me 20 times before it worked.  Once a week I would have the therapist do it - and she would only do the maneuver twice in her office. Towards the end, I was able to do it mid week myself at home.  There was never an 'ah ha' moment where I KNEW the maneuver worked.  In fact, the last time she tested me with the Dix Hallpike, I was feeling super dizzy yet - but I tested negative.   So, now I am working through residual dizziness.  And it changes.  My body is readjusting to being balanced again.  It is been a month of being 'fixed' and I still have some days where my head feels swampy and floaty.  Some days when I move wrong, I get waves of dizziness.  I still cannot sleep on the 'bad' side as I get dizzy (but not the BAD vertigo dizzy - that is for sure gone).\n\nSorry my response is so long.  Hang in there.  Try to find someone that specializes in dizziness. And please try to not stress out.  Trust me - the anxiety feeds this monster. Thank you all! I started doing the brandt-daroff maneuver yesterday and I actually feel a sligt relief. I think I will try that 3x 5 times a day for two weeks and see if I will feel better. If not I will definitely call the doctor! It is nice to know I am not alone in this torment lol as others have suggested please please please go see an ent dr. i had bppv and after seeing an ent dr things have resolved. Well the thing is my country is kind of on lockdown so you can only call a doctor \ud83d\ude05 so i will have to wait to see one, but for now it is gone! And for the most part my anxiety too to help your anxiety a bit and if it is bppv and it comes back know that bppv is not considered a serious issue. just be sure to get it checked if it comes back.", "desperately seeking comfort - how long do your spells last? hey all!

I eventually was able to make it to an ENT who said my sinuses were VERY inflamed and did an audio test to apparently check for inner ear problems but that is about it.  They said even the inflammation should not cause it but the inflammation is chronic and will probably need to be eventually surgically removed. Presumably caused by allergies even though i scored low (1 or 2 on a 1-7 scale) on everything they tested for.  They referred me to a neurologist but it will be MONTHS before i can get seen.\n\nPlease tell me if my experiences sound familiar!!  I have a few triggers that i have noticed which are drive thrus, driving (or being in a car in general tbh), storms, and sometimes video games.  Which sucks because video games are such a big part of my life.  But other than that, sometimes they just come literally out of nowhere like a clap!  I will be completely fine and then suddenly my whole world is spinning and i have to crawl to bed as soon as possible.  Sometimes they last just 30 seconds, sometimes they last 3 hours.  My world is spinning, i cannot move my head, and i feel like i am on the verge of passing out!  All i can do is wait for it to pass.  My heart rate and blood pressure is always fine.  My anxiety DOES spike very high because of it but it is not the cause.  I am honestly at the end of my rope, it is so so so hard to live with.  I have trouble going to the grocery store with it, i feel hopeless.  I have no other symptoms when they happen.  \n\nYesterday i felt it coming a little bit, but managed to sleep.  However when i woke up this morning i literally could not walk and it felt worse than it ever has.  I was genuinely scared for my life.  I had my mother take me to the ER where they did a ct scan, ekg, and blood tests.  Sent me off with meclizine (which i still have not tried because i am scared of feeling drowsy and more dizzy) and a \u201cidk, could be bppv or your period\u201d and that was it.  I was discharged today roughly 10 hours ago and am still struggling :/ have yours ever lasted this long??  Does meclizine really help?  Does this sound like bppv?  Thanks all &lt;3 Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Bppv vertigo lasts anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or two. And is always triggered by head movements\u2026 I am no doctor but based on what you said it does not sound like bppv to me. \n\nHonestly do not waste your time or money at the ER anymore. Meclizine is just a bandaid. I would see if you can find a neuro-otologist. They are ENTs that specialize in the inner ear. They will prob have you run through a bunch of inner ear testing (called a VNG) to figure out root cause. \n\nWhen these dizzy spells happen to you, do you hear ringing in your ears (tinnitus), or do one or both of your ears feel clogged? Do you lose your hearing?\n\nIt could be vestibular migraines. You do not necessarily have to have the \u201cheadache\u201d portion of a migraine to have this condition. Again, I am no doctor but unfortunately have spent way too much time researching vestibular conditions, as my own issues have been going on for 25ish years. \n\nThere is a website called vestibular.org that goes really great into detail on vestibular conditions/symptoms/where to seek help etc. they even have a provider directory to help find someone to diagnose you. thanks for the reply!\n\nIn all fairness, it is triggered by head movement.  It is always when i am driving and turning my head to look whichever way when turning.  I cannot say for sure with gaming but I do have two monitors that I have to stop from looking between because it bothers my eyes a little bit when i have to turn my head back and forth.  I do not have any tinnitus or hearing loss, sometimes my ears feel a little full but honestly it is such a common thing with me with my sinuses that i am not sure it is even a difference during the spells.   I will definitely look for the neuro-otologist, thanks for the tip!\n\nI have looked into vestibular migraines too!  I am sure it is a possibility, I do have a long family history of migraines.  But I never get any other symptoms really and pain medicines do not touch it, i also did not really consider it since sometimes the hits only last for a few seconds - a minute on a good day.  I do feel as if i am almost constantly a little dizzy and off balance so i hate leaving the house unless i have to - which is the main reason i went to the ent in the first place.  There is still minor dizziness in between the episodes, even if i go nearly a month without one of the more intense claps that leave me scrambling for a place to lay so i do not have to move my head Do your eyes have a beating nystagmus when the vertigo happens? This has to occur for it to be BPPV i get it. i have dealt with something similar to you since i was 16, i am now 19. i feel like it is linked to a hormonal birth control i started, as i began having dizzy spells 2 days after starting it. \n\nthey happen about once a month for me, and can last up to 20 mins. no hearing loss, no fullness, just some buzzing noise in my ear in certain head positions. i have had the dix hallpike maneuver done by multiple doctors, no nystagmus. it only happens when i have a dizzy spell. seen an ent, they had no idea what it could be. it sucks. You should look into MS, vestibular neuritis and PPPD .. if you are not already, you should start VRT ! I hope this is of any help! I hope you feel better soon! I am a 23 F and I have had this for a bit over 1 year now. I am unable to work. I could not imagine getting this at 17.. praying for a recovery for you! Are you able to have someone who lives with you to treat you when it happens? You first have to make sure its vertigo (world is spinning) which I think you have.\n\nGet them to learn the Dix-Hallpike test to see if it is BBPV caused. If so, then the Epley Manuevre. If they are aware of these and your episodes last longer than a few seconds, you should be able to minimise the damage it takes on your life. Have you looked into vestibular migraine? You do not necessarily have to have a family history or even have traditional migraines in order for it to be one. It can also be a neck issue as well since you mentioned that head movement causes symptoms.", "What to expect next? First vertigo experience Experienced my first ever vertigo today. Woke up and turned to my side and the whole world spun for few seconds. Broke into cold sweat. After two episodes of just crazy spinning, decided to go to ER. ER doc performed epley repositioning and that did not help at all. So they brought in PT who seemed more experienced and figured out my right side had a pretty bad one and minor one on the left. My left side vertigo disappeared pretty easily. after couple more of repositioning on the right side helped as well. I was wondering if the community here can alert me on what to expect next. I am feeling much better, although a little light headed and I am trying not to move my head as much today. Will this bppv be a recurring issue for me or will it be gone for good. I had almost **exactly** the same situation with my first episode. The only difference was the ER doc did not try anything himself.\n\nSo sorry that this happened to you but it is fantastic that you got into a PT right away (the Drs are not as good with it in general) and that you were able to get this episode knocked out. It is crazy how the Epley can get you from \"my life will never be the same\" to \"I am a little light headed\" in just a few minutes. \n\nThe next steps are to take it easy for a several days: be deliberate in your movements and no fast motions of your head, do not turn your head upside down, you may want to sleep propped up. Stay hydrated (which is important in general) and there may be a connection to low Vitamin D so consider taking a supplement.\n\nNow for the bad news: it will almost certainly happen again and there is no predicting when. It could be days or months but probably not years. Accordingly, you need to prepare by having a PT you can see at the drop of a hat and learning how to do the Epley and related ( yourself or with a friend. Aw man \ud83d\ude1e but thank you so much for your response with the suggestions. I will definitely go pick up vit D supplements. Anything to keep that terrible thing at bay. It is good you caught it quickly and got professional help! I am thinking (and hoping) that since you caught it so soon, you will not have much residual dizziness.  After a few days of taking it easy - you should be able to resume normal activities. This info is from my vestibular therapist....and exercises she gave me.  Challenging any residual dizziness is GOOD in helping your system get back in sync. If you turn your head to the left and it gives a mild wave of dizziness, do it 15 more times.  Do this up to 3 times a day.\n\nAs I spent over 2 months trying to resolve my vertigo, I kept my head as level and as still as possible. This created a secondary dizziness, called gaze instability. So I had another monster to deal with.  So, keep as active as tolerated - so this does not happen to you.\n\nSadly - BPPV is likely to hit you again. I have had 4 episodes in the past 3 years. The first 3 I did not seek professional therapy and let them resolve on their own.  I have high hopes that this last time, with education and therapy - it will stay away longer. Or at least I will have the tools to treat it right away so it does not get so bad.\n\nBest wishes! Keep us posted as to your progress! Thank you for the suggestions \ud83d\ude0a i think my residual dizziness lasted a day. I still feel a little slow and do feel little woozy when I sleep on my right. Otherwise all good.", "Semont maneuver questions Hi. My bppv  has gotten worse lately. To the point where I feel off when I am walking and sitting.  I did the Semont maneuver  One time yesterday. If I did it right, should not I feel a little bit better today?   I feel just as bad. I do not know if I should attempt it again and again?\n\nI do have an appointment with the physical therapist, but it is not soon enough. I need some relief right now.", "BPPV &amp; TMJ I had my first round of BPPV about 3 years ago.  It was resolved quickly with the Epley Maneuver, I had another bout of it about a year later and Epley worked quickly that time too.  Then on Halloween morning 2019 I woke up feeling weird.  I felt really lightheaded, I was not spinning but I just had this strange dizzy feeling in my head.  I laid down and put my head to the side to see if it was BPPV and sure enough the room started spinning, when the feeling passed I continued the steps of the Epley by moving my head to the right and that is when I felt the most intense vertigo I had ever experienced, everything felt like it was spinning not just the room but I felt like my body was spinning.  It only lasted for a minute in 2 but it was terrifying. I went to see a physical therapist to have her do the Epley for me.  While performing the Epley she could not see any movement in my eyes and said she was not so sure it was BPPV.  I got no relief from that Epley, I saw her the next day and it was the same and again got no relief from the next Epley.  She referred me to a more high tech PT, they insisted it was just BPPV, did another Epley (again it did not work) and sent me on my way. For months I was barely able to function.  I knew something was different this time and it could not just be BPPV because it felt so different.  I also developed bad Tinnitus that made sleeping really difficult.  After Googling obsessively I started down a path of learning about trigger points and found if you have certain trigger points then that can cause vertigo.  After finding the trigger points in my jaw and working on them I found that weird feeling in my head that I had had constantly for months would go away for a bit.  I got a strong feeling my jaw was the problem.  I started seeing a chiropractor and after each adjustment I would feel better and better.  She felt my jaw was causing my issue as well.  I had so much inflammation in my jaw.  It was way out of alignment on my left and my right side was overcompensating for it.  This made sense to me since when I would turn my head to the righ that is when I would have severe vertigo.  After months of working with the chiropractor I still could not lay down and turn my head to either side without getting dizzy but I was able to function a lot better during the day because the icky feeling in my head was almost completely gone.  Then COVID hit and everything got shut down here.  I had to go a couple months without seeing the chiropractor and I started feeling terrible again.  That is when I decided I needed to see a specialist for my jaw.  I saw a TMJ specialist who told me I had a bad overbite.  I already knew this but I was surprised to learn how a bite misalignment causes TMJ and can also cause issues with the inner ear.  He said I could use an orthotic however that would only be a temporary fix as it would not permanently fix my bite.  It would only work when I was wearing it.  The permanent fix would be braces.  So off I went to an orthodontist.  After a consultation we decided Invisalign would be best for me.  I am now on week 6 of wearing Invisalign and I can already feel a huge difference in my jaw, I have way less pain and when I am wearing the aligners  my head feels so much better.  I also noticed my neck and shoulder pain that I have had for years has almost completely disappeared.  I do not know if I still get dizzy when I lay down and turn my head to the side because I am terrified to try it.  I just hate that feeling so much and I am afraid I might get discouraged to continue with my Invisalign.  I am going to wait until I have completed my Invisalign process which is 25 weeks of wearing aligners.  I guess I can update then and let you know if it took the BPPV symptoms away completely.\n\nI know this is a crazy long post but I wanted to share my story because I know I was searching constantly to find advice on how to resolve my vertigo.  Doctors were zero help for me as they do not think outside the box.  If you are having issues with vertigo you may want to get your jaw checked.  I did not feel like I had noticable jaw pain before this.  My jaw would pop pretty bad when I opened my mouth wide but that is the only time it would really hurt.  It was not until I found the jaw trigger points and pushed on them that I felt terrible pain that would make my eyes water.  Until I figured this all out I was losing hope.  I felt so miserable and alone.  I have a young daughter and she is the only reason I still got out of bed each day.  No one should have to feel like they have to just live with feeling terrible and that they will never get better.  Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions about what I have been through.  I really want to help others who may be struggling with this. Thank you for posting.  I have been in a similar boat and am on a similar path (TMJ, neck and their trigger points) causing a lot of the issues.\n\nVery happy to hear you are finding a way out of that frustrating situation, and believe me when I say I understand how it feels, and sharing! :)\n\nI feel this post would be helpful to the folks on /r/StopSpinning too. There is much confusion and overlap between these two subreddits. Wow thank you for sharing. This is so interesting as I have had bppv for almost a year &amp; trying to figure it all out have been exhausting and expensive. I figured it was inflammation and vitamin d deficiency was a big factor. I also have hearing loss and tinnitus, sensitive hearing, along with the occasional spins. The tmj link makes a lot of sense. I have always had a cobra jaw that dislocates and when stressed, pain goes right to my jaw on both sides. I have learned the pressure points as well. I have also been using a shiatsu back massager with heat on my neck and my gut tells me that is helping too. It is all interconnected. Make sure your taking 5000iu/d of Vitamin D3 and keep up the good work! Keep us posted! I also suffered from Tmj wich turned into vertigo/balance issues and then the headaches and the neck and shoulder pain. It sounds so Similar and I have tried so many things. But your saying this invasligjn treatment really fixed a lot of your problems and you are now not dizzy during the day? I cannot even drive right now :/ I have tmj, too. I can pop my jaw like knuckles even. Good info, my dentist has been trying we will me invisalign anyways I am on week 7 now of my Invisalign and I really feel like it is helping. I notice when I do not have my trays in that I immediately get that spacey feeling in my head. When I have them in that feeling goes away. I occasionally still get a dizzy spell but it is not as frequent as it was before I got Invisalign. Have you ever seen a chiropractor for your TMJ? The chiropractic adjustments really helped me with the vertigo and that is what made me think the issue was related to my jaw. I have seen Chiros but What kind of adjustment did they do for your tmj ? I am going on anti depressants soon for this :/ I do see a chiro who also does dry needling but he is never adjusted my jaw before and I had an x ray and my jaw was not like misaligned they said but idk what could have caused all this My chiropractor works on my trigger points in my jaw by sticking her finger in my mouth between my cheek and teeth and pushing on the points. It is so painful it makes my eyes water. Then she pushes on the outside of my cheeks, right over the jaw and has me open and close my mouth. I have a lot of inflammation so I do ice my jaw at night to help calm it down.  \n\nI was so depressed before I started all this work on my jaw. I have a young daughter and I was so miserable from the vertigo that I was struggling to take care of her. I was missing a ton of work too. I was scared to leave the house. After my first appointment with the chiropractor I did feel a little better. I started seeing her twice a week in the beginning. After about a month I only saw her once a week and now I see her once a month. I found that the adjustments were making me feel better longer. Hmmm my old chiropractor use to do the finger presses back there but as time went on it felt more like a neck problem than a jaw problem but idk. Did you ever get mris before? They said my disc is fine in the joint so idk why my jaw is sore but I can see about asking my current chiro about those trigger points. He would probably do needles to the outside of it I do not know if it is as effective as the inside treatment. But I can always go back to the old one if needed I have not had an mri for it. I did have X-rays done when I saw the TMJ specialist and I do not remember everything he told me about them but I do remember when we looked at the left jaw the bones were worn down from them grinding against each other. He could also see that my overbite was really bad and my bottom jaw was sitting to far back and he believed that could be part of my ear issues. \n\nAnother thing I have had done a couple times are miofascial (not sure how to spell it) massages. I had that done on my neck and shoulders and I feel like it helped me too. Hmmm well I am defiantly going to ask my chiro about some of these tmj trigger points. But this has also reminded me of where all my problems started was with my jaw. Thank you for that! I have a lot of whole body symptoms like pain everywhere else and fatigue and nausea I thought I was maybe devolving fibromylgia. But I will def ask for the adjustment to see if it calms down my headaches and diZzyness a little. I REMEBER he adjusted my T1 Wich is right below your neck and I felt Amazing for a good 4 days I forgot to mention my chiropractor adjusts my neck too but she does not \u201ccrack\u201d it because I am terrified that would make me spin so she uses this thing that taps against my joints. I am sorry I have no idea what the technical term for it is. \n\nAnother thing that really makes me think my jaw is my issue is that I get dizzy when I talk too much or I eat something really chewy. \n\nI hope you can get some relief soon. Oh yeah when I chew a lot my neck hurts like hell \ud83d\ude02 I do not get the visual spins but more like I get the feeling of motion", "Anyone else get dizzy after being on their phone or focusing on something for too long? Sometimes I get carried away on my phone and I am so focused on it that I catch myself and it feels like I was about to fall over because I got dizzy. I try not to be on my phone for too long in one sitting due to this. \n\nAnyone else have experience with this? \n\nAlso does vertigo trigger anxiety for anyone? It definitely makes me panic and assume the worst when it starts to happen I do not find I get dizzy when focusing on something for too long, but definitely with the phone. I think for me it is that with time my head starts hang a bit when I am using my phone.\n\nI feel you on the anxiety too. It is terrifying that first moment of violent dizziness. I am relatively new to having vertigo symptoms but it is truly awful. Just happened to me about 1hr ago and I found this thread. I have had this before and decided it was most likely BPPV which fits basically perfectly - it is not serious. Been a few months and got it again at my desk today whilst staring at my phone after like 4 hours of web design. I still think it is BPPV but still get really anxious. I am 27, BPPV is fairly rare in younger people but still happens and who knows, maybe staring at screens, etc, is a risk factor.", "Is this BPPV? So this has been a problem for the last three days especially, worse than ever, but I have had this off and on since I gave birth to my first child (I am 33/F if that makes any difference). \n\nBasically, any time I look over either shoulder (my right especially) or move my eyes too quickly, I feel this fuzziness/dissociation, almost as if I am about to faint. I am not sure if I can call it vertigo, as it is not a spinning sensation. It is just this jarring, sudden feeling as if someone filled my brain up with cotton that lasts for a few seconds. Like I said I used to have this off and on a few years ago, but these last few days it is been so bad that I do not even like moving.\n\nDoes this sound about right, or am I barking up the wrong tree here? I am taking some allergy meds to see if it is just fluid in my ears or something, but if I should be seeing a doctor instead I would want to set that up. I had that same sensation on and off for at least a year before I had a real BPPV episode. Vertigo would be be spinning, yes. I had many occasions, sometimes when at my laptop at the table, I would feel like a sudden WHOOSH and grab hold of the table and it would be gone. Once it happened when I was out walking with my little boy and I had to sit on the grass for a minute because I was afraid I was going to faint or fall. I chalked it up to anxiety, but it may have been allergies or some random shit in my ear canal. I had true BPPV in March so I know the difference now. You could try the Epley maneuver on yourself to see if you can clear it up, if it is loose crystals. Or the somersault. Google those and give it a try. Also--sudafed. I took that on a couple of especially bad days after the BPPV episode and it really seemed to make a difference. You can also trying holding your nose and blowing out your ears. These are all things I have done with some success. Good looking out. I already tried some Zyrtec but I will try drying it out up there, too, and see if that works. It sounds like you think it is just fluid, which is good, so I will try seeing if something to dry it up does not work. Thanks for filling me in; I was not sure what to even call this! Well, I do not know what it is, I just know what I did when I had similar symptoms. Do the somersault maneuver too. It is easy and if you have loose crystals it will reposition them. I will look into that! Thanks so much for the suggestions. :) Hi there. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is. Because i have these sensations as well and i had vertigo too (not necessarily BPPV). Somehow i fell my vertigo is linked to this sensations because often i had the fuzziness before an vertigo. now i just get the fuzziness sometimes but not the vertigo.   \nSee if it not related to a cold/virus or spine problem (maybe sitting to much in the bad/at the desk). For me, i think it is related more to my spine (the vertigo attacks) than to actual bppv.", "Is it BPPV? Or something big else? Hello, about 5 weeks ago I began feeling dizzy, I then rang my doctor who told me that it sounded like benign vertigo. I realised that at when u turn my head to the right I would get dizzy and feel like I was going to black out. Anyway, a few days later I went to hospital because I was suffering from really bad headaches. Doctor at A&amp;E told me it was BPPV on my right side and my headaches were anxiety tension headaches. About 1 week later (10-11 days) it just went. I had no symptoms for about 12 days until suddenly it started again. But this time I feel dizzy randomly. Sometimes when I move my head in any direction I will feel dizzy, and when I lay down at night it feels like the room is spinning like crazy. I have also had really bad headaches/migraines and my ears are aching me, especially my righty ear. They are super sensitive to sound.\n\n\n\nLast night I went to the hospital again and the doctor told me it sounds like peripheral vertigo and has now put in a referral to see a ENT specialist. My anxiety is over the roof because I cannot stop thinking I have a tumour or something. Has anyone had a similar experience, and if so what was your outcome? Hard to say, but it does sound like BPPV.  I was also worried about tumors, but mine was BPPV and was cured by doing the Epley maneuver. It was nearly 2 years ago and I have had no relapses so far. But I can certainly understand your anxiety. The vertigo is nasty. But maybe the other symptoms you are feeling (headache, ears ringing) may be related to the anxiety.\n\nYou really need to go to a balance center and see someone specialized in Vestibular disorders. Google \"balance center\" and the name of your closest metropoliltan area. Thanks for the reply, the doctor at A and E has put in a referral for me to see an ENT specialist to my GP Anxiety will amplify your symptoms so try to practice some mindfulness around this issue \u2014 very unlikely a tumour! Get lots of rest and take care of yourself and try not to panic too much, it will not be forever Thank you \ud83d\ude0a, I found myself to be a lot calmer after browsing this sub and reading 100s of peoples own experiences. Many of theirs seem similar to mine, and they are still kicking and breathing Not all ENTs have a lot of experience with BPPV. The first ENT I went to was honest enough to admit that he was not the best guy to treat my BPPV. He suggested I come back and see his collegue. She had worked in a vestibular center for a year and knew exactly how to treat it. It was gone by the end of the day and has not returned. Not all ENTs will be so honest with you. Make sure the person you go to see is SPECIALIZED in vestibular disorders or this may not go away so easily. Hi love, Sounds very similar to my episode I had last year. I had a migraine for what feels like a month straight during my active BPPV. I think it was just mental exhaustion from the stress and nausea from the vertigo. \nI got treated for BPPV by a physical therapist that specializes in vestibular rehabilitation. \nIt completely cleared up and I have not had any more issues since. (8months)\n\nI did have residual dizziness for a couple months after treatment but it was just a general off feeling. I no longer had vertigo like room spinning sensations since doing the Epley Maneuver with a physical therapist. \n\nENTS never helped me besides ruling out other disorders like M\u00e9ni\u00e8res, Vestibular Neuritis, etc....\nA physical therapist helped me in one session. Look into finding a balance center or dizzy clinic. \n\nI hope you feel better soon! xx What I thought was Bppv turned out to be labyrinthitis. I got diagnosed yesterday and have been put on antibiotics. I feel better already. Do not sweat it. Panic gets you nowhere. Did you ever have a fluid in your ear? I suspect it may be labyrinthitis (among other things) but I have not had any fluid in my ears. I did notice my right ear crack a bit and had a sinking sensation in my rig he ear when I went to lay down earlier on my left side Thanks for the reply, I just hope my referral gets done swiftly and I get a decent doctor. The tension headaches from this whole ordeal is horrible I am sorry. They suck. Have you tried an ice pack on the back of your neck? That helped me a lot. Also massaging my neck. It relaxed those muscles enough to relieve some pressure. I did not have fluid in my ears. I mainly had vertigo, dizziness, some nausea and my left ear was blocked with and my hearing was muffled. I also had some earaches. Il give it a try today, thank you \ud83d\ude0a Pretty much the same as me then apart from a blocked ear. Thanks for the info, I appreciate it hi I have the same, i have a feeling it is connected in some way to diet have you found this? I have not been able to make a correlation, but I even get toothaches when my ears hurt", "This cured my BPPV in minutes, Half Somersault Maneuver!  Did you have derealization/dissociation with your bppv ? One time, and it was because I was very careless post-maneuver.\n\nI follow this (( post-maneuver now: \n\n1. Wait for 10 minutes after the maneuver is performed to avoid \"quick spins\".\n \n2. Sleep semi-recumbent for one night. This means sleep with your head halfway between being flat and upright (a 45 degree angle).\n \n3. During the day, try to keep your head vertical. \n \n4. For at least one week, avoid provoking head positions that might bring BPPV on again: Use two pillows when you sleep, avoid sleeping on the \"bad\" side, do not turn your head far up or far down.\n\n5. Be careful to avoid the head-extended position, in which you are lying on your back, especially with your head turned toward the affected side. Did doing the Half Somersault provoke the brief vertigo/nystagmus like the Epley does?  I did the Half Somersault a ton during treatment (along with the Epley), because it did not provoke the horrible symptoms like the Epley does. But then I questioned whether or not it was working.  But studies show that the Half Somersault typically does NOT provoke the symptoms, but it will still work.  To this day - I am not exactly sure WHICH maneuver fixed my BPPV - but I am trying to plan ahead for the next episode! Can you elaborate on this? Reason I ask is, I have been having some serious issues with this round of BPPV. I just thought it was my heightened anxiety but I feel so disconnected with reality lately I have been feeling dizzy and dissociated from reality as well and derealization and everything feels weird and i dont know what to do with it really To me, yes, doing the half somersault did provoke nystagmus but it was ever so slightly that I did not even notice it at all. \n\nRegarding if half somersault works or not, it does but after a few weeks it was not working anymore for me (I do not know if our body adopts the maneuver or just the particles collected in the fluid filled inner ear were not flowing, but when performed Epley maneuver, I was back to normal the very next morning. \n\nSo basically, if the BPPV will come back (I hope not) I will perform Epley Maneuver first and then follow the post-maneuver precautions as I have ( Thank you for the additional info! I can relate to this...", "If Epley made things a little worse, does that actually confirm BPPV? So about 10 days ago I started to experience mild BPPV symptoms.

It comes and goes but does not seem to be getting any better. \n\nThe last few nights I have woken up slightly after falling asleep completely disoriented and in a panic. Its like my whole body is buzzing and it takes me about 20 min to calm down and reset. This ONLY seems to happen when I sleep in my right side. Strange.\n\nAnyway, this morning I tried the Epley and it seems to have aggravated things. When I looked the one direction my eyes would not focus at all but when I looked the other way they were fine. I am guessing that all but confirms BPPV but curious to hear what others think.\n\nI do have an appt with an ENT Tuesday so hopefully I can get some relief. I am trying to remind myself how lucky I am that this is fairly moderate but man if it does not suck\n\nThanks. The Dix-Hallpike, which is the first position of the Epley, is diagnostic for BPPV. Sometimes when people try the Epley at home, it just makes it worse. I know that was the case for me. Once I saw a vestibular therapist, I felt much better. Good luck!", "Is this vertigo? Hey everyone, 21 M here. I have had the following symptoms with varying severity:\n-Constant Dizziness, feel like the room is spinning ever so slightly \n\n-Severe dizziness lasting seconds, sometimes randomly or when standing up\n\n-Constant head heaviness/discomfort, feels like head is too heavy for neck\n\n-Occasional tinnitus in right ear\n\n-Right ear feels full \n\n-No nausea\n\nI also have a eustachian tube disorder in my right ear where it does not close properly at times. These symptoms have been so bad for the past few weeks and I am seeing a doctor on monday but I wanted to know if these were similar to what other people felt. It might be vertigo but it does not really sound like BPPV. BPPV is a positional vertigo, the room spinning happens when you have your head in certain positions, typically it is when you look straight up or down, or when you roll to one side in bed. Hope you get some answers on Monday. In the meantime otc meclizine might help you feel better but do not take it for 12 hours before your appointment because it can disguise some symptoms of vertigo. Good luck! Right here. 30 f. \nMy left Eustachian tube is jacked up. \nAnd from my understanding it can become inflamed and inflamed your middle ear and cause all of this crap. ENTs are a pain to try to get help for this too. They just want to hand you Flonase and send you off to therapy. So be firm to the doctors. \n\nI have all of your symptoms except switch out full ear to painful ear, and constant dizziness to constant on a boat feeling and weird visual crap for almost 4 months now. Hiya!\nI had BPPV last year which was positional vertigo. Usually when laying down, rolling over or looking up and down. Last week I started getting the ear fullness and tinnitus again but no vertigo and my ent said it was a TMJ flair up. All the muscles getting tight and inflamed can cause the ear fullness and tinnitus. I was also getting the lightheadedness too. Taking anti inflammatory helped  relieve it. Now, most symptoms are all gone. Still have some tightness and fullness but it is going away. \n\nI had the same symptoms with my BPPV episode last year, but the BPPV caused me to stress out and flair up the TMJ. \n\nMb talk to your doctor about TMJ. :)", "Hi, Is there a specific type of physical therapist ya\u2019ll see? \ud83d\ude43 And does it only work if you are having full blown attacks or does it work when it is been latent/mild for a while (although it can come back full blown any day) thank you -wobbly ", "Afraid to do the maneuvers myself, not sure which canal is affected Hi everyone!\n\nI am 25 yo female. I got my first vertigo attack 3 days ago. I was sleeping on my right side, and suddenly in my sleep I felt like spinning, then I opened my eyes and the room was spinning so fast. I went to ER, the doctor said I got BPPV and told me to go to ENT. After that I did some research about BPPV. I tried to do half somersault maneuver, but the moment I put my head upside-down it was spinning so hard and my body fell to the right immediately. It was so horrible that I decided to not do anything before going to ENT.\n\nSo yesterday I went to ENT. The doctor examined my eyes with goggles, that time when he turned my head 45\u00b0 to the right there was no nystagmus, but when turned to the left there was a bit of nystagmus and I felt dizzy a bit. So he said the problem is in my left ear. He told me to do maneuver like in the photo (sorry it is in Japanese) at home everyday.\n\nActually after going to ENT I was not really dizzy. Then before sleep last night I tried to do the maneuver. When doing sitting-lying down and facing downward-upward position I did not feel any dizziness, when lying on my left side I felt a bit dizzy but it went away within 5 seconds. The problem is when I lied on my right side, everything started spinning hard. I could not maintain the position and my body just fell on my back. After I calmed down, I did Dix-Hallpike test to make sure but I did not feel dizzy on both sides. Then I lied on my back without pillow and turned my head 90\u00b0 to the right, and the spinning started again. I got the after effect dizziness again even until now.\n\nI wonder which ear and which canal is actually affected. I want to do the maneuver but I am so afraid of the spinning feeling and worried it might get worse. I will go back to my home country in about 1 month so I want to resolve this faster, but I cannot find BPPV therapist here. I am thinking to just wait it out, but I am worried what might happen if I board a plane with this BPPV.  I need advice. Anyone here ever waited the vertigo to resolve itself? How long did it take?\n\n\\*sorry if my English is bad\n\n*Processing img mm9wul9a4sh61...* Sorry to hear about your troubles. I am in the same boat, my vertigo just started less than a week ago. I saw a physiotherapist and will see a specialist next.\n\nHas the specialist told you what type of BPPV you have? \n\nDepending on that, different maneuvers can be done. Apart from the Foster half somersault, the rest are done lying down. Most people have the posterior canal affected, requiring the Epley maneuver. Thank you so much. I have an appointment with the ENT again next week. Last time he seemed just trying to look for nystagmus but did not analyze the eye movement, so I doubt whether he can read the movement. Even the maneuver guide I got is not specific for which canal. But I hope he will analyze that next week or recommend me to a vertigo specialist. Sorry, by eye movement I meant nystagmus. It varies in direction and that can tell a vertigo specialist which canal is affected.\n\nThis article here describes 90 degree roll test for horizontal BPPV: \n\nHas your doc done this one? Ohh sorry I meant that too, it seems he did not analyze the nystagmus direction. And he did not do the 90 degree roll test. I would not recommend the at-home maneuvers. I dislodged the crystals in my ear when I tried them and had to go back to my specialist to get on the epley maneuver chair. \n\nSeek help from a specialist and try to get a visit when you notice your vertigo gets severe. \n\nAlso to keep your crystals in place, practice keeping your head upright when bending over to pick something up, keep your head upright when sleeping by keeping pillows behind your back, and pillows at your sides so you do not roll over. Do not tilt your head to the sides either. \n\nIf you practice that for a while your crystals will hopefully settle down and you can go back to sleeping how you like. Thank you! Thank you! I have same problem trying to diagnose which ear and which canal. So to diagnose, I generally do various exercises (Epley / half somersault etc.) on both sides. And when I find which side makes me spin, I know that is the ear that is affected. I then complete whatever manoeuvre I am doing, then wait 15 minutes. Try and keep head still in this time. Then do manoeuvre again. Wait 15 minutes with head still. Then do manoeuvre again. Then repeat again etc. etc. After each time the dizziness usually gets less and less. The most difficult part for me is working up the courage to do the manoeuvre. The spinning sensation is horrible, but I guarantee that after 30 - 90 seconds, it stops, as you have moved the debris in your ear canal from 1 position to another. That is what you have to do to feel better. the spinning feeling was necessary for me during the half somersault.  I think it is a sign that the crystals are moving. If you can handle the spinning temporarily you can get through this.", "Suffering with vertigo attacks for years I am 17 years old and I am in the UK, I have suffered from random vertigo attacks my whole life but my last one was 3 years ago when I went to the doctors and they said it was only down to migraines and give me sumatriptan, which never worked. 2/3 days ago my attacks have started again and they are the worst they have ever been. I have sweat all over my body, my heart beats really fast and the only way I can describe the vertigo is when you get that horrible ache after pins and needles but it goes from my head and into my stomach. I have never been sick with it until now and I have to keep my head into a certain position, I am really suffering with it. Can anyone give me any advice whether I go back to the doctors and request to actually get checked over or? Anything would help at this point", "What does the future hold? So; my first bout of BPPV started about 12 or 13 years ago. I am 34 years old male. At first it came every few months or so. As of the past maybe 5 years it has been once a month for me. I noticed that as of the past couple years it seems to be triggered by me moving my head around (like bobbing it to music, or jumping, etc). So my question is....when I am 70 will I be guaranteed to fall and break my hip or die because of BPPV? Is it even possible after this long for it to get better? It is such a darn nuisance in my life and I get so annoyed by it (especially when it is really bad). Have you always let it just resolve on it is own?  Or have you gone and seen a specialist and had treatment/therapy? I am just curious, as my first 3 episodes I just let them resolve on their own. This last time, I saw a specialist and did the Epley to completely resolve BPPV and also had many exercises to do.  This time, I am hoping that it never comes back....But time will tell.  I am curious as to what others have to say - and how many have completely resolved BPPV and never had it return. Because yes, it is going to suck if this keeps returning the rest of my life! Every doctor I went to kind of brushed it off. I have been to 3 ENTs in different hospitals. I do some exercises I found on medical websites and they help mitigate it some, but they still come back next month. That is basically what I found with my first 3 episodes - the docs brushed it off.  But this last time, the vertigo really got bad and I started to worry it was something else. My regular doc had the day off, saw someone else, and she referred me to a vestibular therapist (also scheduled me to see a neurologist and ENT).  The vestibular therapist was a god send.  Truly. She specializes in dizziness.  She did a ton of tests - many to rule out more serious stuff. And at that initial appointment, I was so scared to have her do the Dix Hallpike/Epley because I knew it would provoke the vertigo.....she put it off until the next week.  Little by little she eased my anxiety and taught me SO much about BPPV. I would do the Epley with her once a week (two times in her office each week), then eventually would do it on my own mid week, as it was taking so long to clear.  She also gave me vestibular/balance exercises to re-train my balance system.  Even the ENT and neurologist did not provide a whole lot of help with BPPV, but assisted in ruling out anything more serious.\n\nI am hoping this time, because I KNOW it is gone, and know better how to manage it - that it will stay away. I am doubtful - but at least I know how to manage it.\n\nWhen you do your exercises, do you know the BPPV is cleared (crystal back in place) at one point by testing it with the Dix Hallpike? I know after my crystal was cleared, I still felt horrible and would continue to test.  Having a negative Dix Hallpike eased my anxiety, and I just continued with the vestibular excercises to get rid of the residual dizziness. That residual crap is horrible!\n\nMy hope for everyone that has BPPV is to find a good therapist that can truly help. I am sad that yours has been so persistent and keeps returning. Ugh. Not fun. I never tested with any maneuver. I sat up and laid with head to side and looked up for about a minute and did it to the other side. Did this until I felt better. The only test I do after maneuvers is to see if I feel dizzy. I never did Dix-Halpike, because the sites I saw warned not to do it without professional guidance. I would find a balance center or someone who specializes in vestibular rehabilitation like a Physical Therapist. At least someone who can diagnose the BPPV properly with goggles. They can then find the ear and canal that has the loose crystals. \n\nIn my experience, I tried to let it resolve on its own and it never did. Once I got it properly taken care of I immediately felt better and the residual dizziness went away after a couple months. It is been almost 8 months and Ive been back to normal for most of it. I still get a dizzy spell here and there or I guess it is more of a light headed feeling when flip my head upside down to fast but I think that is normal - blood flow rushing toward the head or out of very fast. \n\nThe only thing that I still cannot do is sleep on my sides. Idk. I think I developed PTSD or something and I get super bad anxiety and taught myself to sleep on my back. \n\nI am interested in hearing what others have to say, but I would definitely get checked out by someone else. I saw 2 ENTS and they did not do anything for me. Like...literally nothing. One gave me a print out of how to do the Epley on my own. Apparently it was not in his schedule to show me how or work it with me to make sure it worked. As you may know, the Epley may not be the exercise you need to do if another canal is affected. Some find the somersault or barrel ones more effective. \n\nI hope you find relief bc having a flare up every month sound awful love. Good luck! xx After all this stuff going on in the world right now I am going to go to a balance center or a specialist in BPPV like you said. The most I got from ENT is a Meclizine prescription and told to do Epley on my own. The Epley (kind of) helps, but ultimately I have to let it pass on its own. They never had goggles or anything like that to tell where and what is the stone causing it. That sounds like a good plan!\nYeah, the prescriptions only helped with the nausea that came with the vertigo. Other than that, it did not really help much. \n\nI would find a place that uses the goggles (Electronystagmography). It looks for the characteristic nystagmus (jumping of the eyes) induced by the Dix-Hallpike test. \n\nThe otoliths can be in posterior or anterior canals. (The tubes lol) \nHere is a website that I like that covers a lot of info, I am sure you have researched all this but it explains it a bit more better than I can lol \n\n As the other posters noted, go to a balance center. Also, try to get ahead of it - understand the root cause. I remember reading a paper about what makes you more predisposed to an episode: being a female (ok, not your case), vit D deficiency, hyperglycaemia and high blood pressure (which leads to high intracranial blood pressure), dehydration, prolonged inflammation due to ENT problems.\n\nHope this helps! I do have Eustachian Tube issues and I do have Vitamin D deficiency. That is interesting that you have never done the Dix Hallpike, because if you have done the Epley maneuver, the Dix Hallpike is essentially the first step to it (laying back with your head turned to the side). So you have done it. Strange that you found info warning you to not do it alone. Perhaps because it will trigger the vertigo of it truly is BPPV? I do not know. I hope you can find a specialist that can give you some help &amp; answers. Ah. I guess I did it. What is the soment or barrel ones? \n\nI guess they are others or called something different.  I have seem people talk about a log/barrel one. I will try to find a link for that. But above is 4 exercises including the Epley. I would not do them on my own, I never had luck doing so. A PT should know how and can teach you the others. I have read many of your posts here and really value what you have to say about your BPPV. Do you have a resource for information on vestibular exercises that you would recommend? As soon as the pandemic subsides (if it does), I intend to find a specialist to speak to and my plan is to mention some of the things you have shared. Thank you by the way. /u/PurposefulTraveller Thank you for your kind words! I am glad my posts have helped you!  I do not really have a good resource for vestibular exercises. There is a lot of good info out there if you google it. But then again, the exercises need to be tailored to your individual situation.  Some of the basics were/are just a series of moving your head back and forth, up and down.  First while being still (head looking up then down, up then down 15 times). You can slowly increase the speed of this after a few days if the dizziness is subsiding.  Do these 3 times a day. Also - do it looking left and right....back and forth.  15 times, 3 times a day.  Eventually do them while walking. Then start looking diagonally up and down. You are basically challenging your balance system and trying to retrain it.  For me - these exercises got more complex weekly with me running, and even walking/running backwards.  There are tons of other exercises too - and mainly, I am such an active person, that I was doing a lot of the same things just by my daily activities.  (Stacking wood, snowmobiling, running, painting, riding horse - it is all about getting back moving)  Because I developed a gaze instability that caused severe dizziness, I had many other exercises with me focusing on a single point and moving my head.  You can google that as well. But if you do not have gaze instability going on - these would not help you. I also had 'busy' You Tube videos to watch with crazy busy things going on that would make the average person want to puke!  I hope you are able to get into see a specialist soon!  A GOOD specialist is worth their weight in gold. Thank you so much. I am sorry you have had to go through this. Sounds worse than my particular case. You are a real trooper!", "BBPV from chiropractic neck adjustment? Hi all. \n\nI am a young male in my 20\u2019s.\n\nRecently I have been getting into the best shape of my life, I was feeling great. Over the past few months, I have been dealing with some hamstring pain/tightness. I decided to go get some treatment from a family friend who is a chiropractor. \n\nLast Monday was the first day of treatment. He explained to me that everything connects back to the brain and we are going to work on some stuff to help that hamstring. Some of the things that were done during the treatment were a sitting neck adjustment, and some rapid eye movements. Since that day, I have been dealing with some dizziness/lightheadedness. It is not severe but it is enough to bother me and really stress me out to the point where I feel like I am never going to get better and the stress also causes some shortness of breath. \n\nI have gotten many treatments and adjustments from chiropractors in the past. But is it possible that this neck adjustment caused me to feel this way? It is been well over a week.\n\nI have still been going to work, and it does not bother me much during exercise. But when I am alone, or when I am at working looking at a computer, or sometimes when I am just standing talking to somebody it really does bother me. Part of it really makes me sad because I was on such a roll with the gym and feeling better than ever.\n\nDoes this sound like BBPV? Will I get better? :( &gt;it is enough to bother me and really stress me out to the point where I feel like I am never going to get better and the stress also causes some shortness of breath.\n\nThat is anxiety talkin'! \n\nAre you suggesting that your neck adjustment caused ear damage? Possibly? \n\nI honestly have no idea, but since I have been feeling this ever since the neck adjustment (I have had plenty neck adjustments in the past, but this was my first in about a year. It was also a type of neck adjustment I have never had before, I was sitting up) Hmmm I would probably email your physio and ask if there is a chance you hurt a nerve in the adjustment or something, does not sound ear related which is what bppv is. If this is the case, from what you know, does that sound like something permanent? \n\nSorry just so paranoid right now lol lol I am not a doctor but I very much doubt it is permanent!

Getting an mri this weekend but I doubt they will find anything. Just think I am getting episodes far too frequently :( i have migraines and then last year BPPV. i get an attack about once every three months. But they are intense. When are you getting the vertigo spells? Have you identified which ear and done the resetting maneuvers? I seem to be getting them monthly/every two months with no real trigger. Epely manoeuvre works but it always comes back eventually. It is my right ear only that is affected. I have been diagnosed with migraines (which are also right sided).

No, it probably will not be fun, because they will have to trigger your vertigo to see it for themselves.

But to be honest, I feel like breaking down multiple times a day, I just feel awful and I do not want to live fearing this forever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I am so scared and upset, I do not even know if this is BPPV anymore and thanks to all the awful things happening and the medical bill, I cannot even go to any more doctors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I plan on going to Korea sometimes soon, and I hope I would be able to see a Vertigo specialist to maybe even just get an answer. At this point I do not know if it is BPPV, Psychogenic vertigo(Which I learned that many people who experienced BPPV gets it from the fear)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n It is awful and I live in fear. Right now it is during Corona so I do not have to worry about work or anything, but I am an actor, love to swing dance and just everything fun in the world seems like something I should not do if I want to not be dizzy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Thanks for reading my rant. I hope someone has some positive experience about this and that there is something I can do. I am really close to depression, hopelessness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Bppv was such a traumatic experience and now I have unanswered dizziness and it is making me feel hopeless and scared Big hugs to you. I have been there... feeling completely hopeless, frustrated and afraid. Things will get better with time, I assure you. A lot of people experience residual vertigo and even have multiple episodes within a period of time. When you are able to, I would advise that you seek out an experienced physical therapist that specializes in BPPV/vertigo. Also, I would recommend going for testing to see if there is anything else going on. For me personally, I started with random BPPV episodes every couple of years that were corrected with the Epley. Eventually though, the manuever did not work so well and I felt dizzy all the time. After some testing, I found out that I have a 20% deficit in my left ear, which is what is causing me to feel 'off' all the time. I also still get BPPV on top of that sometimes, in multiple canals. So I am one big dizzy mess. ... There is hope though! At my first appointment with the specialized PT's, they comforted me by saying that there are exercises that I can do to correct my deficit! It is a lot of work, and I get cranky at times thinking about how many exercises I have to do a day to be somewhat 'normal'. I have not experienced much relief yet, (I have not been the best at sticking to my exercises) but I will go back for a second round of therapy one day... and I have hope that it will help. Ultimately through all of this... at some point it finally clicked with me that I will probably be dizzy for the rest of my life. And when I finally accepted it, I was able to find joy again. You can mourn the loss of what your life is/was supposed to be, for sure. There are many things that I cannot do anymore that I used to be able to without a thought. It is heartbreaking to let them go. But... once you do, then you can start opening up to finding new things or new ways of doing things! For example... I love to hike. I thought I was unable to do that any longer, then I realized that hiking poles helped me regain my stability! Also, I used to hike any trail that I wanted without a care in the world. Now I research trails ahead of time to find out what to expect, since I cannot scramble down rocks like I used to. Or be comfortable on skinny trails on mountain edges. However, I can choose easier trails that are family friendly and bring kids along! It is different, but equally as enjoyable to teach kids about nature. Hopefully, your vertigo will subside and you will not have to make such permanent drastic changes... but even if that was the case, I hope that your mind could eventually accept the changes and learn to love life in different ways. Helpful tip: Looking at videos of dogs &amp; cats with cerebeller hypoplasia make me so happy! They do not even realize how much tougher their wobbly little lives are, and they are so happy all the time! Gives me strength and hope. All the best to you on your journey. You will be ok, friend. Have you read the literature of vestibular rehabilitation, it is promising for many patients. However you should be seeing a PT weekly to ramp up the difficulty of the exercises slowly over time. I know the desperation. I can only share what I think helped my bbpv go away. Taking vitamin d and vitamin k2, they both may help shrink the calcium particle, and drinking a lot of water. I also avoided cheeses and nuts, I once had a dizziness attack from taking an amino acid supplement called tyrosine. \nAlso, irrigate your ears to make sure there is not any irritation that could be messing with your inner ear system. Is there a specific piece of literature you are referring to? Or just in general? I would be really interested in reading anything to do with vestibular rehab! Especially if it is got some good news to share. As for my experience with PT, I forget how long I went. Maybe a few months? I was going once per week though, and they were making my exercises more intense every week. I really liked their approach, because they tailored my exercise routine to fit my lifestyle. My homework included bicycling and hiking! I have to say though... I did not find any relief or improvement with the therapy. I feel like I only have myself to blame though, since I did not do the other exercises at home daily like I was supposed to. Which is why I will definitely go back for round two at some point when the world is not on fire. I am 30 male, and I experienced the exact same thing as you described. I had three vertigo episodes on a morning 5 weeks ago. 2 of them was because I rolled over in bed, and one when I got up from the bed. After that, no vertigo, but I was lightheaded all the time. When I was laying down, it was better, but when I was sitting somewhere or walking, I had this lightheadedness. After about 10 days, I was 99% good, and I even saw a physical therapist and he tested me and said: yeah it was bppv and you are good now. So for about 3-4 days I was almost completely ok and I thought the dizziness is gone. I even played soccer for an hour during those days, and no lightheadedness. But on day 14, boom, the lightheadedness was back out of nowhere. I saw my therapist again who did no help and made me feel worse after doing some stupid tests. \nAnyways, I am on week 6 now, and I still have this lightheadedness, but it is gotten very much better. During these days, I get some dizzy spells, but not all the day. \nAs far as I know, you should be positive and patient and try not to get anxious otherwise it makes the lightheadedness worse. I believe it will go away but it takes time, maybe 2-3 months, as I see from posts of many people in this subreddit. Hope you get better soon. Thank you for this... I hope your go away too. I heard that a lot of BPPV patients get a psychogenic dizziness from the trauma so I am trying to stay positive. However, the bills, the situation just makes it hard sometime... Thank you I will try that. What is irrigating the ears mean?? D: I never heard of that Thank you... It is exactly what you said. Heartbreaking and scary. My passion and dream is theater and I am so scared I will not be able to do it. Also swing dancing. I am in such fear.. Thank you for your experience... Just earwax build up, can cause bacteria to get trapped, ears inside will get itchy, you can get a bulb kit to flush ears. I wore earphones a lot so eardrum would almost get infected. Good luck! Omg, I am guilty of that for so long now. Yeah, we will not have this dizziness forever. Do not worry at all. For many many people, the dizziness after BPPV lasts a few weeks (or months), and it goes away after that. I assure you we will feel much better soon. Let us stay positive, and try to continue our normal life. I have learned that not thinking about it really improves it. Up your Vit d. Huh, I heard it might be bad for you if you took too much? :\\\\ There is a direct link to Vit D Deficiency and bppv. And these days, seems we are all deficient. I up\u2019d mine from 1200 to 4000 iu/d. Not sure what is \u201ctoo much\u201d in your book but check your levels. If you are on the low end, your can tell you how much to take. My dr never considered it so I just doubled it on my own and seems to help. Your dr can tell you how much to take", "I am a teenager and I woke up with vertigo and had it ever since So I woke up with spinning dizziness today, I have also been super lightheaded and I have had balance issues all day today. I thought it was something to do with blood pressure at first. I have been researching what this could have all day today (I have absolutely forgotten about vertigo even being a thing prior this.). After tons of digging online, I have come to the conclusion that my symptoms are caused by vertigo. \n\nWhat can I do about vertigo? What is the best sleeping position? Vertigo is a tricky beast and there are many causes besides bppv (which is the focus of this sub, although bppv is only one cause)\n\nIf I were you I would pop a gravol and lay down in any position where you can get comfortable without the spinning sensation. Watch some Netflix, chill and pass out. Hopefully your vertigo subsides on its own within a day! How many hours has it been going on for? It has been going on for 13-14 hours. I gave up on trying to sleep 1 hour ago. Bppv seems to be most plausible cause to my vertigo by the way. Thanks for the advice. Could be caused by a ton of different things. If you woke up with it, it is possible that your head fell into a position while you slept that caused crystals in your ear to end up in the wrong places. If that is the case, a doctor or vestibular therapist would need to examine you and possibly perform some maneuvers to try to get those crystals back in the right place.\n\nOn the other hand, it could be something like vestibular neuritis, or labyrinthitis, which is typically caused by bacterial infection and may take much longer to go away. I have been going on some 6 months with issues.\n\nWhoever you end up going to see, make sure they check your eyes for nystagmus (your eyes shifting back and forth on their own). If nystagmus is present its much more likely an issue with crystals in your ear and could be BPPV, in which maneuvers will be performed and it should hopefully subside quickly. Thank you for the information. I will definitely go get a check, vertigo is really bugging me after only one day lol I had it for a month straight and went through two ENTs. The second one put me on enough steriods to kill a horse and that seemed to do it.\n\nVertigo is caused by so many things. Go see a doctor if you have not already. I truly, sincerely hope it subsides quickly for you! I would not wish the things I have been going through on my worst enemy.\n\nI had an issue back in 2015 that put me out for a week but afterwards I felt 100% normal like my usual self. My recent incident is a different store but I hope your issue is much simpler. Hmmmm 13-14 hours in length might indicate its not bppv to be frank! I had it for ~2 months solid, my ENT was still quite sure it was BPPV, so it definitely can happen.\n\nShe did want to send me to a neurologist to make sure it was not something more severe (luckily for me it mostly cleared up just after that visit), getting checked out is still a good idea OP. The first ENT I went to also said it was BPPV! Thankfully I did not give up and got a second and third opinion What did the 2nd and 3rd doctor say? Reduced vestibular function in one ear confirmed by a lot of testing at a dizziness clinic and then they told me to monitor my symptoms, but all signs point to vestibular migraines.", "My experience with BPPV, residual dizziness and anxiety I am 23 years old and experienced my first BPPV attack in January. I had recently began sleeping on my right side for the first time in years for no particular reason, and I had slept on my left side pretty much every night up until that point. I believe this is could have triggered the first attack because when I woke up and whipped my head around to turn off my alarm which is on the left side of my bed, the room started spinning which I had never experienced before. For the next two days, I would feel extremely off balance and the spinning would occur whenever I laid down to sleep and woke up, and I would run to the bathroom with nausea. I have moderate to severe anxiety and this experienced caused me to have panic attacks whenever I tried to sleep, which would exacerbate the dizziness. \n\nThis spinning sensation eventually stopped, but I would still get dizzy whenever I laid down or tried to go to sleep. I still felt extremely off balance and had vertigo everyday to the point where I could not walk down a flight of stairs without having to hold onto the railing. I still had panic attacks almost every night and got only 4 hours a sleep a night if I was lucky. At this point I had no idea what BPPV was and that this was what I was experiencing, and attributed it to my anxiety disorder flaring up due to other stressors in my life that were occurring around this time. I restarted therapy, hoping that alleviating my anxiety would make it stop eventually. I now know that I was experiencing residual dizziness after the initial BPPV attack.\n\nAbout a month later, I came across this sub after some googling and wondered if maybe I had BPPV. I made an appointment with an ENT and he performed the Dix-Hallpike test on me, but I did not get dizzy at all. I was referred to an audiologist, where I did hearing tests and a VNG/dizziness test. My hearing was normal but the VNG test showed that I was severely off balanced in my right ear. I then had an MRI done but the results did not show anything out of the ordinary. My ENT told me that there was not anything he could diagnose me with, and that my anxiety was likely the culprit of the dizziness. \n\nBy this point, I had been living with residual dizziness everyday for so many weeks that I had accepted that it would be my \"new normal,\" and continued living my life trying to not stress about it too much. By the time I attended all the doctors appointments and received the MRI results, it had already been three months since the initial attack. I had gotten so used to the residual dizziness that I had not even realized that I no longer had it. I sometimes still felt a bit of vertigo when looking down for too long at my phone, but otherwise things had pretty much gotten back to normal. \n\nIt has now been about 4 months since my initial BPPV attack and I woke up this morning with another BPPV attack. I performed the Epley maneuver several times to my right ear and immediately the dizziness subsided. However, I am now dealing with residual dizziness again. It does not seem to be as bad as it was after my first BPPV attack, but it could get worse in the next few days since that seemed to happen the first time around. \n\nAlthough the residual dizziness can be hard to deal with, being optimistic and knowing that it will eventually go away, even if it takes time, definitely helps ease my anxiety. After my first BPPV and residual dizziness experience, I have learned that the stress I caused myself from worrying about it hurt my mental and physical health way more than the actual BPPV/dizziness itself. This time around, I do not feel as anxious about it because I know what is going on and I am optimistic that things will get better, as it did the first time around. This was exactly me 7 years ago. The panic attacks, dizziness and not sleeping. It got better over time once I dealt with my anxiety. But that is hard when the dizziness itself makes you anxious. For a while there I got no bppv attacks. 3 years to be exact. Until this January. Now I am still dealing with some of the after effects here and there. It almost feels like a cycle sometimes. But you need to be optimistic or else you can fall down a very dark hole mentally. I remember I immediately began feeling better the moment my doctor (unintentionally) shifted my attitude toward hope. May I ask what it was they said or did? Optimism definitely makes a huge difference. I am way less anxious this time around because I have gone out the end of the tunnel last time, and I know I will get there again in time. I think it was just the positive way she prescribed antiemetic medication. (She had this positive nonchalance--this casual objectivity--of someone distanced from the situation .) I had already read that antiemetics had different reported levels of effectiveness (and I had not had much luck with them in the past, so I was not exactly waiting with bated breath), but I remember the hope I felt when I heard the positivity in her voice.\n\nAnyway, after that, I began to feel much better--because I had hope again. I am going to chime in here too. My vestibular therapist was a godsend. I was at the end of my rope.  I was SO miserable for SO long.  She was a breath of fresh air. She was so positive.  She reassured me each week when I saw her (for over two months I saw her weekly for therapy).  And even though my case was stubborn, she still encouraged me.  Part of it was her positive personality.  Even the first time she did the Epley twice and sent me home saying 'It is fixed! Go back to your normal activities and enjoy life.'  Imagine my disappointment when I returned a week later, she laid me back, and the vertigo was still there.  But she held strong. Did the Epley twice again, gave me exercises, and told me this was temporary. A month later, as I continued to not get better and would see her weekly, I would be in tears. I FEARED seeing her and having her do the Epley (as it made me quite sick). But she smiled and talked me through it. She continued to give me hope.  I would always walk away mentally feeling better.\n\nDuring Epley number 22, she (and I was feeling more miserable than EVER - as my anxiety had gotten the best of me as we were going on 9 or so weeks of this) laid me back and nothing. No vertigo. No nystagmus.  She sat me back up and told me the crystal was finally cleared.  WHAT?!?!? When did this happen? I still felt like total crap!  I made her lay me back again and test it. Nothing.  I returned a week later and told her I still felt horrible (residual dizziness and anxiety).  I made her do ALL the tests again.  All were negative.  I cried tears of joy.  She told me it would just take a while to get my body back in sync.  Getting on top of the anxiety was the key. That can just totally wreck a person. Almost exactly what happened to me one year ago. I am much better now 1 year later but I still experience what I would call 'feeling off balance' every now and then. I will do the Epley maneuver myself and it always helps. This is starting to feel like something I will just have to live with. Those darn loose ear crystals. There are some surgical procedures that look like they can cure it but it is so manageable now that I doubt I will ever pursue those options.", "24F diagnosed with BPPV after ER visit - advice? I spent the last night in the emergency department due to severe vertigo, background dizziness, and vomiting (unable to hold any food or drink in 12+h, which prompted me to go to the ER for the first time in my life) and was told I have BPPV. The doctor did and taught me the Epley maneuver and relieved my symptoms for the moment being, but I still get \\~5s vertigo whenever I lie down and get up in the morning. I also slept in the 45 degree position that some sources recommended, because lying on one side flat = instant vertigo. I plan on seeing my family doctor ASAP to discuss next steps and possibly PT but this condition is giving me so much anxiety right now and I want to hear your long-term experiences. \n\nI am very worried about how this will affect my studies (ironically, I am a 2nd year medical student, and ironically, BPPV was never taught in our neurology block), whether I can hold a future practice, and drive. I have read a lot of posts where you guys were so supportive and gave amazing advice, but I keep seeing that stress is a trigger, and unfortunately stress is the name of medical school and probably for the rest of my life.\n\nI know I sound like I am blowing things out of proportion right now, but it is very hard to focus with this background dizziness and fear of triggering the vertigo with the slightest movement of my head (even such as shaking it). My final is in two weeks and instead I am sitting in front of my computer feeling guilty because I spent my study day in the ER instead of staying on top of school and working towards being a good doctor.\n\nAny words/advice would be appreciated. Nobody has ever had this in my family and this is so different from a disease that I can touch/see and I feel very scared and alone. Thank you to whoever is reading this post. I hope you have a good day. You are going to be fine. Even after you have adjusted and fixed it you will still get residual dizziness. My ent told me that I can experience residual dizziness up to the next 5 years because it is easier for the crystals to move out of the proper place again cause it is happened already. \n\nEveryone is different but it is been a year since my diagnosis and I have not had vertigo since, every now and then I do get a residual episode were certain positions (ei lying down) make me dizzy but no where near how I was. These often go away with some sleep or within a few hours. \n\nI would like to reference that my first episode where when I was 22 full time college student as well, on top of part time job. No one i knew even understood or could help because they never experienced it. Bppv can happen at any age but is more common in older people and rare in younger. I complete understand how scary, rare, and worrisome this whole thing is. It made my anxiety and depression worst but I pushed through. And I know you will too! My best advice to you if you are worried about it is: \n\n1) limit your salt intake and eat healthy. Salt can make the dizziness feel worst\n2) avoid caffeine and alcohol for the same reason prior \n3) stress and lack of sleep can also affect your balance and dizziness. \n4) if your having a bad dizzy or off balance day take it easy. \n5) stay hydrated\n\nIt is important to take care of yourself. You are going to be able to finish school and drive and travel and do whatever you want. Just definitely take it easy, and try to calm down. I know it is scary being dizzy and off balance. Keep a positive mind set. You are going to be okay, it may not feel like it right now but your going to be okay. Just keep telling yourself that when you are worried. Thank you so much for your advice and kind words. I really needed this. I was worried I would be waking up to 5s of the world spinning and the same when lying down to sleep every night for the rest of my life, on top of the unpredictable vertigo episodes and throwing up.\n\nAs for your tips, it is going to suck a little as caffeine runs in my veins but I will cut it down &amp; switch to decaf haha - if you do not mind answering, right now do you sleep normally like you did before you had BPPV (flat, in whatever position comfortable) or do you also prop your head up and do the 45 degree thing that some sources recommend? For me it took a couple tries of the maneuvers to finally get the crystal in place (mine was in the rarest canal and stuck there for so long) So many times I had to sleep propped up. But it should be for the first night. Just allow 24 hours for the crystal to settle in its new place. \n\nI have always been a side sleeper, and my vertigo and dizziness was always worst on my right side. While going through it I had to sleep on the left but as I got better I sleep completely normally now.\n\nEveryone is different, I have seen some people on this subreddit have one maneuver and they are fixed and never get residual dizziness and others end up having reoccurring bppv episodes for years and the rest of their life. But it is definitely not going to be something constant. For me ever after I was better it look a long time to feel that way because I had so much residual dizziness.\n\nAlso the earlier the diagnosis the better. For the longest time I did not go to the doctor because I thought it was me being dehydrated or waking up to fast. For 4 out of the 6 months I just dealt with it. That also was why I had so much residual dizziness. Bppv also ends up correcting itself as well. It is not permanent just an adjustment. sorry to hear about your bppv.\n\ni had bppv back in march 2020 for about a month. youre lucky the er doc knew the epley. i went to the er thinking i had a heart issue from dizziness. my er dr was clueless regarding bppv.\n\nif you have bppv symptoms again see a ent (ear nose and throat) dr. he/she will be able to care for your bppv. i saw an ent dr. she first did the dix-hallpike maneuver to determine which side/ear was affected then did the epley on me to resolve my dizziness. bppv is not fun but is not supposed to be a major ailment.\n\none other thing...if you had bppv for a while your symptoms/dizziness may take a while (a couple days) to completely subside. essentially, your brain is trying to fix itself :) . but dont worry youll be ok. Sorry to hear about your experience.\n\nI have had it for 15 years since I was a kid.\n\nProbably get an episode a month at minimum. I think there was 3 last week.\n\nJust need to live close to work because it is probably never going away. Sucks but I am not dying so that is nice. I am a 38M in a high performing stressful role that requires a lot of entertainment for my customers. The role \u201crequired\u201d me to have lots of \u201ccoffee meetings\u201d and to be out nearly every night for \u201csocial drinks\u201d. \n\n6 years ago I was hit by BPPV unaware of what it was (until 1.5 years ago) but noticed that coffee and alcohol made it worse. Fast forward to today and I have not had a coffee or a drop of alcohol in 6 years and I do not plan on going back. \n\nInitially people that knew me were like \u201cwhat is wrong?!?\u201d But as time went on people understood that I had made a personal choice to stop and now I would enjoy mineral water and peppermint tea. \n\nI learnt very quickly that I did not need the stimulants to have fun or to stay awake and if I did the dizziness just was not worth it as it brought on anxiety which made everything 10x harder to function at my job. \n\nTo be honest I do not miss booze or coffee one bit. It feels liberating to not be a drone that feels like they need to drink to fit in. \n\nSo my advice on top of the good advice you will read in the sub is to take BPPV seriously, do gaze exercises to speed up the healing process and given it sounds like study and becoming a doctor is everything to you, cut the stimulants out.\n\nLife does go on and you will be fine. You are right. Thank you for your advice! Sometimes certain choices suck but it is what it is and we have to live with it, could be a lot worse. Thank you so much!! I am also very grateful for my ER doc - she was absolutely amazing and kind and jumped to the Epley immediately after noticing I did not have any neurological abnormalities on the exam. Thank you for your reply. And I agree on your last sentence for sure - hope things turn out better for you as well.", "Can head trauma cause bppv? Last saturday i was at a friends house who has a bunk bed and on the side of it his brother has a like a night stand table top thingy connected to the bars of the bed. Long story short i hit my head on it some what hard and an immediate bump could be felt. Monday morning after mothers day i was awake and decided to turn my head to the left. I am naturally a back sleeper but sometimes ill lay either on the right or left side. Once i did that i was spinning. I immediately went back to my back and i laid in bed all day skipping my on line classes. \n\nFast forward the next couple days the spinning got better but i would spin if i looked left while laying down. That same week friday i felt 100% better but towards the end of the night i was going to lay down for bed and i could feel that same spinning sensation. Now sunday a week after mother\u2019s day i can feel the sensation if i look up but besides that i dont feel \u201cnormal\u201d anymore. I also tried the maneuvers to try and fix bppv but idk if i did them right. Should i see a doctor? Sounds like BPPV, it can happen from head trauma, See a doctor. This guy said it all. Best of luck to you. agreed. specifically see an ear nose and throat (ent) dr or a vestibular specialist. ent's are usually trained at performing the proper maneuvers to diagnose and resolve your issue. when i saw an ent she resolved my bppv quickly. From my conversation with a doctor, yes it can. For me, sleep appears to correlate as well. Perhaps, odd sleeping positions could be an issue.\n\nI would recommend a vestibular specialist (could be an ENT, audiologist, etc.). They can help you rule out other causes like a mild concussion or something along these lines.", "BPPV: A Quick Reference Guide **Disclaimer and Preface**\n\nI am not a medical professional. I have just compiled and summarized some information I have found on the Internet (sources provided where reasonable) and provided tips based on my own experience (marked with \"OP\"). This guide is merely a starting place (i.e., not exhaustive). Consult your doctor or vestibular physiotherapist for information on your case. Information below can be updated as I receive feedback. ( (our moderator) feel free to pin this to the top of this subreddit if it is helpful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Background**\n\nBPPV:\n\n* **B**enign: Harmless\n* **P**aroxysmal: Sudden\n* **P**ositional: Related to (head) position\n* **V**ertigo: Spinning dizziness\n\nBPPV is a problem within your ( the system in your inner ear that tells you where you are in space (e.g., standing, moving) so that you can stay balanced. Within your vestibular system, there are two sets of structures that detect movement:\n\n* **Linear acceleration**\n   * Utricle: Horizontal acceleration (e.g., speeding up and slowing down in a car)\n   * Saccule: Vertical acceleration (e.g., going up and down in an elevator)\n* **Rotational acceleration**\n   * Lateral/horizontal semicircular canal: Acceleration along the transverse plane (e.g., shaking your head to say, \"No\")\n   * Anterior/superior semicircular canal: Acceleration along the sagittal plane (e.g., nodding your head to say, \"Yes\")\n   * Posterior semicircular canal: Acceleration along the coronal plane (e.g., tilting your head from side to side, touching your ears to your shoulders)\n\nThese inner-ear structures are filled with fluid and have hairs attached inside that move with the fluid. Depending on which and how much the hairs move, electrical signals are sent to your brain, telling it where you are spatially so that your brain can coordinate the muscles in your eyes and the rest of your body to keep you balanced. The following may mix imagery a bit, but these analogies (OP) might be helpful for imagining the hairs.\n\n* ( Grass at the bottom of a layer of jello, with little rocks on top of the jello to weight things down. When the fluid above the grass-jello-rock combination moves, it creates drag on the top of the combination structure and moves it around. At the bottom of this structure, the grass \"feels\" this structural movement. It send signals through its roots to a brain somewhere, telling it how much movement there was.\n* ( The grass sits on a hill, with the hill covered by a teardrop-shaped gumdrop. When fluid around the hill-grass-gumdrop combination moves, the grass and gumdrop \"sway.\" The grass senses movement and sends signals through its roots to a brain somewhere, telling it how much movement there was.\n\nBPPV occurs when a rock (i.e., a calcium carbonate crystal) somehow breaks off from the jello in one or both of your ( (i.e., on your left and/or right side) and moves into ( you have (i.e., three in your left inner ear and three in your right inner ear).

This is really great, thanks for putting it together. It would be nice to have it available under the subreddit info for new sufferers to be able to easily find. Thank you so much. Hopefully this will benefit alot of people!!  ( \\- thanks for posting this info.\n\nimo, simply see an ent (ear nose and throat) dr. they will diagnose, treat and resolve (hopefully) your bppv. i did and im cured. I saw a regular doctor, an ENT, and a neurologist. The only thing they did - was to rule out more severe things. It was a vestibular therapist (dizzy specialist in the PT department) that truly tested me,  diagnosed and treated me (for over two months).  So, sometimes it takes finding the 'right' specialist to help you. Awesome - thank you so much for compiling this info! agreed Excellent info. My only suggestion for improvement is clarifying that ENTs and Drs may not be the most familiar with the treatments, and finding a vestibular therapist (read: A physical therapist that specializes in balance issues) is strongly suggested. This was my experience and what /u/Colmanson1 said. Very nice! I would love it if someone has a guide (like the ones in r/coolguides) for the Epley maneuver.  I have good luck with using that to treat my BPPV but do not always want to watch a video so a guide that I could print out and keep by my bed would be awesome. Not to learn but mostly just to refresh my memory . All the ones I found on the internet are tied to clinics and cannot be printed. How can i determine which semicircular canal the crystal is in? My doctor said i have BPPV and printed off a set of exercises for me - but i literally saw him google search \"bppv exercise\" and print out the first page :/ I did a brief search on Google and found ( Does this help? I just added otolaryngologist to the list of professionals to seek out!\n\nThanks for the input! Thanks for your input! I put vestibular PTs first in the list of professionals and mentioned that they come highly recommended. My doctor knew about the maneuvers but also gave me a referral to a vestibular PT (since the PTs sometimes require a doctor's note where I am). It seems doctors diagnose the affected semicircular canal by measuring your response (e.g., nystagmus and level of relief) to treatments of, first, the maneuver for the most common BPPV type and, then, maneuvers for the less common BPPV types (( (\n\nHope you feel better, and thanks for your question! I have inserted a comment above about it. That really helps actually, thanks! I have just turned 23 and been suffering for a week now :( hopefully this is not a long term thing - it is completely affected the way I live day to day That sucks. I remember the nausea; it was the most awful feeling. \u2639\n\nTake care of yourself, and hope you are able to find remedies and positions that minimize the discomfort for you! Is this something I am going to have to live with or do people normally make full recoveries? I have seen mixed things online :/ I think that is something you will need to explore with a vestibular physiotherapist, doctor, or ENT with whom you have spoken about your family history, your habits (e.g., diet and activities), one-off incidents (e.g., accidents), etc. As you can see above, there are so many risk factors, and, despite certain tendencies (e.g., BPPV's more common in older people and women), a confluence of factors can mean almost anyone can get BPPV. However, there are steps we can take to mitigate residual effects and prevent reoccurrences; even positive outlooks can help! (I remember, for me, it was my doctor's positivity that helped lift me from my sadness.)\n\nGood luck, u/thehumanwookie! Yes that is what I was looking for! thanks so much! I am glad! And no problem! Try and stay positive! Take the advice anyone on here has given that has gone through it. YOU ARE NOT ALONE! I am currently in the residual phase of dizziness... not fun. I ended up at the ER last night freaked out about myself. Had a CT and EKG because I was so stressed. Everything came back fine. Try to stay positive, it is not easy but you will get better eventually. 5000000% agree!!! \n\nI am still gob smacked at how many people I had seen and I still had no idea I had BPPV until I found my PT. What a cracker of a video. Needs to be pinned somewhere :) As others have said, stay positive and see a specalist. \n\nMy PT has been helping people with balance disorders (not just BPPV) for 20 years who would have treated a few thousand people and has only had one person that she could not help which she said was in her early years. - this tends to make me believe that if you have BPPV it can be resolved albeit some people it is instant while others need a few sessions. \n\nHave you seen a specalist yet? Would be great to see an update for those who read the historic posts. I love how clear it is! Very accessible.\n\nI have it linked in the main post, too! Hello, thank you for your response! I will do a post right now on the sub about my experience so everything is there in one place :) the TLDR: after about a month I feel nearly 85-90% normal. Still have a little off balance moments  Fantastic to hear you are on the recovery. Highly recommend vestibular exercises and look forward to seeing your post!   Do not know why I did not receive a notification about this, but you are welcome!", "BPPV? It is been four months now of constant head pressure. I feel more and more disconnected from my own body and sometimes when I sit or stand I feel like I am falling forward or to the side even though I am not moving. I can remember back in June I definitely had BPPV cause as soon as I got up one morning the entire room was spinning and I had to lie down again quickly. It is not that intense though. I am thinking it is my ears though since last night i turned on my bath and the sound was so loud it muffled my hearing and it almost resembled radio static. I thought I would go deaf- I never experienced the hearing issues. The other symptoms all sound just like BPPV. Have you been to a doctor to get a diagnosis? The Dix-Hallpike maneuver can be used to confirm BPPV. Nah I have not. Should I just go ahead and make an appointment with an ENT? Absolutely see a specalist. ... I have had BPPV 4 times over 6 years. Never experienced loss of sound... which you will read over in the meniere's sub.\n\nIt also reads like you need balance therapy. Some people do not need it, but most will suffer residual (like me) balance problems that can be helped (never fixed) by exercises that a PT will provide for you. \n\nBTW has the vertigo based on movement been constant for 4 months? And by vertigo, do you mean room spinning uncontrollably or lightheaded and unsettled? I had funky ear stuff going on when I had active BPPV - and even for a while once it was cleared. But oddly, my ears checked out perfectly fine when I saw the ENT.  I was certain it was Meniere's because of the ear symptoms. But I had fullness, pressure, and popping, crackling &amp; gurgling.  I also was super sensitive to sounds for a while.\n\nI would go see an ENT and get checked out.  Perhaps you truly do have some inner ear issues going on. For me, a lot of my symptoms had gone away by the time I was able to get in to see the specialist.  Also, as mentioned, if you have the most common form of BPPV, the Dix Hallpike is a quick way to test if it is still there or not. If you lay back in that position of the Dix Hallpike, and get the 30ish seconds of intense vertigo with nystagmus (eye twitching), you still have active BPPV. I had ear symptoms just like that. They treated me for BPPV but I never got better for a couple months. Turned out to be cervicogenic vertigo instead. My muscles in my neck were so tight it caused inflammation in my jaw and eventually pressed on my inner ear. Trigger point release helped the most and it has not returned. Lightheaded and unsettled. Its almost like my soul is falling forward sometimes or I am swaying in the ocean. So that feeling I can relate too... you need to do gaze stability exercises  it is not a silver bullet (was not / is not for me) but it definitely helps. These exercises can be taught by a PT, YouTube, reading what others have posted here. \n\nDo not expect immediate results... some people (including my self) had to keep at it for 6M! But it is better then nothing and it is better then thinking ... great I just have to endure this for the rest of my life. \n\nI found having something to do / work towards helped my anxiety which in turn settles the lightheaded and dizzy feeling.", "BPPV diagnosis 15 years ago, I have always just dealt with it. Getting to the point of looking for help again. Any advice before doing so? I was diagnosed with BPPV when i was 15 or so. Probably got it from football or head banging too much at metal concerts then. \n\nI saw an inner ear specialist then, neurologist (sleep study), and a dizzy doc and all of them said \u201cYep just BPPV, could be migraines manifested as that, could be inner ear, could be nutritional... nobody knows\u201d. I managed to make it in to a doc one time with symptoms and it was verified back then. \n\nEver since then for 15 years i will get bouts randomly for weeks/a month till it fixes itself.\n\nThe problem is with the stay at home order i am not getting out and about to do enough movement for it to fix itself like normal. My bouts are lasting longer as a result and it sucks.\n\nWhat triggers it for me is not moving in my sleep. I get it more often after a LONG day or work, sometimes drinking/smoking weed, and occasionally with a giant meal that makes me pass out.\n\nSo the other problem is i have gotten more bored staying up late and smoking a reasonable amount. My partner is also doing the same and not sleeping with me as often to subconsciously move during sleep and make me re position while i am passed i am out. \n\nMy real issue is in 15 years i cannot for the life of me figure out what is a good side to sleep on. I have a giant body pillow i try and prop up on 30 degrees to sleep but sometimes it does not feel right so i roll off it and end up in a weird spot.\n\nAfter reading this, does anyone have any tips besides seeing a vestibular therapist to nail down the problem/treatment?\n\nmy bouts are usually really bad for about 2-3 hours with 1-2 hours of residual dizziness so it is hard for me to make it to a doctor while it is still going on and get diagnosed.\n\nI am going to take the exercises more seriously after poking around the awesome community that did not exist not too long ago. I might be a little in tears right now to know that there are so many other people struggling with this disorder. 15 years it has sometimes been my daily battle so i applaud anyone else that has to deal with this crap too. Not fair to say the least. I have also just been dealing with this for years, but it got worse this time with the stay at home orders.  The exercises definitely helped me get rid of it faster.  I also read somewhere that taking Vitamin D supplements helps (not sure how and do not take my word for it).  But I have been taking vitamin D for strengthening my immune system anyways and it might have helped as well.\n\nGood luck and hope you get rid of it soon! You do not sound like you have BPPV. If you are triggers are long days and meals and quick head movements set you off then I would lean more towards vestibular migraine or vestibular neuritis. BPPV is a mechanical issue ie an otoconia is in a part of your inner ear it should not be, its movement provoked when you have it and I would say rarely lasts for 3 hours unless you are doing a manouveure to fix it. \n\nDo you get light or sound sensitivity? Do you get auras? Do you get migraines? Are you dizzy at rest when you have your attacks? Do your eyes to funny things when it occurs? Are you motion sensitive? \n\nTreatment for migraines is often medication and hypofunction is gaze stability exercises. You probably do not have BPPV - very much sounds like what you have fluctuates with your blood sugar/blood pressure. Sorry to put it like this, but I think it is dangerous for ppl here to try and \u2018figure out\u2019 what you have.\n\nThe only way is to get to the bottom of this is to see a vestibular specialist. Make sure to see somebody that is actually knowledgeable. They will do multiple tests - there are just to many possibilities: migraines, menieres, hydrops, vestibular imbalance, etc. So the only way to know is to seek professional help. I am sure that once you see somebody it will become much more manageable. Gl! OP had this for 15 years - you would eventually compensate for neuritis or at least plateau. So your condition would not fluctuate that much. Not necessarily especially if it is developed into 3PD. Vestib migraine would more likely fit but not enough info to say. As I said, I think it is dangerous to point OP in certain directions - even more considering his symptoms do not fit the traditional ones for either vestibular neuritis or PPPD + we do not even have enough info. yeah you missed the part where i have had it diagnosed but appreciate the response yeah that is the problem with this disorder. i have seen 5 VERY good doctors and BBPV always comes down to the fact that nobody knows enough about it and the general fact that it is just a physiological disorder that is almost impossible to 100% diagnose in 90% or cases. i would get nauseous if i did not have it for 15 years and i cannot see a thing when moving my head in the slightest Sorry about that, might have skim read! In that case, just want to add that studies have found that BPPV is oftentimes correlated with some other vestibular disorder (though they could not establish a correlation) - that was my case as well.

I was \u201ccured\u201d around a month and a half ago, but i recently developed some mild dizziness. What does this mean? My physical therapist told me that I could go back to doing normal things, but now i am afraid that it is going to come back if i do. Does this mean i have to keep being super careful, and does that mean i would have to be that careful forever? I would hate to never be able to do fun things like riding roller coasters ever again but i am not really seeing another outcome. There is often 'residual' dizziness after your BPPV is 'cured.'  I went through vestibular (dizzy) therapy for months, and the best advice was to get back to regular activities as soon as possible. There is no exclusive reason as to why and when a person gets BPPV. My therapist told me I could not go around worrying about it all the time, since we cannot predict when it is going to happen. The therapy I did was basically to 'challenge' the residual dizziness and get my body back in sync with being balanced again.  I was back to running, snowmobiling, and all other hobbies right away (actually - I did those things WHILE having active BPPV for over two months as well).  Do not push yourself too hard though. If something makes you feel super sick/dizzy, back off and give yourself time to gradually get back into it.  I still have fears of it coming back - especially at night. I can finally lay almost flat and on the 'bad' side and feel minimal dizziness. So, there is definitely anxiety related to BPPV.  So, do not worry - you should be able to have 'fun' again! It may take a while before your body had readjusted to being 'cured.' But your life should go back to normal! Hang in there! I am about 3.5 months in and I feel the same way you do....I still have not been \u201ccured\u201d or maybe I have... my PT never saw a nystagmus and I have had weeks where I think I am almost out of this then bam - a week of feeling awful, like this week. anxiety definitely can make it worse so you have to try your best to not let yourself get anxious when you feel mild dizziness- way easier said than done bc I am having trouble with that this week, hang in there, it will get better from all the stories I have read on here. Some people just take longer and unfortunately we are just probably in that group. You are definitely not alone\u2665\ufe0f thanks so much i did not realize anxiety had that kind of impact on it. it is nice hearing that other people are going through what i am\ud83d\udc4d oh man thanks so much. i did not know it could last that long, but knowing there is a light at the end of the tunnel is encourging. thanks! There is a light at the end of the tunnel. It just takes a while to get there some times. And you may never get BPPV again - or it could randomly hit in a month, or 2 years from now, or 10 years from now. You cannot predict it. So, just always know, if it DOES happen again, you know how to get help and fix it and will get it done right away.  In the meanwhile, try not to worry about it. If you do have worries, it never hurts to see the doctor/therapist/specialist again just to get checked. yeah true. thanks so much! I have had it since I was 16 (15 years now) Nobody knows why. I do not even bother going to the doctor when I wake up with it anymore because nobody can fix it. Just like migraines.\n\nFind out your triggers and do your best to minimize them. I had it 3 times last week when waking up. So far so good this week. Usually it is staying up late, working too much, or passing the fuck out so my head does not move at night. \n\nSucks but some people are just unlucky in life. Could be worse. What are the cures? there are not any, just short term treatments. So while there is not a cure per say, you need to think of it as a mechanical issue, something that is a defect of sorts that cannot be fixed and that it is nothing to get worried about.\n\nI have been hit by vertigo from BPPV 4 times in 6 years. The last 2 times were in the last 3 months with a few weeks apart the other 2 were years apart. Each time, I woke up by rolling over on my side and boom the world is spinning. Each time there was no warning and I did not do anything earth shattering leading up to the event. \n\nAt 16 enjoy being invincible, enjoy roller coasters, enjoy life and do not let BPPV take over your life to the point the anxiety of it all controls you. That Is shit. I use steam every day to clear my sinuses, that seems to do wonders for me but its annoying doing it every morning.

I have been having balance problems not very severe but it feels somewhat off everyone in a while could this be bppb is bppv pretty severe usually or can it be mild ?

Please pray for me. \n-Jason Hey Jason,\n\n Take it easy, do the maneuvers, give yourself time to feel better. BPPV sucks but it is pretty manageable.\n\nHope you get relief and return to the baseball diamond (covid allowing) soon. i had bppv back in march for close to a month. my primary care dr **MIS**diagnosed me with having an inner ear infection. who diagnosed your bppv?\n\nas soon as i saw an ear nose and throat (ent) dr who performed maneuvers properly my bppv was gone within about a week. the longer you have bppv the longer it may take to go away. trying the maneuvers yourself can sometimes be difficult and there are certain steps to follow even after the maneuvers are performed. for example, for me after i left the ent dr i was instructed to take it easy (especially to keep my head from moving too much and to lie a certain way when sleeping). if you dont follow those instructions you may cause your bppv to return.\n\ni highly recommend you go see an ent dr or a vestibular specialist who are familiar with treating bppv. you will be very happy you went. I agree with what is already been said. You are smart to get on top of it quickly - as the longer you have it, the longer it takes to get rid of.  Having a doctor or therapist that specializes in BPPV and dizziness is a godsend. They can diagnose you correctly (it is common for general practitioners to misdiagnose and not give you help in resolving your BPPV).  They can also offer assistance in showing you how to correctly do the Epley (the half somersault is another maneuver that is easier to do at home, and does not provoke symptoms as bad - it is not as effective or as proven as the Epley though).  My therapist tested all 6 inner ear canals with different tests and tested for other things as well (to put my mind at ease).  She had goggles to video my eye twitching (nystagmus).\n\nI am very athletic as well.  Please know that it will go away.  This forum has a good amount of people that have experienced BPPV and had it resolved.  It is a good source of info and support.  Hang in there! And try to find a therapist that can help guide you.  If the Epley is done incorrectly, the crystal can move to a different canal - and then you will need another maneuver to clear it. Not to freak you out - but that is why it is so good to have a professional help you!  Once you get the maneuver down correctly, it is easy to do at home by yourself. Hiya! \nDid you do the Epley on your own? I had better luck with a physical therapist. It took only 2 sessions and the vertigo went away. \nHope you feel better soon! Do not do Epley or any other maneuver over and over again, only 2-3 times. The crystal needs time to settle, otherwise you are just sending it back and forth. Not sure if that is what you meant by spent all day lying down and doing the Epley but I figured I would mention it. If it is helping you should have a reduction in symptoms after doing the maneuver, otherwise that could indicate the crystal is in a different canal and will not respond to Epley. Also avoid quick head movements for a few days after doing the man. Hope it passes quickly for you.", "Residual dizziness for 3 months? It is been 3 months since I had an intense attack of vertigo. I did the Epley maneuver and it fixed the intense vertigo. Since then I have continued to have \"residual dizziness\". Some days I am fine, other days, it is pretty bad. Antivert (meclizine) seems to help sometimes, but not always. Saw a physical therapist last two weeks and he did the Epley maneuver again. I thought maybe that was it - but then the past two days it came back.\n\nI am also experiencing fatigue, a \"floaty\" feeling, and even just light exercise raises my heart rate by 30-40 bpm. I am wondering now if this is something more than just BPPV. I am on month 4 of residual dizziness. Granted... It gets a tiny bit better weekly... But there are still days that I feel pretty yucky. I saw a specialist weekly for over 2 months before we cured the BPPV. The therapist would perform the Epley twice on me then I would do it myself mid week. For the first month or two, I still felt horrible &amp; made my therapist test all 6 ear canals over &amp; over just to prove to me that it was just residual dizziness.\n\nHave you been doing any vestibular, balance, or visual exercises to help the residual dizziness? I was very active through it all &amp; challenged the dizziness with the exercises. I know you said increased heart rate brings it on (or that your heart rate increases quickly) ... Perhaps it is a blood pressure issue that is making it worse? I would go in to your specialist just to get checked out again. I also know if I worried that vertigo was going to happen again my anxiety would sky rocket making the residual dizziness worse. It is hard not to worry.... But none of us want this to come back &amp; it seems to be first &amp; foremost on our mind!\n\nWhen your therapist did the Epley again, did it provoke the intense vertigo &amp; eye nystagmus when you laid back? Or were you fine during the maneuver? Perhaps the crystal moved to a different ear canal, which would need a different test to diagnose. And a different maneuver to clear it. Have you done any Brandt-Daroff exercises? You sound JUST like me. I am going on almost 2 months of residual dizziness .. if you want to talk, DM me! &gt;Brandt-Daroff \n\nHm that looks similar to Epley - I will try it. Yes the Epley did retrigger the eye nystagmus a bit. He said to keep doing the Epley at home as needed but did not give me any other exercises.\n\nIt is very possible that anxiety about the return of the vertigo could lead to more dizziness. A vicious circle!\n\nI just got a blood pressure cuff to measure my own BP - going to see if it is possibly changing during these bouts. I had BPPV for the first time about a week ago. I rolled over in bed and tried to sit up and the room started spinning. I immediately lie back down and waited until it stopped. This whole week, like OP, I have this floating feeling whether I am sitting or standing. I know it is best that I see a specialist, but with covid, I am a bit scared to visit the doctor.\n\nI did the Dix Hallpike test myself. I had my mom check my eyes and I did have nystagmus. It seems like my left ear is the bad ear. I did Epley manuever 1-2 times every other day. And before I did the Epley manuever, I always did the Dix Hallpike test and each time I got dizzy on my left side.\n\nIs it normal to trigger nystagmus/dizzinesss everytime I do Dix Hallpike? Or does it mean the crystals are still stuck?  I cannot tell if this is residual dizziness or if I never actually got the crystals out :( If you get the severe dizziness/vertigo with nystagmus when you lie back doing the Dix Hallpike (the first step of the Epley), that means the crystal is still in the wrong place. Once you can lay back without the vertigo/nystagmus, that means the crystal has gone to the correct place.  Or, it is always possible the crystal moved to a different inner ear canal - but that does not happen frequently.  If you CAN get in to see a specialist, please do so.  They can help make sure you are doing the Epley correctly and also do some other tests to make sure you have it diagnosed correctly.  If your doctors offices are seeing patients, please know that they have standards in place to keep you very safe from being exposed to COVID.\n\nAlso - you determined it was the left side that is effected. So you are doing the Epley for the left side, correct?  The half somersault is another procedure that can be done that is sometimes more effective for people.  It is not as proven as the Epley, but it also does not provoke symptoms as harshly.  I have never done the Brandt-Daroff - but others seem to recommend it. Update on my condition - I finally tried the 'half-somersault' maneuver and it seems to be helping with the residual dizziness. I am wondering if there were still some particles in the ear canal that Epley was not getting. I also think the half-somersault is also a lot easier to perform yourself. Good video here: ( Six month update. For about a week now my symptoms seemed to have disappeared almost completely. I can only think of 2 things it might be. First, about a week ago I did an Epley maneuver but let my head fall back at a greater angle than I had before. Second, I started taking vitamin D3 supplements. Unfortunately both of these happened simultaneously so I am not sure which one has helped, or if it was both.", "My BPPV started a couple months after getting the COVID vaccine.  It happened to me approximately 2 weeks after my 2nd Pfizer shot. I have been feeling better but I still feel lightheaded and a bit dizzy from time to time. Mine started soon after my second shot (Moderna) 2-3 weeks after in May. Did not go away until a couple of weeks ago after an appointment with an ENT doctor. Mine started 3 months before getting the vaccine. What did the ENT do? I got this from covid That sucks. Im sorry. I got mine in one ear almost 3 wks after the first Pfizer shot and then in the other ear abt 4 weeks after the 2nd shot. Still worth it to get the vax tho! My BPPV resolved right after I did those exercises fir it that i found only where you lay down and then turn head in certain ways. Worked like a charm. Yeah I dont regret getting it. I just want this dang vertigo to do away. The epley maneuver to the right ear. The ENT will examine you to determine what is needed. It felt like it got worse at first but after a few days of doing it at home, it completely went away, for now at least. Same for me. Got my first episode 4 weeks after 2nd moderna. Maneuvers made it go away, had residual effects for 4 days then went way. Was fine for 3 months, now it is happening again.", "Ginkgo Biloba for BPPV Prevention? I read a few previous posts where people have said that Gingko supplementation was recommended to them by a doctor or health professional to both aid in recovery AND help prevent future episodes.  I was hoping that those who take it can elaborate a little more.  Have they still been taking it?   Anyone take it and did not help?   I am thinking about taking it but since my bppv episode 3 months ago I am hesitant to take anything that affects my brain. I actually saw an ( about this, but cannot confirm myself. Also, BPPV has to do with mechanics of calcium crystals not brain. From what I have gathered so far, the most basic advice would be to make sure sufficient D3 levels - if you supplement, ensure it is with K2, or if you do not, spend lots of time in the sun, preferably while eating kale  (K2 makes sure D3 does not mess up calcium absorption). See ( about D3-BPPV relationship. Also, regular hydration is important. when i spoke to my ent (ear nose and throat) dr, she said drs really dont know what causes bppv. yes, there is plenty of theories. which tells me that if drs know know what causes bppv then drs probably dont have a great idea how to prevent it.\n\nthe only day to day that i try to follow to help keep bppv in check is to try not to move my head to quickly or stand too quickly to loosen those rocks/crystals. wife thinks small rocks only \ud83e\udd23", "BPPV or Anxiety? Two Fridays in a row (Oct.29, November 5th). I experienced some type of vertigo where, it was not a 360 degree spin but when I closed my eyes I felt the room tilting a lot. The worst part was the severe off-balance that went on for about 3 hours. The first time this happened I went to urgent care and they blasted some wax out of my ear and it seemed to go away. I figured that was that and went on with my life. Then last Friday it happened again and this time I saw my doctor about it. She thought the wax was not the issue and that I might have BPPV. She wants to wait and see if it will resolve on its own but, though I have not had the vertigo again, my balance has been bad. Not rough seas bad, more like walking on the deck of a passenger ferry. Thing is, I have a history of anxiety and panic attacks so I am not sure if my balance issues this week are because of BPPV or just anxiety...It seems strange that I would not have these balance issues after the first instance, but have now persisted after the second instance when I realized this vertigo could happen again! The one good thing I suppose is that I have not had any issues sleeping. I can lay on my back, and both sides without feeling that vertigo feeling I did when this first started.\n\nSo, long story short. Is it time to bug my GP to give me a referral to a vestibular PT? Or should I take her advice and wait a few weeks? Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* I would say see an ENT or PT; they will be able to do the Dix-Hallpike and determine what side is the problem if it is BPPV, and then do a maneuver and give you directions for after it (sleep instructions, etc.). The longer you put off addressing it, the longer your body will take to bounce back. \n\nGood luck! Thanks! Got the referral from my doctor for vestibular PT just a few minutes ago. \n\nI know my symptoms are not as severe as some folks on this sub but, whenever vertigo happens it is scary. Glad this sub exists! They might not be as severe as someone else\u2019s, but you are still experiencing them and they are still disrupting your day-to-day\u2014 that is important, and nobody here will discount your experience (it is a very good board!).\n\nGlad you are getting help and I hope you feel better shortly. I am not a professional about this stuff, but to me, anxiety makes me off balance a lot. I had really bad vertigo last year, come to find out after a MRI, I had a mastoid effusion. Took allergy meds religiously and it cleared up.\nHave you had a MRI yet? I have had bppv for over 25 years. Sometimes it presents as the constant severe spinning with head movement/when laying down. \n\nOther times I get one big spin and then an off balance in my head feeling like you describe. \n\nSo it is definitely possible it could be that. However vestibular neuritis can also present in the way you are describing. Were you sick with a cold or anything recently?\n\nGlad to hear that you got the referral! They will be able to quickly test for bppv and go from there. Interesting, my doctor also mentioned it could a virus. I did have a cold about a month before this started...The only other thing she mentioned was that she and a massage therapist I saw recently noticed a lot of neck and jaw tension. In fact, the night before I had some bad tmj tightness, but, I have dealt with that on and off for several years.\n\nJust curious, when you feel off-balance do you still have a sense of motion when sitting still? For me, it is very slight, like a small little pulse when I sit still. No spinning or tilting, just the tiniest nudge like feeling. Yes!! Like I can be sitting on the couch watching tv and feel like I am moving as opposed to the room spinning. \n\nThe physical therapist, so as long as they specialize in vestibular issues, should be able to figure it out for you!! Glad to hear that it is possibly not just in my head! Does it ever eventually go away for you? Or do you need treatment for it to stop (like epley's maneuver)?", "I was diagnosed BPPV but are these symptoms because of it. The past 2 months suddenly I started to feel super super dissociated and dizzy which caused me so much anxiety and i feel so weird. I did everything MRI EEG and everything i can possibly check. Went to the ENT today and did the VENG test with the glasses and the red dot thing. He said i might be having bppv and an inner ear problem. I feel like sometimes when i lay down im on a boat and i afeel so weird and everything else says im fine. I experienced this 3 years ago and then it went and now it is suddenly back and its creeping me out cuz it feels like derealization and everything around me feels weird. He told me to do the Semont maneuver for 2 weeks and then we will check again. So anyone had these symptoms?  Thank you. did your ent dr do the epley on you? if not go back and ask for it. its resolved mine on one visit. Did you have dissociation as a symptom? No he did it only while the glasses of the VENG is on The VENG test is the glasses they put and there is a red dot i have to follow and they shake my head to see my eye movement that sounds similar to the dix-hallpike maneuver. that maneuver determines which side someone is affected. the epley resolves the affected side by repositioning the crystal that dislodged in your ear...assuming it truly is bppv. Have you had dissociation and feeling weird when you had all this ? No I just felt dizzy and some nausea Is it fixed or are you still going through it ? one visit to an ent dr. did the dix-hallpike maneuver to figure out which side was affected and then the ent properly performed the epley on me, twice, and my bppv was resolved.", "More than BPPV? Hey all. 30F here in the US. I have been suffering from dizziness since January 11th, 2021. Long story short, do not really know what caused it, but I did have a CT scan with contrast (to make sure pulmonary embolisms were dissolved), and 6 hours later had intense dizziness with spinning clockwise. \n\nI tried to brush it off as being tired, but as soon as I tried going to bed I started vomiting and could not stop. 12 hours later, went to the ER.  They did bloodwork, another CT scan with no contrast, and a brain MRI. The only thing they found in the brain MRI was this: \n\nMinimal hyperintense foci in the white matter of the right corona radiata.\nThe appearance is nonspecific. This could represent minimal chronic microvascular disease. The history questions the possibility of multiple sclerosis and this could represent tiny foci of demyelination. Most often such minimal foci are idiopathic with no clinical correlate.\n\nHowever, that demyelination has been there since 2016 on a previous MRI. I used to suffer some wicked headaches, switched oral contraceptives and did not have an issue since. I am no longer on oral contraceptives due to them causing pulmonary embolisms (it is been a hell of a year for me).\n\nAnyway, ER diagnosed me with vertigo, suspicious of vestibular neuritis but said it was more likely was BPPV. Went to PT, she confirmed BPPV on my right, did the epley maneuver, and the spinning has gone away. PT suspected something is off with my right eye and I should pursue neurology. \n\nBut I have lingering dizziness with nausea. I am living on scopolamine patches and Zofran.  I have some loud tinnitus in my ears, particularly on the right. Went to neurology, they did a round of bloodwork looking for autoimmune issues and all tests look okay. He referred me to ENT. They cannot see me until March but I am on a cancelation list. \n\nI am at my wits end. I cannot drive. Daily tasks are a real struggle. I have 2 kids doing school from home. I am attempting to work from home. I am trying to look for the positive, but I am slowly sinking into a depression here. \n\nAnyone experience something similar? I know that BPPV can sometimes have lingering dizziness, and I have scoured the resources on this page and I just cannot find relief.\n\nEdit: typo - fixed \"contract\" to \"contrast\" in 3rd sentence I am just going to keep this short and sweet, I felt I could relate to some of the things you are saying. Something to look into, an ophthalmologist and a neurologist. I do not know for sure but something else to rule out is iih. It is what I am dealing with right now and a lot of doctors overlook it... it is worth a shot. Just looked at the symptoms for this. I do get blurred vision off and on, but my ringing in my ears is pretty steady. Definitely going to ask both my primary and neurologist about this. I would assume they would have seen that swelling on the CT scan and brain MRI on January 12th, but I realize things can change quickly. I do not have vision insurance but I think I need to just pay out of pocket to rule out all possibilities.  \n\nThank you for the suggestion and good luck. This stuff is no fun! I guess sometimes it does not show up on scans but typically an optometrist or ophthalmologist will know right away, it is worth getting checked by one for sure. I would tell them you want to rule it out have them check your optic nerves which I am sure they would anyways. \nNo fun at all! I wish you luck too! Not easy not having answers and feeling like your suffering. Thank you! I am going to find a local ophthalmologist and get an appointment set up. Thank you! I am going to find a local ophthalmologist and get an appointment set up. You are welcome. Good luck. After my first intense bout, followed by the epley- I was nauseous and dizzy for weeks afterwards. Some weeks all I could do was take Dramamine all day in order to function. But that does not mean you do not have something else going on too. I made it a point to take vitamin d everyday, exercise, and avoided sleeping on the affected side. It eventually subsided but seems to come back about once a year, but not nearly as bad. Good luck- I wish you the best- being dizzy and nauseous SUCKS! Oh man. I am sorry you go through that. I definitely feel ya on living on Dramamine to function. Every time I take the scopolamine patch off it is unbearable. I have tried to go as long as possible without it, and and within 24 hours I am so sick again. Yesterday I tried going without it and I was literally in tears 5 or 6 times just worrying about how the hell I am going to function in the future. I coach youth soccer in the spring and fall, and at this point I cannot even imagine lugging the ball bag to my car and driving there!\n\nTrying that whole \"take it one day at a time\" advice, but days are blurring into weeks at this point. \n\nI am hoping this is just that- residual from BPPV, but I am still pursuing all the specialist doctors which is exhausting on its own. \n\nThank you for your perspective. I am suffering similar instances. Mines been around since October 2020. Cannot figure out what is wrong with me. It is making me depressed too, the fact of not knowing. It is hard for me to enjoy daily tasks. I am sorry to hear your facing similar issues. \n\nThe ENT doctor ruled out being caused my ears. So, now I am trying to go to a balance center where they can do some other tests, and my primary is talking about a neck MRI, too. I am getting a second opinion from another neurologist,  but that is not until March 11th.\n\nI feel like the ringing in my ears will never go away at this point. Sometimes it is deafening if I think about it too much and the room is too quiet. \n\n know it is hard to stay positive. I had a melt down today over it because I was feeling nauseous after trying to keep the patch off for more than 12 hours. Never fails, right back to being green around the gills every time. Then I become irritable, too, with my husband and kids. I snapped over something so trivial, and was bawling my eyes out. All three of them just wrapped around me with love and held me. I am so used to taking care of everyone else, I feel guilty that I cannot give them my best right now. \n\nHave you had much testing done? I hope we both can find relief soon. I actually just went to a new ENT today and he did BPPV tests and I had an audio test done, and his conclusion was that it was not BPPV. He suggested it is probably neurological. I saw PT a few weeks ago who showed me how to do epley maneuver but did not test for BPPV - he just took my primary doctors opinion \ud83d\ude44 anyways, I guess moving forward I will go see a neurologist. What happened when you went to see a neurologist? I am sorry your in so much. At least you seem to surrounded and comforted by family. Well guys, it is March and I have had a c-spine MRI that found bone spurring, reverse cervical lordosis,  mild thecal sac narrowing and mild narrowing of the right foramen - all screaming degenerative disc disease at the c-5 and c-6 vertebrae. \n\nI see a neurologist on March 11th, we will see if she thinks any of it correlates to my dizziness/ floaty-ness.", "Highly recommend BPPV video on r/medicine: Vertigo myth: BPPV is diagnosed when you perform a Dix-Hallpike test, the patient gets dizzy, and you see nystagmus  Worth a watch! Thankyou for sharing \ud83d\udc4d Awesome video! Again - I am so thankful I was able to find a vestibular therapist that was knowledgeable in all of this and took such good care of me! (After 3 previous episodes with sketchy care and docs that did not understand BPPV) Nice.  Now only if modern medeicine could develop a pill to help prevent BPPV from happening in the 1st place.  :)", "Looking for some help with possible BPPV :( Alright, for starters I have raging health anxiety, and anxiety in general. I know anxiety can mimic many symptoms of so many different things... probably one of the most annoying things about it! \n\nFor the past 3 days, I have been extremely dizzy. I spoke with my mom who has what she referred to as \"transitional vertigo\" (google corrected it to BPPV). She said when the dr held his finger to her eye lid while it was closed, he could feel her eye moving, and that is one of the ways he confirmed her vertigo. \n\nI notice that that is what I feel too when I hold my finger to my closed eye lid (not always though) \n\nI do not necessarily feel the room spinning, just like I am on a boat and swaying, or my head is spinning. \n\nI notice I have some difficulty with my vision. It is not necessarily blurry, but unfocused and like I cannot really concentrate/theres too much going on???\n\nMy head feels foggy. \n\nI went for a walk earlier and just felt shaky in my legs. I guess somewhat out of balance. \n\nOver all, I just do not feel right. I am super concerned that I am just dying or something horrible. \n\nI know I have to, nd I will, be making an appointment with my dr. Unfortunately due to covid, she may only be doing phone appointments, but she takes client in on an emergency basis (and currently my anxiety is nearing a 10 right now, so hopefully that will be considered). \n\nAny tips, advice, or support would be appreciated! Thanks for reading :) Hey, look into a physical therapist that treats vestibular issues. They know a lot more than a family doctor Do you have someone available who could watch your eyes while you check for BPPV yourself? Or try taking a video? Someone who has experience with bppv like an ENT or physical therapist might be a better person to see instead of a family doctor.\n\n Yep - find someone that specializes in dizziness.  Even a neurologist or ENT does not always know enough about BPPV to help treat it.\n\nIf you google Dix Hallpike, that is the maneuver that can test for BPPV.  It is easy to do.  There also is a great video in this forum from a few weeks ago that shows it. If you do get the intense 30ish seconds of severe vertigo with nystagmus - continue to do the Epley maneuver to try to fix it. The Dix Hallpike is essentially the first step of the Epley.  The severe vertigo/nystagmus happens with a position change, and is basically the loose crystal in your ear moving around your ear canal. As it moves, your body tries to compensate and rebalance you (thus the brief vertigo - until it settles). I tried getting my boyfriend to watch my eyes when I did that, but he could not anything obvious. I could still feel my eyes twitch when I pressed my forefinger lightly to my closed eye lid though. I did see that posted in this sub before I made my post, so I tried it out. My bf said he could not see if my eyes were really twitching, but I could feel them twitch when I pressed my forefinger to my closed eye lid. \n\nI did feel like garbage doing it though. \n\nI will be looking into appropriate diagnosing. Unfortunately, as I said above, I have got so much anxiety, and my anxiety likes to mess around and mimic anything it feels like somedays. It is extremely uncomfortable:( Thanks you! Will look. I know - anxiety totally makes everything worse!  Did your eyes twitch while testing the right or left? You can do the Epley on whichever side seemed to be effected. You may get the unpleasant vertigo as you move through the different positions of the Epley as the crystal rotates around the ear canal. There is also the 'Half Sommersault' maneuver that does not provoke the vertigo as bad that you could try if you have determined which side is effected.  Best wishes to you! Vertigo is no joke. It is horrible. And anxiety is not much fun either. I hope you get some answers and get this resolved soon. More so on the left, I think. But still twitched on both sides. \n\nI will look into what you mentioned! Thank you so much for the advice \u2764 I would get into a dr ASAP. If you are anxious about bppv, but do not know if you have it, your anxiety can make things worse. I have bppv and the anxiety around it makes it worse so get a diagnoses. People self-diagnosing is not good. Absolutely, I posted to make sure it was a valid concern to bring up. My old family dr brushed me off a lot bc of my anxiety. Ya, and they wonder why our anxiety is so high. IVe seen my GP, OB/GYN, ENT, urgent care, audiologist, PT and now I am going the naturopathic route and there is still no clear answer. BPPV yes, but why it happens the same time every month is my question. Good luck and let us know. Yup... she was honestly OKAY with telling me that nothing was wrong even though a STACK of reports from crisis lines and after hour dr offices were sitting on her desk... \n\nWill keep ya updated!

Hi all, i am glad i found this subreddit as I am slightly worried. \nI am a 22 year old female, profoundly deaf and I just experienced really bad dizziness (room was spinning like 180 degrees every time i blinked). I have had tinnitus more or less since I was 7 years old. \n\nOn Friday I took my cochlear implant out and it helped with the dizziness but then I was sick all day Saturday (not sure if this is linked?) \n\nSun-Thursday (today) and I still have slight dizziness. I went to the docs and they want to refer me to the ear, nose and throat specialist. \n\nIs this Vertigo? I know I do not expect a diagnosis but I am just asking for experiences from someone who have been through this before. \n\nMany thanks Whenever you open you eyes, and find the world spinning.. Yeah, that is BPPV. Do not worry, a couple of medicines and it will be obay within a week or so. Try finding the direction in which when you bend your neck downwards causes these, and prevent doing that. It may come again after an year or so. Thank you for commenting, so bending the neck downwards makes it worse? \nI am on medication right now I have to take 3 tablets a day for 7 days but I do not think they are helping much!! Looking down one is common, it is there for me as well.You have to basically take care of left and right. The thing you have to do, Is to lie down and wait for about 5 seconds.. Turn your head left wait for about 5-6 seconds and then towards right, again wait for another 5-6 seconds. Now you have to realise that turning which side made it worse.\n\n*The theory behind in simple words..*\nThink of your ear canal as an hourglass. It got two compartments, A and B. The sand should remain in A (that is normal) while for us, some of it went down into the B somehow.\n\nYou must be wondering, why should you even find which of your ear got it? Yea, valid question and the answer is to find which of the compartment is normal and which one's abnormal. You get this dizziness because the sand seeped out to the wrong compartment and you have to put it back (with a process called maneuvering). How is it going to work? Just use gravity.\n\nI will tell you mine example.\nMy left ear is affected. Whenever I turn towards right side while lying on bed or somewhere, I get those horrors and this is because my normal compartment is in the left ear and it somehow seeped into the wrong compartment located somewhere in the middle (through ear canal). What I did was, rotated my head in such a way (while lied down) that the crystals (yes, crystals in this case) move back to their respective place. Do this multiple times a day, it will take patience..\n\nWhen you are completely fine (BPPV) gone, then you just do not turn your head to that position (right side in my case) (prevent doing that). Is it going to come back? Yea, it can, maybe about in an year or two.. But it will not if you take care which side not to turn around while lying on your bed sleeping.\n\nSo why this happens? \n\nOur brain calculates that whether we are spinning, experience some G force (sitting in a space rocket, or in space) based on feedback from our eyes as well as the fluid in ear canal. When these crystals break and reach there, they create a literal disturbance, which is why we see everything spinning.\n\nSorry for the long paragraph lol.. I wish it helps.. :)\n\nPS: made up the A and B compartment thing just for explaining lol, do not want doctors attacking me xD\n\nAlso, the medication is basically to prevent you from puking all day long and some for making you fall asleep.. Sounds like it. I had a spell last fall and it took me a few weeks before the dizziness abated. For me, the key to feeling better was cutting alcohol and caffeine. I do not know why but any excessive drinking would set me back and if I drank any coffee I made no progress getting better. \n\nGood luck. If it is BPPV it will get better. Bppv is a spinning dizziness provoke by bending down, looking up, or rolling in bed (also getting out of bed...) it a vertigo provoked by changes in head position. It can be helped with the Epley maneuver easily found on YouTube, although I recommend a physical therapist or ENT perform this. Medicine will not help it, it is a mechanical problem with a mechanical solution. Medicines will only mask nausea and dizziness until it passes (which is 50/50 without treatment within the first 2 months)", "input thoughts advice please hey i am a 23f and i have been suffering with bppv episodes since i was 15 or younger. neither of my parents have it but my grandma does so maybe it is genetic? either that or my ears just suck at holding the crystals in place. really only effects me once or twice a year and maybe if im lucky it will skip a year but has always came back. i remember when i was younger i did not know what was going on and i just had to lay down for a while and not move my head. then over the years i figured out what was happening looked up the epley maneuver and learned how to do it on my own. most of the time i wake up with the vertigo. i have had to crawl out of bed literally on my hands and knees and go to a confined space (like a bathroom or something) and i just lay there until i work up the courage to do to epley. bc once you start it literally makes you so dizzy and your eyes do that weird thing and it is honestly just horrifying. i usually have to do it a few times and then my vertigo disappears. BPPV is honestly the worst i would not wish it on anyone. it is like actual torture. scary horrifying terrifying all of the above. anyways i usually only get it in the morning when i am just waking up. i am assuming i could have thrashed around too much in my sleep. the only other time i got it was once when i was starring down at my phone for too long and looked up too quick. usually when i am waking up tho. does anyone else get it first thing? also side note i struggle with severe anxiety but take meds. i think getting my anxiety under control does help the episode to be slightly less severe. also how is there only 1.5 k members in this sub? do more people not struggle with it? i was thinking about going to therapy for it..anyone have success? i would probably do anything to keep the episodes at bay. even 1 a year is one too many. please share input thoughts advice. thanks!!! I would start with the two stickied posts at the top of this sub for tips for prevention. Lots of good stuff to be found through them! Hi! I started suffering from bppv when I was 12. I am in my mid 30s now. When I was younger I just referred to them as \u201cdizzy spells\u201d. My parents took me to countless doctors and no one could figure out that it was bppv. I highly recommend that you find a physical therapist that is well versed with vestibular disorders. You can go to vestibular dot org and search for one. And yes, cognitive behavioral therapy helps a whole lot too, to help you find ways to combat health anxiety surrounding this hi thank you so much for replying!! i feel like the only person in the world with this sometimes ? how often do you get vertigo ? do you go to physical therapy regularly? So in my teens, I would get it pretty often.. 2-3x a year lasting 2 weeks at a time. Then around age 18 I saw an allergist and did allergy shots, Zyrtec and nasal spray and did not have any attacks until age 25. At 25, I got a condition called vestibular neuritis (where virus attacks your inner ear nerve).. it was AWFUL after that I had bppv for a very long time. Maybe like 5 months? And then I would get it every few years 1-2x a year usually during allergy season. \n\nA game changer for me was to religiously take 5000IU of liquid vitamin d3 3-4x a week. Once I started that I did not have any attacks for about 5 years. \n\nThis last bout of bppv I got in March and I still have it. I made it worse by doing home maneuvers and seeing two physical therapists who were not well versed in treating more stubborn cases of bppv\u2014 that is why I mentioned definitely seeing someone who only does vestibular PT and not just dabbles in it. \n\nI just started seeing that PT last Friday. Thus far we have done 5 Epley maneuvers and 2 semont maneuvers, as I have BPPV in both ears and both types! She said that is most likely the result of me doing home maneuvers and making it worse. i am going to start taking the d3 forsure thankyou. do you notice more episodes happening during extra stressful/anxious points in your life? thankfully the epley has always worked to resolve it for it but i heard if you do not do it an exact certain way then it will not work. i am thinking of going to physical therapy but i will make sure the person knows what they are doing. it sucks bc i feel so alone in this. not a lot of people get it it seems: and you definitely do not hear many cases like us where it starts around 11 or 12. Exactly. It can be so depressing. Especially because we look \u201cfine\u201d on the outside. And yes stress is a huge trigger for me! have you struggled with anxiety since childhood ? i definitely have..wondering if that is a reason i developed bppv so early on.. I did not. But I do believe I used to have lots of ear infections as a kid and then sinus infections as a teen, which I think definitely contributed to it", "First BPPV Episode from Quick Head Movement in Bed Woke up this morning and did this really fast movement to get my head to the other side and immediately felt vertigo for about 10 seconds. Very scary experience, I figured maybe I just moved to fast and was dizzy. I get out of bed to use the restroom and realize it is still there when I get up from the toilet.\n\nI am still not too freaked out at this point so I lay down quickly thinking it would help and get a violent spin for 30 seconds and it is at this moment I am freaking out telling my wife that the room will not stop violently spinning. I have no idea what is going on.\n\nI hit up YouTube and discover that I may have BPPV due to crystals getting dislodged. They probably got dislodged when I did a fast head maneuver to look at the other side of the room. Thankfully I found some relief by doing the half somersault. I have been repeating the exercise every 15 minutes. Things seem to have gotten much better but every now and then when I do the final position I get a very quick bout of vertigo, lasts like a few seconds. I am not sure if it is because the crystals are now in the correct place or if they fell back down and caused dizziness.\n\nMy case seems rather mild compared to what I am reading but the damage that is done mentally is probably worse than the vertigo itself. I am worried about triggering it again so I have been limiting my movements. Every time I go to do the somersault I am more scared every time because I do not want to trigger it.\n\nIt is been about 2 hours since my episode and I am feeling a better but I cannot shake the feeling of it not being completely gone. I just took some food in so I will try to resume some other exercises to see if it triggers it.\n\nAny tips for what is hopefully a mild case? First of all, welcome to our exclusive club that no one wants to join. The bad news is that it freaky as hell. And the spinning is catastrophic. But the good news is that it curable and it sounds like you have made good progress on it. I joined the club approximately 2 years ago. Since making my crystals go away, with the help of an experienced ENT, mine has not returned. \n\nBut not all ENTs are experienced with BPPV. I suggest you find a balance center (sometimes called dizzy clinic) near you. Mine was completely gone in one day.  Once you are in experienced hands and have this thing kicked in the butt, it gives you a lot of confidence and the fear quickly subsides. Good luck. Feel free to post followup questions. You can read my post, I had a mild case like yours, went to an ent who suggested I do the epley. After two days of epley it went away and I was very thankful and completely dropped doing the exercise. Week later it comes back 100x worse, and I cant even do epley now because if how bad it is. Im even going to physical therapy in a few days, something I would have never thought Id do. I recommend you precisely discover which ear is affected, and do the epley thoroughly until youre 100% sure its gone. If its both ears, do one at a time and be very thorough. Thank you, never thought I would be waking up with this condition. Seems like it does not discriminate too since I see people of all ages posting about this debilitating experience.\n\nI am going to see a dizzy clinic this upcoming week. Do you mind sharing around how much these visits cost? Seems very specialized so I am not sure my insurance would cover it.\n\nAlso what maneuver did the clinic use for you that helped? Did you try doing the half somersault? Seems to have helped me after doing it 5 times. Not sure if it is completely gone because I am so dizzy but I hear if you did it right that there will be some residual dizziness. I will update my post tonight if it comes back after doing the maneuver.\n\n Actually, I did not go to a Balance Center myself. First, I went to one ENT who (thankfully) told me that he was not experienced enough with BPPV to treat me. This guy is rare. Some ENTs and other doctors will accept you as a patient, but not really know how the best treatment. BPPV can be tricky and if you have a complicated case, you can lose a lot of time before it goes away. My first ENT recommended that I visit another ENT who had worked in a vestibular clinic for a year. He knew she could help me. So, I only lost a day. She did the Epley maneuver with me in her office and gave me instructions on how to do it at home. But after doing it once at home, I realized I could no longer trigger my vertigo and I understood I was cured. \nThis is why I suggested a balance center. These guys see BPPV everyday. They will almost certainly help you immediately.\n\nJust make sure that whoever treats you, has a LOT Of experience with vestibular disorders. If you are in the USA and you have health insurance make sure they are in your provider network. Contact your insurance and ask. Can we assume the half somersault worked?", "Fluid in ear? I for sure think i have an inner ear problem. Past few days i have had dizziness and tinnitus and my ears feel full. On a few occasions i will be walking and out of nowhere my right ear will will suddenly feel very full for a second and it nearly throws me off my feet. \n\nI was just doing the epley maneuver and when tilted back i can feel fluid moving around in my inner ear. Anyone else feel that? Could this be bppv? Bppv is usually positional. So, getting in and out of bed, or rolling over, bending over, looking up etc causes the vertigo. \n\nI am not a doctor but I was tested for all sorts of vestibular disorders like VN and M\u00e9ni\u00e8res before they checked for BPPV as testing for that first would make everything else worse if it was not BPPV. \n\nHaving that much fluid and pressure in your ears with tinnitus sounds like it may be something g bother than BPPV to me. I would go to a ENT/balance center and have them check you out for everything, including bppv. \n\nHope you feel better soon! xx You may have endolymphatic hydrops. Which can progress to Menere\u2019s disease (in my case) or not (my neice so far) \nI also suffer from BPPV as 90 percent of the time my vertigo is positional and resolves with the maneuvers. I am really scared it might be menieres, since it is rare a permanent Hi, any news? Did you get your ears examined yet? No news, have not seen a doctor. My symptoms have gone away for the time being Lucky you, I am happy for you. I am sure i still have an issue, believe me. Just have not been dizzy and my tinnitus is not as noticeable right now I can suggest you to visit a vestibular system physio therapist or a vertigo specialist ENT, or preferably both to analyze exactly what you have, it might take more than 1 meeting, im going through this myself right now.", "Went to vestibular therapy again a year later. This time I got Epley exercises. Last year when I started having symptoms I did not have any reaction to the Epley, but today it felt like the room was tilting when I laid on my problem ear so I have some Epley exercises to do each night. Gives me hope the doctors are pinpointing something maybe? Not sure what, but something is better than nothing, which is where I am at 1.5 years later. Does not sound like classic BPPV but my vertigo has been anything but a textbook definition of anything. Thanks for reading. Do you also do vestibular therapy?   Different from Epleys and other maneuvers.  Helps a ton with residual dizziness. Yes, I started today and will likely do once a week. Definitely feels like it is shaking things up. Last year I was not as sensitive, it seemed. Good to check on everything. Thanks, this is good to know. Did they give you homework?  I do about 15 minutes of stuff a day.  Gaze stabilization and balance stuff.  Got a cool little app that guides me through it all. She mentioned gaze stabilization issues but my homework is Epley on my bed 2x each night. Husband helped tonight, but I like app idea especially if I need to do it multiple times a day (I told my vt I could not handle exercises I had to all the time, so she was good about giving this). Trying to be in a better headspace this year. Last year I was rather cynical and stopped going back after the pandemic reopened the clinic. Good I went this year as it feels like any motion of my body makes me dizzy as of late. The gaze stuff helped me a lot.  Ask your PT to load you up with homework.  For me, I like feeling pro-active about it.  Makes me feel I am doing shit to help myself.  Good luck!!! I agree. As much as I sometimes want to fall on my moving bed and give up, it feels much better and healthier to do something about it and progress. Thanks for the encouraging words! :) That is progress, congratulations! I also had to do weekly Epleys with my ENT for 3 months, but it did not improve my residual dizziness. Then he gave me vestibular exercises as homework every morning and that did the trick eventually. :)  \n\n\nNow whenever I get an attack, I would do the Epleys first, around 2-3 times until the tilted sensation disappears and I am just left with the residual dizziness. Then I would spend the next days doing vestibular exercises every morning until my brain re-balances itself.  \n\n\nLife does not need to stop when you have vertigo. There are people with various illnesses and disabilities but still, make their lives meaningful and active. &gt;:)\n\n:) All helpful tips\u2014thank you! :) The app sounds neat! Is it clinic-specific or a general app anyone can use? Clinic specific. Hello there, not sure if I have BPPV, I have been experiencing vertigo for about six months, but not the typical room spinning vertigo but feeling like I am floating and on a boat all day long. I started doing vestibular therapy about three weeks ago, and I have the same exact tilting feeling you are describing. I am starting to think the therapy is working since I have never felt this before. Yeah, strangely things are getting better and I only do 6 20 second exercises each night! Happy to hear it might be helping. What is the name of the app? I got through doc office.  They load exercises on there.   Not useful without therapist putting stuff on there", "Anterior BPPV Does anyone else have issues with this? I was just diagnosed with this form of BPPV. For forever(a year)I have just kind of suffered through it. FINALLY a doctor sent me to a vestibular therapist to get myself worked out. It is really, really intense. Some days I cannot even move my eyes around the room without vomiting. I do not know if I have any triggers because every time it comes on I either wake up with it, or it wakes me up. Sometimes the maneuvers help, but here lately they have not helped at all. I had a bout of it today that lasted seven hours, and once it started to slow down I would get these really intense moments of it again. I am at a loss. I have no clue what to do. Hi there. I too have had bppv in the anterior canal. For the first month my doctors and physical therapist did not even think I had bppv and thought it was neurological. The eply maneuver works wonders but not for the anterior canal. You have to do speak deep guided head hangs. Talk to your PT and/or Doctor. These help immensely My PT did the head hang last week, and it worked immediately. Now the vertigo  is back and the head hang is not working. I am out of work on FMLA right now, but I am really afraid I am going to have to quit my job. If the head hang is not working it is a different canal or residual dizziness. Contact you PT You can try the Epley, it is very common to get it in a different canal after having it somewhere first. Can try sleeping on an incline also. Hope you get relief!", "5th day of dizziness diagnosed with bppv.  \ni miss being normal. \nim 36 y/0", "Is it anxiety or vertigo? I have suffered with an anxiety disorder for years, I also have tinnitus which i have had since childhood. My weirdest and new worrying symptom is when i am driving on a motorway I almost feel like i am driving vertically upwards or downwards or I feel like i am upside down. Am I imagining it or could something actually be causing this? Thanks Does not sound like BPPV to me.  Not a doctor though. This does not sound like BPPV at all. You should see a doctor. Do you think it sounds serious? I definitely would not drive anywhere. I cannot say for sure, since I have only ever had bppv, but this sounds like you should see a doctor before you attempt to drive anywhere. Bppv is more like a sudden dizzy feeling, like you are suddenly totally falling-down drunk with no warning.  I do not know if it is anxiety, but it does not sound like BPPV To me it felt like violent spinning. But if I stayed still it was over in a few seconds. ", "BPPV or something else Hello everyone. I am super frustrated right now. About three months ago, I woke up with severe symptoms of BPPV. Crazy room spinning vertigo. Went to ENT, test came back negative, but I was still feeling really off / dizzy. About a month later, I had another episode of the room spinning vertigo. Went to see the ENT again that day, test came back negative once again. I only had the really bad room spinning symptoms first thing in the morning. Doctor basically said it is still probably BPPV but it is fixing itself and you are just suffering from a hangover like effect of the vertigo. Well it is been about two months since then, and I am still not back to normal. I went to ride my motorcycle to see if I was feeling better, and since I did that two days ago, my constant motion sickness is off the charts. I just always feel off, it is so frustrating.\n\nBasically, should I be worded this Is something other than lingering issues because of my bout with BPPV? I have seen accounts of people experiencing minor symptoms for months after being affected. It just really sucks living like this, I cannot do anything I love doing. I am also supposed to get on a plan in 9 days and fly home, and I am almost positive I am going to end up puking on the plane.  \n\nIs there a possibility this is a brain tumor? If not, is there anything I can do to speed up the recovery of my vestibular system and go back to normal?\n\nLike I said, ENT says it is BPPV but both times the test they did on me to induce the spinning came back negative. When I went to the ENT - he could not find anyting wrong.  From my impression - he did not seem at all interested in helping.  He performed the epley maneuver once and said nothing was wrong.  He refered me to a physical therapist that specializes in balance issues. \n\nUnlike the ENT - they performed the manuever more than once.  On the 3rd try, Veritgo hit when my head was rotated to the right..  They then performed it 2 more times and each time the spinning reduced significantly as they said it should only be performed no more than 3 times.  A week later \\ - they performed the maneuver 2x and no vertigo.\n\nSo.. I would suggest you find a physical therapist that specializes in balance issues as they will spend more than 15 minutes to try and figure out what is going on.\n\nOh - for the plane ride - try Dramamine Less Drowsy formula - it contains  Meclizine HCI 25mg. Thank you for the reply. I appreciate it. Unfortunately in my case Dramamine, meclizine etc make my motion sickness worse because I have hypo-vestibular function. Small percentage of the population, myself included, have the opposite reaction to medications like this.\n\nEdit: seems like the vast majority of experiences people have with ENTs are negative. Mine seemed similar, short meetings, did not seem too interested in helping me. Sorry to hear about your experience. Obligatory disclaimer that I am not a doctor, just a med student also with BPPV.\n\nDid doing the Epley/Semont maneuver for a couple of times (( help relieve your symptoms? If so it is very likely that it is BPPV because these maneuvers help you align the crystals in your ears.\n\n(Edit: Personally, neither myself nor my ER doc worried about \"which side the vertigo was coming from\", we just did the lie down suddenly with head to one side-eyes looking at the floor, wait for vertigo to settle, then quickly turn head to other side-eyes on the floor, wait for vertigo to settle, slowly roll on shoulder and get up, worked for me)\n\nI understand your fears, when I had my first episode of BPPV and was in the ER (because I was vomiting anything I eat or drink for 14+ hours) I thought I had something in my brain also. If you do not experience new onset headache, fevers/night sweats/random weight loss, twitching/unexplained weakness of your limbs etc. it would be unlikely that it is a brain tumour - those are statistically very rare.\n\nIf you have not already, have some Gravol with you and take it the next time the symptoms get worse. Unfortunately it will make you sleepy but it helped with my symptoms a lot.\n\nI hope you feel better soon. What about ginger root?  Or would that cause the same issue? Thank you very much for the reply. The thing I am still experiencing is lingering dizziness / motion sickness when doing things like driving or riding my motorcycle. The actual head spinning vertigo only happened in the morning, and no longer occurred when I would lay down / turn my head. It was so brief (the actual spinning), that I was not convinced it was BPPV. I did not even need to do the epley maneuver. The bad spinning just went away on its own in an hour or two. I just have horrible lingering dizziness, it is been months. I am sure ginger root would be fine. I can give that a shot. Part of my wants to take something that will just knock me out for the plane ride. Cannot get sick if I am asleep. Hm, so you have background dizziness (not vertigo), but also motion related... If you have a family doctor perhaps it is worth talking to them about it and get some basic bloodwork done if they see fit - especially if you also feel dizzy **at rest**. It could be nutritional/electrolyte imbalance/anemia/hormonal etc. Good luck! Oh..then you want to take Xanax .  She just popped a pill and slept on the plane. :) Actually not a bad idea lol Thank you for the reply. I have had blood work done a few times. Got a full blood planet and everything\u2019s normal except for elevated LDL due to hereditary circumstances. I do not really feel dizzy just sitting down, but definitely when doing certain movements. I used to be able to ride my motorcycle no problem, taking turns fast, accelerating quickly, braking hard etc. After my bout with vertigo a few months back I just cannot do those things anymore without getting super disoriented and nauseous. Do you think there is any possibility this was not BPPV since the vertigo itself subsided almost immediately? I think it is weird I would have such severe lingering motion sickness this long after having a bout with vertigo. Just joining today and I am so relieved to listen to others experiencing vertigo. I have gone to ENT, Vertigo Center, Balance Center, primary care doc etc. The Vertigo center tried to induce it to determine which ear is the problem and it did not work there (not unusual) but I was told they did not want to do Epley if they cannot narrow down which ear. The instructions they gave me were to videotape my eyes rolling around the next time it happens and to send it to them. Well I live alone and when the room is spinning, all I want to do is pray that it stops let alone get my cell phone ready to video tape my eyes. I have had several episodes more recently and it makes me crazy. I work full time and it is so hard to deal with when I wake up feeling sick. I just went to a chiropractor/acupuncturist and I am going to give it a try. I am also flying on Sunday and I am terrified. I had an episode on an airplane a couple years ago and it was so awful that they had to take me off the plane in a wheelchair but I had to get on another plane. So awful. I have meclizine and other prescriptions but they do not seem to scratch the surface once it hits. I will take the meds before I get on the plane but they have not helped in the past. Vertigo is really awful. I appreciate everyone is comments on here. May we be Vertigo free in 2021:) Really sorry to hear about your experiences. They sound awful. Vertigo really is the worst. I just got diagnosed with cochlear hydrops today, precursor to Meniers Disease. Got To go on a low sodium diet for the rest of my life. Part of me wishes I just had BPPV. Meniers disease sounds scary. I guess it can be pretty bad for some people and require surgery, even severing vestibular nerves. Thank you for sharing. I am sorry that you are going through this. What does a low sodium diet do? I keep reading about it and was wondering the connection. Vertigo is awful!! I guess the reason for the vertigo is an enlarged fluid sac inside of the inner ear. This I guess presses on some of the nerves and causes the vertigo. The way to get rid of the fluid is by eating less sodium, since sodium retains fluid in the body. They also have me on diuretics to help flush out the fluid as well. That makes sense. I appreciate the information. Let us hope 2021 is a Vertigo free year. Could not agree more", "It is back, after November 2019 episode. Lifelong sufferer. 24f. I have had bppv my whole life, from childhood onwards, and it caused so much school absence and misery and medical gaslighting, but it got much less common in teens and adulthood.\n\nChildhood episodes of incapacity could last until midday, or a few days at most. In adulthood I mostly forget that it exists, although tipping dentist chairs make me nervous and disoriented, it is not near the severity of an actual episode.\n\nBut last November I woke up with the worst adult episode ever, maybe worse than most of the childhood episodes, and I was stuck in bed for a week, barely eating and constantly vomiting. \n\nI lost weight (I am already naturally a bit underweight so I became a bona fide stick) and after a few days considered asking for an ambulance because I was desperate and wasting away from vomiting, even though I do not have much faith in medics helping me. It is not a wound they can staunch. I honestly craved death, I thought the dizziness would never end.\n\nIt shook me out of complacency and reminded me that this sh** is basically lifelong and I have to treat it as a chronic illness.\n\nI do not drink caffeine and do not have crazy salt spikes. The only identifiable trigger is sleepiness before bed, for some reason the natural melatonin spike(?) confuses my vestibular system, but it does not trigger full on episodes. I cannot identify many ways to prevent actual episodes, except extreme positional/sleep caution.\n\nI woke up with it today and immediately attempted the Epley Maneuver because it seemed to help last time but it has not worked so well, maybe it is just residual stuff and I will push myself a little harder to walk around later, but I feel so nauseous and miserable. I do not want this to be another long episode, I am so frustrated because I had plans for my day and now I am stuck in bed.\n\nWhen this strikes I make bargains with myself that I will never toss and turn ever again because nothing is worth getting bppv, but I cannot sleep deeply or comfortably on my back so that rule always goes out of the window. \n\nI cannot swallow nausea pills so I rely on mints. I just had to pause to vomit into a bedside bucket while writing this, so I am officially categorizing it as Pretty Bad. I might try Epley again later if I have the wherewithal or desperation. Right now I just want to go into the flop response and give up for a bit.\n\nBppv is so frustrating, it can destroy my life in an instant and all I can do is wait for recovery. There is not much more advice I can apply to my situation, I cannot see a specialist for various reasons, I just thought venting in this community might make me feel a little better. Because when I was a kid I felt so alone and confused and did not realize there was a group of people who also experienced and understood it. \n\nHere is hoping it is not a November 2.0 \ud83e\udd1e Ugh I am so sorry! I have seen studies that have correlated BPPV to low vitamin d so I take that daily now too. Cannot hurt right? I hope you feel better soon! Same thing here. Had it for about 16 years give or take now.\n\nIm super close to setting up a camera in the bedroom so I can see how I am sleeping when I get it.\n\nSupposedly there are some expensive (300$+) pads that will analyze your sleep and positions.\n\nBeing SUPER tired and working too hard with stress is a trigger for me too. Like if I am in ANY sort of state where I pass the fuck out (a beer, giant Meal, weed sometimes) there is a higher chance of getting it. But what is life without a little enjoyment Can you see a physical therapist? I did and it changed my life for the best, they are trained to do Epley and do other analysis. I am so sorry this is been happening to you again. Instead of Epley, look up half somersault on YouTube and give that a shot. I would be interested in seeing if that helps you at all. I have some additional thoughts, but Do not have time to spell them all out right now. I am so sorry. It is truly a miserable monster.  My last bout happened in December - and lasted two months.  The residual lasted 7 months and I felt so crappy. I kept seeing the vestibular therapist and made her keep testing me - as I was SURE I still had active BPPV.  And I did not.  My body had just grown so accustomed to being off balance - that it was having a hard time getting back to normal.  I am finally feeling 'almost' back to normal.  I have worked HARD at getting better and doing everything 'right.' Yet the fear of it coming back is incredible. Like, heaven forbid I actually get to have a few months where I feel good? This is my fourth episode.  The first happening about 3 years ago.  I sought help this last time and had a lot of testing done and worked with a vestibular therapist. I am hoping that since we worked to 'correct' it together - it may stay away a while longer this time!\n\nNot knowing what causes it is just horrible. It strikes everyone and anyone, when it wants. I have no know physical problems. I do not have a lot of caffeine. Salt intake is normal. Vitamin D levels are fine. And I am super active and fit. BPPV does not seem to care. It will strike when it wants.  I am working hard on not getting super tired/exhausted. Keeping stress levels down. And another thing that 'may' have triggered it was running races - as when I run THAT hard, I feel intense pressure in my head and my ears will thump. It is likely just a blood pressure thing.\n\nHang in there! I am fortunate I was not NEAR as sick as you currently are. But next time, it may be different.", "Been constantly dizzy for 1.5 years now. Long story short I have seen every doctor you could imagine due to me having eye strain and dizzy spells when walking through large buildings and when driving/riding in a car, and I am definitely dizzy once the car has stopped moving like at a red light or something like that. It is to the point where I cannot drive or go out alone. \nI also, often but not every time, get super super dizzy and lightheaded if I look up, or if I lay on my stomach and do a \"seal stretch\" or \"cobra stretch\" \n\nI have been told it is not bppv, but I do not know what else it could possibly be since my dizziness only occurs when I am in motion. Of course I am not expert but dang....I am really desperate to find a solution here.\n\nI was diagnosed with an eye condition and we thought that was the issue but unfortunately it was not as my vision has been corrected via vision therapy.\n\nAny suggestions, thoughts or tips would be beyond appreciated.\nThanks for reading. Have you been to a vestibular therapist?  I would try to that.  Most every Physical Therapy place should have one.   Ask your doc to get you there Be careful of staying on medications for years they can cause that. Also you could very possibly need to stay hydrated. Drink recommended amount of water daily. Take liquid B-12 Tri-Blend, liquid vitamin C, magnesium pill daily, liquid B Complex daily. A vitamin deficiency could cause that. VERY IMPORTANT- EXERCISE!!! Even if you get dizzy when working out. Take it easy and slowly work your way into exercise. \n\nDoing all these things may well help but will takes a few months to fully work but you should see improvements in first 2 weeks Hey thanks for reading and responding. I did actually a few months ago. Went through quite the barrage of tests over the course of about 2 1/2 - 3 hours. They said everything was fine which is why, at the time, I figured everything with my ears and vestibular system is fine. \nBut like I mentioned before, I am just puzzles as to why I would still be having dizzy spells/symptoms Thank you. I will have to be more aware of staying hydrated and maybe talking a multivitamin at the very least.\nAnd I guess you just gave me a new reason to start exercising lol A good physical therapist will give you homework to do (gaze stabilization,habituation,etc).  I go once a month and the give me stuff to do in-between. Your symptoms sound a lot like Binocular Vision Dysfunction.  I was watching a webinar on VEDA the other day where they were talking about lots of different causes for dizziness including MAV, SSCD, BPPV, and BVD.  \n\nI know you said you saw a vision therapist but I think this condition is different.  More to do with really subtle vertical eye misalignment.  They shared lots of helpful information about dizziness, esp while driving and in big stores. \n\nMight be worth a watch: \n\nAlso the doctor had this article on dizziness in the car \n\nHope these help! Have you been tested for visually induced dizziness? I would also suggest you check out /r/dizziness.\n\nHave you seen an ENT to rule out any vestibular issue? Also, if a possibility, you probably want to do an MRI, just to exclude that from the consideration.\n\nDo you (sometimes, this does not work always) feel a bit less dizzy if you close your eyes, when the symptoms are bad?\n\nYour symptoms intersect very much with what I have been dealing with. Based on my experience, I would  suggest checking two things:\n\n1. Finding a knowledgeable therapist (probably a physio or another similar therapy place that specializes in visual/neurological/concussion recovery - note: I have tried a few physio clinics that claim they specialize in 'vestibular therapy' and they were of zero help to me, because they were not treating VD with *optokinetic therapy*\\- check out ( for details). They should have training and equipment to diagnose nystagmus, and if that is the case, provide therapy to correct it.\n2. Finding a knowledgeable neck/head/TMJ physio or a similar therapist - tension and issues in upper back, shoulder or neck/jaw muscles can definitely cause dizziness on movements\n\nMy issues are a combination of the above (ENT and neurologist had no idea really what the causes are, and MRI came back clean). Took me a long time bouncing between therapists of all kinds,  until I found one that knew exactly how to diagnose 1. above, which cleared up most of my visually induced issues (like stores, neon lights, even walks outside that were making it impossible to me to function at any reasonable level; I have also had the exact same issue with dizziness while being driven, which slowly went away after 1. was fixed, but for a while I would get bad symptoms when we would stop at the lights or just stop and sit in the car without getting out - there is something called disembarkation syndrome, which is related to/a version of VD), and now I am finally able to distinguish it from 2. The good news is that this can be addressed via therapy and exercises, as long as you get the right therapist of exercises.\n\nAs the link above states, 1/VD can be caused by a variety of things, such as an episode of BPPV, vestibular neuritis, injury or any other cause of dizziness (which can be many - lack of certain vitamins, dehydration, food or environmental allergies etc.). It can be fixed regardless.\n\nIf you cannot find the therapist for either, there are enough DIY  resources that you can dry and they should probably work.  Feel free to ping me if you want more information or just to talk. I have struggled with a similar situation for a long time and it took me a while to discover what can help it. I know what such situation can do and how limiting it is, even if it is totally benign (as far as the medical system is concerned).", "It is returned sadly. Do I even have BPPV? Years ago I got sick. Do not really remember what I had but I remember that is when the dizziness started. After many depressed weeks of nothing going away I went and saw an ENT who gave me the Epley. Did not work. Maybe it did just a little bit it always came back. She later said it is potentially migraine related. I have been taking 25mg of Kolonopin for it since and it helped. Ever since then I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I was put on Nefazodone for depression and recently I have been tapering it off due to it causing liver issues in some patients. I went from 300mg to 200 and for the first week I was fine. Second week my dizziness came back. Nothing too bad but certainly noticeable. 2 days ago It got so bad my work called an ambulance and I was in the ER. Yesterday was awful and so was today. I have been trying to tell myself it is just the anxiety and me going off my meds but this is so debilitating. \n\nI do not know if it really is my meds, or if it is just my brain. Do I even have BPV at all or what else could it be? I would do anything in the world to be rid of this. I am at my wits end. I do not know who to see or what to do or anything. \n\nAny advice would be great. Thank you. Difficult to say. BPPV is usually triggered by a quick turn of the head in a certain direction. For example, mine only happened when I was lying on the bed and I turned my head to the left. Then the world was spinning like an amusement park ride from hell. It lasted about 10 seconds and then it stopped.  If I were standing up, I was fine.  \n\nWhat triggers your dizzy spells? I agree with /u/RehaDesign that BPPV is triggered by a quick head turn into a certain position.  BPPV can cause other types of dizziness over time if it is not corrected. And once corrected, it can cause residual dizziness.  Keep in mind that often the Epley does not work the first time for everyone. I had to do it 20 times over the course of 2 months.\n\nThe golden standard for testing for BPPV is the Dix Hallpike.  It is essentially the first step of the Epley (laying back quickly with your head turned to the side - head then extended past your shoulders).  If doing the first step to the Epley does not cause the 30ish seconds of severe vertigo with nystagmus (eye twitching), it is likely something other than BPPV.  A skilled doctor or therapist will do multiple tests, likely with goggles on your eyes to video your eye movement. The direction of the eye movement dictates which inner ear canal is effected, thus determine what type of therapy is indicated.\n\nAnxiety can definitely feed the dizziness as well. And ongoing dizziness can for sure cause depression and anxiety. If you could find a vestibular therapist (often they are in the regular physical therapy department), or find someone that specializes in dizziness.  There are so many different kinds of dizzy diagnoses - that many regular docs just are not well versed in all of them and just write you off, give you meds, and try to guess what is going on.\n\nI found my vestibular therapist was WAY more helpful than the ENT. Hi love,\nHm hard to say BPPV is more positional. If yours followed a illness, I would check into vestibular neuritis. As that is a possibility and can take years unfortunately to get better. \nI am sorry you are not doing well, I know the anxiety that comes with vestibular issues is draining. Just know you are not alone, and look into a balance center/dizzy clinic to get checked out. They can verify if it is BPPV or if something else is causing your dizziness.\nBest of luck. xx Anything triggers them. Pretty much just existing does. I remember the first time I saw you say you had to do the Epley 20 times, and I literally got sick just thinking about it. But I think I am going to be similar! The vertigo is a lot less severe at this point so each maneuver does not make me as horribly sick as the beginning, but I am probably on 10 or so at this point, over 3 weeks. My therapist is thinking my crystals either keep popping back out, or there may have been a clump at first and now just smaller ones. \n\nAnd, thank you for always taking time to provide such thorough and helpful responses. This sub is so great. When doing the Dix-Hallpike test there does not have to be nystagmus for it to be positive for BPPV. Most commonly there is nystagmus, but there have been cases where no nystagmus was present and it was in fact BPPV. Just fyi lol /u/mcurri02 yes, you are correct.  And sometimes nystagmus is present and it is not BPPV.  I was generalizing and going with the majority.  That is why seeing a specialist is always the best answer! There is far too many studies and confusing info regarding BPPV.  This forum is great for getting other perspectives and insight from people. /u/tllallyrfrnds they were thinking a clump was stuck in my ear canal - as it took so long! And you do tend to get used to the Epley a bit (or perhaps the vertigo does lessen) the more you do it. But it is still pretty horrible.  I will keep my fingers crossed for you that you get on top of yours soon!  Keep us posted!\n\nFYI - so many people had said how one Epley cured them - so I panicked even more when mine was not getting better.  So I was thankful to find this forum and hear from others that it took a while for them as well.  So hang in there!  I still remember the day my therapist laid me back and nothing happened. She was so excited.  I am like, 'no - you did not do it right. Do it again. I do not believe it.'  She did it again and I still did not believe it. A week later when I saw her, I still tested negative!  At that point, I cried tears of joy.  For real. I am guessing this is probably not BPPV. But you need a proper diagnosis to be sure.", "Help!!! Epley manuver not working. A month ago I was sleeping in my bed and suddenly my eyes open and I felt dizzy although I was lying down I still had feeling that I was falling. I closed my eye and then woke up to be normal. \nThen on the same day I was eating lunch and suddenly I felt dizzy again and had a panic attack, I lied down had some deep breaths my brother gave me stress release medicine. He is a doctor and he said that I have bppv. Then he helped me do epley manuver and then in matter of minutes I was fine. All the dizziness went away. \n\nNow after a month later I am getting that same dizziness and I have tried doing epley manuver several times now, but it is still not going away completely. \n\nWhen I move my eyes I feel dizzy, also when I stand up too quickly. \n\nCurrently I am taking vertigo medicine but I do not know what is the next step is. \n\nDue to covid all ENT doctors are unavailable. You may have to do the Epley several times per day before it takes. First, figure out which ear the bppv is in. You can use the Dix Hallpike for this. Once you are sure which ear it is in, then you may just have to do Epley for that side several times per day until it goes away. It depends on your tolerance - you could try a few in the morning and a few before bed. Some people get really bad symptoms each time and may only be able to tolerate one repetition per bout. There is really no other \"cure\" for the symptoms of bppv other than getting the canalith(s) repositioned.\nHope you get some relief! Thanks for the advice. Much appreciated. Check out the maneuvers as well for the horizontal canals. This is what worked for me. I videotaped my eyes to identify the affected canal and did the maneuver and it worked. ( You may need to get the epley done by a professional. They are much better at doing them with you than you are by yourself. It may have helped the first time but it did not get the crystals back where they needed to go. See a PT that specializes in Vestibular therapy or an ENT or a chiropractor that has experience with BPPV. It took over 2 months for my BPPV to finally get 'fixed'. And during that time, I visited my vestibular therapist weekly and she did the Epley twice during each appointment. It provoked symptoms horribly each time. So, over 20 Epley maneuvers later and a bunch of the Half Somersaults.... The crystal got back where it belonged. I also started doing the Epley myself mid week. \n\nAs mentioned, do the Dix Hallpike to determine which side is Effected. When you lay back, if you get a 30ish second wave of violent vertigo with your eyes twitching, that is the bad side. \n\nEven after I was fixed... I suffered residual dizziness &amp; felt like crap for months. Medicine may help with the nasuea, but if it is BPPV, it is not going to fix the displaced crystal. There are vestibular exercises to do as well to help your system get back in balance &amp; help the dizziness go away.\n\nThere are some knowledgeable people on this forum that have given great advice....if you take the time to search through the posts. There is even a video of someone doing the Dix Hallpike. Also in depth descriptions of folks doing the Epley &amp; other types of therapy. Best wishes to you! Hope you find relief soon. Thank you much appreciated Hi there!\nI am sorry your going through that. Sounds like an otolith has fallen out again. It is possible they can fall into other canals that would not be resolved with the traditional Epley maneuver. Seeing a professional to figure out which ear and canal will help you find the correct exercises.\n\nGood luck and feel better soon! xx Definitely try this maneuver (Foster manuever) as well. I just came from the doctor ENT checkup. \n\nHe said it is due to ear wax which is very thick and is blocking your ear drum which can create light headedness and nausea. \n\nHe prescribed me drops to get rid of excessive wax. Glad you got a diagnosis!  And that it is NOT BPPV!  Hurrah to ear wax!!! It is probably cheaper if you can find a physiotherapist trained in vestibular disorders like BPPV and can guide you through the Epley steps or whatever treatment that is ultimately recommended. \n\nI just got BPPV yesterday and it returned when I tried to lie down for bed.  I had it before so I was somewhat familiar with Epley.  Still, I watched a couple of videos.  It helped a little but the nausea remained and some dizziness and headache was still around.  Currently, I have a bit of nausea and slight headache.  My doctor said to wait until Monday and see how I am. I wish I did not listen to him.  If I got an appointment that afternoon at a physiotherapist, I would know if I was doing everything correctly and that would count as one legit treatment. \n\nYou can try it yourself but you cannot be 100% positive that you are doing it right unless an expert watches and tells you. I do not trust ENTs.  50/50, her dr is wrong.", "What to do after Epley manouver? Hi guys, today i was diagnosed with bppv, my ent did the epley manouver and i feel better. With the restrictions of sleeping angle, staying up straight etc. she also said I should not focus on one thing for a long time (ex. Gaming), does anyone know why I am not allowed to sit on my phone or play games on Pc? Can it affect the result of the Epley manouver? yep i was given the same restrictions for 5 days after the epley. dont know exactly the reasons for the gaming concerns but residual/after affect dizziness slowly improved day by day. the biggest restriction that i followed was to not sleep on my right side (my affected side) for 5 days and not to move my head too fast. i still try not to move my head too fast.\n\ni recommend you follow all restrictions from your ent and you will be feeling better. Thank you for your info! Will do! The little crystals can easily become dislodged again.  I find that using my phone and video games exacerbate my residual dizziness.  Also riding in the car, but sometimes you got to. Oh really? Going To reduce using my phone \ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72", "Off balance feelings Hi! \n\nI have had what my doctor thinks is BPPV for a while now. I no longer have violent spinning vertigo but I do experience swaying and weird balance sensations at times, mostly when I am lying in bed, I get this kind of bouncy feeling and sometimes it feels like I am being pushed/pulled to one side etc.. had these symptoms since like November but obviously it is better some days and worse others, but no spinning vertigo. I have been to an ENT and described these symptoms to her and she said It is normal for these symptoms to occur after BPPV and that I need to do certain exercises to train my brain to get back to normal. I do not have any nystagmus, she did the tests but she said it is normal to feel of balance and it takes time and perseverance to fully get back to normal. \n\nHave any of you experienced these off balance feelings where you feel a woozy feeling when lying in bed and occasionally off balance while sitting/standing?? Yes!!!!!  I actually had BPPV for 9 weeks (left ear, violent vertigo with nystagmus, tested weekly with Dix Hallpike by a therapist).  It took 20 Epley maneuvers to get the crystal back in place and finally no violent spinning vertigo.  And now, almost 2 months later I still have what you describe.  My vestibular therapist said it is common to have this residual dizziness, and since I had the BPPV for over 3 months, it is going to take longer for my balance system to reset.  Some days it is better, some days it is worse.  In fact, I keep laying myself back to see if the vertigo has returned - but thankfully it has not.\n\nJust last night, I had a really bad night sleeping, as the waves of dizziness kept coming. It almost triggered an anxiety attack, as I freaked out, thinking this would NEVER go away. But we have to remember not to let the anxiety get to us, as that feeds the dizzy monster.\n\nI was given 'gaze stabilization' exercises.  Google them. They have been helpful. I also continue to challenge myself when possible with the dizziness.  Like, if I look down to the right and it gives me a wave of dizziness, I keep doing that same move, 15 times.  This is all to try to retrain my system. I also try to be as active as possible.  When I am running, I will do some of the gaze stabilization exercises (in which the docs/therapists were always amazed I could still run with BPPV, and even now, do those exercises while running, and running backwards!)\n\nMy symptoms change weekly.  I have never noticed a day to day different, but weekly, things change a tiny bit.  And it is not always changing for the better.  Like, oh - now I get woozy while looking DOWN.  The next week, I will get dizziness upon closing my eyes....but oops, the looking down dizziness is gone.\n\nIt is frustrating, and a slow process.  My husband just said, 'This dizzy crap has gone on for way too long.'  Um, do you think I WANT to have this?  Do you think I am not trying as hard as I can to get it to go away?  So hang in there. You are not alone! Everything you said is what I experience!!! Lying in bed and moving in bed around feels so weird sometimes!! Like sometimes if I move my leg slightly it feels as if I am going to fall of the bed as if the bed is tilting, kind like three feeling you get when you are at a height and it feels like you are going to fall?? Guess I could call it falling/dropping sensation?? \n\nIt is good to feel understood because no one in my surroundings has experience this and no one takes me seriously because I am 23 and my parents think that \u201cI should be healthy\u201d, it is so debilitating because I just want to feel normal again. Thank you for your support\u2764\ufe0f RIGHT!!!! And I am healthy as a horse with every single specialist I saw (EENT, audiologist, neurologist, regular doc.....) Yet, I have felt SO incredibly crummy for MONTHS.  And each day is a struggle to get through with feeling dizzy and nauseous. People cannot physically see our 'illness.' And they say, 'Oh, right....I was dizzy once.'  Um, no - I am sure you were not.  Not like this when you spin violently and your eyes twitch so that you cannot even see.  I have had 3 or 4 other episodes that went away on their own.  It was not until this time, that it held on forever and got worse, that I tried to find help. I learned SO much from the docs/therapists.  I also learned that so many regular docs (and even the neurologist) do not want to work with dizzy patients, because they do not know about BPPV.  So it truly takes finding someone that knows about it and can help you.  And my PT has experienced it as well, and even the anxiety/depression that can come with it.  She helped me through SO much. I basically owe her my life!  And, it sucks to tell someone to hang in there - it takes a long time - wait it out. We want answers, but sometimes just getting support is the best we can get. Try to be strong and continue to do things that find you joy. And try to NOT worry. Do not let this beat you down! Yes I agree... we will have to try to wait it out and see if it gets better, which it most likely will with time. Having this illness is so annoying but I am still hopeful that it will go I away if I do my exercises on a daily basis (which I have not lately). Stay strong!! Thank you for sharing this.  I had BPPV for 8 weeks before a diagnosis was made.  You have summed up my symptoms as well. Mine too. I have had two violent episodes since december and one that was induced by PT for the tests. I have been doing the Brandt-Daroff exercises but on days when there is no dizziness, I do not. But it always seems to pop back as minor, residual dizziness. Esp in bed, and sometimes brings anxiety. Did you see the thread where some people noticed it worse before their period? Anyways keep up with the maneuvers, try new ones. I have also increased my vit d, added lysine and Chinese herbs. Not sure if they work but I have not had a violent episode since feb 1. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc I have been doing the Brandt-Daroff exercises too but not enough or on a daily basis so I have to start doing them again. Interesting that we all seem to have the aamw symptoms. Thanks for the advice \ud83d\ude03 Yep! It is been about 6 months since my episode and I still get woozy feelings. It just takes some time. But after 4 months, I have continued to feel normal everyday. It is just days every now and then where I will get a off feeling Ok I see! Hopefully I get better soon. If you are getting the feeling mainly while lying down it could very well be BPPV. Crystals dislodged in your ears. Sorry I am commenting on this late, but I think I am having similar issues. This is my second episode of BPPV. Started 4 days ago &amp; Epley maneuver was done 2 days ago. I feel a bit better today, but still have some dizziness/nausea. Wondering how long this will last as my first episode of BPPV resolved in one day :( it sucks feeling off balance and woozy/queasy. My first episode of BPPV that I had in May last year only lasted a day too, and then it came back in October. I feel better I guess but I had I ongoing BPPV symptoms which waxed and waned over a period of like 2 months and then after that I had the residual dizziness that I still sometimes feel. Mostly I feel it when I am lying down, I get this like dropping, woozy/swaying feeling and sometimes I even feel like I am bouncing/bobbing up and down a bit. Sometimes when walking I feel as though my head is being pulled or pushed to one side. These symptoms wax and wane too.

About a month ago I had my blood work done, everything was normal. During my follow up I was given a flu shot and moved on with my life as normal. Days following I experienced dizziness spells on and off, intense brain fog, and nearly blacked out in a gym class. Because I just had blood work done i thought everything was caused by my vision. After going to the eye doctor everything seemed to be normal. I then went back to my general practitioner who diagnosed me with bppv. I explained to her my concern about my different symptoms occurring days after getting the flu shot, but she immediately denied it was from that.

(And the safety of vaccines in general) However, I am concerned that somehow the mixture of the two or this years flu shot alone might have triggered me to have bppv. \n\nI am simply wondering if anyone else has had this happen to them following either vaccines - or if you know what triggered your bppv to begin.

I have sometimes had some very, very mild dizziness which runs concurrently with a feeling of fullness in my ear, but this happily has not happened for a little while.\n\nI sometimes get the same mild dizziness  when I am sat at my laptop. What happens is that when I sit at my desk I tend to shake both legs from side to side quite quickly - it is just a thing I have always done since I was a kid and is driven by anxiety. I have noticed though that sometimes when I do it, I get the same mild dizziness creeping up the back of my neck and skull. I was wondering if the motion of my legs moving creates a slight side to side rocking movement of my head which then trigger the dizziness? Anyone had anything similar? Try the Epley maneuver. Thanks, to be honest I did not fancy trying anything until I would had my appointment. But I may try that in the morning. It is very easy to do yourself on your bed so there is nothing to lose. It worked for me and I could feel a difference after even the first day of repeating the excercise about three times. A weekend at home is a good time to dedicate to it for starters.", "Is there anything we can do to prevent the reoccurrence of BPPV? Hi.\n\nIn the past 6 months, I have had BPPV attacks 3 times. The first one happened at the end of July 2020, for the first time in my life. I was super scared and my anxiety levels were up to the roof. The BPPV was gone by itself, but I had awful lingering dizziness for a month after (During August), and mild lingering dizziness for two months after that (September and October). At the beginning of November, I was finally happy that this awful thing is gone, but in mid-Nov, boom, it happened again in an early morning. This time, I had awful dizziness for a day, and after that, it was better. I was a PT and she did Epley on me. I had nystagmus on the right side (similar to my first BPPV), and the Epley fixed it. I saw the PT for a few more weeks (up to the end of Dec) to get rid of that very mild lingering dizziness and it was gone. Again I was happy, and today, boom, another one after \\~1 month of happiness. I am really tired of this game and I truly wish there was a surgery or something to get rid of it. I really do not know what I am doing wrong that causes these BPPVs to happen. I use a pretty firm and high pillow. I do not turn to my right and left quickly, and I do that very slowly. \n\nDo you guys know anything that can at least reduce the chances of reoccurrence? Should I even get a higher pillow? I am worried that I might hurt my neck by doing that. Should I stop turning to my right (bad) side for a while? Does it help if I do it? The unfortunate thing is that leaning on my right side is my favorite position for sleeping :(( Check this out \n\nI started taking vitamin D, I am caffeine-free and BPPV-free since then, not sure if it is correlation or causation, but I am very happy about it. Small price to pay. Hope it lasts. :) All the best! I am interested in this as well. I had labrynthitis at the start of 2020 followed by two episodes of bppv. I have happened across different NHS suggested therapies but there is no consistency in them apart from epley. The thing is that I am also caffeine free and non-smoker. I saw my PCP about three months ago and she ordered a bunch of blood works to basically test whatever in the body that might be related to dizziness. Every thing is fine, but it turned out that my Vitamin D level is so low. It was 9 while normal range was 30-100. So she prescribed me vitamin D pills which are very strong (one 50000 UI pill per week) and I have been taking them since then. It seems that, although the pill might have helped with my lingering dizziness, but I guess they have not helped with the vertigo attacks. I am not sure if this has been proven and I am not a doctor, but not wearing headphones has been a huge difference for me. It makes the time between the dizziness longer. Sometimes loud music or sounds can make me dizzy.  Especially Apple headphones that sometimes are noise cancelling, they change the pressure in your ears.\n\nI have been dizzy at random times though even without wearing headphones or hearing anything loud, but these two things made time between the occurrences longer.\n\nI feel like the Epley movements make things worse. If you are actually having a vertigo attack and you try to do the epley movements and you move your head the wrong way, it makes the dizziness worse. It only thing that helps me is holding my head straight when laying down. That is interesting and kind of makes sense too. I will definitely try it. Thanks for the reply. You need to always eat something fat with vitamin D to absorb it. I do not know much about BPPV, and I do not really understand it, but I can tell you how it is for me at night. For me, there is one single head movement that triggers BPPV, and I have programmed myself to (hopefully) always avoid that. Aside from that, I can still switch sleep positions, and I use a regular pillow. I never tried that particular head movement since my last episode, and I do not think I ever will do that consciously. The simple answer is no. You cannot prevent BPPV. I have had it a number of times over the past 6 years all seemingly random\n\nTwice I had it within a few weeks of each other while other times it was years between occurrences.\n\nI do not drink booze (stopped 6 years ago), never smoke, no drugs, my only vices are peppermint tea and sparkling water. \n\nI am currently reading this book -  and think a lot of people on here would benefit from it. Yeah I am not a drinker too (have not had even a single drop of alcohol in my whole life). Also no caffeine ( I hate coffee) and never smoked in my life. But still getting these awful episodes sometimes :((( I think it is something diet related also. I had an episode last year before I changed my diet. Time will tell. What works for me:\n\n1. Sleeping on the side that does not cause BPPV \n2. Sleeping with 3 pillows under my head so my head is propped up\n3. Upon waking up - s...l...o...w...l...y sit up and lean back against the bed rail and sit for \\~4-5 minutes before getting up. Yeah that is what I should do. Thanks for the advice. Also one more thing that my PT taught me: when you want to sit (after waking up) try to straighten your neck. You know what I mean. When you sit, do not sit in a curved position (like when we are really tired). Sit up right (like the military guys :D). That helps your neck to send blood to your brain faster and easier and it prevents dizziness because of bad neck posture. Out of curiosity, which ear / canal do you treat? What is the nystagmus that you get? In every case for me it is been a twisting (torsion / rotation) that rolls to the left which led my PT to do the log roll with me to work on the lateral canal. \n\nIs it possible your feeling relief but not treating the correct canal? For me it is the right year. My vertigo is like I am steady but the room is spinning in the clockwise position. The maneuver that helped me was dix hallpike. The first time my PT did it on my right side I had an awful nystagmus. Then turned my head quickly to the left and finished the maneuver. We also redid the maneuver in all the next sessions to make sure about the crystals and I had no nystagmus anymore after the first maneuver. \nAlso yesterday that I felt bppv happened, my wife helped me and we did the dix hallpike again at home, and surprisingly no nystagmus. So maybe it was bppv but got resolved by itself, or maybe it was just my illusion and imagination. Not sure. Anyways I think I am better today. I did not rolled to right last night at all. Hopefully it will help it. In case this is helpful, I have consolidated a lot of information, including advice from previous BPPV posts and comments, in ( and I am updating it as I am able. We are working to have it pinned to the top of the subreddit for easier access. Interesting... that rotation for me is anti-clockwise on the verticals axis. \n\nGood to hear your okay today \ud83d\udc4d", "Diagnosed today any help? Hey guys got my diagnoses today of bvvp.

Okay thanks. One more question - if someone does not have BPPV or it got resolved, but you do the Epley again, can that make it come back or make crystals move to other places? Honestly I am not sure.\n\nI guess I have the same question myself. I mean, for me, as long as you perform the maneuvor in the right way (allow the crystals to move in  the correct direction) then it probably cannot harm you and all it could do would be to benefit your condition - as long as it is done right.", "Can weak neck muscles cause this? I had prolong bed recently and at first my head became so heavy to hold lol this was around the time I first experienced bppv symptoms", "does this sound like bppv? so about 2 years ago i first had an episode with this where when i moved my eyes and focused on something i would get hit with this spell of dizziness and i could almost feel it in my ears when it happened. it is hard to explain because it feels so weird. i can almost hear a little bit of ringing too. i went to the doctor and they told me i had an ear infection and gave me an antibiotic or whatever. took it and the dizziness did get better, but then it came back. decided to go to the ent to see if i could get a different reading. they looked at my ears and tested them and all that and they said my eardrums were fine and they did not look enflamed or swollen or anything. but they did say they were full of wax, so they cleaned them out. i THINK it helped but i remember had began feeling better before the trip to the ent. so throughout these two years i have had the dizziness with eye movement on and off and i just get hit with episodes that last for a few days to a week. but just recently i have been hit with it bad. it is gotten to the point where i just move my head instead of moving my eyes because it is just that bad. it is been about two weeks since it came back and it is just been getting worse and better and then a little worse again.  i googled bppv and it is the closest thing i could find to what i am experiencing but i could not really find much at all. does this sound like bppv or something else? Could be. Doctor time. Could be! I am not very convinced though. From what I understand, BPPV is brought on by movement in the head, not the eyes. Because when the head moves in certain directions, the crystals in our ear become dislodged and create a spinning room sensation. So if this were the case, moving your eyes alone would not bring on vertigo. And moving your head instead of your eyes to relieve it would give give the opposite effect that you are experiencing. I would schedule an appointment with a physical therapist that specializes in vertigo. They can perform diagnostic tests to check for BPPV and other similar disorders.", "I have BPPV Hi, I am 17 years old and I was diagnosed with BPPV last week, the doctor told me to do the epley\u2019s manoeuvre to help get rid of it, I have been doing it 3 times a day for at least 1 week and I do not feel any change at all, it really became a problem because I cannot drive, I cannot go to work, I cannot do anything without feeling weird and uncomfortable, I am starting to think that maybe she misdiagnosed me, I was wondering if someone here could help me, thank you so much im not a dr but i had bppv for about a month. what type of dr did you go to? im surprised your dr told you to do the maneuver yourself.\n\ni saw an ent (ear nose &amp; throat) dr who had specialists in her office that did the epley on me. they first performed the dix hallpike maneuver to determine which side i was affected on, then the epley. after one visit i was cured after about a week.\n\nwhat im saying is:\n\n1) go see an ent dr who is experienced with bppv. a vestibular specialist should also be experienced with bppv if you cannot find an ent dr.\n\n2) i was told that if the epley is not performed properly and for the proper side that you are affected on, the maneuver can possibly make it worse or at least not help. again, see an ent dr.\n\n3) after i saw the ent dr i was also told not to sleep on my affected (right) side for 5 consecutive days. Get checked for vestibular migraines. Had the same and verapamil took care of it in a few days. I went to see a normal doctor, she determined that my left side is the problematic side, then she proceeded to tell me to do the Epley\u2019s manoeuver at home so I do not know if I am doing it correctly :/ I never did any migraines tho.. does it have a relation ? My experience with the epley maneuver is that I do it only once or twice in a day and then leave it. I tend to feel dizzy/nauseous for a few days after doing it and then it gradually leaves me and I am good for a while. Since I was diagnosed last summer I have done it on maybe three occassions and my BPPV goes away for a few months at a time, but it has not got rid of it completely and I do not think it ever will. \n\nI would not like to advise you at all but you might be better giving it a few days without doing it to see if your symptoms ease off. If it is having the correct affect the crystals should settle back where they should be and leave you feeling better, but as I say I definitely feel nauseous for a few days after doing it before it gets better. best i can tell you is see an ent dr who is familiar with treating bppv. the dr or specialist in their office can do the epley properly for you. you will be glad you did.\n\nsomething that may ease you a bit for now is bppv is not supposed to be a serious ailment. just very uncomfortable. its not fun and made me nauseous at times too. im an avid road cyclist and not riding for over a month was not fun. see an ent dr. I have had bppv since october last year. Im 18f and i thought for a loooong time that i was misdiagnosed too. Have taken mri scans and blood samples. Everything came out ok so in my case at least im pretty certain its bppv find a local physical therapist.  A lot of them specialize in BPPV and Eply. I would get a 2nd opinion from a specialist (an ENT). In my opinion, I think people are perfectly capable of doing the epley properly themselves, especially if a doctor/physical therapist has demonstrated it first. However, the epley will only really help if, indeed, you have BPPV. Let me note that an ENT recently told me that eye nystagmus (what doctors look for when doing dix halpike) is not necessarily only BPPV-related.  I showed a little nystagmus but do not have BPPV. \n\nThere are lots of things that can cause vertigo. A regular doctor would not be super well versed in all possibilities. An ENT has more experience and is familiar with more possibilities and what their symptoms look like. BPPV is more common than other vertigo sources, so I think regular doctors are most familiar with it. \n\nBPPV should only last like a week or two at most? I could be wrong.\n\nI am currently recovering from labyrinthitis/vestibular neuritis. This is the 2nd time in my life I have had it, which is so unlikely that I wonder if I have been diagnosed correctly. The first round lasted 6 months. I was 24 years old and super healthy up until then. It was about 4 months before I could drive and like 6 until I felt normal, so I feel your pain. This time (6 years later), I am almost normal after only 6 weeks! I am back to driving as of this week! It is so disruptive and just awful. \n\nIf yours persists, ask for more tests. I had an MRI about a month ago to make sure there were no tumors. Be cognizant of your hearing ability. Information about hearing loss or sudden tinnitus is super helpful for doctors when they are diagnosing you. If your hearing seems normal\u2014great! It is important to share that info. Doctors like to ask me if I have allergies, migraines, am prone to ear infections, or if I was recently sick. Just be prepared to answer. Also keep track of how you experience your vertigo. They will ask you if certain activities bring on an \u201cepisode\u201d or if it is more continuous or whatnot. For awhile, I even kept a journal of what foods I was eating and my vertigo strength to see if there was any correlation. Some vertigo conditions can be influenced by salt intake. Just make mental notes that you can share with a professional. Help them help you, you know?\n\nI am really sorry you are going through this. Vertigo sucks. And it is hard to explain to people who have not experienced it. Have they given you any good drugs? I like ondansetron for nausea\u2014it is like a miracle on those nasty days. Other anti-dizziness/suppressant meds have not worked for me (meclizine, Valium), but maybe you will have better luck. This time around, I went through a steroid round to treat inflammation, and it was very effective. That would not really work for BPPV, though. \n\nOf all the horrible things that cause vertigo, I hope yours really is BPPV and is short-lived. I never actually saw a doctor for the Dix-Hallpike or the Epley maneuver, but did them via remote medicine while watching videos (my BPPV started at the height of COVID shutdowns, so my only option was telemedicine). It was pretty easy to determine which side. I remember very clearly the uncontrollable eye movement, and intense nausea dizziness when doing the Dix-Hallpike on the effected side. \n\nThis is the Epley maneuver video I follow. Its a simple thing to do, and effective to do at home, IMHO. Note that I am an engineer and not a doctor, so my opinion is not qualified medical advice. But I am also a fellow BPPV sufferer. \n\n(\n\nThat video is the process I use for doing the Epley maneuver. Lots of helpful things happen through the video. I recommend watching the all 10 minutes of it. It takes about 2 mintues to do. \n\nAfter conducting the Epley maneuver (I only do it once a day in the middle of a BPPV episode), I will have some residual nausea for a few days or up to a week or so. I will repeat it daily, once a day, until I get barely any eye movement (nystagmous) when performing it on the affected side. Do not perform it on the unaffected side. Thank you so much for your answers! Tomorrow I am going to a physiotherapist who specialize in vestibular rehabilitation, and I have another appointment with my usual doctor this week, so I will try to maybe make him give me special meds to help me it completely ruin my life and I cry and I cry always I am just really eager to all of this to end Awesome vestibular rehab! That is great! Hopefully they will epley you into position! If not BPPV, they can help you re-train your brain to rely on your good ear. Either way, a physiotherapist is going to speed up your recovery!\n\nSo sorry you are going through it :(\nStay strong! Have you tried the Half Sommersault for left side? It works for me What other symptoms did you have? She should have at least done the Epley with you in the office. It is possible that you are not doing it or the crystal is in a different canal which would require a different maneuver. Like others have said, your best bet would be finding a doctor who specializes, like an ENT or PT who has experience with BPPV. Good luck! The epley maneuver treats BBPV in one of the semi-circular canals - but there are 3 canals, so you may need a different maneuver. Because of this when I get BPPV I never do the epley maneuver by myself - I got to an OT and have him ry to diagnose the problem. If possible try to see a physiotherapist or occupational therapist that treats BPPV/balance disorders/does vestibular rehabilitation. I have found doctors (including ENTs) do not understand vertigo.", "Bppv? Had a similar experience one time last week. I wake up after a night of sleeping my stomach which is the way I always sleep and everything is spinning. Last time just lying in bed straight up for hours and it eventually went away. This time I feel much more nauseous and I really do not want to throw up since it will probably make it worse. Also cannot really go see a doctor right now and I am afraid to try epely maneuver since I hate the room spin Yes it sounds like it. I would try the maneuver but that is just me. I learned to do it myself after getting tired of waiting months to see specialists. Sorry to hear. I dealt with vertigo/dizziness/disequilibrium for years. An epley maneuver can help if its related to a lose crystal, but there could be a different root cause that is causing inflammation in your ear canal which is throwing off your vestibular system. My root causes were more related to Lyme and CIRS (mold illness). Happy to chat more on it", "Any good way to self diagnose which ear? I had a viral inner ear infection years ago, BPPV for weeks. I also have TMJ and allergies so my ears are shit. I get BPPV once a year or so. \n\nCurrently it kicks in if I look up and left. \n\nIt will be a while until I can see a doc. \n\nSince this happens periodically, is there any good way to determine which ear it is without a doctor so I can just run the maneuvers myself without having to wait for an appointment every time this happens? If the dizziness is occuring in when you look to your left, then it will probably be that left ear. I had issues with rolling over on my left side and in that direction in general... I was later diagnosed with BPPV in my left ear.\n\nWith that all being said though, I am not a doctor nor health expert. It could very well be your left ear causing the dizziness, but I would recommend seeing your doctor as soon as possible. \n\nPersonally speaking, I would recommend the hanging head manuever, and avoid any sharp turns with your neck towards your left and move your whole body instead of your neck when looking around.. if that makes sense.. and take medication for motion sickness or OTC vertigo medications. \n\nDo not bend over, squat, or look up. Avoid over exertion until you get to the doc. If symptoms worsen, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nFeel better! When i got dizzy rolling over to my right side, my right ear was affected Dix-Hallpike test \n Thanks!! I like many others woke up a week ago, rolled to my left and got vertigo, rolled to my right and got vertigo and thought... how could it be both ears?!? \n\nWent to the PT where we did a few tests and whilst both sides would trigger vertigo, we decided to work on the ear that felt to me as a stronger spin. Did the BBQ roll for that particular ear and after a week the vertigo has settled down but unfortunately not completely resolved. \n\nMy take away is that if you feel that one side sets the vertigo off worse then the other, then that is the ear to work on. This video helped me out: ( at 2:08 in the video, she explains how to tell which ear it is.", "BPPV a d tinnitus Hello \nDo any of you with BPPV have tinnitus in both ears and if so have you noticed a spike in your T after your attack and or Epley maneuver? Thanks", "Initial spinning changed to I think I have BPPV. A couple days ago, my world would only spin when I got up in the morning. The nausea would dissipate throughout the day, and I would feel fine by the end of the day.\n\nI tried the Epley maneuver first on the right side and later on the left side when I did the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and found out the vertigo was on my left side.\n\nThis morning, however, there was no spinning--only the sense of exaggerated motion whenever I moved. The nausea I felt from this was so severe that I vomited, which I had not done in the days before. I performed the Epley maneuver again on my left side and ended up vomiting again. The position I am in right now is the only one where everything feels normal--lying supine and not moving.\n\nHas anyone experienced the transition from spinning to only exaggerated motion?", "Hi Is this BPPV? Ive had two episodes like this so far and they are months apart...\nThis is what happened:\n\nI wake up turn to the side, and suddenly the world is spinning. It doesnt stop unless I dont move my head AT ALL but even then, my eyes kind of drift? Like away from what im trying to focus on (if that makes sense). I cannot walk steadily and feel nauseous if I do so. During the second episode I actually threw up a LOT... \nAnd both of these episides lasted a whole day/ the vertigo began to subside as the day came to an end (~8pm) and I could not do anything but stay in bed the whole day , also the balance issue would remain until the next day which by then I would feel perfectly fine. \n\nI went to the doctors once and they didnt do anything at all it was frustrating :/ she just said I have \"extra fluid in my ear\" ...\n\nI dont have any other health issues that I know of . I guess Im also kind of clumsy but that is about it. Sounds like BPPV is a possibility for sure. I would suggest going to an ENT to get a proper diagnosis and find out the best maneuvers for you going forward. I waited almost a year before I finally went (also after having gone to a general practitioner who was no help.)  Best $40 copay I have ever spent. Thanks! I will do so!!! I have to get the doctors to take me seriously \ud83d\ude15 I agree - seeing a specialist that works with dizziness is the best thing you can do.  I developed gaze instability with my vertigo because initially I stopped moving my head to try to keep the dizziness away.  So I had exercises to fix the gaze instability (which sounds a bit like what you are describing).  It could for sure be BPPV as well. A correct diagnosis with specialized testing can help you get the treatment you need and hopefully get you back on your feet quickly! Many doctors and sometimes even an ENT or neurologist cannot correctly diagnose dizziness - so be sure to see someone that specializes in it.\n\nBest wishes! Thanks! You too !  :) Definitely sounds like BPPV. Try doing the Epley maneuver - does it happen on just one side? One side??? No just if i moved my head at all in any direction Typically (but there are exceptions) BPPV effects one side of your ear canal or the other.  It may seem like it is happening in all directions - but only once side is effected.  By performing the Dix Hallpike (google it) test, you can determine which side is effected.  Also, if you want to attempt the Epley maneuver to get the crystal rotated back around the ear canal and into the correct spot again, study that maneuver as well.  Essentially the Dix Hallpike is the first step to the Epley. This is how a specialist will test for BPPV. They also use goggles to video the nystagmus (eye twitching) to help determine which ear canal is effected.  There are also other tests to see if the crystal is in a different ear canal (there are 3 on each side).  Once you determine which side is effected - you can perform the Epley or Half Somersault to try to correct the condition.  Just note that if it truly is  BPPV, when you do those maneuvers - it WILL provoke the severe vertigo. It will last up to 30 seconds in certain positions.  Wait it out. It is the crystal moving around the ear canal and your body trying to adapt. There are some good posts in this forum describing these maneuvers better. I will look more into this thank you!!!", "Is this actually BPPV My GP said it sounds like I have BPPV and just gave me a print out sheet of exercises to do, I cannot really say it feels like dizziness, it is more like the room I am in or the space I am in goes really big every now and then, not the object's themselves just the distance/depth everything just seems off.\n\nIt brings on terrible panic attacks but from what I have read about Bppv it does not sound like this", "First time with Vertigo Hey folks. I just discovered this sub Sunday night after going to the ER when I got vertigo for the first time ever. It was really scary.\n\nI was putting a bookshelf together for a couple hours so I had my head at every angle imaginable. But it did not hit then. It hit an hour or so later when I sat down to watch some TV and eat...and bam. Out of no where I got really dizzy and had an immediate panic attack. Laying on my back was when it was the absolute worst. I did not have any balance problems though. It was probably stupid, but I drove myself to the ER.\n\nI went to the ER because I read (and watched) that BPPV episodes only last a few minutes or seconds and if that is not the case something else is causing your vertigo. All in all I was dizzy for around 4 hours but it only stopped because I was give meds. They gave me some anti nausea meds and anti-dizzy meds and ordered a CT scan which came back unremarkable. That was it. No Epley maneuver, no examination by the doc, no anything. Just told me \"yeah sometimes crystals get loose and cause random vertigo.\"\n\nIt is 2 days later and I am now having a pretty strong headache, and I almost never get headaches of any sort. Cannot remember the last time I had one in fact. Still feel pretty off. Some seriously bad fatigue. Kind of feel like I am hungover and did not sleep well. Some residual dizziness is still going on but I cannot find a position that makes me dizzy anymore. From what I have heard and read it does not really sound like BPPV. I mean the vertigo went away on its own and now I have some strange symptoms still lingering. Anyone have these symptoms days after? Anyone have their vertigo stop for seemingly no reason after a few hours? Vertigo/BPPV is tricky; I have had it for over 30 years. \n\nSometimes the crystals in your inner ear canals - their proper name is *Otoconia -* get stuck in the wrong place for a few hours, or even a few minutes, then dislodge on their own and all is well again.  Sometimes they do not behave, and that is when you end up at the doctor's or with the Epley maneuver.\n\nThe symptoms you describe are confusing, as vertigo and headaches do not always go together (i have never had that happen).  Since you cannot replicate the dizziness with your head at certain angle - something easily done with BPPV - I suspect something else is going on.  \n\nIt sounds like you are trying to come down with something, but your immune system is battling it. But I\"m not a doctor, I am a liberal arts major (want fries with that?). \n\nAll I can suggest is a return visit to your regular doc if you have one. Same thing for me. I was typing an email on Monday and boom, i felt the room spinning. I went and laid down and all hell broke loose, the room was spinning at light speeds. \n\nWent to the ER and they gave gravol and that helped. The dizziness stopped after the first day but I have felt uneasy since. Little headaches and nausea on and off since. Fatigue but getting proper sleep times. It sucks Hey! This makes me feel a little better knowing someone out there is going through the same thing and not dying \ud83d\ude05 It is been driving my anxiety through the roof wondering if there is something wrong with me. It is been much better but I am still getting a headache every other day and waking up feeling like I am hungover :(", "The word \u201cbenign\u201d has a lot of explaining to do.  \ud83e\udd23 - agreed. \n\nI remember my first episode thinking my whole world had ended. \n\nMeanwhile the ENT tells me ... it is benign... you got nothing to worry about!!! \n\nClearly had never experienced BPPV No kidding!! Benign my aunt fanny! JFC you are bloody right. Curled up on my front terrified to move in case I throw up yet again. I am a big guy who is played contact sports at a national champion level, climbed mountains, done heavy labour and this is the only thing that has ever REALLY debilitated me. I have ended up in the emergency room twice due to how much vomiting is involved.  If you are vomiting and cannot even hold down water please do not try to tough it out, call the doc", "Is This BPPV? I (19F) was sleeping last night when all of the sudden I was woken up by hitting my head on the corner of my window when I was readjusting in my sleep. That obviously startled me awake and I was having trouble falling back asleep. Once I flipped to my left side (the side that was up when I hit my head) I finally dozed off only to almost immediately be woken up by and intense spinning and my body shaking. I calmed myself down and the shaking stopped but the room kept spinning and I was very hot. I eventually tried to stand up to get some water and felt the worst vertigo I have ever experienced. Eyes completely black and extremely nauseous. As soon as I laid down it went away but I was pretty spooked. I have had vertigo almost all my life in short episodes that do not usually cause nausea. The rest of the night I felt weak and dizzy and scared to go back to sleep. It is morning now as I am typing this and I still do not feel like myself. Dizzy and head feels like it is rocking back and forth like on a boat or something. Is this BPPV? I do not know about feeling hot or the shaking. When I have had episodes closing your eyes almost feels like you are on a roller coaster and you are griping the pull down bars but the ride never stops. \nEvery time I have had an episode I have thrown up from the nausea. \nIt does not go away until you do an epley maneuver. \nAnd even after you will have days even up to weeks of residual dizziness and general fogginess.\n\nI would say go to the doctor but I never went so idk. It will go away but you have to work at it. Thank you for your response. I think it might have triggered a panic attack in my sleep as a form of defense. That is the best answer I have for the hot and shaking. Yeah I do not know I mean I hope that is the case. \nI have had panic attacks before and as bad and scary as they are BPPV is much more intense.\nIf it just kind of subsided on it is own that does not make sense. The level of vertigo you would experience will make you either fall or make you lay on the floor for hours even days if untreated. Hey, I had a similar experience. It happened at night when i turned over, felt like I was continually falling. Thought it was getting better so I got up to use the bathroom. Suddenly things felt much worse, I immediately became covered in sweat, my partner said I became extremely pale and, when I went to lay back down, I had a couple of minutes of intense shivering/shaking. That was the worst moment for sure but I have been dealing with these feelings now for the last few days. I am wondering how you are doing and if you have found anything that works? Hi! That sounds almost exactly the same as me! The days after the experience I was just very tired and weak feeling. I think I was dehydrated from all the sweating so I sipped on Gatorade for awhile. My neck was also stiff and my ears would ring periodically. I went easy on myself for a few days and just tried to relax in order to not make things worse. Now I feel completely normal during the day, sometimes my ears ring or I get a little dizzy but nothing as bad as that night. I would just recommend staying hydrated, stretching at night (helped me not feel panicky about it happening again) and taking it easy. I have to say my equilibrium does feel off from time to time but it gets better! I would also recommend noticing which side makes you feel dizzy. For me it was when I switched to my left side, which was also the side I got my head. I try to not fall asleep on that side if I am feeling especially dizzy. Hope this helps! Feel free to DM if you have any other questions! Hey, thanks for the response! It really sometimes just helps to hear others' stories. I think mine is moving in a positive direction and it looks like all of the research indicates it tends to resolve on its own without treatment. I have considered doing the Epley or Foster maneuver myself but I am terrified of the stone going into another canal, making the symptoms even worse. Regarding treatment, I am trying to avoid going to a medical doctor during this pandemic. It is really true that anxiety plays such a major role in this. As a psychologist who has treated people with many types of anxiety in the past, I have really had to apply some of my own techniques to decouple the anxiety experience from the vertigo experience as they clearly exacerbate each other. When you say stretching at night, are you talking about basic yoga poses? What kinds of stretches have you found helpful and non-triggering of vertigo? When I was sleeping I found myself overcompensating for my head trying to keep it \u201cstill\u201d so my upper back and neck were very tense. I was doing a YouTube video of Qi Gon for upper body tension. It had a lot to slowly tilting my head from one side to the other. I did it sitting down and by doing it slowly I felt like I had more control over the whole situation. It stretched my neck out and ultimately helped control my anxiety. For the first few nights after the incident I slept in my living room because my bed itself was making me feel so anxious. I also just felt generally anxious at night so doing some stretches in the area that was making me anxious definitely helped. I recommend them doing sitting down for sure. That is awesome, thanks for the advice!", "I do not know if this is BPPV. Please help! So I am nearly 19 years old and I have had swirling/dizzying/falling sensations whenever I lay down on my right side ever since I was 5 or 6. Never been diagnosed since I have not told my parents about it much (they will not do anything about it anyway). Only today did I look it up on Google. Tried the home epley maneuver twice back to back but it did not seem to give instant results, though I may have done it incorrectly.\n\nI have been sleeping on my left side for the last 4-6 years as a habit because I heard laying down on your left increases your digestion rate slightly. I suspect my slight facial assymetry is only worsened by this though it may be a whole another topic entirely.\n\nPlease advice. If you are not sure if it is BPPV you could try the dix-hallpike maneuver. It can be really helpful to do the first few maneuvers with a specialist or somebody who knows how to do it right. Get in touch with an ENT and a Vestibular therapist if possible. I think it would be helpful for you! Thank you, will do whenever the pandemic situation is more stable in my country. Thanks, will try it out! Im sorry you have to wait about this. I would avoid sleeping on that side (which you do). It does sound very similar to bppv! I tried doing the Epley at home before I found my vestibular therapist and it also did not yield results. My ENT even tried to do the Epley maneuver on me and it did not work! She did not do it correctly, but that is bc she is not trained in doing so (she did tell me herself in her defense lol). The movements have to be very precise or else it could worsen matters so be super careful if you do then at home. Doing too much Epley/vestibular exercises if you are not prepared or doing them properly can cause more harm than good so be very careful. I saw results after the first day of therapy. I hope you can find some improvement if you choose to go forward with them! I am 17 and I have the same thing. Been sleeping on my right as I have it in my left ear. My neck is killing me and my shoulders always hurt. I am going to have someone do this epply thing to me. All these years of my life worrying about this shit and just holding me back. I honestly do not even care if I faint or anything when I get this done to me, at this point I just want to give a big fuck you to this horrible issue in my ear and fight back.

I suggest having someone do this to you rather then doing it to yourself as it is much more challenging without your balance. Have you tried addressing muscle tension/pain, especially if it is bad posture related?  Tense neck muscles and bad posture (esp. cervical spine) can be a cause or a significant contributor to these issues. \n\nYou should definitely see a therapist that specializes in BPPV an/or vestibular issues. Best of luck! Well the tension in my neck is a new thing i suppose. The bppv has been around my life for a few years though. It is most likely because recently when my bppv reoccurred it always happened when I woke up from sleeping on my left side or a few mins after I woke up from sleeping on my left so I figured out it was in my left ear. Now I have been sleeping on my right and on a pillow that is more thick so I am a little elevated and I guess that is why my neck has been so tense.

", "Was suggested to repost this video I took down- Dix Hallpike showing rapid uncontrolled eye movement while experiencing BPPV :)  Interesting, I always felt like it was a waterfall motion and imagined my eyes rolling down and then going back up and rolling down again.  Did not realise that was what it actually looked like. This is the only visible evidence of a debilitating condition. Yeah, I know that B stands for Benign since it is not going to kill you, but it sure is horrifying. The first time it happened to me I was sure that I would never be able to function normally again.\n\nThank you for posting this. I hope that you are doing better now. Thank you for posting this! I think it will help a lot of people understand the Dix Hallpike and what to look for. The nystagmus is a tell tale sign of BPPV. A specialist will often put goggles on to video the eye twitching, as the direction they twitch can determine which inner ear canal is effected. Hope you are doing better! \n\nHere is a video I made about the Dix-Hallpike test. The moment I knew I had BPPV now DH said to me\u201dYou would not be dizzy if you would quit doing that with your eyes\u201d. I have watched many of your videos and found them to be very informative &amp; helpful. Thank you for all that you do! \u2764\ufe0f That made me laugh! \"Yeah DH, I will get right on stopping that. Thanks for the tip!\"", "How long do your episodes last? Hi all. \n\nI am looking to hear experiences with BPPV. \n\nI have had tinnitus first a few years in my left ear, and this year I have had vertigo for about 60-90 minute episodes. I had them every few days for a few weeks earlier this year and now I am getting it again. \n\nI have yet to visit my doctor but I am giving him a call this week. When I get my episodes, it seems that my vision is spinning counter-clockwise, My balance is off when I tilt my head from towards the right to back to neutral, when I turn my head to the right, and when I look up from looking downward my head turns to the left a little. \n\nLuckily the last few times I have gotten this I have not had any visual spinning. I had a 3 hour long episode on Sunday which sucked, that was the longest so far. I did go 5 months without vertigo which is really interesting. Almost like my ear fixed itself and then it came back. My \"main\" episodes last until I do the Eply pretty much. Then I will have residual dizziness for days to weeks afterwards. Do you do any of the maneuvers? When I first started getting them they would last minutes or hours. Over the next 20+ years they increased, to a few days, a little more than a week and to cap 2020 off I got an episode that lasted 5-6 weeks. into January 2021. FML. 10/10 do not recommend.\n\nApril 2021 I had a short 2 day spell. I was incredibly grateful that it did not last 2 months. I can deal with short spells, even a week. I do not ever want multiple weeks ever again. That sounds awful. I hope it gets better for you. Fingers crossed that you never see a long spell again Do you mean the actual dizziness or how many days a person has episodes of vertigo? I have had episodes that lasted from a couple of weeks to a month and a half but the actual dizziness happens when I turn my head certain ways, lie back in bed and turn from one side to the other in bed. At most the spinning lasts maybe a couple of minutes, usually it is a minute or less. I have tried but I have not had much luck. It may have helped one time or it was just a coincidence that my episode was nearing end. \n\nI am kind of worried that I will dislodge another crystal (if that is even my problem) by doing the wrong side. I am still learning about BPPV. Thanks!! It is pretty bad, I have a handful of medical conditions and while this was not the worst condition I have had to deal with it absolutely made me the most sad and scared and anxious that I have ever been about my health. Yeah I meant the actual bouts of dizziness and vertigo What you explain does not sound like bppv.  Bppv will cause vertigo in short bursts from moving your position.  Once you stop moving the crystal stops so the vertigo ends.  Mine will trigger when I sit up from lying down usually.  I then do the epley a few times and it resolves.  I often have lingering dizziness for weeks but no more vertigo until the next onset. I have episodes lasting about 2 days, at least twice a year. By 2 days I mean that I have bouts of dizziness when I move my head, and when I try to minimize any movement and sleep it off, it becomes alright within two days.", "BPPV and menopause I have suffered through three separate bouts of BPPV over the past five years, not as terrible a track record as many on here, but the experiences are bad enough to mean I think often about preventing another attack.\n\nI am a 46-year old perimenopausal female. I noticed that on all three occasions of BPPV, I have also been experiencing hot flashes, a long stretch since my previous period, insomnia - classic symptoms of perimenopause. I found this article (and others) that reports a connection between the two conditions: (\n\nI would love to hear about the experiences of other women on here who have maybe noticed a connection as well. I really want to try and understand what about the estrogen fluctuations leads to the crystals dislodging, etc. and how it could potentially be treated. I have spoken with two different doctors about this and they are reluctant to offer opinions or even really acknowledge there might be a connection. I would love to know.  I am not peri menopausal yet, but I want to know what I can do to prevent attacks from happening. I am 28 and nowhere near menopause, but I have noticed a correlation between vestibular migraines and my menstrual cycle. This makes sense as my migraines were worst when I was going through puberty. I had migraines with aura, which for me meant that I would go blind. I would also be sensitive to light and sound. When I have a VM attack, it is many of the same symptoms, minus the actual head pain.\n\nAll that to say: it may not be BPPV (even if you are certainly diagnosed with it) but rather a dual presentation of VM and BPPV, especially if the Epley Maneuver does not resolve some episodes and you have a history of migraines.\n\nI did find this from a quick Google search: ( (about 2/3 down the page). Perhaps a Vitamin D supplement could help? This is interesting - I am pretty much over menopause (I am 61), but started hormone replacement therapy about three months ago. I have had a pretty bad and lengthy bout of BPPV that began three weeks ago. \n\nSince my progesterone bottle says \"may cause dizziness\", I discontinued it two days ago.

I am looking for the best method and I cannot remember what I used 3 years ago. I do the Epley because that is what I was taught... and it seems to work. My therapist did the Epley with me many times. She said it was the most effective for the effected ear canal on me. I also did the half somersault (foster) at home as it did not provoke symptoms as bad. I did the Epley at home as well. I once remember reading an academic article. In a clinical setting the epley had a slightly better outcome than the semont manoeuvre. Cannot remember the article but deffo somewhere on the internet.", "Anything I can do? My wife got diagnosed with BPPV this year but has been having on/off vertigo issues since 2016. She went to ENT and was told to do PT for the vertigo and take meclazine for the motion sickness. She is been getting worse lately and I feel so helpless. Is there anything I can do to help her or suggest to her? These episodes knock her on her ass and she is worried about it going off while she is driving or at work. \n\nThank you in advance for any advice you can give me or give me to give to her. I suggest to go to a balance center. Most major metropolitan areas have one. BPPV is not very  common and not all ENTS or PTs have a lot of experience with it. Have your wife get treated at a place where they do this everyday. That is where she is getting the PT at It actually is considered common, but you are right in that, despite that fact, there are not many specialists in the field that are readily available . The experts in the field are actually otoneurologists. A good PT is best for treatment but the actual skill level and knowledge on these issues are spotty at best. When I had BPPV, the  first ENT I visited admitted that while he thought it was BPPV, he did not feel comfortable treating me. He recommended that I see his colleague who had trained for a year in a vestibular clinic. My appointment with him lasted under a minute. However, the next day I returned and visited his colleague who treated and cured me almost immediately. She did Epley and sent me home with  instructions to repeat it for a week. But by that evening I was sure it was gone and it has not come back. \n\nI really respect that first guy I saw. Not every ENT will do that. This is based on my experience; have been dealing with vertigo off and on for about 10 years. This year has been particularly bad for some reason:\n\n\\- Make sure she is doing PT at a place that specializes in vestibular issues/vertigo.\n\n\\- Make sure she is doing her exercises several times per day. In my experience, push yourself even if it makes you feel like shit at first. Do not stop because you get a little dizzy/nauseas. Eventually you build up a tolerance. \n\n\\- Try sleeping upright/on a wedge pillow. This has helped me a lot. Thanks for the tips", "Is there any cured story for BPPV ?  Today it is been a month since I avoided lying on my right and left while sleeping. and I feel my body aches and my neck hurts because I always sleep facing forward. when i try to lie down facing left the spinning effect starts to appear slowly and i know this bppv has not gone away. will BPPV be completely cured?

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Bppv episodes can get cured when 1) the otoliths dissolve/break down by themselves over time or 2) when the otoliths find their way back to where they belong which can happen accidentally via rolling over at night or through the maneuvers. \n\nHowever if it is happened once, you have a higher chance  of it happening again. My memory on the exact numbers is fuzzy but I believe it is something like 30% of people will have a reoccurrence in a year and 50% within 5 years. You could have the certain maneuver done on your neck ... I think a lot of people confuse bppv with other types of vertigo.  Bppv is characterized by 30-40 seconds of nystagmus (super rapid eye movement).  It can have residual dizziness after it is corrected.  Mine lasted 2-3 months.  \n\nMy recommendation is to go see an ENT asap.  If you cannot get in soon, go to your primary.  Either way get one of them to send you to a vestibular therapist right of way.  Like today.   They were the key for me.  If you have bppv they can fix it quickly.  If you have residual dizziness or just some form of vertigo they can help you help yourself in fixing it.   \n\nAs for other things\u2026 \n\n1) my ENT is big on keeping sinuses clean as a whistle.  Get a Neti pot.  \n\n2). Accupuncture helped me a ton.  Vertigo causes anxiety which makes it worse.  \n\n3.). Exercise.  Keep moving to normalize your brain.  \n\n4.). My ENT loves magnesium too.  \n\n\nGood luck.  Get to that therapist asap and be religious about the homework they give you. I do the Epley on myself when it happens, like immediately.  Then I sleep the next couple of weeks with my head and shoulders raised.  During that couple of weeks, I repeat the Epley every few days (my theory is that smaller, gravel-like crystals fall at the same time the big one does, and it takes a couple maneuvers to get it all where it needs to be).  That seems to keep things under control for me.  Not a cure, but something I can live with. Sorry for the dumb question but where are you having accupuncture done on your body for this? Never tried it before and I am on week 6 of recovery...just cannot get rid of the 'off' feeling and pressure in my head If it is BPPV the crystals should be able to go back. If not, then start searching for other underlying causes to the symptoms. Many things that can shift with your body could creat these symptoms. For me it is tmjd and cervical misalignment It is accu-pressure based.  Hands, feet and head.

I take vitamin D daily yes and i test every 3 months ok i will look into this type of therapy thankyou so much", "First time posting here not sure what to do I (24f) have had bppv for 6 months and a feeling of fullness in my ears. Has anyone else had it this long, will this ever go away? I feel like its more than just crystals dislodged for it to being going on for so long. I do not know if I can relate to your symptoms, but I have had consistent BPPV spinning for almost 2 years now. After talking to an my doctor, an ENT, and a PT I found the best treatment is the Epley maneuver 3 times every night. I would highly recommend talking to a doctor. When you say 2 years you cannot possibly mean that when you move your head you get vertigo?? Over the last 6 years I have had BPPV a number of times. ... fullness of ears was one of my symptoms that last for years in the early ears for me. I went to the ENT, they would test for pressure in my ears and it would return \u201cnormal\u201d.\n\nIn the end I have now developed an Eustachian tube disfunction where flying and driving through the hills is somewhat painful.\n\nFollowed by residual dizziness... however after 4 years I found a PT who has helped me through BPPV and residual giving me my life back albeit I am stuck with the ear problems. For about a year my symptoms gradually became worse until I went to the doctor to see what was up and learned the Epley maneuver. Now, if I do the Epley maneuver the night before the symptoms are hardly noticeable or pretty mild. But, if I stop doing the maneuver for a few days simple bending over or looking up will trigger dizziness and it can get pretty bad. It seems like it is not improving I guess? Wow \ud83d\ude33 - genuinely surprised by this. Are you sure you are treating the correct ear and the correct canal? \n\nThe idea behind the head manoeuvre (there are a few of them) is to move the displaced crystal(s) floating around in the vestibular canal (there are 3 per ear) back to where it lives. \n\nSuccessful reposition will stop the vertigo but you may have to continue balance exercises. \n\nFor me, the vertigo has stopped but the lightheaded feeling comes and goes but improves with exercises. I am not sure if I am treating the correct ear, but the manuever I do seems to help. I have been slowly testing other manuevers. \n\nWhen the ENT and PT were trying to diagnose me they could not replicate any eye movement or the vertigo symptoms using the hall pike(?). They think that could be  because I am younger (23) and because I had been living with the (slight) vertigo for a year before attempting to fix it. \n\nIt is frustrating How long would the vertigo persist when you noticed it, a few days, weeks? Was it sporadic or consistent? Hmmm... without the eye movement, it is impossible for ENT / PT to figure out which ear to work on... in saying that, do you find that the vertigo is worse when you close your eyes or when it is dark? \n\nI lived with the dizziness feeing for years before I found a PT who could help me and they stuck frenzel goggles on me which showed eye movement and they helped me from there. \n\nYou could also see a neurologist and see if the vestibular nerve is damaged and perhaps they can help. So my last event would cause vertigo while laying down in bed and rolling left or right.\n\nThe vertigo was brought on by head movements and providing I hold the head movement the vertigo would ramp up, eyes would beat and then after 30 seconds (give or take) the spinning would slow down and stop. \n\nBPPV is not something that is sporadic, it is reproducible. Yeah the PT mentioned that and decided to treat based off of the trigger I though was the most prominent, forward backward head movements. I think when my eyes are closed it is worse.\n\nOne of the first things the ENT did was use the frenzel goggles and they did not notice anything. \n\nGood idea on the neurologist! So for years (prior to the PT and understanding what was going on) I could not walk around at night... I just accepted that at night I would walk like a spaceman and struggle to stay up right... when I eventually found the PT who taught me exercises... 6M to a year later I can walk around at night and I am nowhere near as bad. ... so just a thought that even tho your doing the epley every night and that it is helping you, I would suggest gaze stability work... quick google will show up a lot of exercises. That sounds terrible. Aside from the eye movement, that sounds pretty much like what I experience. \n\nAbout the residual dizziness, have you noticed it less when you are active, like walking, running, excercising ect? For me, the vertigo/dizziness seems to be more noticeable when Im less active. I learned about those a few days ago via this sub and will definitely be trying them out now \ud83d\udc4d Yeah - it is absolutely non existent if I am out running or cycling... I put that down to the body sensing LARGE movements and knows how to interpret those signals very clearly vs sitting still where you have slight movements which I am sure are harder to understand. \n\nFor instance, I can drive a car and become rather carsick because I am not physically moving but imagery is whirling past me... So when I do the Dix-Hallpike test, I do not get super dizzy nor do my eyes start twitch.. yet I still feel off balance all the time. Certain head movements like looking down and then right are particularly bad for me. \n\nI do not really have the spinning sensations anymore - been suffering from this for like 2 weeks now :/ \nCan anyone relate to this? / Have any suggestions? So I did an exercise on YouTube and its literally cured I havent had it for weeks after having it every night I cannot believe how simple of a fix it was lol Link? So I guess its only been 6 days but feels like weeks i feel so much better, I honestly tried some other ones and this is the only one that worked  hi. I am experiencing much of the same. I have a constant slight dizziness and feeling of being off balance. its not spinning but its like being on a boat. I also get the ear fullness and a tight jaw. I believe it is related to an injury of my neck. it all started a few months ago when I shook my head to try and get water out of my ears. I believe its some sort of whiplash injury. Ive seen an ent, several gp's and a vestibular therapist. Vestibular neuritis (the ear crystals thing) has been ruled out. I saw a neck and jaw physio because of the pain in my jaw and she believes my neck could be causing all of the problems. you should have your neck checked out. it may be something to do with that. I have got very similar symptoms to you! I have always had a \"fullness\" in my right ear - I have had it looked it, but doctors always dismissed it. They said it looks inflamed, but it will calm down on its own - it has not. I am 23, but this is something I have had since childhood so I always accepted it. I have also got an asymmetric jaw - it is slanted towards the left, I think that is due to my teeth no aligning properly, and pre covid I was planning on getting braces to repair that. \n\nDo you feel a tightness in your ear when you extend your jaw forwards? Or hear (what I assume to be) fluid movements or cracks? \n\nThanks for your reply. My BPPV symptoms have calmed down a lot over the last week - before I was constantly light-headed but that has relaxed. Now I just feel slightly off balance when I walk. \n\nI do however get the nauseating dizzyness by doing certain head movements - in my cases rotating my head counter clockwise from a 6 of the clock position to a 3 of the clock position. yes I do get the fullness in my ears when I move my head certain ways or if I sit with bad posture. for the fist 2 months of this ordeal I actually thought everything was being caused by my ears. That is where I was having the majority of my symptoms. then I started to notice the jaw. then when I saw the physio I was told that my neck muscles were extremely tight. I have now started doing stretches and exercises of my neck. \n\nthe dizziness is still there. as I am moving my neck more though, I have become a lot more conscious of how messed up my neck feels. I am realizing that the 'fullness' feeling in my ears is more like a pulling feeling. its like the ear canal is being stretched downward towards my neck. there are muscles in your neck which will pull the tendons in your ears and jaw when they become tight.\n\nI have gotten an mri of the brain and a CT scan of the skull and sinuses which were all normal. most recently I got an xray of my neck which I am expecting a call from my doctor to talk about in the next hour or so. if I can rule out any damage to my actual spine I will be relieved and continue on the path of treating my neck muscles. I highly recommend you going to a good physiotherapist. \n\nsome things to consider. do you have poor posture? do you spend a lot of time looking down at your phone or sitting at a computer. I have seen a lot people on here saying that this problem has arised for them simply from spending a lot of time laying in bed and bending their neck to look at the tv or laptop screen for hours during quarantine. I believe this has played a part for me. doing these things can weaken your neck muscles and I had spent 6 months in lockdown, most of which was spent sitting in bed (in a very small apartment) hunched over playing video games and watching TV. I believe perhaps my neck muscles were weakened by this and then the shaking of my head strained them.", "When should I go to a doctor/specialist about BPPV? I have had my first couple experiences with BPPV (assumedly) a couple years ago, and they were extremely brief, only lasting maybe 10 minutes, and all dizziness and vertigo would be gone and a complete afterthought for the rest of the day.\n\nI had my first serious experience with BPPV yesterday, which resulted in me feeling extremely nauseous, dizzy, and anxious the whole day. I even vomited twice, which is something I never do unless I am extremely ill. \n\nI woke up today feeling the same as yesterday, experiencing the vertigo when I tilted my head while getting up from bed and the nausea came along with it. I have been doing research about BPPV yesterday and today, and I keep reading about how this may last months or even years. I am fairly certain what I am experiencing is BPPV. \n\nThis vertigo has impacted my life so much in just the two days that I have experienced it, and I want to get a diagnosis and treatment for it right away. But, I am not sure if this is something that I am just being paranoid about, and should give it another week to see if it \"goes away\". Is there any advice you guys could give me? Thank you so much. Do not let negativity get you down.  Every time I have had BPPV (3 times) I did the Epley at home and resolved it myself rather quickly.  I am quite aggressive with my Epley and I will just do it over and over until it is fixed (Screw the once a day rule).  The most I have had to do it is maybe five times?  As long as I can ACTUALLY GET THROUGH IT to the end without getting sick it is fine LOL.  The residual effects can be annoying but you have to remember that as far as disorders or inconvenient things to happen to you health wise, this one is not life threatening.  Also, there are FAR WORSE THINGS that could happen to you.  Stay positive! If you can handle it, try the Epley.  I have never had it done professionally and just solved it myself.  I know that everybody is different but I refuse to wait for an appointment.  I will fix it my damn self! Assuming you have insurance, you lose nothing by going to see someone. I got an appointment with an ENT PA and he did the Epley manoeuvre with me and I have not had any dizziness or nausea since. Just go. There may be relief in your immediate future. im not a dr, or at least not on tv, im really not, but from what i learned when i had bppv the longer you wait to resolve your bppv the longer you will have symptoms. I love that you do the Epley over and over until it is fixed! Hurrah!  I have thought of this same technique (doing it over and over) the next time it hits me (assuming it WILL happen again). I initially started doing the Epley with my vestibular therapist (after a TON of testing to determine what was going on). She would do it once, and assumed it worked. But then would lay me back to check to see if it was resolved. Nope.  Then do the Epley again. By then - I was feeling so yucky. So home I would go....hoping that second time worked.  This went on for a few months - stubborn case.  But I would feel SO horrible, that I could barely do it more than twice in a day.  So, truly, kudos to you! I did try the Half Somersault many times on my own (as well as the Epley on my own in between appointments). The Half Somersault seems to not provoke the symptoms as much as the Epley - but it is also not as reliable as the Epley. Agreed. I have not had much luck with half somersault. My theory is if you throw up and immediately try the Epley again the odds are you will be able to finish it a couple times before getting sick again. Works like a charm. I would rather have one shitty day throwing up and fix it then wallow about it for months. It is massively anxiety inducing but the pros outweigh the cons Oh exactly! One super shitty day versus it lingering....and then having residual for even longer.  I had Zofran, which helped with the nausea (thank god!).  Which step of the Epley was the worst for you?  The vertigo only would hit me upon initially laying back, and then the very last step of sitting back up.  I studied the maneuvers up and down, and felt the last two steps were critical, in getting that crystal up and over the circular canal, to fall back down where it belonged, so I kept thinking the angle was slight off as I turned onto my side with my face looking down. And then feared sitting up, as that was 'make or break' with which way the crystal would fall.  And I have no defining moment of when it actually was corrected. A week went by, and I Epley'd at home, Half Somersaulted, and snowmobiled with a vengeance....So I really do not know what corrected it - other than that next week at my appointment, she laid me back and it was negative.  I told her to do it again, still negative.  No horrible vertigo, no nystagmus. Just left with crappy residual stuff. The laying down initially is the worst.  I have gotten pretty good at it.  Although even though correcting it right away has not solved the random dizzy feeling when I lay down flat (annoying but oh well).  I for some reason can easily feel which ear it is in.  I know right away what ear and then I Epley for that side.  I can feel if it goes back in when I sit up.  Leaning back far enough is super important.  I have NEVER felt dizzy when sitting up if I did it correctly.  I knew that if I sat up and felt normal then it worked.  Meclizine is rather useless and makes me feel like a zombie but that is what they gave me. Thank you for that info! All so good to know.  Yeah - sitting up was the worst - and I assumed it was the crystal falling all the way back to where it started (thus meaning it did not work).  But like I said, I never felt any tell tale difference of 'oh it worked' versus 'it did not work.'   I got pretty good at waiting out the vertigo while laying back.  And again, over analyzed those last two steps, as that is where it can all go wrong.  I was thankful to have the guidance of my vestibular therapist, to make sure I was at all the right angles and such doing the maneuver.  She was a bit stumped too - that it took over 20 Epley to get it taken care of.\n\nI got Meclizine as well.  And it did not do much for me either.  And the therapist told me NOT to take it. But the anti nausea meds were a god send at times! Thank you for sharing all your info! Any time! This group needs more positivity.  Negativity is a poison and we need to actually be a support group instead of a fearful group.  Plus, there are so many worse things that could happen to you....this is really just an inconvenience honestly.  I would rather have this than cancer or lose my hearing or eyesight all together.  Got To look on the bright side sometimes.", "Finally figured it out. It is PPPD Hey guys,\n\nSo I have been fighting for 8 months now to figure out what the fuck happened to me after suffering a concussion which resulted in BPPV. And I have finally found it is PPPD. I lived with the vertigo for 2 months before I got it successfully treated with the epley. But I felt weird after the PT treated me. I felt like my head was wrapped in something, I felt wobbly, off balance, disconnected from my body and the world and just an anxious fucking mess. \n\nI am fucking crying right now. I finally have answers. Now I need to know, I booked an appointment with a clinic that treats PPPD, and they say they can reduce symptoms by 60-90% if not all of them. Is that dependant on time spent living with the condition? Has anyone here gotten back to 100%? I want my life back. I have been working SO hard to get back to it and I have spent thousands of dollars. I was seriously ready to give up before a godsend from this reddit group helped me. \n\nI just want to hear success stories with this. I have not dealt with it an entire year yet so I am hoping that because my case is fresh, it will be easy to treat. Fingers crossed... Fucking life. Hey fellow vertigo sufferer! I have great news to share. There is life post diagnosis. I do not have time now to write a proper response. But I can elaborate more later or you can PM me. Just know, physical therapy works. There is help out there for you, and you will be in a better place soon. Sending you a big hug!! Thank you so much I really appreciate that. I will pm you now and you can take your time responding. Hi there!  I have had 2 bouts of bppv over the last couple years.  Both resulted in residual dizziness or pppd.  I did PT both times after symptoms did not resolve with just the epley.  I am still doing ot now for my most recent.  I see improvement each week.  Some days go forwards and backwards, but overall it will improve.  Do your exercises a couple times a day and be patient with your body.  Your brain has been through a difficult time and it is normal for it to take time to recreate neural pathways. You can get through this!!!!  I know it is hard to be patient - and as /u/ovansan stated, it takes a long time.  There are some that are fortunate to feel better almost immediately. But then there are those of us that do not. It is reassuring to know you are not alone.  We have chatted and I hope I helped bring some relief to you. Please keep us posted on your journey! There is always so much to learn - and it helps hearing other people's stories. It is been just over a year for me and I am finally feeling almost back to normal! I cannot get rid of the fear that BPPV will happen again....but it is not dictating my life.  I am active and healthy.  And living life to the fullest! Thank you so much! That is very comforting to know. I just want to be clear again if that makes sense. I hate feeling like I live in foggy bubble wrap That is so great! Yes thanks to you, I now fully understand what is happened to me now and can finally heal! So thank you. I will definitely be keeping everyone updated. My brief story - I have had balance issues for 6+ years. For the first 4 years I went undiagnosed and just \u201cpushed\u201d through the \u201cnot quite right\u201d feelings of being off balance, dizziness, pressure in head, tension, etc. I spent 1000s in specialists that wrote me off as having \u201canxiety\u201d until 2 years ago I somehow found my self at a PT office who was the first person in so many years that actually sympathised with me and said \u201cI treat people that have your symptoms daily and I think with exercises I can help\u201d. I burst in to tears thinking you have to be kidding me, I have been living with this and going through years of stress, anxiety and sadness of wanting my life back and finally someone has said they could help me. She started me on exercises and 2 years later with a severe bout of BPPV in between I can say that I am 80% back to normal. \n\nHighly recommend reading \u201crock steady: healing vertig\u201d by Joey she has a website filled with great information to help understand what is going on and how to heal. \n\nBest of luck. Thank you so much for sharing that ! It helps alot. I am not dizzy, but I do often get sensations of sudden falling or drop on a rollercoaster. It is awful. And I am super detached, feels like my head is wrapped in something, it is hard to focus, I have extreme fatigue, anxiety is bad, I have brain fog. It is just awful. PPPD is 100% what I believe I suffer from. I did get that book, I cannot wait to read it. Is it possible to get back to 100% or is 80% the best I am going to get? I have been living with this for only 8 months so I am hoping there is still enough time. When I say 80% I mean that during the month there will be good days and bad. The good days are where I do not have any \u201cnot quite right\u201d sensations and the bad are not terrible but I find that I am slightly off\u2026 that I will get those micro drop feelings randomly through the day or that slight floaty feeling or that feeling of the room slowly rolling but stops when I move. \n\nGiven where I was at for years being anxious, distressed and feeling like I was all alone at the end of my rope\u2026 I will take the 80%\n\nThat brain fog feeling I had was due to all the anxiety. I found that lifted along with other odd symptoms once the anxiety calmed down but that is something you need to work on separately which the book will cover.\n\nAnother thing I did was change my bed, pillow, started supporting my neck and back properly which I found helped the healing process. Spot on \ud83d\udc4d That makes total sense. I am so glad to hear that. Did you have the extreme fatigue too? I am so wiped all the time but I must admit, since I found that this is what I am suffering with, I am alot happier and my mood is starting to stabilize. I seriously thought I really hurt myself or something. I am so happy to know it can be fixed and that people like you are doing alot better. I cannot tell you how much sharing your story with me has helped. I am very thankful. Thank you :) You have to remember that the body uses all of its senses to stay up right and everyone takes these sense for granted. When there is a problem with one of these senses your body has to work overtime to compensate which chews up a lot of energy. \n\nFor years as I just \u201cpushed\u201d through I felt extreme fatigue and could not understand why\u2026 but through lots of research, finding the PT, reading books etc, it starts to make sense. \n\nI found once I understood what was happening, the healing could start, the anxiety and stress could lift and the fatigue started to disappear.\n\nIf you need some motivation have a read of \u201ccant hurt me\u201d by David Goggins. \n\nEveryone is different but reading David\u2019s book gave me a different outlook on life and how you just have to accept how the cards fall\u2026 maybe you will not get back to 100%? Maybe you will relapse? Maybe those drop feelings will not ever stop? You cannot let these things control or dictate your life That is true. Thank you for that outlook and book suggestion, I will check that out :) What are your main symps???? Some weird sensations, like motion when there is no movement, depersonalization, high anxiety. That is the worst of it now. But it is getting better since I have been taking high magnesium prescribed by my natrupath", "Seasonal Vertigo Story/Info  I had my first vertigo attack just over two years ago now. Every March/Early April and early November since I have had an episode, but not nearly as awful as the first time. So I am writing my vertigo off as seasonal. \n\nThere is little research on seasonal vertigo, however the studies done show influx in attacks in spring and fall and small correlations with humidity/barometric pressure/temperature change, but correlations nonetheless.  \n\nThere is a study about vitamin D helping to improve vertigo symptoms. I started taking Vit D/magnesium religiously last summer and the past two spells I had were not bad at all, very manageable compared to the first two I had. To my surprise, I talked to some family members and my Grandpa experiences seasonal vertigo, and his mother also struggled with it as well. So I am not convinced I did not inherit this.\n\nI am honestly about to start taking Calcium and see if that helps any. I feel like I am getting close to making these spells even less drastic by getting the vitamin combo right, considering that ENTs are at a complete loss on this. \n\n\nGood luck to everyone out there. After going through 4 spells now, one lasting 2/3 months (intense residual dizziness), the words of advice I can give you are this:\n 1) BREATH.  No seriously, breath bc this shit is scary, and world altering. But you will be okay. This WILL pass. \n2) STOP reading shit on the internet after a certain point. Please. I had myself convinced I had Menieres and other diseases. Get yourself to a doctor to confirm it is not the big shit and then STOP. after I did this my life got better. \n3) If needed:therapy. I had intense  anxiety/borderline PTSD that I needed professional help for. It did wonders for me.\n 4) Trust yourself to take care of whatever comes up. Whenever you get an episode, trust that you now know what to do to help and not help. Breathe through this. You got this. \n5) last but not least, WALK OUTSIDE. I swear to you, all I wanted to do was sit in a ball and feel awful. During the vertigo spell that lasted 2/3 months, about halfway through I had a breakdown and said fuck it. I started walking outside everyday, even though nothing looked right. When I tell you this changed everything for me. It is like moving/walking outside was the only thing grounding me. I felt so much better and took 3-2 mile walks a day. Get yourself moving, you have to tell your brain to adapt and re-adjust. You are only hurting yourself by staying stationary, load up on some meclizine and go for it. Push through. \n\nYou have got this my vestibular challenged friends.

I psyched myself out alittle I guess with google but could this very well be a seasonal issue? This may be it! Just make sure your hydrated and getting exercise/walking to rebalance. Many people get their vertigo attacks during the fall/spring. I would see a doc to just make sure it is not anything major, after that I would just say keep your head up and let it run its course. thank you so much for your advice! i am going through some dizziness and found that the more i focus on it, the worse i get.

Has anyone discovered that their BPPV episodes are tied to hormonal fluctuations? I have been dealing with BPPV for about six months, and coincidentally, my periods (F47) have been irregular/absent as well. My doctor just keeps telling me to do the Epley. Sure, it works. But, it comes right back 4-6 weeks later. I have an appointment in November to talk about starting HRT, and I wonder if that is what will stop it for good. Can anyone relate?

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Yes, I have absolutely noticed a connection. I have had three bouts of BPPV and all three coincided with times when my period stopped for a stretch. I am also 47 years old by the way. The first episode was several years ago. My period had been absent for about 2 to 3 months, I was starting to experience hot flashes and then I awoke one morning while on vacation to find the room spinning. The next two episodes also occurred in similar circumstances. I started to look into it and found this article below - it does seem like there is a clear connection. I went on low dose birth control to prevent it - so far it is done the trick, although I still on occasion get slight bouts of dizziness that the Epley will clear up. Good luck!\n\n( Yes, there is actually some research that indicates that BPPV can be linked to hormones. I found it interesting when my ENT told me BPPV seems to effect women more than men, and usually around middle age. \n\nHere is one such paper about it:\n\n\n\n\nFor what it is worth, I am 40 but my mother started early as did my sisters, and I have been noticing hormonal changes for a couple years now, and was hit with vertigo earlier this year. Thank you for the link! Thanks for the link! Next time I go see my doctor, I will mention it\u2026although he is can be pretty useless sometimes. for sure. i started having dizzy spells maybe 2 days after starting a hormonal birth control that contains only progestin. i have no idea how it is connected, but it has to be. i have vertigo spells around once every month as well that seem to just come out of nowhere, and can they last up to 20 mins. room spinning, vomiting, etc. no hearing loss, pressure, or fullness. just some buzzing noise in my left ear when my heads in certain positions.", "Heavy Tight Head Pressure, no hearing loss...inner ear? Thought you could help, even if a little bit.  I do not look to be mean-spirited in any.  I am just looking for other people who may have similar feeling as mine.   I am desperate so I thank you in advance.\n\nHi.  So I had flu-like symptoms back in January.  Mucus, fever, cough etc.  As I was getting over it I developed slight vertigo.  It would come and go for the next couple weeks.  Some days hardly noticeable (although I was starting to get really fatigued at the gym...odd).\n\nOkay. \n\nBut then in February, I developed ear fullness and facial tension.\n\nThat is when the vertigo came back.  And it came back stronger.  I eventually developed a heavy head with so much pressure that sometimes it felt like it was going to explode.\n\nIt got me lightheaded and sent me to urgent care.  \n\nI eventually was given a comprehensive blood panel which came out just fine (except for a tad bit low on Vitamin D and a tad bit high cholesterol.\n\nThe doctor said it could be possible I have a middle/inner ear infection.  \n\nNow it is been over a month since these symptoms began.\n\nNo more vertigo.  Well at least not from my eyes...(when I close my eyes, I do sway a bit.  So there is still imbalance there?).  \n\nHowever I still have a heavy head and ear pressure/crackling! Like heavy head sensations.  The head pain moves around, sometimes feels like a wooden block is in front of my face or I am being squeezed from my temples.  \n\nI also feel most lightheaded when I lean forward or stand up too quickly.\n\nNow I have had migraines growing up.  This feels different just cause I feel lightheaded and the pain and nausea are ever constant.\n\nOn top of that, I am beginning to have odd sensations in my body too...Burning hands when it is just a tad bit cold outside.  Throbbing fingers at random times.  And burning feet especially in the morning when it is coldest.  Also today for about an hour my legs were non-stop tingling and numb.  \n\nThere seems to be some peripheral neuropathy going on here but I am not sure why.  Can an ear or possible sinus infection cause the nerves in my body to go haywire?? \n\nOr is this something else? Anxiety? MS? Fibromyalgia? \n\nI also have aches developing in random places in my body  (mainly in chest/ribs \u2014 throbbing sensations in back between shoulders in the morning) + developing shortness of breath with heart palpitations.  Almost like I cannot take a full breath.  Maybe 70%.\n\nI have been googling my symptoms everyday.  And I did have a few panic attacks early on.  But as of now, I am not even anxious.  Just frustrated.  Is it possible for panic attacks from before cause me to have physical symptoms subconsciously to this day?? \n\n\n29 year old male\n5\u20197\n175 lbs\n\nI was healthy leading up to the new year.  Now I am ill and every little thing that hurts my body instantly sends me to google.  \n\nIt sucks.  \n\nOn a side note: Loud sounds do make me lightheaded.  Almost as if any startling sounds brings pressure to my sensitivity.  Could be an ear issue? \n\nAlso, I did score high blood pressure the last few doctors visits.  I am not sure if it is due to potential illness or because of somewhat high cholesterol.  Like I mentioned I would go to the gym 4 out of 7 days a week.  Now I can barely move without feeling fatigued.\n\nNo more fever, no mucus, no cough.   \n\nDoes this sound like it could possibly be MS or is my doctor correct in ear/sinus infection? \n\n\nAny advice would be amazing! BPPV is classified by vertigo when changing head position. It sounds like you need a comprehensive medical checkup. Nausea and fatigue with bppv are secondary to the vertigo. Get a full check, hope you find some answers. I agree with bejingmanny - I think you have something other than BPPV going on.  You can test for BPPV by doing a simple test (Dix Hallpike) and see if laying back in that position creates the intense vertigo and nystagmus (eye twitching).  It sounds as if you have an underlying, possibly low grade infection, that is starting to effect other things.  And anxiety could certainly play into it as well, causing other symptoms.  Please see a medical doctor and hopefully they can get you feeling better soon - as you have a lot of symptoms that could be concerning. Have you had any luck getting any answers? I am experiencing many of the same symptoms also brought on by some mystery virus. My PCP is probably going to send me for an MRI, but has not physically examined me due to covid issues. And I might have to wait a while. How you feeling these days?? Much better. The vertigo has been completely gone for a while. Only remaining symptoms are nerve things like random twitches, burning feet, and a bit of fatigue. Finally going for that MRI next week. That is good to hear.", "no more BBPV with Benzodiazepines? Hi, during my Benzodiazepine treatment (8 years) I did not experience any BBPV episode by far, not even any small dizziness. I have been 16 months off these pills now, and I have been experiencing a lot of BBPVs. Just like before my treatment. \n\nI just want to know if there is someone in this forum with a similar experience, because I do not really think it is a coincidence (0 episodes in 8 years\u2026)\n\nThanks a lot. Oddly enough, I always chalked up my BPPV to a sickness at the end of 2019. That was however when I started tapering down and coming off 2 years of Ativan. so it happened the same to you? (more or less)", "my first BPPV episode. need advice so i had my first bppv episode yesterday. i woke up at 7 30 am and was fine and i was just snacking. around 9 30 am, i decided to sleep in more. i woke up at 11 am and the whole world is spinning. i had to grab my mattress as i thought i was falling down. the ambulance came and when the paramedics tried to get me to my feet, i started throwing up. i was in the ED and was unofficially diagnosed as BPPV and was discharged on meclizine 25 mg every 8 hours as needed. \n\nnow i can stand on my feet and do stuffs, but whenever i tried to lay down flat on my bed, i would have 15 sec of the room spinning and it would stop. \n\nso my question is does meclizine works for you guy or do I need to go see ENT for the maneuver? i read someone that bbpv occurs mostly in ppl older than 50s. I am only 23 and i am scared that it would never go away and reoccur again. i am guessing/ hoping that when i washed my hair the day before, the water might have gone into my ears and it is causing it. i hope it is not due to some crystals in the ear having dislodged. I would advise you to get checked by either an audiologist that does vestibular or a vestibular physical therapist. BPPV is very treatable and meclizine will not help as this is a mechanical issue, i.e., those crystals floating around in one of the posterior canals most likely. They will perform a positional testing to diagnose which side and which canal then treat you then. If you are going to get vertigo, BPPV is the most easily treated. Hi!\n\nI am 23 and I have BPPV as well.  I have had maybe around 4 major bouts of it in 3 years?  I have not had the medication you mentioned, but the Epley Maneuver is the only thing that eventually makes mine go away.  They taught me at the hospital when I went to the ER because I had no idea what was happening to me.\n\nI would say the maneuver is important so it is best to go to the ENT to at least figure out how to perform it properly. It is a gross feeling and makes me extremely anxious doing it (because it brings on the symptoms) but should you have BPPV again it will save you a lot of grief. \" If you are going to get vertigo, BPPV is the most easily treated. \" \n\nit calms me a bit. thank you. i am going to make an appt with ent tmr Hello. I know it can be a scary thing, but it is nothing too frightening. I myself just had a second attack last week, and my first was three years ago.\n\nFirst, go to an ENT and get the Eply done. You will know which ear and it will get resolved.\n\nIt will take some time and you will have some residual dizzyness but it should go away.\n\nAs for future attacks, it is a concern of mine as well. Last time a chiropractor screwed me by adjusting my neck. This time, I had the most normal day and it still happened. My ENT said these things just happen. \n\nIf it does happen in the future it will be less alarming because of this experience Ugh I had my first attack in dec and it went away on its own. Then Friday I had a really bad allergy attack and woke up sat with very bad bppv. I went this morning to get my first epley maneuver but first they did the test and it brought out the dizziness 10 fold. It was so bad and she did it again on the other side. Then when she finally did the epley, the dizziness was so bad I fell off the table. I made her stop as I started crying. It is an awful thing. I do not know what to do next but not the epley. how long does it take for the first attack to go away on its own? it is my fourth day now. does not seem to be getting better. I think it is all subjective. \u201cAttack\u201d can mean different things to everyone. My attacks only last a few seconds until I get standing and grounded. They say people learn to deal with vertigo by adjusting their stance or position and then it subsides. But the vertigo is still lingering around in that if I let it, it will happen. A lot of people say they have it if they sleep on one side so they do not sleep on that one side. And that can be for years.", "Anyone feel that mild vertigo/dizziness can be triggered by tiredness and hangover? I feel like my head is spinning and dizzy this morning as I am extremely tired and had a couple glasses of wine last night. I feel like when I focus on something my head starts to get dizzy and light headed like residual bppv. I have not had a severe episode since January 2019. I have suffered from residual dizziness every now and then but I feel like it is worse when I am very tired in the morning or slightly hungover or even when I focus on something for too long or position my head a certain way. Does anyone relate to this? Thanks! I do feel as though when I am exhausted.... The mild dizziness gets worse. It is like my system is not strong enough to fight it off. Or maybe I am just too tired to put the effort forth to ignore it? Regardless.... Lack of sleep makes me feel it more.", "Heartbeat whooshing in the ear ? Before yesterday i was diagnosed with BPPV and the only thing the doctor told me to do is the semont maneuver 10 times a day for 2 weeks and check again with him. But i want to ask is it a symptom of bppv to hear my heart whooshing in my left ear even tho they said i have something in my right ear. I tried to touch my nerve on my hand and its whooshing the exact same time my heart is beating. Of course the dissociation and dizziness Mostly the whole day that makes me super weird and hate everything im getting easily irritated. \n\nI noticed I had this last night when I was sleeping with my head turned to the left where my right ear is currently the suspect one. I hate seeing \u201c untreatable \u201c. Everything im going through is basically untreatable idk what to do anymore tbh. My dissociation is too much and it bothers me so much. Idk what can i do I have the exact same thing! It is called pulsatile tinnitus. I had it two years ago until it dissapeared on it is own, and now when i got sick with bppv it came back. I think it is a symptom yes, but in my case it dissapeared on it is own. Do you feel dissociated too? I have been struggling with that for so long, i thought i was going absolutely crazy! Can you tell me more about that? Im going through the same thing! 3 years ago i had dissociation and the it went and now 2 months ago it all suddenly came back. My main issue is the dissociation it sucks soooo much the doctor told me to do the semont manuver 10 times a day for 2 weeks then we will check up again Do not hesitate to dm me if you need someone to talk to. Untreatable does NOT mean chronic. \n\nThe dissociation is absolutely horrible, and the anxiety is gut wrenching, but it will get better. It will. You just have to give it some time Already sent you a msg", "Dizzy for four weeks after a vertigo attack Hey fellows,\n\nHas anybody here experienced constant dizziness for weeks after a vertigo attack?\n\nAround four weeks ago, I had two vertigo attacks for the first time in my life. It was early morning, and I was sleeping on my bed where I instantly rolled over from right to left, and felt that room around me is spinning for 3 seconds. I though it is nothing serious. Then I heard my phone alarm, and instantly sat down (from laying down position) and I had another vertigo for 3 seconds. Since that time, I have had no vertigo anymore but I have been constantly lightheaded like 24/7. It is like somebody is shaking my head all the time (or like I am on a boat all the time). I get a bit better when I am laid down.\n\nThe day after vertigo attacks, I went to urgent care and the doc told me that my left ear is full of wax. She washed it and removed the wax, and examined both ears and said that there are some liquids there that should not be. Prescribed Amoxicillin and Meclizine. I took them for about 6 day, but did not get better. Went to an ENT doctor. He examined my ear, nose, and throat. Told me there is no infection, inflammation or anything. An audiologist also tested my ears and my hearing was 100% fine. The doc had no idea. Told me that these constant lightheadedness might be due to the vertigo attacks. So told me that this is BPPV and referred to a physical therapist. I want to the therapy twice, but no help. The therapist tried epley maneuver and no help. Also he put some vibrating device on the back of my head behind each ear to check if it is making me more dizzy. And it was, specially when vibrating on the back of my left ear. He said he thinks it is not vertigo and might be some allergy. Suggested me to take antihistamines, which I took for a few days after that, and no help (so I stopped taking them)\n\nThis lightheadedness gets better some time and worse some other time. For instance, when I look down (while sitting at the dining table to have lunch or dinner) or when I work with my laptop for 5 minutes. It gets so bad and remains so bad for a few hours. Then it gets better a bit, but it is still there and I can feel it. \n\nReally worried now. Does anybody have similar experiences?\n\nThanks. Yeah I had positional vertigo episodes in the morning upon waking up which subsided and was replaced with persistent dizziness. I went to a physiotherapist who found nystagmus and had me do the Epley. Dizziness stayed though. Funny enough I did the exact same thing as you did and went to emergency, where they also told me to flush out my ears. This was 12 years ago and while I have not experienced vertigo the dizziness has persisted. Do you find it is better when you are walking around doing chores and whatnot or when you are still? Omg, you gave me a semi heart attack! So you have been like this for 12 years? Dizzy all days for 12 years?\n\nYeah sitting still is the hardest for me. Standing still is hard too like standing in the bathtub to take a shower. But walking is totally fine. \n\nHave you tried like every possible treatment? I get worse when working with my laptop, and I cannot just ignore my laptop forever because I am a data scientist and working with my laptop is literally how I get paid. \n\nHave you tried going to upper cervical chiropractors? I saw a youtube video of a lady that got good by going to an upper cervical chiropractor after 8 years of dizziness. I want to see a neurologist first to rule out all the bad stuff, and then if dizziness still stays, try that chiropractor. I get vertigo spells throughout the day (every day).  Varies day to day. Yo same thing happen to me I had a vertigo episode twice about 2 and a half months ago and after the spinning stopped It left me dizzy like a swaying rocking sensation and it is been constant every since. Ent checked me out and ordered an MRI and hearing is also not affected. Yes, I also find activities like showering, sleeping or sitting still to be difficult but find it less severe when going for walks or keeping myself mobile. And yeah, dizzy all day for 12 years, although severity varies.\n\nI did see a chiropractor for a bit, but did not find it to be helpful. I am not sure if it was a chiropractor who specialized in upper cervical though, so I do not know if it would be helpful. \n\nIn terms of treatment, I have tried physical therapies and medications with either no or temporary results. Right now I am working on maintaining vestibular therapy and hoping to see some results in maybe the next six months. I would recommend seeing an otolaryngologist (ENT) as well for testing. \n\nAt this point I am pretty sure I either have mal de debarquement or PPPD, but I am waiting to get in to see an ENT to confirm. Yeah I did see an ENT specialist and said it is BPPV and you have to wait until it gets better. I saw him one week after vertigo. I am going to see another ENT in two weeks (which would be 6 weeks after vertigo) to see what he says. \n\nYeah PPPD is also possible in your case, but for I am not still sure since it is been only 4 weeks, and for PPPD to be confirmed it has to be consistent for more than 3 months. Apparently, PPPD also has some treatments, some psychological, some therapies, and some medications. \n\nHope you get better soon. I can literally feel how being dizzy like this for such a long time can be difficult. Hopefully MRI will not show some serious thing, and it gets better soon. Have not you felt any improvements (even with a slow rate) during these 2.5 months? For most people it goes away within 2-3 months. I am hoping the same thing for my case. It is emotionally draining, to say the least. I know there is been some literature on treatments such as SSRI's for PPPD. When I first found out about it I tried an SSRI and did see improvement, but over time that improvement decayed so I was not sure if it was a fluke or if the medication had actually helped. When I noticed that it was getting worse again, I tried switching to Effexor (an SNRI) and then to Citalopram (an SSRI again) but found neither to be particularly helpful and maybe even damaging in the case of the Citalopram. \n\nI know in a lot of cases these issues tend to resolve themselves, and I hope that is the case for you as well. You mentioned laptop use makes your symptoms worse. Do you notice it immediately or does it feel like it relates to how long you have been sitting in front of a screen? Is it the scrolling action that sets it off? Yeah, basically these days (after 4 weeks), I am most of the time ok (almost no dizziness) expect when two things happen:\n1. When I look down (like having my meal while sitting behind dining table)\n2. When looking at my laptop. \n\nAnd in both cases, dizziness happens so fast. Like after looking at my laptop for 30 seconds. \n\nAnd when dizziness gets bad due to these cases, it remains bad for a few hours even if I do not look down or at my laptop after 30 seconds. I have to lay down for some time like one hour and again it gets better. \n\nI feel like laying down recharges my battery. For a normal person, he has to lay down after something like 15 hours. For me, that time is 3-4 hours, and I have to lay down. \nIt is like my battery is broken \ud83d\ude01 Is the dizziness a spinning sensation when you do these things or like a sense of being on a boat? Have you tried elevating your laptop when you work? That sucks though, especially since most jobs require some amount of screen time. It is not the spinning sensation. It is always the boat sensation. Yeah I tried sitting behind my desk and putting the laptop so that the screen height and my head\u2019s height become the same so that I do not have to look down. It is better and I can tolerate it more, but still after 10 minutes or so, I feel the strong boating sensation. Hmm, do you think it is from scrolling or just staring at the screen in general? I can say that it is gotten better. I guess time can heal it. I have PPPD. I am 25 years old and I have had it for the past year. It gets easier once you are able to start distracting your mind. Anxiety is a major trigger for it. Thinking about the fact you hope you do not wake up dizzy is a trigger for it. It is all about re-training your mind to try not to associate dizziness without everyday life. I was not able to work or drive for 9 months. Now I can work..under special situations.. and I can drive if someone else is in the car with me. \n\nAll my skills are still there.. just have to re train my mind to believe that they are. The more you focus your life around the dizziness, the more it inhabits your life. Thanks for sharing your story. I am really happy that it has gotten better for you, and hopefully, it will be completely gone soon. I have read about PPPD as well, and I believe I still have to wait to get to at least 3 months of dizziness to confirm PPPD. But yeah, it might be just something on the mind and the thought, and nothing is really wrong with the brain or inner ears.\n\nMy experience is a little different than yours, though. I was able to drive from day one, and honestly, driving is the easiest thing to do for me, and I do not know why :D\n\nLooking at my laptop was making me dizzier, but that sense is also gone since last week, and I can work with my laptop without dizziness.\n\nRight now, I am on week 5, and I am at a stage that I almost have no dizziness most of the time. So basically no dizziness while driving or working or walking. I get dizzy if I sit still for quite some time and my neck is not supported. If I lean my head on something (like a big chair), no dizziness. Walking is also OK, and I get a bit dizzy if I stand still for quite some time. \n\nI believe my improvement trend is good, although it is slow, and more importantly, it is not strict. I mean the trend is positive, but I cannot say that today I am definitely feeling better than yesterday. So the improvement trend is fluctuating, but the overall trend is positive. I think it is getting better (and I would very much like to believe it :D )\n\nI also have other appointments with my ENT doctor, PD, and Neurologist coming up within the next few weeks, just to rule out all the serious stuff. By the way, I watched this video regarding PPPD, which is helpful, and basically shows all that dizziness is on your mind, and if you try to not think about it, it will go away completely, as you said. \n\n(\n\nIt is a story a lady who had PPPD for long years (15 years I guess), and then saw some packages on the internet, and bought them, and dizziness was gone eventually. I have not bought the packages, but I read about those on the website of the lady that sells them. It is all spiritual and basically psychological videos that advise you to think about other things and distract your brain, and etc. That sounds really good!! I am happy it is improving. The reason I cannot drive is because I had a dizzy episode while I was driving on a freeway overseas and almost passed out. So it is like an aversion thing. Different people have different experiences with their dizziness so it get stronger in some areas. But it sound like yours is more of a positional thing! \n\nMine was linked with anxiety and low blood pressure when I stand up too quickly. I am on an SSRI and they help but work is still needed to be done! \n\nI was not even able to walk into a cafe to get a coffee at the start! But now I can go to the supermarket and do all sorts of things. \n\nThe lockdown of COVID has hindered my ability to challenge my dizziness and go out and continue to work on it so it is up and down for me at the moment. \n\nIt is just a shame I work on roofs for a living! So I am just super careful and aware of my symptoms when I do work and I can always tell when it is time to get back on the ground! \n\nI got diagnosed within a month of having it because I was desperate for recovery. Not being able to function was super difficult but I quickly found mindfulness and meditation a very good way of ground myself and calming down my balance senses when it was bad. \n\nIt sounds like yours is a bit milder than mine but if you have any questions, feel free to ask me! Is her name Joey? The lady that sells them? An Australian lady. \nI live in the same town she is in.. I saw the packages but way too expensive.. so I decided to research what neuroplasticity was all about and have been able to identify the structure behind her programs so I can work on it myself and with my therapist Oh man, yeah working of roofs can be difficult with dizziness. Definitely get enough rest between work periods. I hope both of us feel completely well soon. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Yeah I think so. Great. Hope it helps \ud83d\ude0a", "Can Stress Cause BPPV I know it seems like an odd question because BPPV is a physical ailment in the sense that those crystals have moved or are moving and stress is more mental, but of course it can manifest in a physical illness'...but can it cause the crystals to move?\n\nAnyway, I think my recent and lingering episode is stress related and I say that because im super stressed out and I got it at the peak of my stress (when Kobe passed) and I can even feel my other stress symptoms like hurting jaw and temple. Not to mention I got a pimple and I am usually blemish free.\n\nDo you think it is possible that it is stress related? We do t really know the cause of BPPV exactly but here is a publication for a study that found a potential role of emotional stress connected to adverse life events as a trigger of otoconial dysfunction (bppv). I personally had my first episode when I was going through a stressful period.\n\n Thank you, yes I saw this. Most of my illness always come from stress and this most recent incident, like yourself, came at a very stressfully time. I am the same I always get some kind of illness when I am stressed out. More to add to the pot right? Lol unfortunately bppv episodes can cause more anxiety so it definitely does not help especially when it bothers you for some time. \n\nI recommend just taking some time to yourself and get distracted, (ie: books, video games, exercise etc) Even when everything is crazy, taking some time for yourself and just mentally relaxing has helped me. :) Yeah, I have got shingles in the past...and I am in my 20s!!!\n\nWorking two jobs, one that sucks, doing my Master's full time, being stuck in the cold weather, dealing with family issues, and thinking about my future as really got me stressed the f out lol. So you are right I need to take some time for myself. Shingles! Oh man! I am sorry about that. I have meen fortunate to not have that..yet. Lol but I always catch the nasties that are going around. Strep throat being the one that likes to come around every year. &gt;.&lt; \n\nI feel you on that. When I got my first episode back in sep last year I was like wth does not this happen when you get older? Not in your 20s. \n\nI just graduated college, and let me tell you that was a weight off my shoulders. The struggle was real but it is worth it. Good luck on all your studies and stay positive! \ud83d\udc95 Thank you! And best of luck to you as well! My first \"episode\" (I think it was BPPV I am really still not sure) was five months ago and during one of the most stressful periods of my life. My job was tough, I was fighting with my girlfriend, my apartment flooded three weeks after moving in, and my landlords were complete shitheads about it and would not let me leave the lease.\n\nI strongly believe the insane stress I was going through lead to my issues (which I am still dealing with, specifically horrible anxiety). Damn I am sorry to hear about your stress and anxiety, I hope you you get relieved of it all very soon.\n\nWith your comment, I know also believe my BPPV was stressed related. All the signs seem to point to it", "What are the chances of crystals moving if you sleep on the opposite side? I have right ear BPPV. I did the Epley twice and it seems to be better now. I have been sleeping on my left side but what are the chances of crystals from my right ear moving and getting vertigo again if I do this? \n\nAlso will sleeping on my left increase the chances I will get left ear BPPV? No. I think you should sleep on your back, though. Does sleeping on your back lessen the chances of crystals moving? \n\nI am not naturally a back sleeper although I can probably train myself to be one. However my pillow is specifically for side sleepers. I do not know if it reduces the chances of them moving but it happened to me and I found that sleeping on my side made it harder to overcome.q Every time I have slept on my back with my head flat on the bed I have woken up with another episode. It seems that sleeping with an elevated head prevents this problem from occurring.", "4 episodes, all around 2 or 3 am Wonder if there is any meaning behind all of my vertigo episodes happening in the middle of the night.  \n\n2 woke me up from a dead sleep (and were way worse) and the other 2 i was sleeping, but not so strongly (about half as bad).  \n\nAnyone else?", "Has anyone tried the Dix-Hallpike test at home? I have been having dizzy spells and tried it but neither ear triggered dizziness and I videoed my eyes and they were still", "Is this BPPV? My doctor said I have free floating inner ear crystals and canalithesis. They did the Epley Maneuver on me 5 days ago but it didnt help. I have pressure or a full feeling in my ears, constant crackling in my ears, and I feel off balance when I walk, especially when I turn corners or make sudden head movements. I wanted to know if this is consistent with BPPV and if anyone in this sub had similar problems or any solutions for it. Thanks Tinnitus and a full or pressurized feeling could be meniere's disease. Definitely check that out as it matches exactly. I get tinnitus the day or two before getting an attack, but do not have the pressurized sensation. I was diagnosed with it, but your description matches closer than mine.\n\nThe vertigo attacks come and go, but it does additionally produce hearing loss over time (years).\n\nI have a residual off, floaty, sensation for even a week following an episode. Noticeable when turning more than 90 degrees quickly. Late stages of the disease may trade off intense attacks for constant minor to moderate balance issues.\n\nIf this is what it is, there is no cure. Worth investigating for mitigating options. The hearing loss can become severe over time, but the good news is supposedly the vertigo episodes eventually become milder with it. \n\nWorst part, low sodium diet is recommended. \n\nHope it is not this, but it matches up awfully well. Thanks for the reply-i always thought tinnitis was like a ringing noise in ear-what i feel is like a popping and its pretty much always present. I also do not have episodes of vertigo or being off balance, I always have it. Everytime I am walking, for the last 6 months, I have experienced it, except for in the mornings, which is odd. Also, I passed my hearing exam with flying colors and neither my ENT or audiologist ever mentioned tinnitis. They said specifically that I had \"labyrinth dysfunction.\" Finding out next steps this week after Epley failed to help. Hmm, I did pass my hearing test quite well myself. To my own surprise honestly. That part of the disease is progressive. Seen mostly in the second and third stage.\n\nTinnitus can actually mean any sort of sound that is not there. Anything from a buzz, humm, or ring to something akin to a train in your ear. \n\nThe pressure thing is persistent for some people. The whole theory of the disease is, very roughly, too much fluid causes pressure buildup which damages hair receptors. Pressure reaches a critical point and releases, causing vertigo episode or auditory abnormalities. Low frequency sounds being most common for initial damage from this.\n\nNot saying you absolutely do have it, but you fit the mold at least as well as I do. The fullness, crackling, and off balance feeling is what I had and continue to get sometimes. I was told I had BPPV when I had everything and the vertigo but since then my pt told me it is CCI (cranial cervical instability). My neck also is very stiff and the muscles are tight and sore. Maybe something to look into? With my 4th episode of BPPV, I finally saw some specialists and worked with a vestibular therapist.  I also had ear fullness, crackling, popping, and gurgling (Fluttering).  It was SO annoying!  I was Diagnosed officially with left side BPPV.  Long story short, after many tests - my ears checked out ok. I have had tinnitus for over 30 years, so that was nothing new. Hearing test was good.  My grandmother had Meneires - so I feared I had it also.  My 'ear' problems were dismissed - as they could not find anything wrong.  And even though I had 'some' symptoms of Meneires, it was dismissed as well.\n\nI worked with my vestibular therapist, who performed the Epley on me 2 times during each weekly appointment, and it took over two months and 20 Epley's to get the crystal back in place.  So do not worry, if it did not work the first time. I also was able to perform the Epley and Half Somersault at home in between sessions towards the end.\n\nAfter the crystal was cleared (which can be tested by doing the first step of the Epley - called  the Dix Hallpike), and there was no vertigo or nystagmus, I still felt HORRIBLE for quite some time.  Every time I went back to my therapist, I made her do the numerous tests - to check all ear canals again, because I was certain something was still wrong. She (the therapist) helped calm my anxiety (which feeds the dizziness).  I had horrible residual dizziness, which has taken about 7 or 8 months to go away.  I had vestibular exercises to do - to help my system learn to rebalance itself, after being off balance for over two months.\n\nThe fluttering and fullness in my ears has finally gone away.  Still have no answers for it.  But I definitely know what you are talking about, but do not mention it often, as none of the 'experts' thought much of it.  It was horrible trying to go to sleep, as it was so loud and the ears just kept fluttering and gurgling.", "Do i have vertigo and what should i do? Hello\n\nI am 21 y.o. male. My symptoms are I cannot concentrate, I cannot help but look up, my vision gets a bit blurry. i have seen 2 ent doctors that specialize in balance and they said nothing is wrong with me and i have seen 2 neurologists, one of them said what i am experiencing is an expression of my depression and the other one said this is not vertigo and that there is nothing wrong with me and i should see an ophthalmologist. I kind of believe that this is an expression of my depression but i cant do absolutely nothing about it.\n\nthank you Does not sound like BPPV to me.  If you lay down, sit up, and then the room spins that is BPPV.  One of those P's is position. Lack of concentration and blurry vision are not signs of BPPV.  I am not sure why your vision would get blurry when you look up, but I would also think that this is something to see an eye doctor about. my vision is gets blurry in general not only when i look up, thanks", "Need some guidance. Hey everyone. \n\nSo I will just get right into it. I hit my head back in July of 2020, recovered from the concussion just fine. I did have vertigo that I got treated with the Epley maneuver, and it worked great. I did not let vertigo stop me tho while I lived with it for 2 months. I still worked out with it, I did not care. But then slowly before I got it fixed, I noticed anxiety? It started creeping up on me until one day I had a full blown panic attack that made me disassociated and struggle with Derealization. I thought fixing the vertigo would help. But I am still struggling with the Derealization. I do not get dizzy anymore though. I did have a bad bout again where it came back in my sleep in December, but I just had epley done again by my husband and it was gone again. \n\nI do still struggle though with Derealization, anxiety and the odd sensation that pops up. This sensation I can describe. I will be sitting totally still, then I will get a jolt of anxiety in my head and then it will feel as if I am falling for half a second, then my body will get really hot from the anxiety and weak. I usually go outside when this happens and then I am totally fine. I have been to a vertigo specialist and she did a multitude of tests on me (the same lady that actually cured my vertigo) and she told me I do not have it anymore, it is not coming up at all, and suspects that it is just bad anxiety from trauma. Could this be all it is or is it still vertigo? I am not dizzy. But I still have the other issues from before. I cannot figure it out. I am seeing a natrupathic doctor too and she is helping me alot. I am taking magnesium supplements now and they do help reduce the fog. I just do not know what is happening to me. And obviously after googling lingering vertigo, I am very anxious now and freaking out. Any advice is welcome. I have the same thing. The derealization is definitely the worst symptom for me. I was hoping it would dissapear when i got better... What is derealization? I feel like my GP did a terrible job explaining BPPV to me. Feeling like youre in a dream or that life is not real. Does this sound like vertigo still tho or just anxiety from the experience Probably both, but mostly anxiety. The body does not like being dizzy I am not dizzy anymore tho. Yeah me neither, but the body starts adjusting to being dizzy, so it is normal to feel dizzy and off long after the bppv is treated, because the body needs time to get used to not being dizzy anymore Thank you! That is what I read too. I am going to be calling a dizziness clinic to help reset my brain. I did live with chronic vertigo every day for 2 months but it did not bother me until I got it healed and then I was scared as fuck to move my head, to sleep, to do anything. It is almost like my brain is anticipating all the dizziness again but it does not happen. The experience of vertigo absolutely traumatised me lol The experience of vertigo absolutely traumatised me lol. Litterally, me too! It is so scary and debilitating, i remember feeling so hopeless and scared. \nYeah, seems like a good idea! Did it get better for you? I still struggle with the residual stuff, but it is improving little by little. Im not crazy anxious anymore and i do not get those attacks anymore either.  when it first started it was so bad. I was anxious, depressed, and dissociated. my dreams felt more real than when i was awake. I woke up every day in a panic attack and i thought i was going absolutely crazy. i still feel dissociated and foggy, but it gets more and more bearable so would say that it is better, yes. That is exactly to a T how I feel. I am a lot better than I was, but I am still horribly anxious, depressed at times and disassociated. I just want it to stop. Yeah, i feel you. I really hope it subsides soon for the both of us. today is a particularly bad day, and i feel very jittery, dissociated and dizzy. Im scared it is coming back but i will cross my fingers and hopefully sleep it off. Feel free to dm me if you want someone to talk to during your healing-period Thank you my friend. Likewise ! I am here for you too. I am finally going to a clinic on Tuesday that said they could help me with this.", "2 months long of this so i am going on 2 months of having vertigo. I developed it immediately after having covid. my symptoms are not so much as the room is spinning but more so that i am swaying forward and backward. I do not know if anyone else can relate but just me walking in a straight line I feel like i am on an incline and it immediately switches to me feeling like i am falling backwards. like i am in one of those \u201cfun houses\u201d at a carnival where the flood underneath you moves, inclines, declines - back and forth. my vision gets blurry most days. I have a tingly/heavy sensation in my limbs. \n\ni am sad to say but I feel like it is gotten progressively worse. I was on mezcline for about a month, my ENT suggested I get off of it due to it not working and so this past month all he is given me is the motion sensory patches you put behind your ear (like when you are on a cruise ship)\n\nof course this has not helped either. \n\ni have cried every single day since having this. I feel like I cannot trust any doctors to properly diagnose me. it is sad but I genuinely hate being awake some days. at least while i am asleep I do not feel the swaying. \n\ni have done the eye and head exercises. \n\nnothing helps. \n\nany advice? is there an end to this? \ni am so drained and tired of feeling this way.

Get the good stuff, full spectrum only from a reputable shop/dispensary. Good luck and hang in there! (((Hugs))) thank you so much for the rec! do you just do the drops under your tongue? Just keep on.   It took me three months.  A few things that helped me:\n\n1). Accupuncture.  Did it three times a week.  It helped.  A lot.  \n\n2). Massage therapy for head, neck, shoulders.  Dizziness makes us anxious, anxiety makes us tense, tension makes us dizzy.   \n\n3).  My ENT swears by two things:  500 mg of magnesium a day and keeping sinuses whistle clean with a neti pot.  \n\n4).  Exercise.  I walked and walked and walked hours a day.  Took my mind off shit and made me good a good tired.   I also did/do a lot of yoga. \n\n5).  Vestibular therapy and the homework.   I did about 15-20 minutes a day.

I really REALLY appreciate this response and you taking the time to list out your remedies. i have saved every single one of them. reading stuff like ^ this makes me feel so much more seen and understood about this because everyone around me (is super understanding and helpful but..) also do not understand to the fullest degree. \n\nagain, thank you for taking the time to list everything. i am going to do everything you mentioned - even acupuncture!!! which i have never done in my whole life. \n\nwhen you did acupuncture, did you tell the specifically that yours was for vertigo symptoms? Yes.  Tell them your symptoms.  Good luck. One last thing to list.  Diet!   Eat clean and healthy.  It made me feel good.  Lay off sugar and processed shit. Do not worry it just needs time..just keep moving and do VRT, eat healthy and just know that it will get better.. 2 months is still actually too soon for many ppl who suffer from dizziness..try to laugh it out and focus on healthy things like exercising and staying busy and active\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb you will get better, i was still very lightheaded at 2 months and my body swayed at night and my balance was off when walking, now more than 5 months in and im feeling soooo much better and my symptoms have really eased off. Good luck to you I am sorry you are experiencing this. Have you been diagnosed with BPPV? Diagnosing BPPV is pretty easy with the Dix-Hallpike. Treating it requires a vestibular specialist to properly locate the issue. There are a variety of issues that can cause vertigo or dizziness. It is important to find the root cause. Oh you poor thing! \ud83d\ude29\u2764\ufe0f I hope that you can get this under control and get back to normal ! You are NOT alone! I have had this for over a year! No relief! It did not start from covid though. I had randomly woke up with it. I was bed ridden the first two weeks then I had to learn how to walk again basically. Mine switches around. Sometimes back and fourth like a ride. Sometimes room spinning, and sometimes front to back. i am VERY off balance!! I really suggest vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy! It had brought me a long long way. You could also youtube some exercises! Covid and the covid vaccines appear to cause recurring vertigo in a lot of people. I have had two episodes spaced out 3 months apart. The first episode I completely recovered after 7 days...on the second one it is been almost a month and I still have the 'off' feeling and headaches. Sucks.\n\nTry adding vitamin D and magnesium to your diet, drink a ton of water. I would probably lay off the drugs because those can inhibit your recovery as your brain recalibrates. I am so glad to hear that you have recovered. I woke up with this nearly 3 months ago and I am the same sometimes lightheaded and swaying like inside my head feeling and room spinning when I move to my left. I feel normal most days in the daytime but it starts if I turn my head or lie down. Going to the toilet in the night is still annoying.\n\nDid the vestibular therapy get rid of your spinning too? Or did you just keep doing epleys? \n\nAny help appreciated, this is horrible! Yes! There are different ratios (I think?) for sublingual drops, but that is how it is absorbed the fastest into your body. Hope you feel better soon! The epleys did absolutely nothing for me! I am still not recovered! I can just get around and move now where before I was nearly bed ridden.. vestibular Rehabilitation really brought me a long long way!!! Yes! I really think you should give it a try!! You should actually look into PPPD ! I have issies as well in the night going to the bathroom because I am so off balance! Try putting a night light in the bathroom or the hall way on your way there! This actually helped me a lot! I am so sorry, I misread. Have you got PPPV? I am not sure, mine feels like the crystals are still out of place. Most of the time I do fortunately feel alright. But still get the pressure in the back of my head and some swaying sometimes. The epleys allowed me to return to work as I was bed bound pretty much before them.\n\nThink I might see a vertigo specialist, as this is so frustrating and frightening at times.\n\nI hope you continue to improve and find relief xx Yes I was diagnosed so manny times but the current one is PPPD! Have you tried to see a Neurologist? That should be of some sort of help! Happy you are getting some type of relief with the epely !! I have heard of people going to Acupuncture to help with there dizziness! I tried this and so far it only really makes it worse! Would be worth a try maybe though! wanted to update everyone! I had my first vestibular therapy session this morning. I will be going once a week every thursday. I got a ton of homework and some help on what to eat what not to eat. \n\nthe main thing I gathered from my first evaluation is the thought of when I am having an episode, to sit down, recognize the \u201cpoints of pressure\u201d (my feet touching the ground, my butt on the seat, my arms holding the armrests) and to train my brain to actually stop and realize that I am NOT moving, no matter how much I think I am. i am training my brain and eyes to recalibrate to KNOW I am sitting still. \n\ni am hopeful for the future! I am taking the vitamins you all recommended. i am eating a low sodium diet. cutting the alcohol, caffeine, and vaping (\ud83d\ude2c) and starting over fresh. I want so badly to feel normal again. i am tired of crying and having to leave wherever I am because I cannot handle being out or at a dinner with my friends. \n\nI will probably be updating on this thread regularly as a little \u201ccheck in\u201d for myself to keep track as well. \n\nthank you so much for everyone is help. you have no idea how much it is helped. here is to a hopeful few weeks ahead of me! I completely understand how you feel. I just was diagnosed with BPPV last week after extreme anxiety and panic for a month trying to figure out what is wrong with me. Thankful for everyone under this post who have given great insight how are you feeling? what have you done to help out your symptoms? giving you hugs!!! it is comforting to know there is so many of us I did some home exercises and felt great yesterday. The first day in a month actually that I felt normal. Today, I feel a little off :/ I have increased my magnesium and vitamin D intake as well as a nasal spray my doctor prescribed for the issue that is the worst part of it all\u2026. feeling like oh shit I am actually having a good day, and then it returning or flaring up later at night. i have the same with magnesium! 500 mg magnesium, b12, b complex, ginkgo biloba, ginger (for the nausea) - I hope you get better soon!!! I will have to add the b12 and b complex. Did you ever experience a complete loss of appetite? I find it hard to eat but I am not sure if it is from bppv or the anxiety in general of it all. Thank you &lt;3 I have experienced this complete loss of appetite, where I do not really feel hungry until around afternoon/dinnertime. My gut feeling is that the anxiety has something to do with it", "First experience with BPPV - having a hard time concentrating/focusing Last week while on a business trip I was diagnosed with BPPV. I am still feeling off-center and a bit dizzy but I am most frustrated about the fact that I do not read the same. I am an editor and it is like my eyes are having a hard time focusing. I can see the words but it is not the same. It is kind of like the brain fog someone mentioned before.\n\nAnyone else experienced this? I am getting really worried. I have an appt. with an ENT in a week but that seems so long to wait and now it is beginning to feel like this will never end. :,( Oh man :( I work at a doctor's office and look up and down often to fill out forms and such. I suffered with BPPV for over a year and it was absolutely miserable. I finally decided to actually look it up while I wait for an appointment with an ENT. While doing research I found some maneuvers and tried a few, none really helped until I found ( I did it one Saturday and at first I felt dizzy for a few hours and did not think that it worked but the next day I woke up without dizziness, and I am happy to say that I have had none since!!! I really do not mean to sound like an infomercial even though I realize that I do. \n\nDo you know what side it is on? ( it will tell you how to figure out what side it is on. I am not in any way suggesting you do this instead of seeing a doctor, but maybe something to try in the meantime so you do not go crazy. Good luck, I really hope it helps.", "Hungover feeling? Do you have a residual hungover feeling as it comes down after the epley? In a short answer, yes.\n\nI found it slowly disappears though. Yep, but my as my body has adapted to having BPPV and instead of getting full dizzy, I get the same hungover feeling. That Is normally how it feels for me like a slightly drunk feeling that comes in waves. But this morning it hit me hard where I was almost throwing up. Normally when I do the epley it nearly immediately goes away but today it did not it was better but not great. It is been a few hours now and it seems to have tapered off to just a foggy feeling.", "Vertigo on one side Anyone here experienced vertigo on one side \ud83d\ude4a? Its constant when i am upright and feels like i am on a boat but it is just the left side\nIts driving me crazy! Went to the doctor who said it was anxiety but i dont really agree\u2026. This is impacting my life so much and i am basically just lying in bed because of this. They did MRI of my brain and everything was normal. Any ideas?", "Does this sound like BPPV Every few months or so I will get this extreme rotation like the whole room is spinning but for only a second or so.  Then it stops and will not come back.\n\nCould this be BPPV?  From what I have been seeing BPPV is usually more extreme and lasts longer and shorter intervals.

Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Can you recreate the vertigo with a dix hallpike maneuver? Do you get nystagmus with your eyes? If not then it is probably something else. Could be, but you should see an ENT or vestibular therapist (PT) to be sure.\n\nYou could have some symptoms without others; not everybody is the same with how it comes on and not everybody has exactly the same vertigo\u2014 for instance, some get sick, some do not\u2026 some have more frequent spinning, some do not. \n\nLooking back, I would have constant nausea for a week at a time (not possible for me to be pregnant, so that was ruled out fast) and little dizzy spells going back to 2019. Then started headaches that followed nausea around 2020. Then the vertigo spell hit earlier this year; leading up to it I had eye dragging (nystagmus), felt like I was being pulled to one side while walking and general imbalance, horrific headache\u2014 but nausea came before all of these. I think my body was already dealing with the ear crystals for a long time before I just made a movement one day that sealed the deal and made the room spin and kicked off the worst experience. \ud83d\ude16\n\nSo anyway- maybe\u2026? You need to be examined though, so your medical history can be taken and any testing (Dix-Hallpike) can be checked. \n\nGood luck. For sure needs to be examined. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "BPPV or residual dizziness? I had BPPV for 1.5 years until I finally got it fixed after doing the epley 3 times with a PT. I have been having residual dizziness, which I know is a common side effect. \n\nHowever lately in bed I have been feeling either stronger dizziness or mild BPPV. I cannot really tell. The thing is, some days it is worse and some days it is better. Just earlier in the week it woke me up in the middle of my sleep, but last night I barely felt anything. There is still a little dizziness during the day though. \n\nIs BPPV something that should be consistently the same or could some days have more spinning while other days have almost none? Hm I would definitely go somewhere like a balance center or something and get further testing....BPPV usually does not stay consistent forever but I do not know for sure as I have only experienced it once but it did last about 2 months.\n\nAfter I had the Epley a few times, the vertigo went away but I still had a resident dizziness for like 6 weeks. Now I am fine, just certain positions make me kind of dizzy. (Bending down to dry my hair or laying flat on my back to fast.) I have not slept on my sides to find out if it makes me dizzy out of fear of the BPPV coming back lol but when I lay on them casually it does not happen.", "Shit day. Hey guys any suggestions for dealing with bppv? Im at home laying in a bed and can only get up for under 5 minutes to do stuff and always end the 5 minutes with vertigo and feeling like im going to toss my cookies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see a PT tomorrow but I need to know how to survive today :( I am sorry love, have you tried taking some OTC Meclizine? Brands like Bonine or Dramamine. Both brands usually sell a non-drowsy version since the regular can make some people drowsy. I had better luck with Bonine. It helped a lot with the nausea that vertigo causes and sometimes helps the dizziness a little. *ask your doctor if it is okay to take if you are on other medications* I always note this just because I had an awful experience with medication side effects/interaction (not with meclizine or bppv related) and want to make sure others are safe about it to. \u263a\ufe0f\n\nAside from that, get lots of rest. Sleep is good for the body and that is really all I could do when I had bppv. Mb watch some Netflix. \n\nGood luck with PT tomorrow and hopefully they get that otolith placed and you will feel better soon. Remember to sleep a little elevated/semi-recumbent the first night or two to make sure the otolith does not fall back out. \n\nEdit: more post procedure instructions in this link (middle of page) \ud83d\ude0a\n go see an ent (ear nose and throat) dr asap. he/she will be able to perform maneuvers that will diagnose and remedy your situation. im not sure what a physical therapist will do if he/she does not know the epley maneuver.\n\ni had bppv back in march. once i saw an ent my bppv was resolved. The physical therapist is going to perform the maneuvers also. They specialize in vertigo. im so ready to see them. I can barely do anything im soooo dizzy :( Yes thank you- I am on other medications because I have undiagnosed leg weakness that suddenly hit me one day back in July- was happy to hear my vertigo is BPPV and not related to the leg weakness I have. My doctor put me on meclizine and im about to call Walgreens and see if I can take it more than once a day. IM so DIZZY. I seriously thought not being able to walk was the worst thing that could have happened to me at age 27 and honestly this BPPV kicks its ass- I cant even exist without wanting to toss my cookies.\n\nThank you fortunately its the same physical therapy office I go to for my legs so they already know me lol. Just scared to drive there but I think as long as I dont reach down ill be fine.\n\noh wow thanks for that advice I never heard of not moving the head afterwards. ok as long as the therapist knows how to do the epley you will be good to go.\n\nyea, the dizziness is not fun. on a positive note i was told bppv is not considered serious. youll be ok. Definitely be careful love. Do you have someone that can drive you?\n\nThe maneuvers are pretty intense bc they have to induce the vertigo to replace the crystal. However, I did feel better (vertigo/dizziness) after but man was I nauseous. Felt like my stomach was in knots from all the spinning. There was no way I could drive lol \n\nI am sorry about your legs. I think I spoke with you last week on another post. That sounds scary. I hope you get all your health issues figured out and on your way to recovery soon. I have someone that can pick me up if needed. I did not realize that after it would be more intense thanks for the heads up. \n\nHow long did it take you to feel better after if you do not mind me asking? \n\nYeah the legs suck- I post all the time hoping that someone would have had my situation \ud83e\udd23. Never know. I am seeing multiple doctors but they have not been able to figure it out . But still would take not being able to walk any day over bppv!! Yeah I heard that is also! But man it feels serious \ud83d\ude02 fudge I cannot move \ud83e\udd23 Many do not realize that you WILL feel pretty yucky during the maneuvers, as they provoke the vertigo.  Not to cause you anxiety about going! I often took zofran (anti nausea med) before my appointment. I went weekly for over two months, and my therapist would perform the Epley twice during each session.  I had a stubborn case. My anxiety started to build each week as I went to my appointment.  And the rest of the day, I would feel pretty much like crap. But I continued to go to work and do my hobbies (still feeling like crap). Hope you find relief quickly!  My therapist also told me that 'not moving your head' after the Epley is 'old news' and no longer what the latest studies show.  BUT - I still was careful. Because I was desperate to do anything that would help. Unfortunately, my lack of moving my head for that long, resulted in a secondary dizziness called gaze instability.  Report back to us, as to how your treatment goes, and what you learned.  Some people are cured after one session and feel great. Others - it lingers and takes a lot of therapy to fix.  My therapist was a godsend. She specializes in Vertigo/dizziness. Honestly it took me about 2 months in total. To feel 100% back to normal after treatment. However, I had bppv for like a whole month straight bc I waited a month to go get the Maneuvers done bc I was hoping it would go away on its own (27f) bc I was young. Nope. Lol I immediately felt some relief after the maneuvers. I no longer got the intense spins after (I followed post procedure instructions) and just had a residual lightheaded dizziness for a few weeks. I continued pt for vestibular rehabilitation exercises to get rid of that but it slowly went away on its own after a few weeks. Since u have not waited as long as me, I do not think you will experience the residual dizziness that long. Hopefully after a couple weeks you will be fine. I was okay once I got rid of the vertigos intense spinning. The meclizine helped the most after treatment for me.\n\nI have hEDS and have issues with my hips and ankles but it is more of a joint problem. It is not related to the BPPV I had last year. Awe I am the same age! I am 27F also! And I got issues with my legs so I understand your frustration and also disbelief because of our age. I am like how can this happen I am a healthy 27 year old who loves walking and being outside lol. \n\nOkay I hope it goes away! I was actually feeling better 2 days ago and went for a walk and ever since then the vertigo has been 70% WORSE. I should have never gone for that walk but oh well. \n\nHope I can take miclazine twice a day ! My doctor said I could but the bottle says once per day so I am super sketch lol Yes my therapist also specializes in vertigo! \nI guess Im lucky/unlucky at the same time because I am on disability leave (unpaid) from work due to undiagnosed leg weakness that just hit me one day so I do not have to worry about going to work. so at least I can just be miserable in bed.\n\nyes I will let you all know and hope it just goes away because I need to get XRAYS done this week for my leg weakness issue! I think a lot of people take the word benign literally and do not realise just how debilitating your life becomes. \n\nHang in there. You are on the road to recovery. Yes it is extremely debilitating! Hopefully as terrible as it is as short lived. Tomorrow I hope they snap my ear crystals back into place PT will give you exercises to provoke it- it will suck but it will eventually get better! Meclizine can definitely help. I did the Brandt-Daroff like my PT recommended after a episode I some how stopped. And boy did it bring on the symptoms. Could not walk without falling for a couple hours- but w meclizine and waiting it out I felt better 3 or so hours after. I am still going through residual symptoms and trying to figure out if mine is more vestibular migraine related. I am on month 3.5, good luck\u2665\ufe0f", "Computer usage residual dizziness Hello all, \n\nHad residual dizziness for a little over two months now. It is really only when I force myself to lay on my back or sides to readjust to the position. I am a loan officer who stares at screen majority of day (and I like video games as well in my free time but those do not bother me as much). I have noticed on days I work the residual dizziness seems worse than on my days off. Does the computer screen prolong recovery? I would imagine scrolling makes your eyes move fast and your brain probably does not like that too much? No idea. Even so I will not let it bother me too much I was just curious! Same. I am a clinician who is on telehealth 8 hours a day and notice a significant increase in dizziness and unease on those days. Less on the off days. My last vertigo attack was 4/10. Have not been able to kick any of the residual stuff. My PT believes it is due to visual more than positional at this point. They have me trying habituation exercises. Yeah I had it twice in two weeks at the very end of February and have not kicked it yet. I had started taking Amitriptyline for something and I believe that caused it because apparently it is pretty ototoxic as a medication. It was right around the 30 day mark with the amitrip. Super agitating but there is worse things to have wrong i got bppv on the 19th of march and still going through residuals...from my experience I think sitting up and staring at anything (even the wall) for a certain period of time makes my balance feel off and my eyes to become out of focus. Is Amitriptyline an SSRI? I see it is an anti depressant. \n\nI am on SSRIs and regularly suffer from BPPV ( literally an episode every month).\n\nCurious if there could be a connection. It is a tricyclic antidepressant. Known to cause tinnitus (also treats tinnitus so idk about that one) and can be ototoxic.\n\nIt is super weird to feel like the \u201cwhoosh\u201d affect in your head when you lay flat but I know it is not BPPV. It feels like weird pressure and slight dizziness but no spinning. I keep forcing myself to lay like that lol. It seems to be getting better. At first walking on unsteady surfaces made me feel all wonky so progress is good! I had this--light and motion sensitivity--happen to me with my TV, mobile phone, and computer after I resolved my BPPV.\n\nWith my TV, I just needed to make sure the room light was on to balance the TV brightness, watch things that were not as bright or had less motion, and/or limit my screen time.\n\nWith my phone, I am nearsighted, and I go on Reddit for a while in the dark just before I fall asleep, so I just needed to go to sleep once the light and motion started to become too much for me.\n\nWith my computer, Iimiting screen time was hard with work. I found that turning on the blue-light filter (i.e., \"night mode\") really helped!\n\nBest of luck to you. Interesting,\n\nThank you for your reply.", "Residual dizziness Does the half summersalt work for the residual dizziness or just vertigo I heard minor residual dizziness can go away on it is one sometimes, but also curious To the best of my knowledge, the Half Somersault only works for vertigo. There are a bunch of vestibular exercises that will help the residual dizziness go away. Or perhaps I should say, should help the residual dizziness subside quicker. If you google vestibular exercises, you will find a bunch of them.  Mostly it is about repeated head/eye motions to challenge the dizziness to help your system adapt to being balanced again.  Some folks only have residual dizziness for a few days. Others have it linger for months.  I hope yours goes away quickly!  For me - a year later my residual dizziness is MUCH better. But I still have a stubborn dizziness when I tip my head side to side.  Nothing I do seems to get rid of it. It is mild - so I am not too worried though! Initially the residual was NASTY. When you had residual dizziness, did you get small headaches and neck pain? Not that I recall. Same as me ... the exercises have helped and I still do them every so often (when the lightheaded or dizziness feels bad) but ultimately if I move my head fast, tilt my head, etc... that residual is still there albeit nowhere near as distressing when BPPV was active. \n\nKind of just accepted it, curse it when it happens and just get on with life. Yes for me ... \n\nTension headaches have been a problem for me that I believe have come from my neck. \n\nWhat helped me was seeing a Physio that worked on the muscles that join my head to my neck AND getting a new pillow. \n\nI moved to a latex pillow and now sleep only on my back. Made a huge difference to my neck and head pain.\n\nI also feel that when my neck and head hurt, that residual dizziness flares up.", "When did your BPPV come back? I had an episode of BPPV in June and had some residual dizziness after successful treatment by a vestibular therapist. \n\nI have been progressing nicely since then but yesterday i felt \u201cspinny\u201d again when I lie on the bad side or down. It is not as bad as before but it is definitely a regression from how I was feeling. It is been 3 months since my first episode . \n\nI have read that BPPV often comes back, even though my therapist said I may never experience another episode.\n\nFor those who have had more than one episode , how soon did it come back?  Was recovery a straight line or do you get worse sometimes? Had my first episode July 2016 (a few months after my second was born), the next was in January, and then nothing until three months ago after a very long, stressful day of international travel. I was never diagnosed but I definitely had all the symptoms many years ago (maybe 10 - I honestly cannot remember). I would get spinny when laying down, and I remember one when I was on a step ladder changing a bulb and looked up at the bulb. It just went away by itself after a while, but it is started to come back now after all those years. Not as bad at the moment and does not happen as often, but can get a bit dizzy when lying down, and I just generally feel bit off balance sometimes. I have had it 4 times over the past 15 years, twice it started while I was doing yoga, twice it just came on out of the blue. My BPPV came back when I was bedridden with a severe back injury.  All of the turning in bed while laying flat messed me up.  I had BPPV for months until I recently went to a PT and performed the bbq roll for the horizontal tube.  I was trying the wrong home maneuvers for where my crystals were dislodged. I am so afraid of it happening while travelling. How did you handle if? You have never gone to physio to treat it? I used to love yoga as well, and now I am afraid of any activity that even remotely moves my head. Did you go back to physio each time ? My therapist warned that sometimes doing the maneuvers at home can actually spread the debris to multiple canals. My bppv was also in the horizontal canal and it was incredibly intense- felt like I was on a rollercoaster. I am sorry you experienced that; to have an injury then have to deal with this. I saw an ENT and PT the first time, the second bout I was able to get rid of on my own with the Epley. The other two times I was treated at a dizzy and balance center. This last time was the worst and the crystal moved into a different canal and it was really stubborn when it came to moving it back. Thankfully it happened before everything got shut down because of Covid!\n\nEdit to add I have avoided yoga since this last bout and any exercise that involves laying flat and getting up (sit-ups and such) or things with fast head movements. It sucks because I really like yoga. I have been using a kettlebell lately like it quite a bit. Honestly no attack has ever been as bad as the first one.  The first was a horrible emergency, constant vomiting, second was a bit of vomiting but mostly laying low, the third time I felt dizzy and nauseous but could do daily activities more or less as usual. No. Just realised one day that it was not happening, and I do not know at what point it stopped. I seem to have gotten away with a mild case having read other people's experiences. Maybe if I would had treatment it would not be back. Maybe it is not BPPV, but if you asked me to describe my symptoms I would basically quote the wiki page at you. I think my 2nd episode was a year later (I had basically forgotten about it). Then in the past 2 years, I have had 3 more episodes (so within months apart). The first 3 episodes - I did not know much about BPPV, and they went away on their own. This last episode started in December and took until February to resolve. I saw an ENT and neurologist and THEN a vestibular therapist. She was the one that really helped me. And for 2 months I went weekly to therapy with her for continual testing and maneuvers. It was a stubborn case and I was SO sick. I am still dealing with residual dizziness. And it is been a bumpy road.\n\nEven when the BPPV was resolved, I still felt miserable. I made my therapist test all ear canals again and again. Since I had BPPV for so long, it was taking my body longer to recover and rebalance itself. I am a very active person - and actually remained very active during BPPV. So my balance system had adapted to being 'off balance.'\n\nAnxiety is a big thing with this last episode. I felt it would never go away. So keeping the anxiety at bay is another factor. Not that anxiety can directly effect the physical crystal in a person's ear - but it just makes other symptoms worse.\n\nI still have days that I feel somewhat yucky. I have even done the first step to the Epley (Dix Hallpike) just to test and make sure the BPPV has not returned.\n\nMy therapist gave me a ton of exercises to do while recovering and many of them I still do. Some are actually just things I do, as I do my hobbies and sports. She said it may take a while for the residual dizziness to go away. And then I am sure by the time it does - another BPPV attack will happen. Ugh.\n\nI also hope that because this time, I actually KNOW I resolved the BPPV and did everything right, that maybe it will not come back? It is a mystery. And not a fun mystery. 3 times over the past 6 or so years. Twice it was initially triggered by using too many elevators (at a job first, then an apartment). 3rd time (currently) I am not really sure what triggered it.", "hey community, so im 21 years old, and I had the exact same symptoms back when I was 16. Craziest thing though it literally went away in a week or two because I started going back to normal activities (gaming) constantly and never got vertigo again. Fast forward to 2 weeks ago I get vertigo again, this time since im older have a job and drive everywhere, when I got my FIRST vertigo spell i was driving and IMMEDIATELY had to pull over, i started sweating my heart was racing, I was in fear i called my girlfriend for help because i parked down the street and it was her birthday party (best timing) but I decided to try to enjoy the party ended up getting vertigo episodes 5 times that night. :) anyways I have seen my primary doctor , she said it is probably Bppv so we put in an order for a ENT, and MRI authorization. So I went to a pt who preformed the maneuver and the test and absolutely NOTHING triggered my vertigo, went to an eye doctor and she said my eyes are healthy 20/20. So a week ago I went to the er because my ear was red and i was in pain, they ended up saying it was a middle ear infection and prescribed me antibiotics, however i finished the 7 days on it and well i just got vertigo today. So again I am just worried that Im slowly running out of possible answers to my question. (What do i have). Anyways for me I have seen people say its mild or more severe, but when i get vertigo I literally get scared, i even moved back into my parents house. One thing I have noticed though it is that when I track cars with my eyes that is sometimes a trigger with my vertigo. Super Bright Days as well. Wanted to know if anybody is experiencing anything similar. I do not know if this is BPPV but it is scary and just causes so much anxiety. Hi! I am so sorry you are going through this! I know how exhausting and scary it can be. Bright lights are an issue with me too. Do you have issues in grocery stores or other similar places? Do you feel like movement in your peripheral vision triggers it, or does it seem to be more of actively looking at something and following it with your eyes (like, as you said, cars moving)? \u2665\ufe0f Thank you for responding it feels SO NICE TO TALK WITH SOMEONE like about this but yes my peripheral vision can also trigger it but it is so RANDOM!! like when my family take me places i can track cars and movements from my sides looking straight i can do it no problem, but some other times it is just like \u201cpoof\u201d here you go have some vertigo when i do the same things like a day or two later But also with stores I can manage but bright lights are such a bother and sometimes I can FEEL like I do not see the lights like i used to before, if that makes sense :/ Do you have untreated anxiety? Seems like when I get dizzy my anxiety goes up, which makes me more dizzy. I find if it is manged, I am not as dizzy. \nHave you done MRI yet? I get alot of anxiety when I get my vertigo, but it is like if it is triggered it continues to act up for a minute or two, but no mri yet, just picking up my authorizations for my mri and ent specialist today. That totally makes sense! And yes, it feels really nice to talk to people who get it and do not just think we are nuts. I know that the eye doctor said your vision's fine, but have you noticed any correlation with when your eyes are tired or anything? For example, I am still experimenting, but it seems like if I am working a lot (I work from home and a lot of my job involves looking at lines of data quickly) then I am more susceptible to feeling off balance when I am done working and throughout the day. Could you try something like wearing sunglasses and seeing if it decreases the feelings at all? \n\nThere is something called binocular vision dysfunction, which is basically when your vision does not line up as it should and it makes your eyes get to a point where they can sometimes just have like random little motions due to eye stress. This can lead to visual vertigo, imbalance, headaches, issues with bright lights, etc. Sometimes you can do an at-home test for it by covering one eye for a few minutes and seeing if your symptoms seem to decrease at all (then trying the other eye and seeing if that changes as well). \n\nDizziness is such a weird thing to try to diagnose, because there are so many different systems in our body that can be at fault. As you know, it is super scary! I think you will find out the cause and be able to treat it, honestly. It seems like also for some people, it just kind of disappears over time. Fingers crossed. &lt;3 I was tested with prism glasses at my eye doctor and it did not really help in all honesty, as my symptoms are not constant but recurring so I can be walking straight down a line and in an hour or 10 mins i can have trouble with my balance. If you have vertigo can you best try to explain how it feels? Im curious because i literally get scared when it happens lol Of course! So I deal with basically two things: feeling unbalanced when I walk (feels kind of like being on a boat or like being in a small earthquake), or sometimes I feel like I am going to fall forward when I am sitting down (though usually sitting is not entirely bad). Then, what I call my visual vertigo. When I get that, it feels like my peripheral vision is really spinny and like my eyes cannot focus on anything. It kind of just feels like I am reading super quickly but not actually digesting any information, if that makes any sense at all. So like I will try to focus on one thing and I cannot. That is triggered when I am in stores, particularly brightly lit ones like Giant Eagle or Bath and Body Works. It is SUPER terrifying so I really understand your fear. I love shopping and going out but it is shaken me so much that I do not go in anywhere anymore and I am actually afraid to even go into office buildings (like doctors). \n\nSome people find that chewing gum or sucking on a mint during a vertigo or dizziness attack can help. Have you tried that at all or noticed anything like that? xo So for me, when i first saw my primary doctor 2 weeks  for it she gave me Meclizine (motion sickness medication) which did not help with my vertigo and made me feel SUPER off the whole day. But to me stores is not a problem but i think the ABSOLUTE WORST place to get an episode of vertigo is driving, the amount of fear that goes through my body is insane. And it makes me feel so weak lmao because literally nothing before was as scary as this. but i have found out a trigger - looking to the left or moving my head to the left kind of quick. So I literally try and move my head super slow on my left.  As visual vertigo I LITERALLY HAVE THE SAME FEELINGS it feels like my eyes are fighting so hard to focus. When it happens I try to look around and try to focus but it lasts a good 20 seconds and it is over. So the mint or the chewing I cant really tell if it helps because like i say i feel it happens so randomly that I cant really prepare for it. How long have you been dealing with this? And have you seen anyone, any specialist and if you would not mind sharing what they say? I completely get the driving thing and like.. thankfully I have not had any issues with it yet, though I now do not want to really even attempt to drive anywhere because of it. I read online that sometimes getting \"glacier goggles\" can help with driving with it, because it like blocks your peripheral vision which can sometimes help prevent the vertigo from going, but then I feel like that might make it really hard to drive anyway? The fact that you are triggered when you look to the left makes me feel like it has to be some kind of inner ear thing, like either fluid in your ear/eustachian tube or some kind of BPPV that is in a canal that the Epley maneuver does not work as well on. \n\nMine basically started a few weeks ago. Well, for a year or two, I would sometimes feel \"off\" in a store, but mints would help me and I was fine. I really love shopping and stores and stuff so it was never like enough to make me avoid going. A few weeks back, I rolled over in bed and felt vertigo, like room spinning vertigo, which was pretty much gone by morning. But then after that I kept feeling more off balance when I walked and such. About a week after the vertigo in bed, is when I went to a grocery store and got the bad visual vertigo and had to leave. But once I was outside, I was way better. Ever since then, though, I have had my issues, cannot really walk without feeling off balance and I quit going into stores after the third try. I have an optometrist appointment next week and I am currently in the process of setting up an appointment at my local balance center to see a vestibular rehab specialist for an evaluation. I have not seen my primary doctor yet because she is honestly not the best doctor, and I would have to travel about an hour to get to a real specialist. SO hopefully this will either go away over time or the eye doctor or PT will be able to help. I will absolutely update you on how it goes! I just got off the phone trying to set up appointments with an ent specialist and for my mri. and boy does it SUCK having to go through your insurance for stuff like this especially because my insurance is not the best. But I have a ent specialist seeing me july 23rd (disappointed) but an mri tomorrow an hour away but it was the fastest I could get an mri. I was kind of wishing I would be able to see the ent quicker, but still and MRI could rule out possible issues with my brain and what not. So my question to you, since I used to game constantly and honestly my reaction time with my eyes are great, have you ever had vertigo watching tv? Or while looking on your phone. Also something I do feel sometimes when i switch from apps or like i scroll too fast it does not give me vertigo but it like tickles my brain and not in a fun way whatsoever. lmao it does not hurt its just a slight disturbance It is frustrating! I have a PPO so I can pretty much set up appointments on my own, BUT there is a severe lack of specialists in my area so I would have to travel to the nearest city and I do not feel great about dealing with the traffic when I am like this. If the optometrist and vestibular specialist cannot help me, I might end up turning to Cove or Nurx and just trying some migraine meds or something for awhile. \n\nJuly 23rd seems so far away, but it will come quickly! And in the meantime you will have the MRI to hopefully put your mind at ease and rule out some stuff. Now, for your questions! I do sometimes get vertigo..ish feelings when I watch TV or scroll on my phone too quickly. It just feels like my eyes lose track of what they are doing and I have to look away for a bit. I am a gamer and have not really tried playing anything since this started out of fear, because it sounds dumb but it would be super demoralizing if I could not even enjoy a game anymore (pretty sure Mario Kart is out for sure but yeah). But I know the feeling that you mean, it is just like I feel off or not quite right but it is not like full on vertigo or anything. Also sometimes it feels like my eyes get strained more quickly, like I will get pain when I move my eyes, so who knows. Oof PPO is great, people that have it around my area get appointments so quick, its super dope for them. But yes this MRI will hopefully rule out anything, but reason why i was also recommended for an mri from my optometrist is because i have anisocoria (one pupil bigger then my other) but i know it is not really known to cause vertigo but i am also a gamer but i used to game almost like 5 hours or 6 hours daily ! and it was games like smite or rainbow six siege with so much spinning in the game. and its so sad because I cant play right now because I get scared to trigger it and just knowing myself I would be angry and sad because I could not play anymore. Have you actually driven yet any far distances or do you get rides for the most part because I literally do not even want to touch a steering wheel lol. The scary thing is that some of my friends say \u201cits not a death sentence if they cannot find what is wrong then you most likely have to live with it\u201d and just having to live with something like this will be super difficult. And that to me is scary too. Have you gotten vertigo today?? Hey I have one pupil a little bigger, too! My right one (I think) so we will see if the optometrist mentions it or not when I go in. I will tell you what game really triggered me was watching the latest Resident Evil, like I seriously felt unwell and that was before this current vertigo/dizziness really kicked off lol. But I feel the same way, like I am afraid to do anything to trigger it too badly, I keep hoping that if I can like just do nothing for awhile then maybe it will go away. But like right now I am watching Hellraiser and I seem to be okay as long as I look away when the really crazy scenes come on. I have not driven any far distances in..weeks, unfortunately, I did drive around to find fireworks on the 4th but it was only like 5-10 mins from me. It was weird because the driving was okay, but I was standing outside the car and watching fireworks and like just standing there makes me feel so off after awhile, but then like sitting down made it feel a little better. I am too scared to really drive anywhere and I am going to try to get someone to drive me to my appointments or get an Uber or something. Thank god for grocery delivery at least because I remain well stocked with rotisserie chickens from Sam's Club so at least I can still partake of delicious chicken tacos. \n\nUgh.. like, I know that people mean well when they say \"it is not a death sentence\" but also like the idea of living like this forever is so demoralizing that sometimes I seriously worry for my own well-being. I do know that the brain is supposed to acclimate over time for a lot of this stuff. And like I know that for a lot of people, they get episodes like this for awhile and then it tapers off. To me, there are things worse than death, but I guess to other people they would rather live with chronic dizziness or vertigo than die. But ANYWAYS :P so today I have not had like the spinny vertigo but I have been feeling my off balanceness. I am trying daily Sudafed for a week to see if it makes a difference just to help rule out sinuses and eustachian tube stuff, so far it has not harmed and I do not think it is helped but sometimes it takes a few days or so I think. I was getting really anxious about it last night but I did this Yoga with Adriene video that focused on vertigo, and the breathwork really helped chill me out a bit. How are you feeling? Man, sorry I talk so much, apologies if reading this giant ass wall of text triggers vertigo at all (not even joking) lol xo NO DUDE I LOVE THIS!! it is literally the best i could talk with you for hours because literally nobody i know has any clue or idea how i feel. Dont get me wrong id never ever want any of my friends to have this but sometimes they just say to try and get used to it but I literally cannot! but weirdly enough i try and make connections like what triggers or what makes it worse but yea my left eye is my smaller pupil and literally looking to my left or moving my head to the left can trigger it. BUT then literally at random it can trigger and it is like a punch to the stomach because the mood just dies. But I have just been sitting down tbh and replying too you and I absolutely do not mind it. but if it is tiresome to talk I completely get it !! I would not want you feeling off tryna respond. But that is so uncommon that you also have a smaller pupil lmao like what are the odds!! Me too!! Seriously therapeutic to talk to someone who has such similar symptoms and really gets what I am saying. Sometimes I try to explain it to someone and they think I mean like..lightheadedness, like that almost depersonalization feeling, which I understand but to me it is different than feeling like you are going to fall over or like you are going to black out. Like the spinning is way scarier to me. But because I can get out of bed (which I am super thankful for) it seems less serious to them in a way I think. I really get the mood dying, because like on the 4th I was feeling ambitious and that is when I went out (I initially had way grander plans but canceled them because I was afraid) and I was feeling good about myself, but then I got the imbalance feeling and like I started getting nauseous from it and it just made me feel so upset. Like I got to see fireworks but not for as long as I wanted to. It sounds so stupid and trivial, like oooh so you cannot go candle shopping or go see fireworks, who cares, but like to me those are the best parts of life. Like the things I get joy from, gaming, going out, going for a walk, like I cannot do those things currently and it is just like--ugh. But honestly like I keep reading about people who get BPPV or really other types of vertigo issues, and then it is normal to feel worse when you push yourself for awhile, but it still gets better. Mainly I am just really interested in seeing what your test results are and also how my appointments go. It is really crazy how similar our symptoms are and even having the same pupil be a little different in size! It is definitely not exhausting to talk to you! \ud83e\udd70 i was glad I did not get any vertigo yesterday, i managed to pop some fireworks myself !! but yes dude thank God yk because some people do be having worse things. but i am thankful for my sight. Im christian myself and do not worry i wont like push religion and i hope It is not weird me saying this. but I saw a sermon and it said \u201cI do what I can and give to God what I cant and trust in him\u201d it helped me mentally because the honest truth, and I had to take this with a grain of salt but we literally cannot do anything about this but try specialists or medication yk. but I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE RESPONSES the paragraphs I literally just sit here go on insta and wait for reddit to notify me lmao. because like you are a real person who is going through something LIKE ME ! it feels less like im alone. because I literally had to move back in with my parents this month because when i got vertigo the first time i felt so scared to be alone. lol even reading that makes me feel weak but the truth hurts. but i love talking with you EVEN MORE THAT we have such similarities!! Its amazing and really eases my mind Hey man! How are you feeling today? Let me know how everything goes!! Do not feel bad about moving back with your parents. Honestly, if that were an option for me, I would probably do the same, because nothing makes me more anxious than feeling like I cannot even walk or drive normally, so like I truly understand! Being dizzy or having vertigo is like an attack on our core system, like it just makes us feel so off. I know that for some people, anxiety causes the symptoms, but for other people, it is the symptoms that cause the anxiety, and then it can be a vicious cycle too. As for me, I thought yesterday was overall kind of better? Like I was still off balance but I felt a little optimistic. For whatever reason, today I am wrecked again. I do not know if it is because I tried laying on my other side (right side, I always feel more anxious on that side because that is I think the side I rolled over on when I got my first vertigo a few weeks back) or if it is the weather or just me, but like I kept waking up all night feeling weird and then when I got up this morning I was like ughhhh. Like I said before, my job involves a lot of reading and kind of scanning from line to line, so I know that is not helping. But I popped a few ibuprofen and a sudafed to see if I can bring down the headache and then hopefully as the day goes on I do not get worse or maybe I even get better. ANYWAYS--let me know how you are and how it goes today! Thinking about you! xo Heyo!!! I thought me talking about God scared you away haha, but yesterday was a bad day for me I got vertigo 4 times, and it SUCKED because it was with my friends and like when it would happen they would stop talking and I felt like I would bring the mood down. But last night I got it while i was laying down on my phone, and it is so frustrating because I literally feel like I cannot fend for myself. But today I do have my mri in like 8 hours so hopefully I can find an answer. My friends are telling me that they hope they find nothing wrong with my brain or eyes yk and obviously i hope it is nothing serious like that, but again it would leave me with no answers :/. sorry to hear you are feeling an off day today I literally know how those feel. I hope the medicines you took help!! I was telling my friends about you (sorry if that is weird LMAO) but i was telling them HOW ALLEVIATING it is to finally have a person who KNOWS what im talking about. Also told them we have the same thing with our eyes !  But how are you feeling now?? Is it feeling better at all, Are you working today? Hi!! No, not at all! I kind of got distracted with trying to get stuff done around my apartment since I felt slightly more human, then this morning I woke up and was like, oh hey I forgot to reply! :D But ugh I am sorry you had such a rough day yesterday! I completely know what you mean about like feeling you are bringing the mood down, but I think that our friends and family probably just like do not really know what to say because they have not experienced it, so it seems awkward for us. Last night I thought I was doing okay, but then when I laid down I was like--errrrgh because even though I go super slowly, leaning backwards sometimes makes me feel off. Then I was dumb and tried laying on the \"bad side\" just because I thought maybe I was better, and I felt okay at first but then I was like, noooope bad idea. So today I just feel almost hungover or something, like my head hurts and I feel off balanced and just ew. I think the ibuprofen took the edge off the headache but I am like trying not to really look at much because I feel like there is a delay between what my eyes see and when my brain actually understands, it is hard to explain, kind of like a lag and it is making me feel bizarre. Fingers crossed about the MRI!! I am thinking of it like this. If the MRI does not find anything, then that is great because I feel like it would potentially be easier to deal with other issues than things that would show up on an MRI. (Just my thoughts on it) and then if the ENT does not see anything thennnn possibly it is something like PPPD where it is just taking awhile for the brain to acclimate after the initial bad dizziness. But we will see! I guess all we can do is take it one day at a time and one appointment/test at a time, even though it is annoying. It is totally okay that you flexed to your friends that you met someone who is also living like this! Hahaha :D I am working today which is not helping, but I finally made an appointment with my local balance center and I will be seeing someone on Monday. Her bio looks great, she is a PT who has like 10 years of experience with vestibular/balance disorders, so I am hoping that she will at least have an idea, or if she does not think she can help then maybe she can tell me someone else to see. I am wondering if you have a place like that nearby? Mine's a local branch of Fyzical, which is a physical therapy and balance center, but I know that a lot of PTs specialize in vestibular stuff too. We shall see! xo I hate that though its the biggest punch to the stomach, when you think \u201cmaybe im getting better\u201d andddd then you are not. i did flex because it is so different then someone just saying you will get better. Having someone who is going thru the same thing as you it is like you are not alone. So im trying to book an ent for tomorrow see if it goes through but i know my insurance does not cover it so i dont mind paying for it myself. Im sorry, you said you are not tryna look at much and im here replying fast as heck, the mri reviews were bad regarding timing and what not but I do not mind because I just need a scan lol but I am trying to get a really good ent specialist because if there are reviews that the specialist is great then I would want to go there. I was reading up on someones post and they said that the ent they went to put them in a chair and like basically turned them upside down and got severe vertigo but it is the crystals going into place or what not, I know forsure i had an inner ear infection but when I went again the doctor said it cleared up that the antibiotics did it is job. so my question is why still lmao. Yes! Exactly. Like I almost even went for a walk last night to try it out but I was like, nah give it a few more days of recovery and then try. And then waking up today feeling like this was like, I came downstairs and then was like ahhh I am never going to recoverrrr. But I mean, the odds are likely that we will. It is just so frustrating right now and terrifying, really that is what gets me, i just get so anxious and scared when I feel off balanced. I know you know exactly what I mean. I was looking at the ENTs in my town and like one of them I have dealt with and he was a grade A dick so I am avoiding him, and the other one does not have good reviews, so I am going to see what the PT says on Monday and then possibly try to book with this ENT about 45 minutes from me and get someone to drive me if necessary. It is really hard like, I wish I could just go to a doctor and they would know exactly who to have me see or take charge of my care plan, I think that is one of the hardest parts of being an adult is that we have to make all these healthcare choices and decisions ourselves and it can get overwhelming. I think I read the same post that you did about the chair! And I feel nauseous thinking about it, but I am pretty sure I would do it if a doctor looked at me and seemed genuinely confident it would resolve the issue. One thing I am wondering is like.. you said you had a rough inner ear infection, maybe you really do just have something like labyrinthitis or vestibular neuritis? ( Like basically just residual inflammation that should go away over time, or a doctor can prescribe steroids. I hate feeling so defeated. it is the worst i sit here and think wow 2 months ago I could drive anywhere do anything game for hours no issue. Now its like. ok chris you cant look around too fast, or you cannot game like before. I found this ent but some people saying its out of pocket expensive but at this point I just want to KNOW lmao because the doctor from an emergency room checked my ears and she said that now it is just a little residual liquid and bubbles that the antibiotics did its job. so this ent i hope if he find that my ear is infected or inflamed he can say oh here take these meds yk !! That Is what my fingers are crossed for. But honestly if he were to say hop on the chair I would literally do it. I would be glad to try anything. I thought it was JUST inner ear infection because okay i get random vertigo, but why when Im sitting down and like looking at my phone or when I track movement with my eyes, why the light sensitivity. so many questions that I literally feel it cannot be pbbv because a pt also did the maneuvers on me and it did not ONCE trigger any vertigo so like :) what the heck I have the same symptoms as you and my doctor diagnosed me with BPPV Do you know what triggers it for you?? Or is it random. And what have you done in regards to treatment if you dont mind sharing!! It really is random.. Sometimes when I watch something on my phone, my eyes glitch and get weird and I am a little dizzy, but most of the time it happens a random moments, I am scared to drive now because last time I had an episode while driving, I cannot remember if you mentioned it in your text, but have you ever tried the Epley\u2019s manoeuvre ? If not, you should go check it out on google it shows you how to do it at home, and I have been doing it for a couple days  and I feel better Thing is I went to a chiropractor for the epley maneuver so i could have a professional do it because when I would try and do it at home it would not trigger initial vertigo, but no vertigo at all while he tried to do the maneuver. That is interesting, I have the exact same symptoms and I was diagnosed with BPPV.. but maybe still do the Epley\u2019s manoeuvre even though It does not trigger it, it cannot hurt.. Have you had light sensitivity?? And I DID have a inner ear infection but it is cleared up according to my doctor so literally the only other thing that makes sense is BPPV which is causing my vertigo. But today I have my mri and tomorrow im seeing a ent specialist i know they check my ears as well so maybe it was not cleared as my doctor said or it is probably a weird case of bppv. im just praying to find answers because it is hard not getting answers to your questions yk. I completely get it, seriously, like I just went through some old bags of coffee I had and there was one from Trader Joe's and I was like.. genuinely depressed at the thought of never even going to a Trader Joe's again (sounds dumb but it is like a stress relief for me and something I really enjoy). I tried playing a little Animal Crossing but felt kind of nauseous so I am like, not even going to try anything more \"strenuous\" to play. I just do not get it honestly. Thankfully I can still shower and stuff without too much issue but I am starting to get really anxious about that because like if I fall or something then I am pretty much on my own and I am still young so nobody around me would probably really think to like make sure I am still alive lol. I am really hoping that the MRI went well? And also that the ENT is like, \"Yeah just take these steroids or whatever and you are good to go\" and then you will be done with the whole thing! It is probably something like that honestly. And the light sensitivity is probably related, because I think a lot of people with inner ear problems end up getting more prone to motion sickness/light sickness/headaches, you know? So hopefully it is just something simple and then it will take you like a week or two more to feel back to normal, and then you can drive all over haha. :D Tell me how the MRI went! xo OH NO!! you are alone!?!? Im so sorry for that because i can just get by and I literally have to be with someone or else i get scared!! Wow you are a different breed. Im sorry you go through it alone at least i can talk with you so not SUPER ALONE !! butttt im at my mri appointment right now. So I will lyk but I doubt THEY tell me anything because they only take the pictures. But still im actually kind of scared to be in a tube and laying down. fingers crossed i dont get vertigo Talking to you definitely helps!! And I get the fear about the MRI because.. I actually get claustrophobia. But you are going to be totally fine and it will be like 20 minutes I think. Try to think of how long your favorite song is, and then multiply that by however long it takes to get to 20 minutes. Like that is not so bad, right? One of my favorite things to do when I am anxious (like I hate being at the dentist getting work done so I do this a lot) is I will go through the alphabet and think about different things that start with each letter of the alphabet, but themed. So like, if I am using \"summer\" as a theme, I would do like.. A is for apple pie, B is for beach, C is for conch shell, etc. And then I just keep going through it until I do a bunch of themes and then the thing is over. I know it sounds really stupid, but I swear it helps me really cope sometimes! YOU HAVE GOT THIS!!!!!!!!!! Wow you handle vertigo and dizziness by yourself that is super insane too me !!! I literally had it for two days at my own place and instantly moved back. Im glad I had that opportunity but still for you to be able to WORK AND HANDLE. wow I applaud!!!! But 20 mins?!:$2$:! WOW I DIDNT KNOW but i got a app tomorrow with a GREAT ENT SPECIALIST (according to yelp) so like hopefully it is a ear infection and he gives me some steroids or clears my crystals with maneuvers. regardless every step of the way i take I will be keeping you by my side as i hope to be by your side as you also deal with this !!! Trust me when I say that I deal with it with varying success BUT honestly how my appointment with the balance specialist goes on Monday will determine how I end up, hah.. like really if I get any bad news from that then I am probably going to just lose my mind entirely and go live in the woods or something. Actually I could not even do that because walking outside alone triggers my dizziness SO :P But yeah like I just KNOW tomorrow's ENT appointment is going to go well!! And he is going to be like, \"Yeah I have seen this before and it is so obvious to me, let me do this head maneuver on you and then give it like two days and you are good\" and then suddenly you will be normal again. I am guessing you are in Pacific Time or maybe Mountain Time since it is 9:20p on the east coast here, unless you are at one of those fancy MRI places that is open like 24 hours a day. But I will be around whenever your appointment is tomorrow and also just..whenever, because I am more or less always around :D xo it is 6:30pm and no TRUST ME this is not a fancy mri place \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 but dude do not think that way!!! Because if I literally get no answer tmr then :) welp im also out of answers and well i just SERIOUSLY cannot see me trying to get used to this like in everyday living. But we BOTH!! will get out of this funk. dude tmr if this ent says anything of that matter and says \u201clet me fix that real quick\u201d I would probably cry no joke !! So you sleep way earlier then I do and wake up earlier as well! but all i do is nothing but watch sermons, overthink and talk to you , i refresh reddit just for your paragraphs BECAUSE IT HELPS SO MUCH It was the scariest thing to be in that tub yesterday! It was so loud and I was just hoping for no vertigo! But they are going to let me know in a few days if it was anything, and also today I have my ent in a few hours !  Sorry for the double reply! Again you are the only person who replies and has the same symptoms Hey!!! Sorry for the late reply, I worked until late and then kind of just like laid down and fell asleep! You are SUPER brave for doing the MRI, how long did it take? And yay you did not get vertigo! Super awaiting your ENT appointment because I am really curious as to what they will say. But I think it will go well and if the ENT says \"dunno lol\" or something then we can find you a vestibular rehab specialist or get you on what I am trying now, which is daily zyrtec and sudafed lol. I have that dumb pressure behind my left eye again and feel a little woozy but I think I overall feel a little better than yesterday so far. But I woke up later today so I think that waking up too early might affect it somehow too. I have noticed before this all started that waking up earlier would trigger my headaches more. So maybe it is related? It is just weird because I have thought about vestibular migraine but it seems like that is not..constant, and this is. Have you been getting vertigo? I am fingers crossed for the ent because yesterday my left ear was popping so much and literally most pain is from there so I do pray he puts me on some steroids or antibiotics! I am just hoping to finally get an answer. but if the man can give me the way to being back to normal imma HAVE to have his personal number because this is not the move. Im sorry to hear that you worked late!! i was over here thinking you were done talking to me ! I did wake up today with slight vertigo very mild, but the first time I have had it so early Do you feel like you have trouble if you lay down or like lay on your back? I feel a little off when I lay down but try to just ignore it, otherwise I am sort of like.. more lightheaded today but I am really sure it is because of the weird weather (we are supposed to get big thunderstorms here, I am in Pittsburgh). Oddly, my ears were hurting a bit last night and also today, so it is why i am interested in seeing if the constant sudafed help me at all. I also have a tight jaw so sometimes that causes ear pain, and it can also cause dizziness, SO basically I think that is one of the most frustrating things about all of this, it is like an exclusion game. Like depending on what the specialist says Monday, I will see what the optometrist says, and then depending on what the optometrist says, I will have to start trying to rule out migraine, etc.. I keep hoping it will just spontaneously go away. I am wondering if the ENT will have you try something like Flonase or something for a few weeks to like help reduce any inflammation. And YES if he can sort it out then tell him to make the trip out to PA and fix me too! How are you feeling now? Honestly im just sitting in bed waiting for time to pass. Im not used to this like I would rather be fixing my cars or gaming ! Butttt im not doing those things because if I get vertigo while doing something I love it will crush me ! Have you heard any constant popping noises in any of your ears, could also be \u201ccrackling\u201d noises as well?? wow PA i went to Virginia SO MANY YEARS AGO. It is so beautiful compared to where i live now California. if he cannot go I will get all the secrets and fly out and pass on the knowledge!!! I would much rather be stalking my local Bath and Body Works for Halloween stuff so.. completely understood D: I do get the popping/crackling noises, like my ears always crack but then sometimes they do not actually clear..it is hard to explain. But it is something I have kind of dealt with for awhile, even before the dizziness? So sometimes I wonder if I have had something going on for awhile and then my body was finally like \"LOL KELLY ENJOY\\~\" and just gave up :P \n\nI love Virginia! I have never been that far on the west coast, but my cousin and brother go to Cali all the time and love it. How much longer til your appointment? I am like really eager to hear what he saaaaaays! Bad and Body I just know your place always has candles ! I always be getting candles too. Sad the life I used to live a few months back is completely different to now. But it is in 4 hours ! I hope it is more then a 15 min talk, I am going to explain EVERY symptom and what not. He might get tired of me but oh well\n\nreason why i ask about the popping of the ears is because my left ear pops so many times and that COULD be because of fluid buildup- infection. literally i had the same exact symptoms 5 years ago, and I literally had it for a week and a half max and it went away and i went back to normal living. So what the heck ! Am I just inferior to my younger self lol Bath* oof lol I have like.. literally WAYYYYY too many candles to the point of where I can live in fall and winter all year if I want to :D But yeah like I have spent all year looking forward to Halloween and Christmas, so I am really bummed out at the idea of just like not being able to enjoy them this year if this does not go away. Especially because it was really bad when I tried to go to B&amp;BW last week or the week before or whatever but whateverrrrr. Are you going to take a list of symptoms and stuff with you? I always do that because otherwise I will totally forget something and then later on be like NOOO I FORGOT. Haha. But soon you will feel better and then you can get your own place again and have a million candles!\n\nHonestly, like 5-6 years ago I had bad vertigo, like could not even get out of bed vertigo. It lasted a few days and then went away, I did not go to the doctor because I could not even go down the stairs. That was, in many ways, way worse than this, yet I had LESS anxiety about it??? I think part of it was that I did have someone taking care of me at the time, but also like.. I just feel like when I was younger, I thought I was invincible and everything would just kind of get better no matter what, and now that I am a little older I am like nuuuuuh. Do you remember if you drove through a lot of hills/mountains or if the weather was really bad when your symptoms first started this time? Like maybe just some fluid got stuck behind your eardrum and it caused the infection and the infection is gone but the fluid just needs to clear up. It is common! I still pay rent at my own place ! I visit it once a week or so and just sit there and picture how life was so different! i feel so disconnected right now like life is just passing me by! and no I remember I turned off my tv and got vertigo LOL. Then I drove thinking it was nothing and remember getting it again in my car. this was the worse. i pulled over instantly and started sweating and my heart was racing, im sure it was my flight or fight response to the vertigo. I have all my symptoms written down in my notes so im kind of prepared. Just not prepared for him to say something along the lines of \u201cyou are healthy\u201d :( sad i still have like 5 candles i have not lit in my apartment TELL ME WHY WE ARE SO SIMILAR lol!! but i do sit here and think wow younger me could really kick my ass. i sit here and overthink and my younger self literally just wanted to play video games all the time. Things never change. I miss gaming so much i miss my ps4. i wanted to go to horror nights but i know if this is not cleared up im MOST DEFINITELY not going. I get fear and anxiety from this so jump scares I would probably faint Hell that is even better, your apartment is just waiting!! So as soon as you feel better you can zoom right back in. Could someone stay with you overnight, like your family or a friend or someone, like to help you get used to being there when you feel better? It might help with any residual anxiety! If he says you are healthy, then he still has to owe you some kind of idea, like he has to have something you can try, even if it is like a short dose of steroid or something. Tell him a girl on Reddit demands answers! Haha :D Yeah, like younger me did not give as much of a fuck at all, I have always had anxiety but I used to not analyze it quite as much. Like I had chronic migraines as a kid and teenager and it gave me mad anxiety and stuff but I still did not feel as hopeless as I do now. So weird. AHHH HORROR NIGHTS so jealous, my cousin goes to that and loves it! You will feel better by then, I am sure of it. I do not do well with haunts so I would basically have a panic attack and collapse even at my best but YOU will feel better AND be brave enough to go, I know this :D WE* we will feel better ! we should talk through chat I would be able to bug you more and we could keep up with eachother way more !! It is in 2 hours so I will keep you updated I will pray that in some way I can also help you and give advice from what he says!! But i too feel helpless i still get those weird jolts of brain tingles when i scroll too fast on my phone or when Im on tik tok and the camera zooms into something. but i know we got this forsure! We will feel better! \ud83e\udd70 yeah shoot me a chat or message if you want and we can go from there! Your appointment should be pretty soon?? So excited for you!", "Read about PPPD and now I am freaking out My anxiety is horrendous right now. It is been 1 week since I had vertigo, I \u2018cured\u2019 myself with the half sumersault manoeuvre but when I move my head around it feels light and floaty, especially if I nod my head and I still have terrible nausea. My doctor gave me stemetil (?) nausea tablets but they are not working so far. I am so scared I am gona have pppd and this is not going away. The only time I feel better/normal is when I am driving weirdly. Symptoms of bppv last up to 8 weeks.\n\nThe likely reason driving helps I would because you are able to focus on the horizon, allowing yourself to have a reference point to calibrate to. This is an age old notion sickness remedy.\n\nStress and anxiety make bppv worse. If you are getting motion sick, learn the epley from a qualified professional and repeat it as necessary.\n\nI had to repeat the epley maneuver daily for about a week before symptoms fully subsided. Symptoms do not last only eight weeks for everyone. That not true. I have had it for 4 months now. Still not cured", "Slight Nausea when I rotate my Head.. Hey Folks, I have been feeling slight nauseous when I rotate my head to my right. It is been going on since 2 days now and it is is not any emergency of any sort,It is still bothering me alot. Especially while Driving. I have also noticed that I feel nauseous when I scratch my left ear. I have had history of vertigo and Vomitting. Any chance this is BBPV? If yes,What are some treatments and remedies? If not,Any guess what could it be? Thanks alot. Have a great BBPV-free day. If you think it might be bppv, their are videos on youtube to test if you have it, and maneuvers to help it. Please try it with someone with you as you can become very dizzy while doing the test and maneuver.   You can get your answer if it is or is not bppv from that i have vertigo for like 10 years and never had this much specific symptoms. it is kind of strange to me that you can detect the side of nausea feeling for example. but the ear thing made me think that it can be about something in the inner ear which is the source of bppv most of the time. \n\ni want to ask, does that feeling like being in an elevator or being in a boat? if it is, it can be a kind of dizziness and it can be caused by the eyes, ear or maybe the migraine. you should check all these causes if you ask me. please write again when you recover and have a good day my friend. It is strange for sure. My vertigo usually goes away after I take a nap but this one does not. The ear thing has somewhat stopped now and I feel little less nauseous when I move my head but still feel nauseous when I move my head to say \"No\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNah I do not feel any kind of Nausea or dizziness unless I shake my head. There are no other symptoms of Migraine. I will surely write again when I recover. I am thinking about Making an appointment with my doctor. hope you get better soon, take care", "Cause of vertigo and residual effects? **Day 1:**\n\n* Episode of severe vertigo after lifting head up from looking down at phone. Progressed to nausea and profuse sweating. Kept head still and it resolved within a minute or two.\n* Felt unsteady, nauseous, anxious afterwards and subsequently vomited\n* A second episode of severe vertigo after bending over to pick up a garden hose.\n* Tremendous anxiety and intractable vomiting.\n* Administered to ER for fluids and meds to control symptoms. Discharged that night\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n* Felt a bit better with some dizziness. Did some light gardening.\n* That night, a very mild episode of vertigo. Stayed calm and it resolved within a minute after keeping head still.\n\n**Day 3:**\n\n* ENT was unable to confirm BPPV (negative Dix-Hallpike)\n* Felt a bit better with some residual dizziness and brain fog. Did some gardening for most of the day.\n\n**Day 4:**\n\n* Fourth and last episode of vertigo after turning back and forth in bed. Subsequently lead to profuse sweating and vomiting. Rested for the rest of the day.\n\n**Day 5:**\n\n* Woke up with general dizziness, brain fog, eye focusing issues\n* ENT was yet again unable to confirm BPPV (negative Dix-Hallpike)\n\n**Day 6:**\n\n* Morning dizziness that resolved quickly\n\n**Day 7:**\n\n* No morning dizziness but general brain fog and eye focusing issues\n\n**Days 8-11:**\n\n* Same as day 7 except improving every single day  (on both brain fog and vision).\n\n**Today:**\n\n* Again, even better than the day before, but still some vision issues. Particularly sensitive to different lighting (looking at computer screens, for example). Just feels off and I cannot describe it.\n\nI am wondering if anyone can offer an opinion if this sounds like something that requires a neurology consult or is likely a vestibular episode (BPPV, neuronitis, migraine, BPPV). And does feeling better each day signal that it is less likely something serious?\n\nHas anyone had these types of residual effects after vertigo episodes? I have residual effects with brain fog, focusing, and lightheadedness for several days after a BPPV episode.  Usually it lasts 3-5 days and improves daily. Thanks for your reply, it means a lot. It has definitely noticeably improved day after day, which I assume is a good sign. This really sounds like PPPV &gt;I have been trying to do everything I normally do every day. Exercise, landscaping, working, running, etc and not just slouching in bed all day. So far I assume that has helped.\n\nYou can think that if it makes you feel better but my feelings are if you would have taken it easier--not necessarily laid up in bed--but simply done small recommended things like avoid, the head movements like, bending and picking up the hose maybe you could have avoided the ER trip and shortened your week long+ ordeal. Bending over to wash your feet was just one more unnecessary thing that could have made this needlessly worse.  Well, that comment I more meant in the last week or so to try to aid vestibular compensation. I was definitely taking it easy but yeah apparently not easy enough. In general you are right, I made this worse than it needed to be. The episodes were true vertigo though triggered with head down and then back up, not just dizziness. Have you had your ears checked out? Yup, exam that took place after the first 2 episodes was perfect. Yeah I really think it is PPPD then. You can still have dizzy bouts with pppd and it can look alot like bppv. Definitely! But live and learn. I am also having focusing and visual issues after two bouts of vertigo a few weeks ago (although not as severe as yours with the vomiting). I felt pretty crappy for about two weeks but still had these lingering eye issues. I went to Dr. Google and officially scared myself so I made an appointment with a neurologist who did some vestibular testing and found some nystagmus that could be from lingering BPPV (although no more vertigo) but am seeing a specialist for balance testing on Friday to try and find out what is going on. I started rehab with a vestibular therapist today and she said sometimes when you have these \"vestibular events\" it can take awhile for your system to re-calibrate. If you are worried about your lingering symptoms it would not hurt to get checked out! Just want to add I am not a doctor! I had an issue with Vertigo in 2019.  Went to a Balance Center and had Epley Manuever done and the vertigo was gone but had still a little dizziness going on and they told me it was residual vertigo.  They gave me a few head movements to do.  I have been dealing with this constant dizziness for the past 2 years now.  I went to another balance center yesterday and they told me it was residual vertigo and that my vestibular system never recovered after the Epley Manuever.  He gave me 5 head exercises to do for a week and then I go back in a week and he will incorporate more exercises and he told me by the end of the month I should be feeling better.  This has been really hard on me and I am glad I am not the only going through this.  My doctor kept telling me it was my anxiety. Anxiety apparently can be a huge component to this. Important to reduce it to alleviate the symptoms.", "How do I know if Epley is effective? TL;DR how normal were you guys a week after your successful Epley? Were you guys able to lie down flat? Roll to the sides? And enjoy those 4D immersive rides in theme parks?\n\nIf you have the time to ready my experience below with BPPV since 2014, could you say my first Epley in 2014 was successful? Or was it not successful since I could not lie down flat, roll to the sides, and enjoy those 4D immersive rides in theme parks without feeling unstable and getting dizzy?\n\nThank you! \n\n--------\n\nSo I had my first BPPV attack in 2014. I rolled to one side and was jolted awake with the world spinning. Went to an ENT who did the Dix-Hallpike test and saw that it was my left ear that had the problem. He then did the Epley maneuver. I immediate felt better. I cannot remember if I had like vestiges of dizziness or something.\n\nBut since then, I have never tried lying down completely flat. Closest was 1 pillow flat during massages. I always slept with 2 pillows or a wedge pillow. I also have never slept on my sides ever. I sometimes get close to lying on my right side, but only when I am awake. I have never turned to my left while lying down ever. I have built the awareness to never roll to my sides when sleeping.  A handful of times I have felt suddenly steady when looking sideways too much, but no spinning attacks. I also noticed I get motion sickness easier after getting BPPV. I could not read while in a car, and felt highly unstable when watching swooping camera movements on medium to big screens. But apart from these position limits and random moments when I felt suddenly unsteady, I was \"normal.\"\n\nUntil the evening of October 2, 2020 that is. I had my first spinning vertigo attack in 6 years. It was the same spinning I experienced in 2014. I think I tilted my head a little to the left downwards. So I immediately scheduled a consultation with an ENT. A different one because I am now an expat. After my attack subsided, I continued doing things, but I kept my head and neck stiff, steady and upright. Ialso slept a little bit higher that night. When I woke up, I felt normal. So normal that I even thought of canceling my ENT appointment.\n\nI still went to the ENT, and the doctor could not elicit vertigo on me after doing the Dix-Hallpike twice. She decided to do it a third time and I felt a jolt that told me it was about to start, but everything stayed normal. She then did the test again and on that fourth try, everything went spinning. So after looking at my nystagmus, she did the Epley on my left ear. I was so nauseated at that point, and I still felt dizzy on the way home like I was not on steady ground. This persisted for  a week. \n\nDuring that week, it was so easy to trigger the start of spinning with my usually normal actions. I felt so anxious and frustrated. I was so tired of feeling dizzy and I always had to snap my head back to upright because small movements felt like they will trigger a spinning attack. I also slept much higher than before because 2 pillows still felt like I am at the start of a spinning attack. I did not feel this way after that first Epley in 2014. Then one day, around 12 days after this second Epley, I picked up something from the floor, and suffered another spinning attack. I was not quick enough to stop and correct that head position so the spinning occurred.  I visited the ENT again and Dix-Hallpike was performed again.\n\nThis time the doctor said the nystagmus was stronger on the right side, so an Epley on the right was performed. This time, it felt better after compared to the second Epley. I did not feel dizzy going back home. I thought I was back to my 2014-2020 self. But after trying to wash my hands with just the normal level of looking down at sink, I had to snap upright my head because I suddenly felt the start of a spinning attack. Worse, reclining back on my wedge pillow with a normal pillow on top of it made me feel like I was again at the start of a spinning attack.\n\nAlso, I have so many unstable or like jerking/sinking feelings everyday. The world felt so unstable. Hardest part now is sleeping. I am sleeping almost around 70 degrees up and I feel so unstable. Like I am on a boat. I will also experience sudden jerky feelings of movement. Or feel like the bed was tilting down to one side. I only felt normal standing up looking straight ahead. Before this third Epley, I could still enjoy reclining on my wedge pillow around 70 degrees upright. But now standing up and looking straight ahead is the only steady position. So I began researching for a different ENT today.\n\nI felt so frustrated that I just want to share here my experience, and verify as well how normal I should actually feel if an Epley was successful. Were you guys able to lie down flat? Roll to the sides? And enjoy those 4D immersive rides in theme parks? Because I could not do those 3 things since 2014 even after the first Epley I considered successful. But I was able to live with those. It is just this 2020 that everything is so bad with the constant attacks.\n\nThanks for reading and replying! \ud83e\udd17 Wow ... where to start. First, I am sorry to hear this is happening to you. I have had 4 attacks over 6 years and can totally understand that panic as you can feel the spin about to start... it is not fun :(\n\nHere is what I would suggest. \n\nStop fighting the spin... if it is BPPV it will last 30 or less seconds and stop. You need to experiment with it, learn it and understand what is going on. Every time you panic, you will tense up, create more stress / anxiety and the lack of sleep will impact balance even more.... sleep is key for recovery! I also found that even when the spin would stop, my body would be left in a state of rocking... like I was on a boat. ... so if that is how you are feeling, you could call that normal. It just sucks! \n\nTreatment for my last BPPV event was not fun... my PT who has been treating people for 20 years was concerned that she could make me worse as the nystagmus was violent, the spin was violent and my eyes were beating inconsistently in different directions through the test moves. \n\nThe PT could not diagnose which ear or canal so we did the Epley on my left side (far out that was not fun...) when that did not work (she was hoping for an instant fix) she did the BBQ roll on me... which brought the vertigo from head movements down from a 10 to a 7 ... so it did something more then nothing. \n\nfrom there she was concerned that everything would be unsettled and that I needed a few days of rest before any further treatment. A few days later, she did the BBQ roll on me, it was not nearly as severe as when I first seen her... but it was still frightening none the less. \n\nSleep was horrible as you described however I pushed through the spin which went from 20ish seconds down to 5 .. maybe less and I would sleep on my back slightly propped up ... but nothing like what you have described. \n\nSlowly over 4-5 weeks the vertigo from head movement has resolved but during those weeks and even now I am left with residual balance issues. \n\nI am now on a rehab program again and while it does not \u201cfix\u201d you, it certainly helps a lot. \n\nCan I go on rides? Nope\nDo I get sick easy? Yep\nDoes fast action / movement on the screen make me feel lightheaded and sick? Yep...\n\nSo although my vertigo is gone, my balance system is out of whack and now I need to train it. \n\nHang in there, your not alone... I have had 4 episodes of BPPV in the past 3 years. The first episode sent me to the ER and I was given meds (Meclizine and Zofran) and sent home and told to wait it out. No tests done. It did go away on it is own, and also the next two times, it went away on it is own.  This last time, it hit hard and I saw specialists and eventually saw a vestibular therapist. She performed MANY tests and I got a REAL diagnosis.  The key was her putting on goggles to video the nystagmus in my eyes and then she did many positional tests to determine which of the 6 inner ear canals was the 'problem' one.  It was BPPV - but she actually knew how to help me and I saw her weekly.\n\nI saw her for over two months as we tried to 'fix' my BPPV.  She would start with the Dix Hallpike (first step of the Epley). And then continue with the Epley. For ME - during the Epley, I would always get the 30ish seconds of Vertigo/nystagmus during the first move (laying back with head turned), and then again when I would sit back up (the last step).  Naturally, I would feel SUPER sick (I will not lie - I often took the Zofran to ward off the nausea when I would go see her.  She would then lay me back again to test to see if the first time worked. If I got the vertigo/nystagmus upon laying back the second time, she would continue with the entire Epley.  After that - she would send me home for a week with instructions to do vestibular exercises and just chill a bit to let things settle.  She also stated that the most current studies report that there is no need to keep upright for 24 hours to let the crystal settle. Yet - I felt most comfortable upright, so I continued doing so.\n\nThis continued for quite some time.  I did over 20 Epley.  A few weeks into it, as our frustration grew as we could not get the crystal to settle, she had me doing the Epley mid week at home. I also was doing the Half Somersault.\n\nA second part of my story, that may relate to yours as well.....I learned what positions triggered the severe violent vertigo and avoided it.  Doing this - caused a secondary condition called gaze instability from my lack of moving my head. So, I had a milder dizziness almost all the time.  I would close my eyes and get a wave of dizziness. I could not watch TV. I could not sleep.  There was just always dizziness. The interesting thing was that I was able to continue to run and work, and I continued with all activities. I just felt super nauseous and dizzy the entire time.  She encouraged me to be active and I constantly was doing all the exercises she gave me.\n\nThen one day when I went in for my appointment, still feeling like total crap, she laid me back and there were no symptoms.  I did not believe it. I made her do it again.  Still no symptoms.  I think back to the week, wondering WHEN the BPPV was fixed. Hmmm.....It was not after my previous appointment with her.  As Mid week I did the Epley and was so sick feeling from it.  I went snowmobiling and rode HARD.  Was it my mid week Epley that did it? Or somehow snowmobiling at super fast speeds, hitting bumps, turning my head, etc?  I do not know. There was no 'ah ha' moment.  I went home and had a week of feeling so nasty, but also feeling like a weight was lifted and my anxiety was going away.  Returned to see her the following week.  I made her do ALL the tests with the goggles and moves - as I was SURE I still had BPPV, because I felt so sick yet.  I still did not get the intense vertigo.\n\nFor at least 6 months following that, I still had residual dizziness.  I would often lay myself back at home to test to see if BPPV was still gone.  It was.  I feel that I had active BPPV for so long, and because I continued to be active during that time, my body readjusted to being 'off balance.'  So it was taking extra long to get things back in sync with being NORMAL.  It is now been 11 months.  Last month was a really good month.  Through that time, I only noticed slight improvements in a weeks time (not day to day).  It is a slow thing. Last week, I started having weird waves of mild dizziness again. Not sure why.  Trying to shrug it off. I think not knowing when it will hit again sucks.\n\nI have only just recently been able to sleep flat. And to turn onto my bad side.  My therapist told me to get back to doing those things right away. Well...it took a while. Waves of residual dizziness would hit and freak me out. Plus, I think there is that fear that if you roll over wrong, it is going to happen.\n\nOn a side note - I am super healthy.  Seriously, no health problems. I am not on medications. I do not drink or smoke.  I am active and I run, ride horse, ride snowmobile, run my dog in agility, trap shoot, live in the country and work outside a ton.  I am 50 years old.\n\nI think some people find immediate relief.  Others.....it takes time (perhaps a LONG time).  I feel like I am finally very close to being back to normal. A lot of my problem is the anxiety I feel when I get a wave of dizziness.  I panic, thinking it is coming back again. And then that somehow feeds this horrible monster. So, I work very hard at remaining stress free, keeping anxiety at bay, and doing the things that I love and enjoy.  Staying busy helps.  Your story feels very similar to mine. I was able to relate to many parts of it!\n\nAnd....sorry this got so long.  You can always search my previous posts to see other things I may have missed sharing in this post. /u/slash5k1 Yep! I can relate to ALL of this! Thank you for putting it into word so perfectly! A huge thing is 'not fighting the spin.'  I think once I knew to just ride it out - that helped the anxiety.  I still felt super sick though. And often, upon the last maneuver of the Epley (sitting back up), the vertigo/nystagmus hit SO hard, I would actually grab my head and hold it, as I felt I was falling all over the place (when truly I was not going anywhere).  My therapist started to learn to hold me too at that point, just to help my anxiety.", "BPPV and Noise Canceling Headphones Hey All,   \nI have a question for you guys and wonder if any of you have experienced this / I wonder if there is any correlation or not. I have been dealing with vertigo on and off for the past 2 years and am aware that there are few things that can trigger it or make me dizzy / woozy. Lately, I have noticed whenever I use my noise canceling headphones ( I have nuraphones and airpods) I get dizzy in varying degrees. Last night was the worst where I felt like I had Nystagmus and could not control my eye movements, along with my dizziness. I just wondered if anyone else who has dealt with bppv and vertigo has dealt with this as well?   \n\n\nAnyways, hope you are all staying save and upright! Does not happen for me that much with headphones  but this is a common trigger from what I have seen on this sub I got my first BPPV episode about a week after getting a pair of airpods. Definitely concerning!

A couple days ago, my world would only spin when I got up in the morning. The nausea would dissipate throughout the day, and I would feel fine by the end of the day.\n\nI tried the Epley maneuver first on the right side and later on the left side when I did the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and found out the vertigo was on my left side.\n\nThis morning, however, there was no spinning--only the sense of exaggerated motion whenever I moved. The nausea I felt from this was so severe that I vomited, which I had not done in the days before. I performed the Epley maneuver again on my left side and ended up vomiting again. The position I am in right now is the only one where everything feels normal--lying supine and not moving.\n\nHas anyone experienced the transition from spinning to exaggerated motion? How did you deal with it? My coworker had a major BPPV episode a few weeks back, and was foggy and had residual dizziness for about a week after. It slowly improved and went away. \n\nAny chance you can see a qualified and knowledgeable PT to help with diagnosis and proper exercises? I just finished a phone call with a doctor, and she confirmed that it sounded like BPPV.\n\nI did not get the answer I was looking for--that is, why it feels like the condition's worsened--but maybe it was my perspective that needed shifting. The way she talked about it gave me hope--maybe what I am experiencing _is_ an improvement?\n\nAt any rate, she also suggested I take Gravol to help manage the sensations (though, I am aware it has not worked for some; guess I will find out soon enough!).\n\nShe also gave me a note for a vestibular PT, so there is that avenue, too.\n\nAppreciate your anecdote about your friend.

But in a different way. I kept making my therapist test me again &amp; again as I was sure I still had active bppv. It is just super gross residual dizziness. And it stayed with me for months. I had a lot of vestibular exercises I did to help my body reset itself. And I worked hard to keep my anxiety away. As that seemed to make it worse too. Hang in there! If you have tested negative now for bppv.... Know that you are on the road to recovery! It just sometimes takes a while for certain people. Thanks!

Title says it all.\n\nI started symptoms with 18 and have had it almost 16 years now.\n\nIt comes and goes for me and my spinning has evolved over the years. I control bouts pretty well and do not get anxious or scared by it anymore (I am sure I was at the beginning but I do not really remember those feelings at all anymore). Mostly I just find it horribly annoying. I work full time and am able to lead my life mostly normally even during a flare.  My first \"terror inducing bc I did not know what it was\" episode was around 12 years ago. I would have been 28 at the time. \n\nOver the years, I have had quite a few actual what I would call significant episodes. Used to be maybe one or two a year, sometimes 3. About 4 years ago I learned about the epley maneuver and things changed for the better. My last big episode was perhaps the worst in terms of intensity. The maneuvsr was so intense I could not do it properly and my anxiety won the battle of forcing me to try it again during that episode. Interestingly enough, I had a migraine the day before which was also different than the ones I have had before as it was on the opposite side. I get classic migraine with aura. And the side where headache was happened to be the affected ear. I am sure it was related but my doc (who is a good doc and I trust) sort of brushed it off as coincidence. I have had a good run since then.\n\nHowever, I have other \"minor\" symptoms occasionally such as a fairly consistent off balance feeling or (and this is hard to explain) that \"beginning of a vertigo spin\" sudden off balance feeling like you are slightly moving and that any moment the big spin is going to come but it never does. This seems to happen without a head movent though but I do have a strong visual balance dependence so it could be cause by small movement around me. \n\nI have anxiety disorder as well and this causes me to have anxiety which I think makes the feeling worse. It is so hard to explain. It has happened about 3 times over the past month but other days I am perfectly fine. It is frustrating sometimes.  I responded to you in my post with some questions, some of which you answered here.  The migraine thing is super interesting to me because I had a migraine on my right side, which was my affected side.  The migraine lasted the entire 10 days.  I had the migraine when I got on the plane, and then the vertigo started that night.  I absolutely think the migraine was related somehow. There is a correlation. A large portion of people with BPPV also get migraines. This was the first time mine correlated. Look into vestibular migraine. It is what you are talking about and could be the cause this time. Sucks terribly it lasted so long for you though. I always hate them and get super anxious (migraines) but I need to be thankful since mine follow a general pattern and usually can get back to functioning after 4-6 hours. I get postdrome as well which just makes me feel weird .  Yes, I get both basilar and vestibular migraines.  The vestibular migraines are most often triggered by running outside in a straight line (I start feeling like the ground is bobbing up and down).  Overall, those have decreased greatly in the past couple of years after I did food sensitivity testing and cut out a lot of foods.   I am trying to integrate some of those foods back into my diet, but if a migraine happens, I have to go super strict with my diet again.\n\nThanks for your responses.  I feel like doctors do not have a clue about some of this stuff.  I mean, clearly, there is a correlation, but most doctors will only acknowledge the symptoms in their area of expertise. And do not look at the whole picture. There are actually a lot of docs that are really expert in these areas; however, they are usually reserved for large cities, university/research hospitals, etc. Nothing close to me like that. \n\nYeah, I have narrowed down my migraines which luckily are usually one a year (sometimes 2) which I am SO thankful for. It used to be I got them in August, ever year, one time. I think I am sensitive to barometric pressure changes as usually it happens when there is a stormy low coming through. Strong smells also trigger me sometimes as well (ironic that I work for a large Chemical company, huh? I am an IT Operations Project Analyst, so not usually around them too much). Sun glare sometimes causes it. While i am not certain I think very strong cheeses (like even sharp cheddar) cause it to, which TOTALLY sucks because I used to love that stuff. Feta, blue cheese, etc. Got To stay away now because i love it but it is not worth the risk. I think eggs might be the cause of this most recent migraine.  I have a sensitivity to then and had taken them out for a couple of years, but wanted to try them again to see if maybe I could tolerate them now.  I think I can have an egg every once in a while (and a little bit of egg in a dish seems fine) but I have to limit them.\n\nMy big food sensitivities though are milk, wheat, chicken (if you can believe it), vanilla, cinnamon, and red food dye (I have other milder ones).  If I have even a small amount of my more severe sensitive foods, I will generally start vomiting within 2-3 hours.\nYou might want to look into food sensitivity testing or maybe a food elimination diet to see if that helps any of your symptoms.   Interesting those do not sound like the usual suspects of migraine triggers..maybe more some sort of allergic reaction that the result of which causes the migraines? Not an expert there though. \n\nDid you have any other symptoms with your BPPV? Tinnitus, fullness in the ear, pain at all (besides the migraine)? Also, did the Epley relieve the symptoms? If yes, then it was for sure BPPV. The question is what caused it. I think the general thought with vestibular migraine is that blood flow changes causes the otoconia to dislodge, somehow and that makes sense in a way due to correlation.  I did not have any ear symptoms except that I could not hear out of one ear for one day after the second plane flight (that was the other ear though, not the BPPV ear).  Yes, the Epley fixed it.  I tested positive on the dix-halpike on my right ear (hearing issues were left ear, most symptoms were looking to left side\ud83e\udd14).  We did the Epley on the right side 5x the first session and then 2 more times the second session.  I stopped having vertigo after the first session, but I still felt like the world was waving and my neck and head hurt a lot after the maneuver.\n\nTo clarify, the milk, wheat, etc cause stomach issues, not migraines.  It is the eggs that I think seem to trigger mIgraines, but I am not 100%.  Running outside in the hot sun will definitely make me have a migraine.\n\nOther workouts are fine and running on the treadmill is also fine.  I do a lot of lifting and some yoga/Pilates and biking and none of those cause symptoms.", "Soft Cervical Collar? Hi friends ,\nRecently officially diagnosed (but longtime sufferer) with BPPV. My ENT plans do perform Repositioning procedure (aka Epley Maneuver). As part of the aftercare, I am told that I will need to wear a soft cervical collar for a few days and there will be limitations placed upon my movements. Just curious, has anyone else gone through this? If you had the procedure/maneuver done by a clinician, how did you manage afterward? What were you able to do, what were you unable to do and what were you able to do with the aid of a caregiver/family/friend?\nThanks! I found that after a successful repositioning with the Epley Maneuver I just felt almost like drunk? Like I never got the intense episodes but it felt like they might come back if that makes sense. I would usually sleep on my back and tuck a blanket around my neck to keep me on my back for the following two weeks but during the day I tried my best to continue normal movements and not avoid bending down because I found that prolonged my recovery. So basically day three I would do my best to go back to my everyday life and day two I would do stuff around the house and take it easy Thank you for chiming in. How are you doing nowadays? I never wore a collar, I was just told to avoid fast head movements and to sleep on my back for a couple of nights. I mostly felt okay after having a maneuver done, most of the time I was able to drive myself to the appointments on my own. Day to day stuff I was limited in doing things that required looking up and down, and having BPPV always made me feel physically tired. Pretty good actually I have my last episode in March and have not had one since, I heard taking vitamin D helps prevent BPPV but like not sure if that is true but I take it anyways, I think having a plan for the next episode is very helpful rather then trying to hope you never get another one. \ud83d\ude02 My ent did not ask me to put a cervical collar, but asked me to avoid sudden violent head movement. She told me to move like a robot even do not look up or bending down to collect any thing , I was advised to sleep elevated 45 degree for the first two night following the maneuver That is interesting. The not looking up/down, leaning/bending over sounds right. My ENT also told me I would have to sleep upright(with the collar on) w/pillows or in a recliner for a few days post repositioning. After that I am not to roll over/lie down on the impacted side for 5 nights after removing the soft collar.\nI am not disagreeable to the aftercare instructions but I have a new (10wk old) puppy that is super needy and the repositioning aftercare will definitely interfere with looking after him; not to mention myself. I am a widow, so it is just myself and the pup. I am glad to hear you have been doing well! I am so glad that I finally know what is been \u201cwrong\u201d with me. I was horrified thinking the worst. Knowing there is a remedy in sight has lessened my anxiety. Hi, thank you for chiming in!\nIn speaking to my ENT\u2019s nurse, I have been told that the soft collar is to prevent sudden movements as we tend to do our normal activities without even thinking and basically loosen the crystal(s) all over again; negating the maneuver. \nHow are you feeling now? Was the maneuver successful for you? How many times did you have it done? Hi , I needed 4 sessions .In fact I cannot tell what if am ok due to residual dizziness which I am experiencing right now , my ent told me  I will feel the same until the swelling in crystal sac gone , so prayers and time may heal Oh no, you are right, that will be really hard to follow! Unfortunately looking up or down ( head movements alone from the neck) is what brings on the vertigo- at least for me. If I do not move my head I can use a step stool to look at things above me or squatting down to see things lower. I was told to avoid sleeping on the affected side for about a week, I forgot about that. Sleeping upright instructions vary from doctor to doctor at this point, the first episode I had about 12 years ago I was told to sleep in a chair for a couple of nights. The last one I had a year ago they said that it was not necessary, although they did recommend an extra pillow to prop up with in bed for a couple of nights. \nAs far as the new puppy that is a tough one. If you are physically able to squat that is going to be really helpful in getting food dishes, putting on a leash and such. I know with rescue dog training sometimes it is recommended to keep the dog by your side for a time by keeping the dog on it is leash in the house and attach the other end of the leash to your belt loop or something. Not sure if that would be helpful but thought I would suggest it. Good luck! I typically go against the majority with the info I got from my vestibular therapist.  This was just a year ago - and she actively researched dizzy conditions and is always attending seminars with the latest info. She said the latest studies show there is no proof that keeping your head upright for a day or so helps.  So, wearing the cervical collar is really old school.  I was told that once the crystal is back where it belongs, it is stuck there. No need to do anything special. Go back to regular activities ASAP.   Now THAT being said - trust your therapist and do as they tell you.  As you hear from people in areas all around the world, you will get a lot of different opinions.  My therapist was a god send and helped me tremendously. I also had a ton of exercises I did - and managed to continue all my daily activities, sports, and hobbies (although I was a total mess and felt super sick ALL the time). How did it go?! Thank you! Had the Epley done yesterday. So far so good. Doing lots of squatting instead of leaning over. Puppy has been tethered to me since I got him. A lot easier to train that way. Hi! It went pretty good. I got a little queasy in the first position but I expected I would. You were right, collar is annoying. Lol but I am not going to complain. My puppy\u2019s usual playtime is suffering but I have been giving him more enrichment toys to entertain himself. He is also been allowed to sleep in his pop-up playpen (instead of crate) in the room with me so I doubt he is pouting. I am however going to try to sleep in my bed tonight, propped up on a ton of pillows. That chair situationship last night was brutal! \ud83d\ude29\nI am glad to have the collar though. I would have been screwed (without it. Lol", "BPPV Guide contents How come the BPPV guide focuses on the Epley and does not include other methods like the Foster?  Ive had good luck with the Foster and it is easier than the Epley. I think because the Epley has been around longer and more studies have been done on it. The Half Somersault is another good one, but not as widely studied with proven results. Every person is different and different techniques work better for some.  I am glad you found something that works for you. It is helpful to share that info, so that if others are struggling, they can see if other methods work better for them. thanks - I really think the Epley is the best technique but some others are easier to do alone.  :)", "Mildness vertigo last week. Off balance while walking. Anxiety Had mild vertigo last week when I lay down.\n\nHad a panic attack due to it.\n\nAfter that while I was walking felt out of balance.  The first time I ignored it but when I went home , I had a panic attack again as if I need to go to the hospital.  Had to take xanax.\n\nSince then went to the doctor.  He will be doing scans in 4-5 days.  Gave some anti Inflammatory medication for some hip pain as he suspects some compression there.\n\nWent for a walk today and was all over the place.

Typically BPPV happens with a change of head position. My first episode of bppv was my strongest. Movement in a car did trigger it, but it was significant with head movement. Example- laying in bed and flipping one side to another, moving your head and staring directly to your feet. Do these movements trigger a vertigo moment?\n\nIf so I use natural Dramamine which is basically just ginger root. It helps the nausea and calms me. I also do the Epley maneuvers which you can find videos for online. It is the same maneuvers Drs or physical therapists do to treat this condition, and are pretty easy to figure out and do on your own. I have dealt with BPPV on and off for 20 years. In my experience, the Epley maneuver stops the episodes. It may linger, but will fade. After that point it is figuring out your triggers. Example- I love rock hunting, but I have to be very cautious about having my head hang down for hours. Vertigo is caused by dislodging crystals in your ear, which must just be easier for some people to do. Lucky me. Also, stay hydrated. Thank you.\n\nThe vertigo seems to be gone.nas doctor has prescribed  medication. \n\nThe walking imbalance persists. Can really feel body struggling to balance while walking.  This is the biggest problem now. Wonder why it happens and how will it resolve.  From what I read it is also due to bppv. Sounds a bit like me... I have PPPD How was It resolved Still have not been fully resolved. I have PPPD, I started vestibular Rehabilitation almost immediately after waking up one morning out of nowhere, very dizzy, very off balance. I was ed ridden for two weeks. Then forced myself up. HORRIBLE symptoms. Dizzy. Nauseous. Severe brain fog, headaches, severe anxiety. I thought I was dying... Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy has brought me a VERY long way... It works ver very slowly but does make a difference. Focus on balancing expresses and eye exercises", "Is this something that can be fixed in one visit with a Vestibular Therapist? On Sunday morning I got super dizzy and kept throwing up and could not walk so I called an ambulance and spent Sunday and Monday in the ER. They discharged me and I have an appointment with a therapist tomorrow afternoon. My question is - Can this be fixed in one visit? It is really annoying and I cannot really work on my computer at all. I am hoping that I can get this under control because after three days I feel like I am losing my mind. Not necessarily, but you should feel lots better. That is encouraging to hear. Right now it really sucks. It is definitely BPPV per the doctors but looking at the directions for performing the Epley, they were not really doing it correctly to help reset things. And also there are many maneuvers. Depends on where the little crystals have been misplaced. Vestibular therapists know them all.", "Does anyone wake up with attacks? I was diagnosed when i was a teenager. 30 something now.\n\nEvery other month i will wake up with a pretty bad episode since then. \n\nFor some reason Summers are usually pretty good and i do not get as many attacks. \n\nI believe it is related to how little I move my head and if I roll into a strange position without having my head angled upwards at at least 30 degrees. That loose crystal(s) move and settle somewhere it is not supposed to in that time. Takes me a 3-4 hours to recalibrate when i wake up. Bad episodes last about one hour where i cannot get out of bed and shower without almost falling over. I only ever get them from sleeping.  The first time it happened I woke up thinking I was being dropped from a roller coaster and could not stop vomiting - ended up in the ER thinking I was having a stroke.  Then it happened again a few months later.  I still think I have a version of PTSD from those attacks because I was afraid to go to sleep for a long, long time (and still an uneasy about going to bed at night). aw sorry to hear that.\n\nmy first time my mom thought i was dehydrated and gave me an hour then threw me in the car and made me chug gatorade to get to school. After about 10min in the car i had to throw up.\n\nCannot drink blue gatorade anymore lol I am curious if you know for a fact that you have completely resolved the bppv in between attacks by testing it? If not, then your theory could be true.... That the crystal is still in your ear canal &amp; your body has adapted to it being there.... Until you move in a certain way, making it move enough to cause the vertigo.\n\nOn the flip side, if you know that the crystal has moved back around the ear canal to where it belongs.... Within a day or two, it should be good and stuck to the stuff that holds it in place... And THAT particular crystal should not fall out again. Sorry for my lack of proper terms.\n\nI know that is not addressing your question... But, I am genuinely curious.... As I am still trying to figure this all out as well.\n\nMy 4 vertigo attacks have all happened at night in bed. One right when I laid down. The other three closer to morning with rolling over. It is hard to get over the fear of nighttime knowing an attack could happen at any time. I probably get 20-30 a year at minimum. So i have probably had 500+ episodes at least in my life. \n\nIt is sadly just a condition nobody can diagnose or treat. Only therapy helps and i am way too busy trying to work and keep a job/career going to have time to go as much as i should. It would only be a serious problem with work if i had to drive. If i keep my head down and do not move it or look around too much i can walk to the train and work and by the time i get there it is 50% gone after another hour. \n\nI am only now starting to take it more seriously after i had it for 3-4 straight mornings last week. I have only had one episode which happened last September (from which I am still currently dealing with an not recovered from) and it started with me waking up from a vivid dream in which I start to flip upside down IN the dream. I woke myself up because I did not like what was happening in the dream and when I woke up the rooms started spinning and my vision was blurry. \n\nAdditionally, I do have a faint recollection of my head/neck being in kind of a weird position when I woke up, and I am wondering if that contributed to it, but I feel like I have fallen asleep in way worse positions and I have never had issues like this before in my life (I am 26 now). So sorry to hear that. My first episode had me in the ER and admitted to the hospital for 2 days. So. Much. Vomiting. Oh gosh - I cannot imagine having it happen that often.  And it is sad that there are not more conclusive studies and treatment for it.  And my brain is just trying to sort out they 'whys' of it all.  And in your case, if it happens that often.....is it the same crystal floating around?  Or is that crystal getting dissolved, or making it up and around your ear canal to get to a spot where it is safe and can get into the thick sticky 'stuff' where it stays put.  Or - is it a new crystal breaking off every time, giving you clusters of them?\n\nI totally get what you are saying. Trying to work and live life through it.  It is miserable, and you fight so hard to just get through a day. No one realizes how much you are suffering, and how exhausting it is, just to keep living.\n\nPlease keep us posted as you try to work through it.  I find this forum can really help other people to know others are perhaps dealing with the same thing - and to read what has or has not helped. Hi love, \nGosh that sounds awful. It sounds like the BPPV is not fully resolved and is constantly getting loose again. I would check out a balance center or dizzy clinic to get fully evaluated and treated. They will use goggles to identify which ear and canal is having the issues and will treat it accordingly. \nI had my first episode last September, and since being properly treated I have been normal. I just do not sleep on my sides because I think I developed a fear to do that, but I am slowly working on that. \n\nHope you feel better!! xx You can do physio daily to strengthen your vestibular system and ideally be less affected. No need to go to an appointment, at home eye movements are supposed to help. Whether they do or not I am not sure! I do them occasionally but I definitely forget to do it multiple times daily. I get my longest episodes from sleeping at the wrong head angle. The short, 30-second spells I get from sudden head movements like looking downwards or suddenly getting up after a long time of looking downwards or my cellphone or laptop. I agree - there are a lot of exercises to do at home. I had the eye movement ones, and a lot of other ones. I was to do them 3 times a day, 15 reps each. Eventually they did not bother me to do them anymore and I advanced to doing many of them while running. I forget to do them now.....but try to remember occasionally! Did they help? I do not know either. But I was desperate to do whatever I could to help fix myself.  So either the exercises helped, or it was just a matter of time. I find that I am active and busy enough that many of the exercises I just naturally do. This happened to me when i woke up from a nap today, looked up, felt dizzy and vision was distorted felt like everything was twisting. So weird, and i felt nauseous. It was scary.", "Is this BPPV? For that past week now, I have been experiencing dizziness throughout the day. It could be when I am sitting, driving, standing up after sitting, walking around. Just at random times and more than 20 times a day. When it happens it is just for 2-3 seconds at a time and it goes away. When it happens it feels like the room is spinning. \n\nI got vertigo once a year ago and it was so bad that I could not get out of bed until I took meclizine.", "Just did Epley Maneuver and fell over??? 35/F.

My right ear is the affected one.

It may get a bit worse for a second when I turn my head quickly or when I blink sometimes?

Also the skin inside my ear is dry and itchy. \n\nA bit more background; GERD, anxiety, potential dpdr (which maybe what I think is dpdr is actually just the vertigo?) \n\nI drink plenty of water and have a fairly healthy diet so I do not think it is just I am not eating enough or anything.

But not sure how soon that will be :/ I have been having similar symptoms for the last two months. I have described the feeling as light-headedness that occur for split seconds at a time throughout the day, without any definitive triggers.\n\nI have seen an ENT and had gone through what feels like the \"standard operation\" for this symptom: hearing test, Dix-hall pike, ENG,...all of which, for me, were within the normal responses. I recently got a brain MRI to check the vestibular system (which I learned is partly responsible for your balance) and it came back normal. This was a relief to know, but it still does not solve my problem. I even saw a neurologist about it, and I was directed to looking into vestibular therapy...still thinking about this one.\n\nIt is totally stressful, and my anxiety is higher than ever. I feel I have developed new symptoms as a result of my anxiety (and my mind is relentless as making connections between all my symptoms--a terrible path to go down).\n\nPerhaps you could see an ENT as well and definitely get a comprehensive labwork done. I am hoping any of this points you in the right direction. &gt;I did forget to mention I did go to the doctor and she said I had wax in my ears and it could be caused my anxiety but idk it just does not feel like it is only anxiety.\n\nWell, from what I have been told by an Audiologist... anxiety can often not be the \"cause\" of vertigo but it can amplify even a small balance problem. Yeah seems to be the way i goes. I also have GERD and anxiety tends to make it worse lol.  Are you treating the anxiety? (Therapy or meds?) I start therapy next week so, soon.  Goooood \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb anxiety is tricky!  Have you gotten any answers? I am experiencing the same feelings almost daily and it is super unsettling. Scheduled to see a doc next week and nervous that I am going to go through a bunch of testing with no resolution.  Hi sorry this took so long! \n\nI just went to see an ENT a few days ago and she said she does not think it is an inner ear problem and that it could be anxiety related :/  \nShe did give me a number for someone else to get tests done if it does not go away after awhile. \n\nI plan to get blood work done soon though and can update you again after that. \n\nHopefully everything is going well for you Thank you for responding! Oddly enough I am 99% sure mine is anxiety-related now or hormonal. I found out a few weeks ago that I am pregnant (was having symptoms before though) and since I cut down on caffeine and started trying to relax more, I have not been dizzy!

Even explaining all of those symptoms 2 doctors were sure I had BPPV and said the pressure was caused by tension headaches caused by BPPV. Hmmmm. I would probably see if that is a common thing for people that took the pirzer one. Man...did I ever. I went birdwatching for a half hour and it consisted of standing and looking straight up about 30 x for 10-15 seconds at a time.

FINALLY after 2 hours I tried again and BAM.....they cleared and my dizziness was gone. How long have you been experiencing it? Did they do any maneuvers to try and clear the crystals?

Hi, I am new to this subreddit and I wanted to add something here to see if anyone has experienced this before! Ok, so I have been having so many headache mainly on my left temporal lobe and occipital followed by some ear pain. Also, I have experienced a lot of head pressure and my left lobe feels hot and sometimes pressure in my ears and I feel like I cannot pop them. \nFurther, I have felt extremely fatigued and I when that happens and kind of light headed as I am drifting in and out of sleep and it was very alarming so I went to urgent care and was immediately told that I had vertigo. I was prescribed me Meclizine for this. \n\nJust wonder, has anyone experienced these symptoms?! Especially the fatigue and brain heat thing. \n\nThanks! Did they consider or mention an (ear) infection?\n\nI have experienced most of those, except for the sense of heat, but I feel them on both sides. Also, add a good dose of dizziness and feeling lightheaded.  \n\nIf it does not settle soon, a visit to your family physician should be something to do. \n\nIn the meantime, consider a possibility that this might be muscle (neck, shoulders and/or TMJ) related. Do you have any tension or muscle pain anywhere? And do you feel stressed or anxious, as those can create a sensation of heat in face/head? The doctor today said that I did not have an Im ear infection and that I may be congested. I noticed that I started feeling like this when I got hungry and was laying down on the couch. \n\nI finally have an appointment for this upcoming Monday!

Some things I would recommend you try and see if they help:\n\n* warm and/or cold pack (test to see which work, if any) at the back of your neck/base of your skull, front sides of the neck (SCM muscle), jaws, temples, anywhere else you feel tension\n* try massaging the above mentioned areas (as well as shoulders/upper back) to find any sore, aka pressure, points; best you start gently - I found a ton of really painful muscles all around and literally bruised myself at the beginning, because I was pressing so much\n* try gentle massage and lymphatic drainage (see ( scroll down to Video Links part that has three links)\n* be careful about not stretching too much, as it can cause more injury\n* try sleeping on the back or your right side (I am using ( and it works great to keep me off my stomach, even tho I hate it otherwise, it is not very soft)\n* work on breathing exercises and mindful meditation (tons of good guided ones out there) every day, for 20-30 minutes, 2-3 times per day if possible\n* consider if you might be missing any essential nutrients like Vitamins D (always take it with K2), B12, magnesium, calcium, potassium, etc.\n* avoid caffeine, nicotine, sugar, alcohol and any stimulants, and hydrate throughout the day\n\nI hope you feel better soon.

It is terrible feeling alone with something people around you cannot easily understand, but we are here. :) Yep, felt similar sensations, crushing ears, pressure / full feeling, foggy thoughts, forehead heat / tightness... Been this way for 6+ years with on and off good and bad days... you are definitely not alone. But I have no answers to help you.", "What happens to the crystal So if you do not get any of the manoeuvres done and your bppv is going away very gradually, what is happening to the crystal? Like where does it go if it does not go back to where it came from? Has anybody just waited it out  From my understanding it may eventually go away on its own...I believe the otolith gets absorbed eventually but that can take weeks to months. \n\n\n Yes, in vitro studies shows the basic compounds are re-absorbed and recycled. \n\nFrom that I understood from my doc, once an epley is actually successful, otoliths will not slide back in. Now of course there is the question of new ones detaching or the manoeuvre being unsuccessful", "7 Months of Debilitating Symptoms **Symptoms -** Head Pressure, Pressure behind eyes, blurry vision, faint feeling, lightheaded, feeling very spacey and woozy, increased stimulus/scenery makes it come on worse, activity makes it worse\n\n**Duration -** Symptoms came on in October all at once following upper wisdom teeth surgery.

Is it possible this is a form of Migraine? Inner Ear Problem? Vestibular Issue? Purely Anxiety? Any feedback is much appreciated as it is now been 7 months and I have been doing nothing any day to these symptoms.** I have same symptoms mentioned by you and this is my 8th month going. I was diagnosed BppV in September and had my second episode in December. From September I am facing one or another symptom mentioned by you. Today I can say that symptoms are reduced as I started to learn how to control my anxiety(playing with kids, stretching exercise and 30 min walk). One thing I noticed from my experience is we should not restrict movement. If we feel dizzy when we go to shopping mall/sceneries, we should try it again and again so that slowly we feel comfortable(just my experience). I too done many tests(MRI, CT etc) and all were okay. So I suggest go back to normal life as much as possible and stay confident that one day we will be okay without symptoms.. I dont feel any pressure per say, but i feel woozy and lightheaded, with some funky problems with my vision. Escpesially when walking, driving, watching tv ect. 6 months now. Diagnosed with bppv by 1 doctor and 1 physical therapist I totally agree with everything you said!  I had HORRIBLE residual dizziness and so much of my treatment was to challenge the dizziness (as much as you can). It helps your body readjust to being 'normal' again.  In the beginning I restricted my head movements (even though I was still active).  That caused gaze instability which is a monster of it is own.  So I was also instructed to be as active as possible. Also - keeping busy was a good distraction to help the anxiety.  I am about a year and a half since my last bad episode and finally just feeling normal again (knock on wood!). The anxiety is a huge thing to overcome.  Kudos to you for your positive attitude!!! Your symptoms are the exact same as mine. I am currently going through it 2 months now. Nothing I do is helping or relieving symptoms. Ended up in the ER was told it was dehydration (i drink nearly 2 litres of water daily) or maybe covid (even though covid test was negative). Lost my job because of covid so no health insurance at the minute. I am depending on the public health system and it is awful. Doctor gave me serc16 medication to try for 2 weeks. If that does not help I assume scans will be next. But it is a horrible fearful situation to be in. Doing the simplest things like cooking, shopping showering becomes a massive ordeal. Constantly worried I am going to collapse. I am also feeling constantly fatigue. Please keep us posted if you find a cure. I hope you get healed soon.", "Can someone tell me about surgery? Guys I am sorry for two posts. but in case the other one was rambling, i just wanted to make a general post. Can someone please advice me if it is possible to get surgery for this kind of thing. I read it is only possible if the maneuvers are not effective. Seriously, I am not willing to go through those maneuvers every month. I do not care if the surgery caused full hearing loss i would trade my hearing for it. I do not know what I\"m trying to say here but, is it possible to get surgery not because it is life threatening but because, it is just so godamn miserable to life with it? I do not really undersatnd why anyone would want to go through this regularly if you can have a surgery to fix it! Your 5 days in. I am sure it will get better as time goes by. I am onto my 3rd or 4th day I think. God damn awful thing. Just got to suck it up and keep cracking on. I have a young daughter and work full time nights (which I have not been able to get out of work). My partner also works full. So imagine trying to hold down a ft job, looking  after your child, and dealing with this shite. Hang in there brother. that is the whole thing. If i were to go through this once a month, life is no longer worth living to me like this. If there is a surgery, I have no desire to suck it up and keep cracking on. My life right now is miserable. I know how you feel but it will not stay like this. that is what people keep saying, then i keep reading posts on this sub and other places where people are like, i have had this for 10 years help me. i am not willing to go through this regualrly Maybe to better phrase it... if the surgery is not life threatening (other than, of course, any surgery has the potential because you go under anesthesia), but if the general side effects are only ones which could disrupt your life (loss of hearing for example), then to me it seems like a decision on what you are more willing to live with. me? i would trade away my hearing to get rid of this in a heartbeat. and hence why i am curious about surgery The surgery can also not work or make things worse. It is new to you now, but it will not be as dire as time goes on. I have had it for 12 years and it gets bearable IMO. Interesting. Though I am being honest I just do not know if I can deal with this. One of the most ironic things here is that my entire life I have had an anxiety-inducing fear of nausea and vomiting. Probably makes me sound crazy but, it is really the only strange fear I have. I feel like God is fucking with me for his own amusement right now and I am not sure how to handle it. actually, do you have any evidence to prove it can make things worse? (just curious). The reason I ask is because yesterday I was reading a journal paper where they discussed the surgery, and listed the amount of success cases year by year for a set number of surgeons I believe, and it was all nearly 100% cure rate across the board\n\nEDIT: The paper  My doctor said he is seen it not work and make things worse. I too have emetophobia and understand the fear of vomiting. If this thing hits me at a rate of once a month at this level of severity, it is surgery for me or nothing, i will not live my life in this condition I do not recommend suicide. Talk to an Otolaryngologist about surgery possibility. If surgery does not work then talk to a mental health expert. I know BPPV sucks and all, but it is not worth killing yourself. that is a personal opinion. i have lived a great life and i do not intend to spend a 4th remaining like this. 5 days in this shit i am worse than day 2 and cannot even move from my sofa. this has cut off entirely my work and goals i was pursuing. if i could put in to words what is the internal experience right now it would make more sense. anyway. dont mean to put it on you or anyone else. i am just trying to better gauge this situation.  i never heard of Otolaryngologists, thanks for recommending, i have somehwere to start perhaps Otolaryngologist is an Ear Nose and Throat doctor. oh ok i was not aware. unfortunately the doctor said it will take weeks to months for me to get through the referral process. it is another reason i feel completely hopeless. i cannot even work in this state. USA healthcare is a sham and sadly does not help the people, but this is not a political page, because I could go on and on. yeah just imagine i do not even have insurance in the usa and i am going through this :( i am terrified. im trying desperately to get on state coverage tomorrow so i dont bankrupt myself. the other thing i am stupidly discovering right now is that none of the ents around here who the clinics recommend seem to accept the state insurance so i do not even know what to do.", "Sudden vertigo in the middle of the night Last night I woke up in the middle of the night feeling kind of strange. After I turned and streched my neck a little I suddenly felt a terrible diziness and spinning. It all lasted less than a minute (I think). After that, maybe 30 min later, I turned to my left side and felt the same sensation again. Like whole room was spinning around very fast, even when I closed my eyes. \n\nToday I feel better but kind of scared it might happen again. Does this sound like BPPV to you? It is the first time something like this happend to me. I am 24 btw. Sounds like BPPV. Hi love, Yep. Sounds like BPPV. If it continues, go to a balance center or dizzy clinic to get evaluated. A physical therapist who specializes in vestibular rehabilitation will be able to identify which ear and canal is giving you issues and help you perform otolith repositioning maneuvers. \n\nHere is a link that gives you more info on BPPV, causes, treatment, and after treatment instructions. \n\n I agree - sounds like BPPV.  You can test it by doing the Dix Hallpike test, which is essentially the first step of the Epley maneuver.  The Epley maneuver is what is used to treat the most common form of BPPV.  If you lay back with your head turned to the left (almost to your shoulder), head extended slightly - and get that same horrible wave of vertigo with nystagmus (eye twitching), you can move into the remaining positions of the Epley maneuver to see if you can get the crystal back where it belongs.  Note - this WILL trigger the horrible vertigo again! If you have time - search posts on the Epley and Dix Hallpike.  It may make you feel worse, but if it works - it is a godsend!  I waited too long to try to correct my BPPV and it took over two months and 20 epley maneuvers to get the crystal back where it belonged. Definitely BPPV. Google \"BAlance center\" and the name of your closest metropolitan area. For example: Balance Center Chicago. These people will be specialized in vestibular disorders. Go as soon as possible. This is something easily treated. No need to live with this.", "Vertigo? Inner ear infection? Side effect to medicine (diclofenac)? Any help? I had hip arthroscopic surgery 3 and a half weeks ago. They put me on an anti-inflammatory called diclofenac. I handled post surgery and the medicine well, at least from what I thought.\n\nLast Friday, I experienced ringing in my ears, a skin crawling sensation about my scalp, and this weird vertigo motion sickness feeling. It did not last that long, so I just shrugged it off. Until Saturday. And it hit me hard. Like, I barely got off the couch, every turn of my head made me nauseas, and I almost threw up.\n\nIt last through the weekend. Couple days ago Monday, I called my surgeon. He said he expects it is a side effect of the diclofenac. He said it was important for me to be on it until Friday, but on Friday, he wanted me to quit.\n\nWell, Tuesday came and that weird motion sickness was worst than ever. Here is the thing though, when I am up and active and moving around / exercising, I feel mostly normal. It is only when I am sitting (like at work), or lying down on the couch, that it gets real bad. And when it gets real bad, I get super tired. \n\nI told my surgery it is worse now than ever, and he told me to get off of them immediately and let me know how I feel after the weekend. So I went off the pills Tuesday afternoon was my last pill. Which means I have been off of them for 2 days. He told me my symptoms should clear up by the end of the week, unless it was something different than the medicine he gave me.\n\nWell, yesterday was not too bad, but today was A LOT worst. I actually went to Urgent Care because I thought I terrified I was having a stroke or something. I was so dizzy, motion sick, nausea. \n\nThe urgent care doctor, who really had no equipment to diagnose something neurological, said that, \"On paper, you look fine. It is probably an inner ear issue, cause by your the diclofenac. I will give you some motion sickness medicine, but if it gets worse go into the actual ER where they have the equipment to test you out more.\" They want me to call them / see my primary on Monday in any case.\n\nSo I just took a pill a couple hours ago. And it is helping a little bit? I guess? It is not as bad as this morning. But I am SO tired. Like dealing with the dizzies, and the worry about the dizzies, is just wiping me out and I just want to sleep constantly.\n\nHas anyone gone through this before? Could it actually be my medicine? This was such a sudden onset, and it last like, ALL DAY, varying from \"eh, it sucks\" to \"OMG I think my brain is spinning around.\" Hi! Yes this sounds super similar to what I have been dealing with periodically for around a year now. I have not been on any medication where the dizziness is a side effect, but your symptoms sound exactly like what I have had in the past.\n\nWhen I got my first spell, I think it was brought on by some anxiety that I was having in my personal life and must have triggered the dizziness. I am not sure if you were feeling the same after your surgery or possibly had other things going on in your life, but my doctor was (and still is) convinced that my spells are brought on by stress and anxiety. \n\nWhen I went on Meclizine (motion sickness/vertigo medication) it helped with the \u201cwashing machine\u201d dizziness and numbed it down to a slow rocking as if I was constantly on a boat. It made me feel like a zombie. I would sleep nearly 18-19 hours a day to try and offset the drowsiness effect of the Meclizine. Eventually they put me on a lower dose which helped with the constant need to sleep. Most motion sickness meds cause drowsiness, so keep that in mind.\n\nMy spells start and stop randomly. If the \u201cwashing machine\u201d feeling has stopped and feels more mellow, I would suggest taking the motion sickness meds for a couple days and then see what happens when you slowly stop taking them. You might all of a sudden find that the dizziness has gone away completely. \n\nI know everyone is situation is different and I am by no means an expert but I know how scary and frustrating it is to feel like someone is thrown you on a rollercoaster for days on end and you are constantly dreading the next loop. Let me know if there is anything I can do to reduce the anxiety surrounding it! Just know it will eventually come to an end. Some thoughts for you. \n1) is it vertigo or dizziness? \n - vertigo is room spinning.\n - dizziness is a lightheaded feeling. \n2) if it is vertigo, is it brought on by rolling your head in a direction ie forward, backwards, left, roll, etc?\n4) when the vertigo strikes from the head movement, do your eyes beat / move uncontrollably? My bisoprolol has a side effect \"ear canal congestion\" and when i stopped it on my own accord i was fine, i went back on it again and am strugling a bit. No doctors realised, eben a specialist who went online checking the side effects but never realised ear canal congestion can cause BPPV. So a year on im close to seeing the correct specialist. If i use steam and nasal sprays, i end up feeling loads better. Huh. Thank you for your reply. I have never had the room spin. It is more dizziness, like my head is spinning, but the room and / or whatever I am looking at remains fine.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo 1, dizziness. 2, The doctor actually tested this, and it usually happens when I roll my head to the right and back, right and forward. 3, I do not feel anything in my eyes, it just feels like my brain is spinning around, if that makes sense.\n\nSo I guess not vertigo / BPPV, and something to do with the inner ear? Do you know who I go to see about this? Yeah, it sounds like something similar. According to someone else here, it is probably not vertigo as the room does not spin. It is just my head feels like I am constantly on a boat (or a roller coaster) without the movement.\n\nAnd yeah, besides the surgery, I had MASSIVE amounts of stress following it. Some really bad job stuff is going on, and I need to look for a new one quick. So it caused a whole lot of anxiety / stress. \n\nHere is the thing, I have had anxiety attacks my whole life. It is not new. This level of stress is nothing new. So is it possibly just anxiety / stress, tied up with my surgery, and then the medicine I have been taking, diclofenac?\n\nDo you know the half-life of nsaids like that? Sorry, I am not super familiar with nsaids and have never had any surgery to be prescribed some.\n\nSame for me with the anxiety, I have had attacks my whole life and felt like I was doing great up until I was worrying about flying home and I had a spell hit right before I got on the plane. Woke up at 2am and my head was spinning and almost took all of my friends paintings off of the wall because I could not walk straight.\n\nSorry you are going through this... I have never heard of nsaids causing this sort of side effect but then again, I am not a doctor. Do not freak out too much about the spinning or it makes it worse (trust me!) You are going to be okay! With BPPV there is no usually about it. It is very specific and can be reproduced with vertigo and eye beating. \n\nAs an example, people normally wake up to BPPV by rolling to the left or right which wakes them up instantly as you feel like the world is tumbling or rolling like a washing machine. \n\nYou can stop the feeling by holding the position which  eventually in 30 seconds or less will stop the vertigo OR you can roll back to a neutral position and it will stop much faster. \n\nIf you can then reproduce the vertigo over and over with that same head movement that brings on eye beating (nystagmus) then you have self diagnosed your self with BPPV. \n\nBPPV is treatable as it is a mechanical issues with your vestibular system and if you read previous posts you can find out more or google \u201cBPPV crystals\u201d.\n\nI have suffered with vertigo and dizziness for 6 years, it is not much fun but it is even worse when you see doctors and they pass it all off as \u201canxiety\u201d. It was not until 1.5 years ago I found a Physical Therapist (PT) that specialises in balance disorders that I started to get help. By then my BPPV episodes had resolved them selfs but I had been living with residual balance problems when I did not have to!! \n\nIn saying that, I do not think you have BPPV, so your next stop must be an ENT that specialises in balance. Surprisingly, a lot of ENTs are clueless in this space, which I learn the hard way after seeing 3 of them!!\n\nBest of luck \ud83e\udd1e Hopefully you will answer, since you have a lot of information! I went to the doctor, he did the and he said it is more than likely BPPV. He did that Dix-Hallpike maneuver a couple of times. He said he wants to send me to physical therapy.\n\nHowever, I do have an ENT / Balance specialist appointment on Monday, for a second opinion.\n\nIf they diagnose the same, what is my next steps? How long will this last? It is taken a while, but I think it is finally affecting my sleep. Hey! So my doctor said it is more than likely BPPV. But I am getting a second opinion with an ENT specializing in balancing next week, as this is a new primary care doctor and I did not trust him that much.\n\nHe said that although vertigo / BPPV often is room spinning, it can just be what we are experiencing, that washing machine dizziness.\n\nMeclizine does help. But I feel tired. Like, all day tired. \n\nYou said it will eventually come to an end. Do you know when? It is frustrating. The doctor is writing me Should I ween myself off the Meclizine to see how things feel? Will physical therapy help? So I have not been to PT just yet because I cannot quite afford it and have not had a spell long enough for me to rationalize going. \n\nI am a 100lb girl, and they had me on 25mg Meclizine that made me feel the same way you do. I could not stay awake for anything - eating, classes, work, etc. I would sleep through my family and boyfriend calling me and checking up on me. I saw a new doctor and she suggested cutting the dose in half because of my weight, so now I take 12.5mg Meclizine and it REALLY helped with the drowsiness.\n\nEveryone is experience is different and I wish that I could give you a solid timeline for when things happen, but unfortunately that is not how things work. I have never had a spell last longer than 2 weeks and would sometimes have residual dizziness for a few weeks afterwards, only when laying down or rolling over too fast. \n\nI would suggest that if you are not having the extreme dizziness anymore and now feeling the foggy headed groggy feeling that comes from the Meclizine, maybe try cutting the pill in half and slowly come off of it. My doctor told me to try that for my last spell and it helped a ton. If the extreme washing machine feeling comes back, stay on the Meclizine.\n\nKeep me updated! I am sorry the recovery is taking longer than expected, I know it is a hinderance to daily life. I was out of commission for a whole week sleeping like a sloth and missing all of my classes. Life gets better afterwards. :) Thank you! I am 230 lb guy. The doctor has me on 3 25mg pills a day. I will see about cutting one in half, maybe in the morning especially, as that seems to the be the time I feel better.\n\nI will keep you updated! Hi - The PT / ENT will do the dix-hallpike on you to determine which ear canal (it is usually only one ear) is the problem. They can only determine this by eye movement which can be severe or subtle. If it is subtle they may have to use frenzel goggles to record the movement. The movement determines which manoeuvre they will do on you to reposition the crystal(s) that need to be moved out of the canal causing the problem. \n\nSome people have instant relief, some require a number of repeat moves, some need repeat visits, some may end up with residual dizziness (like me) where you need balance rehab. \n\nEveryone is different and there is no set \u201cthis will last 2 days\u201d. For me, I have had episodes with me doing nothing that resolved in 24-48 hours. Then this last bout went on for 6 weeks... some people have posted 6 months but everyone here regardless of time line have had their BPPV resolved. \n\nKeep us posted. Coming back to a you a month later. Still bad. Did sound ever trigger you? My balance PT said he rarely gets someone saying sound triggered it, and that I might need an MRI if it does not go away.\n\nJust wondering your thoughts? Sometimes I have noticed that if I have earbuds in before I go to bed I will wake up the next day with it. I have heard a few times from others that they had gone to a loud concert and the next day felt dizzy. My doc also suggested an MRI and if it is lasting this long I would maybe consider getting one, just in case something else is wrong. Damn.. sorry this has been such an ongoing struggle :( I really feel for you. Thank you so much for your help and solidarity!\n\nMy ENT, and stuff I read online, said symptoms, on average, can last for 2 weeks to 3 months, before the nerve finally settles down. Or something. So I keep telling myself, \"It is been a little over a month. I will wait. I can wait.\"\n\nAnd then I have a day like today, a bad day (I am having less of those now, though, so I guess that is good). Especially bad with noises. And I freak out. I will call my ENT in the morning and see about a possible MRI. Maybe I should go to another doc instead? Hang in there. I think if you have been working with a specific ENT probably stay with them for the time being and if you can afford (or insurance covers) an MRI, maybe consider getting one. Hopefully it is nothing serious but better to be safe than sorry!\n\nHappy to hear that there are more \u201cbetter\u201d days than \u201cbad\u201d days.", "Influx of New Members on This Sub-Reddit Since Quarantine started? Hi guys, first post here!  Was curious if the long time members have noticed an increase of people seeking help on here since the quarantine began.  I found this subreddit when my mom experienced her first episodes in April and Just so happens that I have a friend who started to experience episodes around the same time.  Both complained of neck pain and tightness which would accompany the symptoms.  I wondered if the being stuck inside for long periods on time accompanied with bad posture of neck and back(working from home on laptop and cellphone use) for a majority of the day could be contributing.  Moms been in and out of the doctors and had nearly every lab test and scan possible and doctors still come up with nothing major, telling her to continue her head exercises.  I have helped her to correct her posture(still not perfect) along with daily stretches and heat/cold applied to back and upper neck which seems to have helped relieve the severity of her attacks.  If anyone has experienced something similar feel free to share! It sounds like you might** be misunderstanding what BPPV is.  I would not describe BPPV as an attack.   It is literally short duration vertigo when changing to specific positions.  It will happen every single time you change to these positions.  These positions are different from person to person because they are from mispositioned sensors in your inner ears.  It is weird the doctors have sent your Mom to get all these tests because BPPV is easily diagnosed.  You can literally diagnose it over the phone if you are talking to a reliable narrator.   BPPV is also treatable with the Epley maneuver and other maneuvers.  Your doctor would tell you which one is appropriate.  If you have BPPV they are supposed to work to at least some degree. Sorry I described that poorly, she had Vertigo constantly when she would change position(laying down, turning her head) but a couple time a day she would move a way and experience a more severe vertigo which I called \"attacks\", sorry for the confusion!  I just spoke to her again and she said she was originally diagnosed  with BPPV but they later attributed it some something else(still no solid diagnosis), hence the many scans and tests.  She still experiences the vertigo daily when changing positions so I just assumed the diagnosis was still standing, but thanks for the input! Not directly related but my head/neck/jaw-specializing PT said that they have been absolutely overwhelmed by people with TMJ issues since March/April. Interesting, what kind of issues are associated with TMJ? She says (no reason not to believe her, as she seems very competent to me, but I am somewhat skeptical) that TMJ/jaw and back-of-the-neck muscle issues are related, and when messed up can lead to headaches and dizziness, as well as vertigo.\n\nI am not at the goalpost yet, but I definitely get significant relief from heating pads and massage (trigger points, of which I have a ton) of the jaw/neck areas.\n\nThe (tension) headaches were getting really unbearable and I started taking Amitriptyline a few weeks ago, 10mg before bed, and it cured headaches, lets me sleep very well and most of vertigo/dizziness/PPPV-like symptoms are not gone, but are noticeably reduced. Will wait a few more before drawing conclusions, as it takes 8-12 weeks to feel the full effect. There is another user here who had issues with persistent dizziness and were helped by Lexapro (but not Ami).\n\nRegarding residual dizziness and PPPV-like issues (sensitivity to light and eye-movement triggers), I find that being hydrated and avoiding gluten helps me. Those two, and avoiding salt, sugar and/or caffeine spikes are other recommendations I have seen and try to generally follow. I can only confirm that I do have ear fullness and worsening of symptoms after I binge on gluten. I regularly avoid it, so when I do binge on French baguette or pasta, I definitely feel it around 36h later, and it lasts for good 12+ hours. Some research points to frequent gluten sensitivity among Meniere's patients ((\n\nThe tricky part with BPPV is that it can lead to rise in anxiety and development of long-term PPPV, the later of which can be remedied with PT (vestibular rehab). Add to it that most of us have additional things wrong with us like chronically bad posture and other muscular issues, which enthusiastically jump on the wagon and make everything more complicated. I got it in June. have a feeling the virus (COVID) triggered it.", "This sub needs a moderator There are too many posts in this community from people who cannot be bothered to Google what BPPV is. I come here often as a BPPV sufferer but so many of the posts are from people describing symptoms or conditions that obviously are not BPPV, looking for medical advice. It is frustrating and affects the usefulness of the sub. Anyone else agree? I agree with you. I am also shocked that it appears people do not even search through old posts and discussions to find info. Before I ever made a post, I read darn near every single post and response. I have been diagnosed and have seen multiple specialists (also worked with a vestibular therapist for over 2 months).  I feel I have a lot to offer about my situation and what I learned. But I got sick of typing the same thing over and over - when a person could have just scrolled down and read  the same answer I had typed previously.\n\nI am more than happy to offer support to those in need. BPPV is a horrible thing - and this sub has been great for ME - and I would like to return the favor to those truly suffering. I have been thanked by some as well - and that warms my heart. I agree with this, and the other comment.\n\nHowever, BPPV is a tricky thing and residual dizziness can be BPPV related. My own dizziness (and other stuff) story started with a few clear episodes of BPPV,  which can cause residual dizziness for a while (weeks?), and can have a variety of causes as well as consequences or co-related conditions (anxiety, muscle pain/tension etc.). \n\nFor me, it was a god-sent for information. There could be a pinned post with some general information for people to reference, so that might help reduce repetition. Agreed, often a quick search of older posts would be sufficient when the same type of question is asked over and over. Then again I imagine someone having vertigo for the first time is pretty miserable and just wants a quick answer, not to do a bunch of research. I am very familiar with many of your posts and have found them to be very helpful. I get what you are saying about feeling tired of typing the same info over and over. I do not want to be insensitive to people looking for help and guidance but lately I have come across a ton of posts by people who clearly cannot be bothered to look into this a little more first. The overall value of the community gets diluted. Anyway, thanks for your perspective! Great points! Fair enough. But I cannot relate. I was desperate for information after my first bout and I learned a heck of a lot about it. I guess I am being a bit selfish - but this community should ideally be about sharing info and experiences, not diagnosis. I totally get what you are saying. BPPV is scary. And even some specialists &amp; doctors provide incorrect info &amp; often do not know enough to even help a person. Two of the main things to find by Google searching are the main symptoms of the most common form of BPPV and also how to do a simple test for it (along with providing info on the Epley and/or half somersault). Again.... This is for the most common form of BPPV. There are many less common things to be tested for. Nothing can replace a dizzy specialist or vestibular therapist.\n\nFinding this forum brought me a lot of guidance &amp; reassurance. I continue to learn more &amp; look forward to hearing other's stories. I also like to try to help as many as I can. I am not disagreeing with you, I am the type of person who has to learn everything I can about things that affect me so I googled for days about BPPV and vertigo after my first bout. I am just trying to see different views. A pinned post covering the basics is a great idea! I totally get where you are coming from. Given how horrible BPPV is, I can understand why people post without searching as it can be scary and when you feel alone, looking for answers you just post. \n\nThere is loads of good information on here it just needs to be made sticky and centralised in a possible FAQ post. I just came to this sub with BPPV and I totally agree with you.  So many \"I was dizzy a few times this week and I think I have BPPV\" lol.  BPPV can easily be recognized by the timing of symptoms. I think you are confused.  You are assuming the person actually has BPPV but we are discussing people who do not have BPPV and are here in error because they have not done the simplest research needed to find out. Not assuming anything. Regardless if you have BPPV or not, if you wake up or spontaneously get vertigo or feel off balance or dizzy, it is only natural to panic, then google, then think the worse. \n\nPeople end up here not because they have heard of BPPV (I certainly had never heard of it) it is what comes up after you type your symptoms into google... or MD. \n\nIf I had not been to a range of doctors, experienced BPPV a handful of times, been to the PT, I would of probably come on here and posted \u201cis this really BPPV?\u201d In hope it was a blip that I could ignore and get on with life. \n\nBTW - during my journey, I felt alone, had no support, developed anxiety / panic and it was only recently after my last round that I thought, maybe there is a sub that I could post on to help or seek help so I did not feel alone. \n\nAnyway - I think if we had some moderators, setup some stickies, sent people to those, it would save people time re-writing a lot of detail and allow others to focus on the support part of why we are here. \n\nIt also looks like there are more people joining this sub every week. When I joined 3-4 weeks ago it was 650 users, now the sub has 715 subscribed...", "Driving and vertigo So I have had it for about a week. Treated myself with the apley manourvour  and \u201cthought\u201d that was the end of that. It seems to have come back bad again in the past couple of days.\n\nI am from the UK. Apparently, I read that your not allowed to drive if you have vertigo. I have been concerned about this as I seem to be able to drive with no problems whatsoever and therefore have not been to see a doctor because I have been concerned ill have to write to the dvla and inform them and I will not be able to drive.\n\nThe biggest issue is I have a 3 year old daughter who I look after, work a full time job as well; and not having a car would tip me over the edge. I am just about keeping on top of daily life and having to walk everywhere - I would not cope.\n\nAfter I told her I feel really bad again she turned around to me today and said: \u201cyour always Ill, get over it.\u201d Literally did not give a shit. Roll on big argument. \n\nSo yeah, do I have to inform the dvla (from England) if I have this ? I think the MAIN issue is, how would it be if you were driving down the road and you got a sudden episode of vertigo? In my case, I would have instantly crashed my car. \n\nHaving vertigo and driving go together as well as drinking and driving. Would you let someone else with BPPV drive your daughter somewhere? If the answer is no, think 10 times before getting behind the wheel until this is gone. \n\nAs I have written elsewhere, get an appointment with someone highly experienced with Vestibular Disorders. In the USA, there are \"Balance Centers\" in most metropolitan areas. I would suggest seeing if something similar exists in the UK. Wait, you are three-year-old said that? That is hilarious (if it did happen).\n\nOne of my friends said you are not supposed to drive when I told him I had vertigo. I was like \"huh?\" idk I guess it depends how bad you get it. I mean my first time for sure would have been bad to have happened whilst driving. But none of my other incidents were nearly that bad. But when it does linger for those few days, I do feel lightheaded and it is somewhat similar to being mildly hungover or having a migraine or sometimes high (just that zoned out type of feeling).\n\nHopefully someone has answers for you Thankyou. Same. Sitting in an upright position - it has never just suddenly \u201ccome on\u201d - if that was the case I would rule the driving out. \n\nMain issues are: without driving: serious expenditure on taxis. I think*** I am going to make an appointment with my Doctor. I will *probably* be referred to a specialist (like a balancing centre in the US). This will all likely take weeks. I guess I can kind of relate to old people when they do not want to give up their car. I have been driving for 20 years.\n\n Thankyou for your feedback.", "Running makes vertigo worse? Hi all!

Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Dehydration makes it worse. \n\nAlso check your posture while running. I found that walking daily, a nice, not-too-strenuous 30 min walk, helped my vertigo quite a bit.\n\nmaybe try walking until your symptoms improve?\n\nI would also definitely look into the above commentor's advice of staying hydrated and checking your posture. I drink a gallon a day so I doubt it is that. The posture could be it Bad posture during yoga will ruin my whole night Imbalance of electrolytes messes me up, even if I have drank enough water. \n\nI have had to add electrolyte pills during my workouts. Mostly because I do not like the taste of sugary sports drinks, but those would be an option. \n\nIt has made an improvement. But the biggest change is posture related. I think quite a few physical and mental factors could facilitate the loosening, detachment, and wandering of those crystals--vigorous exercise probably being one of them.\n\nBe careful. Does posture affect vertigo? Any suggestions on what I should look up to lake the changes? \n\nI will definitely look into electrolyte packets! Maybe liquid IV It is really tough to say. It seems that BPPV triggers are different for each person. FWIW, I run between 60-85 miles a week, and running does not trigger my BPPV. Done the maneuvers? Are you getting enough Vitamin D?\n\n\nQuote:\n\u201cwe can assume that the higher incidence of BPPV in winter months can be explained by the fact that shorter daytime and lower exposure to sun light may result in vitamin D deficiency and consequent bone demineralization and osteoporosis.\u201d It has not been super bad lately so I just started doing them again yesterday. I do know that the Epley maneuver does not help much I have been trying to the past few days! I am from northern Michigan so the sun has been absent recently. I need to find a sun room or pick up some vitamin d supplements BPPV can be worse during change of seasons. Hope you are feeling better soon. Too much salt intake triggers my vertigo, I remembered eating half bag of chips one day and by night I  had the worst vertigo ever. Have you tried the foster half somersault or Semont? I have not, I will try them next time! BPPV is not normally triggered by posture directly, but rather can be triggered by posture or head angle changes. \n\nFor me, I have lots of triggers: Getting out of bed too fast, going from standing to sitting too quickly (think: flopping back into a couch), sitting still with poor posture for a long period of time also seems to trigger my BPPV - but this last one is strange. Lately swimming has been a particularly terrible trigger and sent me on a week long hellish level of dizziness because I got a little too much water in my nose/ears the last time I went.\n\nIf I am dehydrated or have had too much caffeine and do these things, all is very very not well.\n\nPersonal evidence on some stuff: BPPV is normally triggered by changes, not by statically sitting still. For me the prolonged act of sitting actually indicates that I might be dealing with cervicogenic dizziness as well as BPPV. But BPPV episodes resolve cleanly with an Epley maneuver. Cervicogenic dizziness does not. So there is something about my posture while sitting, and the way I turn my head, that seems to trigger BPPV for me. But its because its treatable with and Epley maneuver that it seems to still remain BPPV. Posture work helps me across all planes of motion, however.", "BPPV Hi, guys! I am a 29F. I had my first bout of intense spinning yesterday morning while I was still lying in bed. It lasted a few seconds and I got just a little nauseous. But I stood up and felt better. I did not think about it for your couple of hours until I got to the gym. I was lying down on a bench and looked over to my left and thought I was going to black out. The nausea was minimal still. When home and almost fell over trying to take off my shoes. Then not any symptoms the whole day once those subsided. In the middle of the night last night I had that awful spinning attack when I laid of my left side. The nausea and spinning woke me up. It was awful. This morning I did the Epley maneuver I saw on YouTube and I am so much worse. The slightest head movement sends me. I am dizzy and uneasy but not spinning if that makes sense. I did vomit and felt a little better after that but still cannot move unless I want that feeling back. I also have some pressure behind my sinuses but I do not know if that is at all related. This is absolute hell. I am also living in Crete, Greece and I have been trying to google a vestibular PT but cannot find one. Is ENT the next step? I am so sick. I also cannot find too much evidence on google talking about many people getting worse after the Epley maneuver. They all say it is supposed to be some kind of miracle worker. LAWD help me. Thank you to all those who read this! (Not a doctor)  \nGenerally you need to go see a specialist. I have had BPPV for a few years now and the epley maneuver only helped me the first time I had a massive dizzy spell. (It was in the middle vestibular canal) After that first day of feeling horrible and getting treated I started feeling better.  \n\n\nFast forward 1 year and I am playing football and get punched cus a guy did not enjoy losing a duel. I get dizzy for months on end as the doctor misdiagnose me first and says it is not BPPV. I finally find a clinic that specialises in dizzyness, and after 2mins of looking at me they can confirm it is still BPPV, just not in the middle ear canal anymore.  \nI have had crystals knocked loose in the right vestibular canal, and it is a bit harder to reset, but still possible.  \n\n\nCheck these out, but you should only be doing them in accordance with a trained professional:  \n(\n\n(\n\nMind you that the second one is for the right hand side, so you would want to do it opposite of the side they do in the video.\n\nHope any of this was helpful in any way, I am still having some issues with my eyes that I need to get figured out (I have no nystagmus anymore, but my eyes seem to not be able to focus or seem like they are lagging while walking), but in general I am way better than I was a year ago. Thank you a million times over!! This was so extremely helpful!! I am fortunately doing so much better after the Epley maneuver. I had the crystals in both ears but only treated one per day. It was absolutely roughhh. I was in bed for 4 days straight. I am living in Greece and I could not find anyone specializing in dizziness so I was feeling so anxious about it. The Epley maneuver made me feel awful after the first adjustment though! I hope you are doing better and I am so sorry someone punched you in the head. That is awful!

I looked up the Dix-Hallpike and tried it. My SO could not detect any specific nystagmus, though (probably our inexperience).

But what if you never get vertigo only dizziness? And it happens regardless of head position, whether you are lying down or not? Plus you are left with a constant off balance/equilibrium? I actually did the epley once and I did feel relief but stupid me winded up trying a different maneuver which messed everything up.

I was turning hot and cold and vomiting, could not keep water in my system, I would just upchuck it. So basically I drank little bits of Gatorade every hour and did not eat dinner,I had ginger tea for the nausea. Probably related to my vertigo(bppv), the next couple days I felt off balance turning my head side to side and up and down.

Hi I am new here and recently started questioning how normal my life with vertigo has been. \n\nI started having what I called \u201cwhite outs\u201d when I was 10 years old. I would get dizzy, sound would all of a sudden go into the distance and it was like I was underwater, then everything would go white and spinning my family started taking me to EMTs and after being thought to possible be diabetic, brain seizures or have a brain tumor, I was diagnosed with BPPV on my 12th birthday after he saw my eyes twitching during a dizzy spell, then released from the hospital after having my ear crystals repositioned and told it could come back sometimes or may not ever. \n\nThe white outs came back sometime after, I do not remember exactly but I would say less than a year, but then I would not have one for months so we never went back to a doctor. In my high school/college days it got worse. The white outs became drop to the ground out of no where spells. Either that or I would throw up. These lasted for so long. Hours at times if I did not pass out or throw up yet. These happened probably 4 times a month. \n\nI am currently almost 27 and still have my pass out spells but maybe only 10 a year now. They are all the same, I get dizzy and I know it is going to get bad the second my hearing switched to me in a glass box, or underwater. Then I know I am passing out within seconds, or suffering absolute hell for hours. I had a giant pass out while walking into my apartment last year in the middle of the street, but this one one different. I felt like I had the best sleep of my life when I came to it and also peed myself. Of course I thought this was a seizure, got an EEG and mri, all normal. Not epileptic. \n\nEven though I am having less passing out spells, I am now having really really bad regular vertigo that can  last anywhere from an afternoon to a week long. I cannot remember having ongoing vertigo in my life until maybe 2 years ago when started. \n\nI am n out looking for a diagnosis or anything of such. I just want to know if my experience is pretty normal to most or you guys or what? I have never met another person who had this besides an old lady at a chiropractors office who could not believe I am already experiencing this. I have not been to a doctor specifically for my vertigo since my diagnosis at age 12. I have just excepted it. But recently it hit me that I am only 26 and this is not normal. The most important thing in medicine is your relationship with your doctor.  If you feel unable to connect with your doctor and make your concerns heard then you should definitely find a new doctor.\n\nNo one who will comment on here is a doctor, or at least not your doctor.  If you at all doubt or just do not understand a diagnosis then get a second opinion or find another doctor. Yes I agree. I just recently took a step back and questioned why I have just accepted this my whole life and not tried to fix it, let alone do nothing more than barely mention it to a doctor. But as I stated in the post, I do not want any advice about seeing a doctor. I want to hear from other people who have vertigo and they experience similar things or not, did they also start having it so young, etc. I used to get something really similar as a kid and we never figured it out but it seemed to get somewhat better with 25mg of Topamax a day, so it may have been related to some kind of weird mild seizure activity or migraines (nobody ever thought I had legit seizures, but some of my symptoms kind of matched up with some forms of epilepsy). As an adult who is off of Topamax, I get it..sometimes. I am looking into dysautonomia. Have you been tested for it at all? \u2665\ufe0f I have had BPPV for several years and what you describe sounds nothing like BPPV.  The key thing is that it is positional ie if you sit/stand very very still it fades out but the moment you move it is back.  \n\nThe classic test for me is to lay down then shift to laying on one side.  When I do this during an attack the whole world spins and will continue to spin for a minute or so.  Eventually the world more or less stops spinning.  If I then roll to the other side everything again spins like mad. When I was 27, I remember unlocking a gate and then the lock started spinning and I got tunnel vision more like black or green in the background and clung to the gate for fear I would pass out. Since then I started getting these \u201ckaleidoscope in my head\u201d episodes where I felt like I was falling through the bed. At 39 I started waking up nauseous in the night like I was on amusement park ride. My most recent vertigoish episode was last month (I am 42) I came to work hot and queasy. I stood up to finish some paperwork and this strong invisible force pinned me to the desk while the room slid side to side. Then as I went to shelve some books, the force wrapped around me like a three-part spiral and the floor twisted and rocked so violently in a circle I almost fell. I tried to drink some water, but almost threw up. I came home and crashed on the bed. I woke up feeling heavy, exhausted to the bone, much like I did when waking up from a faint. Vertigo is so weird. I think it\u2018s different for everyone. Just food for thought - only reason im suggesting this is because you happened to feel dizzy and pass out while walking, it could be POTS. Could look into that and see if you have any of those symptoms. There is also a tilt table test to see how your heart rate and blood pressure react to standing up/strenuous activity.", "Triggers?

I also have noticed neck pain associated with the onset of my vertigo and have changed pillows and that seems to have helped me. \nEarly days here, cannot be certain but that is where I am at and share similar symptoms to you. \u201cThe thing i have not heard too many people have, is that usually when i return my head to horizontal, or flip to the other side, it resides within seconds. Go back to the bad side, boom room spinning and intense spinning.\u201c - same for me. Not sure what else to tell you, I have not tried any maneuver, I usually just wait it out. For me, it lasts about a week - during that time, every time I lie on the bad ear the room spins and it is so scary. But that is just a kind of warning for me - because I know I can get the real BPPV if I sleep on my stomach and turn the head (that is my trigger) - of course, I try very hard not to do that. After a week or so, it all goes away (for a while).", "Lingering effects + general advice ", "First time poster. I need advice. Let me start by saying I have saw an ENT, my GP, and a Neurologist and nobody can tell me what I have or why. Here is what happens. Movement triggers my lightheadedness. Like, the room is not spinning but the inside of my head is, if that makes sense. But sometimes it can happen with no movement. When I feel it coming on, I take a Meclizine. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. These spells last anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours. I drink TONS of water and I always have so I know it is not a dehydration thing. May will make 2 years this is been happening but I can tell the spells are getting worse. I have had a CT w/no contrast and a CT w/contrast and was assured everything looked normal. I also had Covid this past April and since then they have gotten worse meaning they are more frequent and they last longer. This is not constant. I will go a month or more with no lightheadedness then it will hit and will last for days. This current episode started Jan 1 and is still happening. I graduated college in May and to be honest, this is preventing me from getting a job. There is days it just so miserable. Any insight on what would cause this?", "Can it still be BPPV if it is not just one position? Ever since July 2020 I have been dealing with dizziness and unsteadiness whenever I turn my head (up &amp; down, side to side) and get brief bouts of vertigo as well regardless of position. When I stand and walk around I pretty much feel imbalanced and I can only turn my head around so many times before I feel a vertigo spell coming on. Same thing while in bed, I just feel overall uncomfortable because I feel woozy whether I lie on my right, left, or back. Do not even know if this can be BPPV. I do admit I have very bad neck posture , actually years worth of it, coupled with undiagnosed anxiety and depression which led to not so great coping skills and not really learning how to release stress from the body. Sorry if I am just rambling on here but it is just frustrating to deal with and this pandemic is not really making things easy with seeing a medical professional sooner. But any advice is appreciated and if you want me to further clarify any of symptoms that I am experiencing just ask. Since BPPV involves your ear \u201ccrystals\u201d becoming loose and moving around, any sort of motion could potentially exacerbate the problem. I think of it like a snow globe\u2026 moving it around the tiny flecks will move but slowly settle, it is just that your head is the snow globe and the ear crystals the flecks.\n\nAre you propping yourself up at night? That seems to help me some; the extra height with an additional firm pillow keeps me from wanting to turn onto either side (though sometimes I cannot resist; I was 99.9% a stomach sleeper before all of this). Unfortunately my mattress is pretty small so not much room except for myself and two pillows at the most. I do have a neck contour pillow and at times I do put another pillow on top but does not really help. I am just at my wits end dealing with this. I miss having a restful sleep and being able to just relax in bed.\n\nI was wondering if it will be a good idea to bring up BPPV to the doctor? Or will that make me look like I am self diagnosing?", "Residual dizziness blues In need of some moral support this morning. I am about 2 weeks into vestibular therapy. The therapist fixed my nystagmus within the first visit and by the second just had me working on balance and VOC exercises. I have been feeling better some days, but others (like today) are tough from the moment I wake up, seemingly brought on by tossing and turning in my sleep.\nI am trying really hard to keep up with the exercises I have been given but the residual dizziness really takes it out of me. For me, the residual dizziness takes the form of a general lightheaded/unsteady feeling, increased anxiety, as well as nausea and abdominal pain/cramps. I can always get up and go to work, go about my day, but frequently it is hard to eat. I have been struggling with this for a while and have had such a hard time doing the things I want to do. I am glad that the worst of it seems to have gone when the therapist fixed the nystagmus but it is been 14 days since then and I still feel pretty awful about 50% of my days. Please tell me it will get better. My BPPV was SO stubborn that it took over 2 months to correct with a therapist. So, when I no longer had symptoms (nystagmus and the severe brief vertigo), it was like a weight lifted off my shoulders. YET - I had such horrible residual symptoms. I kept going to my therapist and making her test me for ALL the original things she tested for.  Still negative.  My anxiety was sky high - as I was sure I would feel yucky forever.  And the more anxious I got, the worse it got.  Honestly, the busier I could keep myself, the better.  I feel your pain. I really do. It seems there is no hope.  And my symptoms improved so incredibly slow.  I often mention how it would be weekly that I would see slight improvements. And just when I would have a good week, I would then have a set back, which would feed the anxiety.  \n\nI am just over a year of my last bout of BPPV being cleared. I had at least 4 super yucky months after.  And now the last few months I have actually been so much better. I still have some mild dizziness. I still think about BPPV coming back every night. I think of it every time I roll over in bed.  It really left an impact this time.  I was SO sick while I tried to deal with the residual stuff.  Keep doing the exercises and just know that you WILL get better. It just takes some of us longer than normal.  And it does not seem to matter what your mental or physical condition is.  I am active and healthy.  I am not on any medications. Life is good. But BPPV almost took me out.  It is horrible.\n\nAdvice from my therapist......You cannot live every day wondering if you will get BPPV again. It is like wondering and worrying if you will get cancer. You cannot predict it. BUT - know that if you get BPPV again, you know how to fix it and that it WILL get better.  I was also fortunate that I could keep going about life (work, hobbies, activities, etc) while I had active BPPV. Which possibly made my recovery longer, as my body adjusted to being 'off balance.'\n\nHang in there! It WILL get better. It truly is just a slow process for some of us. Perhaps meds to help ease the anxiety will help?  Honestly - the anxiety makes it SO much worse!  I remember having to get an MRI done on my injured knee - and I needed valium to be in the MRI machine.  Well, it was the best day EVER - as during that time, my anxiety and dizziness was GONE. Or at least, if I felt a wave of dizziness, I did not care (because of the Valium).  Mind you - I am not saying to go take Valium (and I only had half a doze). But perhaps your doc can prescribe something safer to help get you through the next few months. There will come a day when you will suddenly realize, \"hey, I have not been dizzy today.  Was I even dizzy yesterday?\"  Until then I have always found this Winston Churchill quote good, \"( I am sorry it is hanging on so long. I have just recovered from over a month of BPPV, which required several Epleys by my physiotherapist and chiropractor to clear it 100%. Some days I staggered about as if I were drunk. It really sucks.\n\nYou might want some low-dose meclizine to help with the nausea (aka Bonine from the pharmacy), or ask your doc for some sort of benzodiazepene. \n\nI had a dreadful episode in 2018 where the crystals were not just in the wrong place - they were STUCK on both sides of my head. I had to go to the ER where I was given IV alprazolam, aka Valium. Thankfully the vestibular clinic nearby had a physiotherapist who only treated BPPV and similar problems. (If anyone in Dallas, Texas reads this and is looking for a physiotherapist, I will send you her name - she was amazing.) That sounds so awful! But I am glad that you were able to find help. I have some meclizine that my pcp prescribed and it does help a lot but a single dose makes me sooo drowsy (like, into the next day of drowsiness). Just hoping and praying that that day comes soon \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Thanks for sharing! It is good to know that even the residual dizziness that is hanging on will eventually let up. But I had my most severe episode of vertigo since the first time I felt my BPPV (~5 months ago, this is my first time ever dealing with it) just now, sitting at work when suddenly I was not sure if I would be able to stay upright in my chair. So I am trying to power through it, keep busy and take my mind off it but  there is always a worry that it might get worse while I distract myself You might want to check out Bonine at the pharmacy. It is also meclizine, but probably a lower dose than what was prescribed. It may not knock you out as much as the prescription dosage. This may sound silly, but if you have a recliner you might try sleeping in it. It prevents sleeping on your sides or rolling while you sleep. Just a thought and I wish you all the best. If you just had a wave of the severe vertigo, then the BPPV may not be resolved yet. You might want to try the Dix Hallpike to test it and go through the entire Epley if it is still there.  Or go back to your therapist and have them test/check you again. BPPV can be stubborn in some people.  I had it on and off for two or three years.  Four episodes total. But the first three were milder and I did not know much about it. The doctors just brushed it off and told me to wait it out.  But this last episode I got help and it is stayed away for over a year now! So fingers crossed - it STAYS away! Yeah they do the Dix-Hallpike at every physical therapy session for me, but last time there was no visible nystagmus. I do not know if the vertigo came back though, I am hoping it is just residual dizziness. But I have my next session tomorrow morning so hopefully they will have some advice Glad you have an appointment tomorrow. There is a big difference between the residual dizziness &amp; the vertigo/nystagmus of bppv. And BPPV can quickly return, unfortunately. I hope you get some answers tomorrow! Keep us posted. I had my first episode in June of last year and was risidually dizzy until December . Have hope - it does get better slowly.", "Not sure if this is BPPV? I will have the quick bouts of dizziness with certain head movements at times, but I will also get hit with quick dizzy spells when I am reading/scrolling down a page. I even at times get quick dizzy spells when I flex my head ( essentially pulling my face back towards the back of my head slightly.\n\nIt does not happen all the time either for them it is like it switches around so I am very confused Your best course of action is to visit an ENT doctor and find out for sure what it could be. They could tell you more about what is causing those bouts of dizziness. If they cannot find anything, it could be neurological. Or even nutritional. It could be anything, and a doctors visit is essential in discovering narrowing it down.\n\nThis is purely anecdotal (I am no doctor) but: BPPV manifests itself for weeks, at least for me. It is continuing, non-stop dizziness/vertigo for days and nights and it is exhausting. If I switch sides while laying down, it can get worse or better, but it will not stop. If I stand up or sit suddenly, the world spins faster. This is because of the crystals in the inner ear that have become dislodged and shift when I move about. Constant nausea, frequent vomiting. My last bout of BPPV lasted 4 weeks, before the world started not spinning and I could finally stop vomiting and losing unnecessary weight.\n\nBut if you can sleep soundly, shift sides in bed without triggering it, and it comes and goes as it pleases and does not persist, then it is possible it is not BPPV. Vestibular Neuritis comes to mind, but again, I am no doctor and you should visit your primary care doctor or ENT to have them check.\n\nCheers, \nand good luck, friend. I had those same exact symptoms for a couple of years then had a genuine bppv episode.  Always chalked it up to anxiety. I also had night spins for several months in the MOTN leading up to the bppv. I did not connect any of it but since recovering from the bppv (it was in March and took about 4 weeks to totally resolve) none of it occurred again. Knock wood. It may all be unrelated and probably is but since this syndrome is so mysterious there is no harm in anecdotal experiences being recorded.", "Bppv? So I woke up Monday and was dizzy when I got up.  Tried it again and got dizzy when I tried flat to getting up.   Later on I layed on the floor and tilted head back, whamo.  I got really bad dizziness that I had to sit.   It happens when I get up from laying down or tilt my head back all the way and come back.    I did the techniques to possibly roll out the crystals.   I went to the ent and he layed me back in the chair.   I got dizzy on the way up.   He said he is not sure it is my ears cause my eyes were not freaking out.   But I still got dizzy when I tilted back and up.   Anyway he said come back in 2 weeks if does not go away.   I definitely feel off. Could this definitely be BPPV or something else ? \nThanks Had vertigo when turning my head while lying down as well, so sounds like bppv to me. But how is your blood pressure? I read somewhere that vertigo can happen when you have low BP and when you are dehydrated. \n\nHave you done the maneuvers and did they help? My blood pressure is fine.  Took it couple times last couple of days and was 125/78 I would recommend you get your doctor to refer you to pt / vestibular rehab asap so they can teach you the epley maneuver and help you do it.  The longer you have the crystals the more likely you are to have residual dizziness once the crystals are moved or dissolve.  Per the research it only goes away on its own in 40 percent of people.  You should not have to live with it when the epley can fix it in 2 minutes.  Good luck! So after doing the epley maneuvers I notice I am not getting dizzy doing it anymore or tilting my head back.   So after a week I am a lot better    I still feel like my body is still re calibrating but definitely in a better place.   I do not know if it is because of time or the epley maneuvers but I will never know.  I just know after doing it a couple or so times at night the dizziness stopped eventually", "Advice on professional Hi everyone,\nWould you recommend a physical therapist or ENT/otolaryngologist more for right side BPPV If you have already been diagnosed with BPPV - I believe a physical therapist (Mine was a vestibular therapist specializing in dizziness in the PT department) will help you MORE.  An ENT can do hearing testing, and make sure there is not anything else going on in your ear/system. But if you truly have BPPV - finding a therapist will be the best bet for you, as they can help guide you through treatment. Hey, I would suggest a PT as well. Doctors can only check to make sure there is not anything else wrong with your ear and make a diagnosis, besides that they cannot do much. A PT can help reduce your symptoms and make sure you are moving around while the vertigo subsides. May not work for everyone but worth a shot!\n\nGood luck!", "New here -any exercises for residual Hi everyone, happy to find this board. I have had BPPV (diagnosed by a doctor) for the last 9 years, started after a really bad sinus infection and seems to happen every few years around the same time of year too. I had a really bad episode though early October. Normally the vertigo only lasts a couple of seconds but this time was about 30 seconds and really nauseous with it and pretty much could not do a thing all day but sit in one position.  \n\nI forced myself to do the Eply with my husband and felt a lot better but it took a while to get back to almost normal. It is now January and I feel a  lot better but still having residual, and not all the time just sometimes.   Today I have that \"off\" feeling but normally if it happens it is in the evening- probably bc i know I have to go to bed and I get nervous. I find that I cant just roll over in bed anymore I have to sit up and then go on the other side.  I have not had another vertigo episode since October just feel like one could come on but i can stop it.  Does this happen to any of you.\n\nI can exercise, i can drive fine and do pretty much all things without issue. Just that turning over in bed. It also feels \"weird' is the only way i can describe it if im in a dark room like in the bathroom, shut the lights and then turn to go out the door- do not get the vertigo - just odd. \n\nAnyway, does anybody have exercises they can recommend to help move out of this phase of residual. Its driving me nuts!  And then I start to get anxiety about it and that doesnt help. \n\nI also noticed a couple of times over the holiday, after having a couple of glasses of wine I felt a bit dizzy. That never happened at all before! I read something that the alcohol could change the volume of fluid in your ear and could throw off that feeling.  Not sure how true that is but has anyone else ever experienced it?   \n\nSo I guess that is it, thanks for all the wonderful information you all share - and any suggestions for just daily exercises to try to move out of this residual would be much appreciated.\n\n  \nHealthy and Happy New Year to you all! Hi,\n\nEverything you have described is very similar to me.\n\nYour vestibular system and your eyes are out of sync and because you have been like this for 9 years (I was 4) before doing exercises your body has learnt to rely heavily on your visual system to give you balance.\n\nSoon as the lights are off, it is dark and your eyes are no longer able to help your brain... your body relies on the vestibular system which brings on these odd sensations. \n\nThis is why driving, running, sport etc is perfectly fine but nighttime, bed, etc is not. \n\nMy recommendations:\n1) see a PT - they can work with you on exercises and go from easy to hard. I remember doing the easy exercises and failing miserably and getting rather upset. Having the PT there helped push me along. \n2) give up the booze - will mess with your vestibular system as you have already described. - i have not had booze for 5+ years. Do not miss it!\n\nIf you do not want to see a PT, google gaze stability exercises OR hunt through the sub, lots of good information on exercises. \n\nBest of luck! Yes! Exactly everything /u/slash5k1 said. I was working with a vestibular therapist and had many exercises to do. Each week, more or different exercises were given to me.  They helped a bunch, but I still have some annoying residual (mild) dizziness. No matter what I do - it does not go away.  And I am accepting that this will be my new normal.  My last (and 4th) BPPV attack was a bit over a year ago. I had active BPPV for over two months. My residual dizziness lasted a good 6 to 8 months.  Initially, I felt HORRIBLE with the residual dizziness. It was a different horrible than the BPPV.\n\nSearch the forum and you will find more advice and even links to some of the exercises.  But truly, seeing a good therapist is better, as they can monitor your progress and prescribe exercises detailed towards you.  There is a good amount of excellent advice here from people that have seen and worked with specialists. I am not sure if this would help, but here are ( that you can try.\n\nA note from Fauquier ENT regarding the exercises:\n\n&gt;Keep in mind that these exercises will not help with dizziness due to BPPV and Meniere's which are treated differently.", "Vestibular neurities How similar? Anyone else has this here? First diagnosed w bppv but 2nd EnT specialist said it is vestibular neurities since I did not have much problem with positions after the vertigo episode. Same - was first diagnosed with bppv then later vestibular neuritis bc epley did nothing and episodes were severe but acute. I read it could be something like a cold sore on your vestibular nerve. I have had VN and cold sores since I was young 4 or 5. I had episodes all the time when I was younger, it was terrible. Many mornings I could not even take my head off the pillow and would have to wrap it around my head just to sit up, desperately trying to prevent an episode. Sick for days after an attack. The sever attacks were the worst, like your brain and eyeballs are spinning a million miles an hour in opposite directions.\n\nI get dizzy sometimes but rarely have a sever episode. I took a bunch of valtrex a few years ago after a bad sunburn and resulting cold sores. I kind of think it helped somewhat but can 't really prove it. Still feel like I am def capable of having a sever episode if I were to spin around to much. I was diagnosed with Vestibular Neuritis and posted this a few months ago (  The theory appears to be a virus that attacks the vestibular nerve and leaves it damaged.  The nerve does not heal, but your brain does appear to provide additional support to managed the degraded signal over time.  However, my understanding of the long-term prognosis is somewhat dismal.  Eager to hear about any good news and treatments! Caloric testing (water or air in your ear) would establish if there is an imbalance between the ears - vestibular hypofunction as well as vestibular neuritis could cause this. So a more trained eye would be needed to distinguish between the two. \n\nENTs are a great starting point but most do not have enough xp to properly diagnose. Seek a vestibular specialist, they can check out your nystagmus and determine what causes it and also help tremendously with rehab. No one on here can tell you what you have just based on comparing symptoms. \n\nIf it is vestibular neuritis do not despair - studies show most people compensate (ie brain adjust to the bad signal from the bad ear). However, might take a bit of effort and time. Good luck!", "Curious if BPPV or not. So I have been diagnosed with BPPV but my doctor did not really listen to what I was saying. My symptoms somewhat align with it, but not really.  Epley does not work on me and it seems my vertigo is only triggered by heat ( I live in the SW United States where it is hot June-Oct), kratom which I use very sparingly, and car rides where I am in the back seat. It seemed for a while that if I took Benadryl on the days it affected me, the Benadryl really helped. Now, not so much. I am stumped. It can go away for a year, and then randomly hit me everyday for a month straight. Any ideas? The number one signal that it is BPPV is that changes in head position or angle cause vertigo - whether turning, looking up, looking down, tilting your head at an angle. If any of those things cause vertigo, then it is probably BPPV. For me, not getting enough sleep, dehydration, or catching a cold can bring it on. It is completely normal not to have it for months, a year, then to get a bout that lasts awhile.\nThe Epley may not work if you have loose otoliths in a different canal, such as the anterior or posterior canal. Yep great info.\n\nIf you can turn your head to either side without losing vision and feeling like you just spun in 5 circles for 3 seconds, it is probably not BPPV. Up and down are not too bad for myself personally, though up will be a little dizzying sometimes.\n\nUsually lasts 4ish hours with 2 hours being really bad on tough days. You can improve BPPV, you do not have to live with it... have you not seen a specialist or tried the well documented moves?? Have you had a professional do the epley on you?? Sometimes I think changing of the seasons affect my allergies, therefor affecting my vertigo. Allergies bring on inflammation. Also vitamin d needs are higher when I have allergies. For me the Epley maneuver does not really work. I do the Half somersault maneuver and it clears my vertigo right up after only a couple of tries. You should try it as soon as your symptoms come on", "Residual Dizziness?? I experience my first vertigo episode in the beginning of the year and got diagnosed with BPPV. My ENT performed the Epley maneuver and was Successful and all the spinning had stop but I was left feeling if I was on a boat going side to side. Has anyone experienced this? If so how long till this feelings go away? Or do you think I need to go back to my ENT? That was normal for me. Lasted about a week, with some days better than others. I have experienced residual wobbles for 2 months after an acute episode. Cannot hurt to get evaluated again to see if the other ear or another kind of maneuver can help. Ya go again. I have read it can take several maneuvers before it is gone. But also try doing the other maneuvers yourself in the meantime. There are several. You might want to go back, I had a crystal that started in one canal that the Epley helped, then it moved to a different canal that Epley does not work on, the PT did a different maneuver for it. I had the same sort of feeling, kind of a motion sickness, like I was moving even when sitting still. Yeah I did. It is been 12 years now.", "Falling over sensation? 1. Is anyone else totally fine for a couple days then other days you are dizzy again? \n2.Something I still struggle with is on one side it feels like my body is wanting to fall over that way. Does that mean I still have woek to do on that side, Yes.  Have you seen a vestibular therapist?  Go.  Made all the difference in world for me Yes - you should see a PT and start balance rehab. just to add i saw an ear nose and throat (ent) dr where they performed the dix-halpike on me to determine which side i was affected then performed the epley maneuver twice on me during the same visit to resolve my bppv.\n\neither an ent dr or vestibular specialist can help you.", "Video of nystagmus as self diagnosis Been previously diagnosed with BPPV - treated by a PT, videonysragmogrphy and Epley.\n\nI am curious if anybody is able to film their nystagmus in provocative positions, during a crisis. I know some people say this could be a good way to determine if you still have free floating crystals after an epley, but I am wondering if gaze fixation might actually suppress the nystagmus (not pitch black as with VNG). Basically I am wondering how likely is a false negative. \n\nThanks! I have not tried filming myself but I did have my husband watch for the eye movements the last time I had it. The VNG helps physical therapists see the movement more clearly, I know at one point it took about. 30 seconds of holding a position before my eyes started moving and it was pretty subtle, I am not sure someone just looking at my eyes would have picked up on it. I personally was always aware of when the nystagmus was happening, I could feel that my eyes were moving, if that makes any sense. It involuntary so I do not think gaze fixation would affect it, I do think blinking does, it kind of resets your eyes in a way? That is why they do not want you to blink.  Thanks so much! I basically trying to understand whether it is smth you can see with the naked eye. And yeah, I definitely remember how my eyes were like buzzing during an episode I watched mine when they were video'ed by my pt and it was very obvious. I can admit, that I have a hard time keeping my eyes open when it happens.  I can totally tell it is happening, and if I leave my eyes open, it seems worse, as I cannot see anything. When the blackout video goggles were put on, it was easier to keep my eyes open because it was dark.\n\nI had my husband watch my eyes once - and he could really tell they were twitching.  I can always feel it as well, whether I have my eyes open or shut. I have not tried to film them myself.  I DO think it would be hard to determine from a person just watching, as to which way the eyes are twitching, to help determine ear canal is effected. It is nice to have the goggles to enlarge and even slow down the video to see it.\n\nThat is a good question though - as to gaze fixation suppressing the nystagmus. But from my experience, I do not think it changes it.  My eyes seem to twitch bad no matter what I do. Thanks so much for the reply - of course, I would not want to diagnose myself. I just wanted to have a tool to know when an episode is happening as I also have anywhere vestibular condition and want to differentiate between them If you try to video.... Let us know how it goes! I am curious! I almost feel like I would have to have someone hold my eye lids open on the light. It is a bit difficult to do while your head feels like it is spinning.\n\nI tried but the detail was not fine enough to be useful.\n\nI tried with selfie camera and other camera, but I did not have enough external light sources in my bedroom for a clear video.\n\nOne problem was that focusing on the phone screen made the nystagmus less apparent, due to gaze fixation maybe?\n\nOnce I \"looked past\" the phone the nystagmus was much more pronounced but I then had difficulty maintaining phone position.\n\nIf I have another bout, and want a record of it I would make sure the room is very well lit where my head will be. \n\nI would also have phone/camera close to eyes on a fixed mount, but off centre so it does not fill middle of vision.\n\nSaves having to coordinate muscles for filming while suffering nystagmus. \n\nLooking at further away objects while filming might show it up even more as it seemed more pronounced to me under those conditions.\n\nI tried to make a bppv-like simulation of horizontal slow drift one way, left on my case, then sudden flick back, so anyone can get a hint of what it is like. \n\nDid not quite turn out right as my phone camera tripod is a wobbly cheapo, and the sudden flick back made camera jump vertically and go out of focus every time. If you do not have eye twitching does that mean you do not have bppv? The majority of most common forms of BPPV do have nystagmus. And the direction of your eyes twitching determine which ear canal is effected. There are less common cases  where you can have bppv with no eye twitching. Did they ache a bit as well? I am not sure what you mean My eyes feel slightly uncomfortable like a dull ache", "Does this sound like BPPV? No diagnosis yet, seeing DR soon It started about two months ago I went tubing. It was super rough and u laid my head on the tube and got shook around a lot. I was super dizzy for about a week, then it eased up but it was not perfect. Then I got bad vertigo, and the dizziness got worse ! It was terrible for a week, then slowly eased up. As of last week I had another vertigo after sitting up quickly in bed, I did the half somersault maneuver and it went away, but of course I am still dizzy.\nCurrently dealing with a feeling of unbalance, dizziness, and light headedness. Also, my vision is super jumpy when I try to focus on Soemthing .\nI want to get my ear crystals checked out. Just wondering if this sounds familiar or if anyone has any other suggestions ! Sounds like bppv.  Do the dix Hal pike test ASAP.  Go online to find out how.  Then do the epley a couple times on whatever side dix halpike shows.  \n\nAfter that go see your doctor ASAP.  Get into some physical therapy ASAP.  \n\nI say ASAP not cuz you are in danger but from what I have read the faster you get rid of it the quicker you heal up.  \n\nAlso, after you do the epleys, try some Benadryl.  Do not use before. I saw a YouTube video on it, I am a bit confused. Does this determine which position of BPPV u need? Yes.  The dix hall pike determines which side your bppv is on (if you have it) and then you do the corresponding epley Sounds like it to me; though I am not a medical professional, I did not experience the same symptoms. \n\nSuggestions? What has helped me is moving around as much as possible, some sunshine and fresh air, I have upped my exercise, staying hydrated, sleeping propped up and off the affected side (easier to do once you know what side is the problem).", "Bad reaction to Flonase Has anyone who has used Flonase for this had a horrible reaction to it? I am feeling unbalanced almost all day and crazy jump out of my skin off and on anxiety. I got concerned this is what was causing it and have no taken any since yesterday morning. I have had a sinus infection and I have been using it. I think it boost my anxiety up as well . I just used some about a hour ago and I know I sprayed it in my nose but I am panicking that I got some in my eye lol I am not using no more after this. Oh ouch! Yeah I am done with it. It makes me feel crazy panicky.", "Hello new to the BPPV thread Has anyone with BPPV and tinnitus (both ears) experienced a tinnitus spike in (both ears) after an attack? And has anyone been diagnosed with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease after a BPPV attack. I know the two are different. My ent diagnosed me with MD even though my vertigo attack was positional. Ive had high frequency hearing loss in both ears but it is worse in my left. I have been told my tinnitus for years has been do to the hearing loss. My low frequencies are fine. But since the spike after my BPPV attack my ent now says M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s. So confusing Not really an answer to your question, but you can absolutely have M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's Disease AND BPPV at the same time.", "BPPV triggers? This is going to be a long-ish post.\n\nI am experiencing BPPV for the third time in a year and half and am feeling a bit hopeless about ever living BPPV free. \n\nMay 2018 was my first ever run in with BPPV. Full fledged spins when lying down, and feeling wonky for two weeks straight when walking or sitting upright. After about a week and half I did the Epley maneuver which reduced my dizziness dramatically (thank goodness) - but I still suffered residual dizziness when looking down or going down stairs etc. \n\nMy second bout of BPPV was Oct 2018. I was in the middle of interviewing for jobs, and also balancing hard deadlines for a couple of freelance contracts I had at the time. I was incredibly stressed and I think it is what triggered my vertigo for the second time - this time much worse than the first. I was unable to walk (!!) and had to postpone almost everything I was doing. I tried to Epley on my own again but with no success. I then sought the help of a physio specialized in treated BPPV. The first time he tried the Epley we could not trigger my vertigo - so he did the maneuver anyway and told me to come back in a couple weeks. I improved a bit and went back, we did the Epley again and the second time he was able to trigger my vertigo. I improved drastically after this second maneuver and went back again to get some exercises for the residual dizziness. He explained to me that he suspected this second bout of BPPV was more aggressive likely bc two crystals were dislodged in two different canals in my left ear. \n\nSo now, almost 8 months later, I thought I was doing well. I was on a trip to the Rockies (Alberta) and got back from my flight to Ontario last night around 12:30a. I was to wake up at 6:30a for work today but was awoken around 4:30a with, you guessed it, vertigo head spinning. I was desperate to catch some Zs so I propped my head up with a  wedge to sleep through the night. In the morning I did not feel my usual \"wonkiness\" but am starting to feel it seep in - likely as I grow more tired in the day. I am not sure what could have triggered it this time. Since occurrence #2 I have been working on managing my stress levels. I am going to get in touch with my physio to make an appointment but I am just wondering what triggers other people's vertigo. \n\nWe have been dealing with a lot of rain as of late where I reside and a few people have told me their vertigo has been acting up recently because of the weather. Could this be true? \n\nCould it be the plane ride? The high altitude of the rockies? \n\nI notice drinking alcohol impacts me a lot and I have cut that down and am thinking of cutting it out entirely. \n\nWhat are some triggers for others on here? You could look into getting your vitamin D levels checked.  There is a correlation between low vitamin D and vertigo and studies that suggest that vitamin D supplementation can decrease frequency and/or intensity of vertigo attacks.\n\nFor me, my vertigo turned out to be vestibular migraines (we think) and I need to avoid food triggers, get enough sleep, reduce stress, etc.\n\nDid you go on a plane?  Airplanes can mess with your ears and have triggered vertigo for some people. Thank you for this, will definitely look into vitamin D supplements. My triggers in the past have been:\n\nFlying\nCaffeine\nAlcohol\nLack of sleep\nStorms \nAnxiety\nSleeping on one side \n\nSo yeah you will find that you are affected by some things and it might change over time. I cut out booze for about a year but now I am happily back on it (socially) \ud83d\ude43\n\nI have been keeping a diary w the barometric pressure/weather patterns/cycle day etc. Not that I have found a pattern. Your bppv might be vestibular migrainey like mine. Also my doc talked me into going into anti anxiety meds and my vertigo has been much tamer. So... lots to ponder there.", "Teenager with possible BPPV I am 17. I woke up on Wednesday feeling okay; walking normally, no dizziness. Then after sitting down for a while, doing some online school work I got up and my balance was off like completely off. It has only gotten worse from there. I am pretty sure it is BPPV, I did some maneuvers and only saw temporary relieve. I do not think I am doing them right. This is so debilitating! I am active and it brings my workouts to a halt, I\ncan barely walk straight all in the course of a day. Why do you think it is BPPV? I did not see anything in your description that sounded like BPPV to me. It is only dizziness when I move my head. I doubt it is an ear infection. Also I do handbalancing and think I maybe knocked the crystals out of place. &gt;In your first post, you wrote:  \n&gt;  \n&gt; I got up and my balance was off like completely off.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In your 2nd post you wrote:  \n&gt;  \n&gt; dizziness when I move my head   \n&gt;  \n&gt;These are very different. With BPPV, if you move your head in a certain direction, the room spins like hell. It is not balance being off. It is violent spinning. But only when you move your head in a certain direction. Not sure if bppv but perhaps vestibular... \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nDiary your symptoms. Are you experiencing any spinning or just balance problems? How long are the episodes? Any history of migraine or motion sickness?\n\nYou can/should try some vestibular exercises (pretty harmless). Do some research on this but I can link you to some if you cannot find anything online. (On my mobile rn and do not have any resources rn) Is it dizziness or vertigo? They are completely different. Vertigo is extremely violent and you will not be standing up or moving period, basically be stuck to the floor holding on for dear life. Dizziness is like when you spin around in a circle and get, well, dizzy. With BPPV, moving your head will activate vertigo, and it will last up to a minute but then go away as long as your head is still. There is some residual dizziness with BPPV though so it is hard to know. Usually if you have BPPV you will know it is BPPV. Google the Dix Hallpike maneuver.  That will determine if you have a form of BPPV or not. It is basically sitting upright on your bed (put a pillow under your shoulders - or be prepared to hang your head partially off the side of the bed), turn your head either to the right or left about 40 degrees (not quite to your shoulder), and lay back quickly with your head slightly extended past your shoulders.  Stay there for a bit. If you get a 30 to 60 second episode of severe vertigo (spinning) and nystagmus with your eyes (eyes twitching uncontrollably), you have BPPV.  If nothing happens on that side, then try the other side.  This is essentially the first step to the Epley maneuver, and that is what is performed to move the loose crystal in your inner ear canal back in place. It is possible to have BPPV without the telltale symptoms - so it is helpful to see a specialist that can help with the testing. But it does not hurt to try this yourself.\n\nBPPV is a 30ish second episode of violent spinning. There can be residual dizziness when recovering from BPPV. There are many different forms of dizziness. Vestibular migraines, vestibular neuritis, gaze instability, and different forms of BPPV if the crystal goes into one of the six different ear canals. Please try to find a doctor that specializes in dizziness, and ENT, dizzy clinic, or vestibular therapist. They can do many tests to determine exactly what is going on. I started getting BPPV like symptoms a few days ago, I tried the Dix Hallpike manoeuvre as you instructed, and was able to isolate it to leftward head movement.\n\nWill see my doc soon, for any tests needed to be sure what is going on but it is been helpful to do the test in the meantime. \n\nI have been dreading laying down because of head spins, could not figure out what was doing it apart from going vertical to horizontal.\n\nNow I can lay down on my right and stay that way to get to sleep easier.\n\nSo your comment has helped improve my quality of life, many thanks. So glad you have found a tiny bit of relief! Now that you have determined it is left sided - you COULD try doing the Epley maneuver for left sided BPPV to try to clear the crystal on your own. It is still a good idea to see a doctor, but in the meanwhile, the Epley may help you out.  Be aware, that it DOES trigger the severe vertigo though (as you found doing the Dix Hallpike, which is the first step to the Epley), as the crystal moves around your ear canal to the different positions.  Stay strong and ride it out though.  In the end, it will help.  Although you may have to do it more than once (20 times for me - through the course of 2 months).\n\nI am happy you could find a position to help you get some rest - and ease your anxiety.  Keep us posted on how you are doing! I had a much needed nice nap this afternoon for the first time in days thanks to you. \n\nI will definitely give the Epley manoeuvres a try, and let you know how I progress.\n\nThanks for taking the time to reply :-)", "Does everyone get dizzy? I have been feeling like my house is shaking for 2  weeks and I left the house today and everywhere was shaking so I am more concerned than I used to be. \n\nWhenever I walk it shakes. I am not dizzy which is weird. I feel like dizziness is associaed with your head. I dont feel disoriented the ground just feels like its shifting. Yes, ground tilts to me but I also have dizzy, as in the world spinning kind of dizzy while the ground is tilting. It tilts and goes back down, tilts and goes back down. I think it is my eyes jumping from nystagmus, trying to balance with the wonky messaging coming from my ears, I guess? Anyway, I can say I can tell the sensation is in my head, not my legs, if that makes sense? Gotcha that helps a lot. That is not at all what im experiencing.", "29, problems with sleeping and I think it is BPPV It is always hard to describe, but in the middle of the night usually as I am about to fall asleep, I occasionally get these intense head \"shocks\". They happen to a lesser agree during the day when I find myself laying down on the couch. Honestly in some ways it feels like my head is about to turn off and it makes me scared to go to sleep some nights. I think it is BPPV because there is some dizzyness associated with it and dizzyness in my day to day as well but that could be me jumping to conclusions.\n\nI hit the back of my head a bit over a year ago and never got it checked out properly as everything seemed fine. All these problems started to occur probably 6 months after that happened, but it is possible they are connected?\n\nIf anyone has similar sensations and has some advice that would be very welcome. I get similar feelings. It can be very scary. My doctor tells me it is BPPV. But not everyone relates when I tell them about those same sensations. It feels like I am going to die sometimes. It can cause a lot of anxiety Do you mean exploding head syndrome? I have not been diagnosed with BPPV, my doctor told me it was all just anxiety. I get those same dying feelings though and I think those sensations are what is causing my anxiety. I do not think so? It is not associated with noise, just a pain in my head and me in a panic because of that I do not think it is BPPV as I have encountered a similar issue whenever I am just about to nod off to sleep - it is as if my brain is not ready to switch off.  But - you may want to see a physical therapist that specializes in balance issues to check you out and perform an epley manuver to be sure.  It took me 3 tries before BPPV showed up.\n\nYou definitley should get your head checked out as there could be residual issues \\ going on after you encountered the head injury.  If a GP will not help - go see a neurologist Definitely does not sound like bppv... Go get your head checked. I have this issue when I have more anxiety / stress than normal. I always thought it was bppv since I have had really bad bppv where I could not stand for a week and a half. This was not my experience. I woke up from simply being dizzy and spinning when moving in my sleep.\n\nI would not just assume it is anxiety. The doctors are quick to dismiss strange symptoms (especially in women or young people).\n\nFor BPPV I searched for a Vertigo specialist who ended up being an audiologist with focus solely on vertigo. But as others mentioned, you should see others, e.g. a neurologist, too. Ya I have BPPV and I feel like my head is being zapped. Sometimes it is right after I turn my head, sometimes a few minutes after, but mostly when laying down, or tilting my head up.", "Four bouts of vertigo in the last 5 weeks. Learning to do the Epley Maneuver now. I asked my primary doctor about a referral to see an ENT doc, his answer was get your hearing checked. Does this make sense?  I might end up with an audiologist but I suspect I need a full ENT doctor.  Thoughts? Thanks. And it usually lasts 24 to 36 hours.  Lately about 24. Try to find a vestibular therapist- usually in a physical therapy location. They have the most knowledge and experience with BPPV. Mine (in US) saw me without a referral. Good tip, I already visited a PT doc and he helped me do the Epley maneuver.  But I just wonder if we can get to the core of this issue. Thanks I second this!! I went to an ent for months and then did not get any relief until I went to physical therapy My doctor made me get a hearing test as well &amp; they said it is because they want to see if it is an inner ear problem. Once that gets ruled out they can look to see if it could be another problem. Try to see if the audiologist can refer you to an ent and/or neurologist I kind of wanted to go to an ENT so they could see if it was anything physical in/with my ear. 24 hours of constant vertigo or 24 hours where a certain head movement will instantly cause it?\n\nI seem to have had it for about a week now (randomly woke up last Thurs), but mine can now only really be triggered when lying down and getting back up Thanks Thanks. I am pretty sure it is an inner ear problem. I will take it step by step, Good call.

Tips about how to cope, exercises that work, dietary tweaks that might help with prevention\u2026 these are what I enjoy reading. But I am getting mighty tired of the \u201cdoes this sound like BPPV\u201d posts submitted by people who cannot be bothered to research.\n\nRant over. I will sticky a post soon to remind people to check the ( first. Good post Another great tip - use the search function on the sub/group.  Often the same question is asked over and over.

I do not know one person in my life that dealt with it, and other forums are not as quick to respond or as current.\n\nPeople who question BPPV- keep coming, there are plenty of us who feel your frustration and \u201cget\u201d the place you are in when it comes to narrowing down the cause of your dizziness; we also wanted a human connection to others and were once in your shoes.\n\nLecture over.   \ud83d\ude09 I get what you are saying - that people should be charitable towards others who are feeling concerned about symptoms they are experiencing. But most of us in here - some of us, anyway - know we have BPPV. The community is called \"BPPV\". So it is a group targeting people who have done their research and who know that what they are dealing with is BPPV - vertigo caused by crystals getting dislodged and moving into the ear canal. It is specific. Many, many posts ask about dizziness that to me sounds completely unrelated to BPPV. I do not think it is wrong to want to prevent dilution of value in this community. I see what you are saying; but I think what adds value to the board is helpfulness, not a policing tone.\n\nIt is not like we have people coming here complaining repeatedly about podiatry or gynecological issues\u2014 they have an idea, and they are looking for humans with experience with it, not WebMD or Healthline, to interact with. Some we have seen also have issues with access to doctors and/or insurance and affordability of care, so asking for help from experienced BPPV\u2019ers might be seen as valuable for those reasons\u2026 someone on here the other day said they have been dealing with it I think since February or March and could not get an appointment until November! No wonder they look for help here. \n\nI have seen many posts that say, \u201cask your doctor\u201d; simple as that, and not at all unwelcoming in a way that *actually \u201cdevalues\u201d the community; maybe a more worthwhile response for Redditors that seek a forum of similar questioning is, \u201ctry /askdocs\u201d if you do not think they belong here. I do not think a rant does anything to actually add value to the community, while solving whatever problem you perceive from people seeking help.

My doctor said i probably have bppv causing vertigo i have had recently but from what i can see vertigo caused by bppv lasts a few seconds and then you are fine again but my vertigo lasts for most of the day which has me worried i might have menieres disease which sounds much worse. Can anyone say if their bppv related vertigo lasts for more than a few seconds? Mine definitely lasts all day when I have an attack.  The most immediate rolling sensation is only when I move though but I feel dizzy and nauseous all day So you are fine when you are still but moving makes it feel bad again? I really regret going to doctor google cos it has really freaked me out\ud83d\ude02 but that is so very nice to hear\ud83d\ude02 this menieres disease sounds much worse cos it can cause you to go near deaf as well as giving you vertigo I use fine very loosely I consider the intense (up to 30 seconds) of severe dizziness as vertigo.  This is positional and it is so severe that I cannot move or see. If I tip my head the wrong direction, I get that brief wave of violent vertigo where my eyes twitch (nystagmus). After this goes away - I still feel very sick and nauseous.  Until the BPPV is cleared - I for sure feel 'off' and get mild waves of dizziness. And for me, the BPPV was active for so long, I got a secondary dizziness called 'gaze instability' where I would get woozy/dizzy just looking around at things.  In fact, I would even get dizzy when I closed my eyes.  Now mind you - the 'dizziness' is not the same as the violent vertigo I get (such as when doing the Dix Hallpike maneuver to test for BPPV or the Epley maneuver to try to clear the crystal). \n\nI was worried I had Meneires as well, because of the constant dizziness and tinnitus.  It was a huge relief to see a dizzy specialist (Vestibular Therapist) and an ENT, and neurologist to rule out Meneires and anything else more severe.  If you are able, try to find a specialist that can truly diagnose you and help you out with exercises/maneuvers.  A lot of docs just tell you that you have BPPV and send you away with some meds and tell you to wait it out.  There are specialists that can do specific tests and ease your fear.  This last episode of BPPV for me, lasted over two months.  So try to get on top of it as soon as you can to get it resolved.\n\nAlso - for many, once the BPPV is cleared, you will have residual dizziness. And that is another monster to try to battle. The actual vertigo where the room looked like it was skip spinning lasted maybe a minute or so. The rest of the time I felt off balance, nauseous and really tired. I felt okay when I was sitting still, then the crystal moved into a different canal and even when sitting still I would get this weird feeling of motion even though nothing looked like it was moving.", "Double Anterior Canal BPPV I have had non vertigo dizziness with head movement from December 2020 to April of 2021. During that time I did every maneuver imagineable epley, semknt, etc. I finally found out at the end my dizziness was caused by VOR being off. The vestibular therapist said I originally had bopv and the vor was off because of it and I must have knocked the crystals back in myself. She gave me vor exercises to do and I was cured a few weeks later.\n\nFlash forward 4 months later. Non vertigo dizziness again, out of nowhere, with head movement. The dizziness comes when looking down always, it is an off balance and pressure feeling. Even if I slightly move my head down.\n\nWent back to vestibular therapist. She could not find cause, said like be anything. Went back to Dr.. MRI, other tests clear.\n\nFound new vestibular therapist. She sees downward beating nystagmus every single time. She claims DOUBLE anterior canal bppv. She says at least 40% of the time bppv does not cause vertigo but off balance like I have.\n\nShe gave me maneuvers to do and THEY WORK. To a point. I would say they make me 80% better. However, still not 100%, and the effects of the maneuver seem to wear off. Has anyone ever dealt with this? When crystals seemingly will not stay in place? They wear off in like 2 days or so.\n\nAlso, double Anterior Canal BPPV seem impossible. It has to at least have an element of anterior canal or the exercises would not work. It is been 10 weeks now, I am just wondering if it will events go away on its own? \n\nOverall I am doing a ton better. I am just trying to figure out what can cause bppv constantly?

I have been at wits end multiple times. Im a 32 year old male. This story all started with a bout of bronchitis. A severe bout that went to my lungs and clogged.my left ear. After the bronchitis went away I was left with a clogged ear for a few weeks and went and saw an ENT to clear it up. Now I assume most doctors are professionals but this one was definitely not. He looked in my ear and immediately ordered a hearing test in which i had some low frequency hearing loss. 40 decibels at 250hz or something. He announced I had Menieres disease but wanted more tests to confirm. Now, I had never had any vertigo symptoms and I have always had a little bit of tinnitus occasionally as a child. His practice was terrible and so was his staff so I do not take anything he said to heart and left pissed off. Took a couple weeks but my ear cleared up. But I was stressed out by the interaction and work stress built up. \n\n6 weeks after the ENT i start getting bouts of lightheadedness when I looked up. After a week I went and saw my GP. He comes in and sees on my record that I saw an ENT for MENIERES cause that asshole put it on my record. So he told me to go back to the ENT. I waited 3 damn weeks with panic attacks and anxiety while stumbling around at work and with pressure on my head and bouncy vision. All so that the ENTs assistant would be the one to see me. Took an audiogram and passed it no problem. The assistant said there was nothing about my previous audiogram that would show Menieres and I didnt have the classic vertigo attacks so she chalked it up to allergies and sent me back to my GP.\n\nGP prescribed me meds for allergies. I went 6 weeks and 3 return trips to the doctor with no relief of symptoms. \nI get a referral to another ENT. One MRI later no answers. Clearly this ENT is only interested in sinus stuff. Tells me it will go away on its own.\n\nI hear about vestibular therapy through a friend and start seeing a physical therapist. She has hard time diagnosing me the first few times with goggles but then sees a nystagmus. She lowered my dizziness about 50 percent of what it was over the course of a month with maneuvers and vestibular exercises.\n\nShe doesnt see anymore nystagmus and clears me and convinces me my symptoms are all residual. I leave. An entire month has passed while I am losing my mind. I turn my head different directions and feel a spell hit me. Again, no wild vertigo, just dizzy signals that are basically starting to hurt. Headaches, throbbing left eye. No end in sight. I can barely work and I cant watch my daughter as per me and my ex wifes agreement so she is currently seeing her the most. My depression and anxiety is eating me alive. I start to convince myself this is the end of my life. Since no physician seems to care and I have no support at home then there is really no reason for me to continue on. \n\nI find another physical therapist ag the same facility. Shes slightly more personal in her treatment. I tell her all my symptoms and she goes over all the tests shes going to do. As soon as she puts on the goggles she immediately sees nystagmus and says its definitely BPPV. So she performs maneuvers, schedules more appointments. I have been there a total of 5 times with my new physical therapist and each time theres a new nystagmus, a different maneuever, and send you on your way feeling like absolute shit and have to wait another 3 or 4 days or sometimes a week. I will say something changes each time. But anyone and everyone I have talked to has had theirs successfully fixed wothin a few sessions and are living normal lives. Performing the maneuvers on themselves even. And I try to be polite and ask WHY IS THIS STILL HAPPENING and the only answer I get is that I still have crystals out of place. I cannot get a clear answer of what is going on. So I made an appointment with an ENT out of area on my insurance of course, that specializes.in balance and dizziness. This is 24/7 off feeling, tinnitus louder than usual, and driving me nuts. Its causing me to clench at night from the stress so I had to pay a lot for a mouth guard. \n\nI just needed to vent my story. This is ridiculous. If I am feeling this bad then why am I not being treated or held somewhere until this is resolved? This is like having a shoulder out of socket and uncomfortable pain and each session they try to get it in and if it doesnt, we will try again next time. Go about your day.\n\nAm I the only one suffering from this chronic dumbass condition and who do I have to kill to get some relief? It will not last forever mate.\n\nApparently \u201cvitamin d supplements\u201d help to keep bppv away. This may be something you may want to look into. Cheers It is been forever already. Idk what I am doing wrong. Being misdiagnosed for so long made it worse? I am done with this part of my life. I think one of the main issues with the vertigo is people do not understand. You may look and sound fine to other people but inside your dying. And no one seems to understand.\n\nMy research indicated that if it is bppv - that the earlier the epley maneuvor and whatever else maneuvor is performed - the better outcomes for bppv. Now you are having regular treatments, hopefully, it will not be too much longer until you start feeling human again.\n\n\n\nI feel for you mate. They did an MRI to clear any brain results ? It came back clear ? Yup. Nothing do you ever have bouts of nausea ? Can I also make a suggestion. . I am not a doctor nor am i telling you what to do , but talk to your doctor about trying lexapro , i am happy to hear your mri came back normal SSRI for BPPV? Please do not. I just so happened to come across this YouTube video and then thought about seeing your post. Maybe taking L-Lysine could help you? It is worth a shot. \n\n( Are you affected on one side or both?  It takes longer to resolve if you are affected in both ears.   My BPPV can sometimes several months to resolve with regular epley maneuvers by my PT.  However both of my ears are affected so we have to play a game of seesaw until both sides are resolved.   For several days after each session I cannot tip my head down (including looking down at my phone), bend over or move my head quickly.  I also have to sleep sitting up.  Finally if I follow all my instructions it will eventually clear.  If I have residual symptoms I have a series of eye and balance exercises to do to help my brain \u201creset\u201d.  I seem to be very sensitive to the symptoms and my brain will decide that \u201c this is the new normal\u201d even when the actual condition is resolved.   Usually BPPV is not something that is \u201ccured\u201d but a condition that is managed.   I was completely fine for over and then spending too much time in the dentists chair triggered it again.  I am in my third month this time around but it is slowly getting better.  Meclizine  may help you feel better to manage the symptoms. Well then what is the longest you have gone without symptoms? And how come no one has explained this properly to me. I wasnt told I couldnt look down. And how am I supposed to just live like this? Rest of my life feeling dizzy? That is grounds for suicide. I am sorry I had to edit my post.  Over a year was the longest but i think I would have still been ok if I had not had to get two crowns in a row in one month.  Remember this is positional.   So you need to tell your dentist that you have this and cannot be tipped upside down like that if they are working on your affected side.   During treatment I sleep sitting up with one of those u shaped travel pillows to keep my head from turning to the side for several nights.  It is also best if you can teach yourself to sleep on your back from now on as sleeping on your side can dislodge them. So basically I will get back to normal at some point? Because I have yet to get there. I feel like I am running into a lack of professionals or they see so many people. Why is this not considered alarming? I cant even have a drink to calm myself because it will triple my symptoms with half a cocktail. Try taking some meclizine and see if it helps you with some relief of the symptoms at least. You should get back to normal but it might take a while.   In the meantime limit your head movements/tilting.  Sleep upright.  Get treated and checked.  Take meclizine for dizziness and symptoms.   Do not try to treat it yourself until you are sure you know which ear is affected.  My PT does not consider me resolved until she can get a completely negative test on both sides three times in a row over a couple of weeks. I go to a Physical Therapist who specializes in nothing but BPPV and balance issues. The meclizine. You mean dramamine? What does that do besides prevent nausea. I have over the counter but no om has told me to take it. Idk how much and what exactly does it treat? Im literally at the end of my rope with my life and I am fighting to take it back but i cant. The dizziness makes me not want to move or leave the house anymore. I cannot enjoy anything or anyone Meclizine is the active ingredient in NON drowsy Dramamine.    Regular Dramamine is different .   You can but a bottle of generic meclizine cheap on amazon. I keep a bottle on hand and carry a few with me all the time just in case.  They are chewable.    The dose is one every 6 hours.  I only know they help me deal with the dizziness and nausea. But really you need to find a physical therapist who specializes in BPPV and balance issues to help you resolve this. That Is what I am seeing now. Idk how to tell the difference. She has the goggles and knows all the maneuvers and even has BPPV herself. But shes only told me once after the first treatment to stay sleeping on my back propped up. Nothing about bending over and definitely has not given me a timeline on WHEN I will get better. This is becoming very costly too. But I will pay anything to feel better. It is hard to know when you will get better. Everyone is different depending on how well the treatment goes, if both ears affected, what triggers it etc.  I am a side sleeper naturally so if I sleep on my affected side when it is active I can set myself back.  I progress faster if I sleep in our recliner every night with a travel pillow to stabilize my head.  That is just a trick my PT and I came up to help me specifically. Stay with your PT if you can. I went three times a week when it was bad and that made a big difference. I am very lucky that my PT is only about 7 minutes away.  I was amazed to find out that this is so common that this place has someone on staff that literally BPPV is all she does. Hi,\nNot a doctor but I have been through this shit:\n- Is there a dizziness clinic at a hospital near you?\n- How would you describe your anxiety (pre vertigo)? Any panic attacks or generalized anxiousness?\n- History of migraine? (You or family members) I have heard from my RMT that jaw massage can reduce tinnitus FYI. Something to look into! Well then how come can I cope with this? I am having a hard time. I have had no relief for 5 months. Onky been 2 months since diagnosis. And I am struggling with anxiety because I feel trapped in a broken body and no answers or relief. Its driving me insane. And my therapist is 45 minutes away with no one else nearby. So the stress level is up because I have PT appointments, in which I have to work around my work schedule which my boss hates, and then I need psychologist for anxiety which also is during the work week, and then a psychiatrist cause I am probably going to need some meds to calm me down. Not including any regular doctor visits. I mean wtf. Dizziness clinic at a hospital near me. The closest one is 30 minutes away that has that.\n\nAnxiety and stress before this happened was very high and I do have panic disorder which is in full affect. This vertigo does not come or go with my anxiety but much rather everything is amplified.\n\nNot much in the history of migraines. Occasional headaches until recently they were real bad 2 months ago. BPPV is a lifetime illness, bro. How do we cope? By checking in with our mental state and having a loving support system of family and friends who understand our illness. Depression and anxiety is a side effect of vertigo. Some patients take antidepressants along with their vertigo meds. Me, I have BPPV everyday. I have it 3 months straight, then it disappears, then returns when I lie in the wrong side of the bed! But I still go to work, horrible and nauseated but trying my best to focus on my purpose in life. I am 2 months since my last attack, 50% of the vertigo is gone, but I still have bad days.\n\nRight now, I just finished my VRT exercises and I am enjoying my time in our company outing. My faith and purpose are my antidepressants.\n\nYou need to find the motivation to live and fight BPPV brother. Stephen Hawking had cerebral palsy, Marie Curie is blind. Lebron James has BPPV too. You can do it! For your daughter.  :) I dont have this loving support system, bro. I am on my own with this. I am the one that is relied on to keep going and pay for everything. And you are telling me you have attacks? I am confused. \nI do not have attacks. \n\nAlso, yay, I am going to be nauseated and foggy headed with dizziness for the rest of my life is what you are saying. \n\nI want to play with my daughter without the fear of dizziness or feeling of being drained. \n\nNo therapist has said this is a permanent situation. Recurrent maybe but I pressed the therapist for what the goal was for the treatments, and she clarified 100 percent. So do not give me that bullshit. Telling me to live with it is me giving up. Fighting it means I keep getting treatment until I am normal again. Unless someone medically says this is a non treatable illness and I will have to live with dizziness, I dont believe anything you say.\nIn fact everything at the therapists office says we do NOT have to LIVE with constant dizziness. bro \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udcaa I would ask for an appointment at your local dizziness clinic because they have more tests than a physio/ENT to nail down your nystagmus pattern. \n\nNot sure if you are medicated for your anxiety? If not, I would recommend trying an anti anxiety (or antidepressant) drug because anxiety can take a small dizzy issue and amplify it, I do not entirely understand how or why but that a little tidbit given to me at the dizziness clinic. When my anxiety got under control I at least did not get vertigo as often or intensely! This is the first medication I have been on in a decade, I was pretty against taking something but now I realize it was a necessary part of my healing. Anecdotal  \u2014 but something to discuss with your doctors! If you are already medicated but still having panic attacks etc you might want to revisit this with a doctor re: drug and dosage? Not sure. \n\nThe migraine thing I asked because sometimes vestibular migraines can look a lot like BPPV but it is hard to pin down and is more nebulous. \n\nKeep a detailed diary of all of your vertigo episodes: duration, symptoms, time of day, any triggers (coffee, wine, lack of sleep, clenching of jaw?). \n\nTruthfully I do not know when your vertigo will settle but I sense a lot of people\u2019s symptoms calm down over time \u2014 so hang in there! I was definitely distraught when this started happening to me, but over time it is settling / easing in intensity. \n\nI have heard of vertigo that is caused by jaw/neck physiological problems so look into that avenue if you are clenching your jaw! Lots of muscles in there connected to your ears.\n\nI personally still do not have a diagnosis and going to a neurotology clinic early next year so my journey continues! My understanding and personal experience is that it is absolutely treatable with a return to compete normal if it is diagnosed and treated correctly.  However it is likely to return for most people at some point.  I was completely fine for over a year. No dizziness. Slept on my side. It was like it had never happened.    I never gave it another thought until it flared up again after the dentists appointment. Which My PT warned me about and said is a common trigger to be aware of.  How long it takes to resolve varies by person and the actual episode you are dealing with. Your anxiety and panic attacks may make that a little more complicated though. I do not know. The brain is a funny thing. Ya know what? Im okay if its treatable and may return at a later date. Its better than Menieres for sure. I just am begging for relief. Its not vertigo so much as it is quick dizzy spells with head movement. And being upright makes me my head hurt. Driving is the only thing that doesnt cause any episodes surprisingly. Thank god because that is part of my job My PT told me that it is super common to have no problem driving because your brain is so focused on the task at hand.  I can drive just fine too when it is active.   She has me do eye exercises that consist of  standing still and looking from one corner of the room to the other gradually increasing the speed for two minutes at a time three times a day.  Also up and down. It reminds the brain where what is stationary and what is moving I guess.   But you should consult with your PT to see if those are right for your situation and make sure you are doing them correctly.    Also once you learn how to figure out on your own which side is affected you can treat yourself if it reoccurs if it is not major event.  So at some point you will feel normal again and you will feel like you have some control back if it does reoccur.  Once I understood what I was dealing with and learned that I will eventually feel better I was less frightened and anxious.  I even went on a week long vacation to New Orleans with it active and managed it ok.    Things will get better for you I am sure.  Good luck. When I do feel better Im coming to give you a hug for that. Im going to best this Do you still have to sleep inclined when you are not in an episode. My first one lasted about 2 months and I am only now feeling normal. I still have to sleep at a slight incline as if I lay flat on my back...things start feeling kind of dizzy. I am just curious if this is just something I need to keep doing to help prevent it. Thanks! I naturally sleep on two pillows anyway. But once I have been back to normal for a couple of weeks my PT told me to go ahead and resume my normal routine.  It is best if you can learn to sleep on your back all the time but I am a natural side sleeper so I struggle with that. Thank you! I am a side sleeper too. Luckily I have trained myself to sleep throughout the night on my back. I bought one of those pregnancy \u201cU\u201d shaped pillows to help me from rolling on my sides. It is still not super comfortable bc I want to lay on my sides still lol Are we talking about sleeping sitting up basically? I have the best results sleeping in our reclining sofa. So no not exactly straight up, but definitely inclined.   I also have one of those pillows made to sit up in bed and read. And I will use that with a couple of pillows added. But I am short so I tend to just drift down and wind up not inclined very much.   So I find the recliner works best for me.  But be sure not to sleep on your affected side.  Never if possible. What do you do when this then prevents you from sleeping I have had a couple of medical issues that had me sleeping in the recliner so I just was already used to it.   So I do not really have any problems sleeping there. how do you survive mentally. MY wife is in tears almost every day, and its about all she can manage just going to work, coming home and grading some papers, then going to bed. she is on month 4 of this. i think what they meant is that its a lifetime condition. it will be recurring but not a constant. I am afraid I do not have much advice for you there.  I had semi retired and was working from home when this started. I do have a monthly deadline I have to meet but otherwise my time is my own thankfully.  So luckily I am able to manage this thing when I need to. actually an ssri for bppv is completely normal, many people get bppv when they are stressed and have high anxiety. There is also a condition called pppd which occurs after a significant dizzy episode such as bppv. So yes, ssri for bppv is totally reasonable, and this is coming from a person who has suffered from bppv for a year and is on an ssri. I cannot find any medical sources saying SSRIs would be commonly prescribed for BPPV. How ever, dizziness and vertigo can be caused by psychological factors such as anxiety and SSRIs can be useful - just the condition is not BPPV then. no youre not getting it, you can develop a condition if you get bppv which is called pppd and is actually still a vestibular disorder. SSRI cant treat bppv but they can help get a person back in a better headspace especially if they develop pppd afterwords.", "It could be more than one thing I had a very clear episode of bppv. They happen again from time to time but are more rare. I have also had dizziness, headaches, nausea, and nystagmus almost daily. So eerily similar to BPPV that I thought it was more attacks. \n\nFinally got into another ENT the other day. They think that it was both BPPV originally (based on Epley being an almost miracle cure), AND that I am dealing with vestibular migraines. I have a history of headaches, that I always thought were tension headaches. I have also had the occasional migraine. My dizziness usually comes with some photophobia and strangeness around light. \n\nGot some treatment for it and I hope it helps. We will see, but it is nice that a doctor says \u201chmmm, maybe it is not so simple.\u201d Got some more imaging scheduled to rule out more nefarious things. \n\nAnyway. Just sharing with a group that can probably relate to the frustrations of getting to a doctor that took the time to review my case and look through my medical history before simply jumping to a conclusion. Do not give up. It is been a year for me and I am hopeful to get some improvement soon.", "Woken up twice Hey guys \n\nJust wanted to know if anyone knew what was going on. I swear I have cervicogenic vertigo my neck always feels uncomfortable if it is like overused and I can get a little like imbalance but no like spinning or anything. \n\nBut 3 times in my life I have woken up in the middle of the night and my eyes involuntary move right and it lasts for like 10-20 seconds and it stops. If I roll over I can feel it or roll to one side. It is only ever happened 3 times in my life. Apart from that, I am normal and never ever get dizzy or vertigo. Only those two really minor parts. \n\nAny ideas ? Cheers Have a read through our ( but what you have described sounds like my experience with BPPV. \ud83d\ude42\n\nHope you find some answers soon! Best wishes on your journey toward recovery. \ud83d\udc4dhighly recommend reading the guide\ud83d\udc4d Currently in the same boat as you are. In fact i woke up with it happening an hour ago. What Is worse besides my vision moving side to side really fast is that I also get vertigo.  I get up from bed and im off balance. The only way to get it to stop is to drink some water, sit down with my head down in the dark and look at a bright screen. Goes away in a minute or two... I have had this happen like every month for the past year. I used to think its the way my head is positioned when I sleep like it is over extended backwards or something, but I think it may be caused by something else? I do not know... I get scared after an episode. Its strange because sometimes I am dreaming and I know I spinning so I jolt up in bed. I am so sorry you go through that. I get mine soooo rarely. Had maybe 2 in the last 3 years. And it stops really quickly, I get dizzy as well as involuntary eye movement. I find keeping my head still helps, I always end up falling back asleep like straight after. That is all I have had in my life. So you get them every month? I would maybe get that checked out. BBPV is the most common cause of vertigo and is possible in anyone. But it is very common for it to happen when lying down. As your crystals are at rest. I think mine could be cervicogenic Vertigo as well I always wake up in the strangest position as well! Idk. Could be dehydration? Do you drink lots? I also have a very stiff and sore neck the next day! Dunno if any of that helps. \ud83d\ude42 What is PMDD? Premenstrual Disphoric Disorder. Pretty much a much more intense version of PMS. IS that what this is?", "New to Subreddit Hi everyone - found this amazing subreddit today. Great support and discussion. I have been going through some of the older posts and reading up on BPPV.\n\nI have been seeing an ENT for about 6mo. now, had an MRI, and even spoken with a neurologist and no one has had any answers for me. I had another episode today (episodes occur frequently over 1-3 days about 2-3x per month). Not sure if I have BPPV though...\n\nDuring an episode, typically a head movement (bending over, shaking/nodding my head, even rolling my eyes) brings on the spinning/dizziness. My eyes cannot focus on one spot and seem to move back and forth like windshield wipers while I work to focus them. This lasts about 3-7min. Afterward, I am hit with nausea as my focus returns to normal. This is a full episode, and often on days with these I have symptoms where I can be staring at something and then I am hit with wave-like feelings of dizziness but only last 3-5 seconds (with about 3-4 waves in a row). \n\nLast night even I woke up in the midst of a full episode with my eyes unfocused and my head spinning...\n\nMy MRI was fine, my hearing was above average, and my ENT says my symptoms do not fit neatly into a \"vertigo box.\" I called him just now after my last episode seeking medication for either the vertigo or nausea. \n\nDoes this sound like BPPV? Am I on the right track? Sounds very similar to mine, although I found once I reduced my stress level I only get episodes a few times a year instead of the every 2-3 weeks I experienced at first.  I was also told I did not neatly fit into one diagnosis box though so sorry I cannot confirm that it is bppv, but that is my most likely diagnosis according to my doctor &amp; vestibular physiotherapist.  Interesting...how did you come to realize you were stressed/how did you reduce your stress level? I do not consider myself that stressed, however I am not sure how to even define my own level of stress (if that makes sense).\n To be honest it was hard to know I was stressing myself out while it was happening, it was something that I realized after the fact.  For me it was a combination or my work situation and planning my wedding, so just general life stress.  Reducing stress from wedding planning was easy, I got married and I was done with it!  The work stuff was a bit more difficult, I have an inherently stressful job, but I just tried to remind myself to leave work worries at the office, and stop worrying about it 24/7.  ", "Watching my mother with BBPV Hi all\n\nYesterday my mother experienced her second vertigo episode. Watching her go through with this was the most heart breaking, stressful and panic peaking period of my life. Im a 38 year old male and I brokedown and balled my eyes out several times during the day because of how helpless I was and watching her suffer so much. It felt much worse dealing with my father's death or any other major life changing stressful events in my life. It really breaks my heart to see so many people go through this .\n\nFor my mum, she says she gets a \"warning\" before the spinning room sensation starts. She can avoid the spinning sensation if she lays down, closes her eyes and stays still for a few hours. \n\nOn this occasion, there was no warning and the room span at 6am.. She called me at 8am because she felt cold from the sweat and was lying down without a blanket on the floor. I could feel the sensations of knee crumbling dread engulfing me and I cant imagine how scared my mum would have been.\n\nI suggested I try the Epley manuevre which I have been somewhat practicsing for this day but she wasnt really convinced. She was too scared to move even 1cm let alone go all the way to the bed to get into position.\n\nHalf of the battle I realised is convincing the patient to try to get into position because for them, the price they have to pay for getting into position is another intensified session of room spinning. \n\nAfter managing to convince her to do it, I performed the THEM and it felt like it worked. She had to vomit due to the \"price\" but felt ok afterwards. After 10 minutes, she moved her head again and it came with avengence. It felt like the sky was falling down around me. This is suppose to work? What is left that we can do? Did I do it wrong? How can I convince her to let me try again?\n\nWatching mum violently dry heave and then close her eyes in agony repeatedly for hours will haunt me for the rest of my life. \n\nI called an ambulance who took us to hospital but no one came to see her in her bed for like 4 hours. There is no threat to her life so I understand but god damn its soul destroying seeing her struggle and watching a bunch of nurses chat about non-work stuff around us and get annoyed when I ask for help.\n\nEventually, on my 5th Eply Manuerve, it was successful. Her spinning sensation stopped and the doc finally came to give her Stemitil and Fluids. This was at around 8pm if I recall correctly. We both just crashed into sleep until 11pm and got discharged.\n\nIn total, she was experiencing vertigo from 6am to 8pm - 14 hours. Not every minute was as intense. There were peaks but every moment was a moment she couldnt open her eyes. Every second was a battle for her.\n\nThat was yesterday. She seems fine today. Today I still feel this horrific sensation of dread all over my body. I constantly ask mum if shes ok. I panic seeing any discomfort on her face while she is sleeping. My body has this base level of anxiety, fear and sadness that wont go away. The world seems like a scary place and I feel scared to face it. Its fascinating to experience how much stress hormones can impact my outlook in life and thoughts.\n\nToday, I have repeatedly watched Epley Manuevre videos on youtube so becomes absolutely ingrained in me. Im going to watch the same videos every day for a while. The videos dont show the insane pressure youre dealing with when you need to do it. The mental cost of it failing and the resultant hesistancy of the sufferer. \n\nI really wish you all the very best. It truly breaks my heart to see the posts here of people going through this. Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Cant even sleep because my head is constantly replaying the images and worrying about how it might happen again I feel bad reading about how traumatic this was for both of you. BPPV is awful but the fact that you had success with the Epley is a positive thing. I have had three episodes of BPPV and was able to successfully resolve with the Epley all three times. In the years since my first episode I have learned how to cope better with knowing there is always the potential for this to come back. There are many tips in this community for managing, suggestions for ways potentially to help prevent and just a lot of people who know what your mom has gone through which means she is not alone. It is really nice that you are so concerned about your mom and willing to help her. You should be aware that there are more than one canal that a crystal can get loose in, and depending on which canal is involved a maneuver other than Epley would be needed. Your best bet is getting her an appointment with an ENT or a dizzy/balance center. If that is not on option do some research on BPPV and nystagmus, it might help you figure out which movement is best to try. You are an amazing son. Vertigo is such a debilitating and mysterious illness. As a 30-something, I have the body and the willpower to give myself Epleys whenever I get an attack. But I often worry about when I get older if I can still manage it on my own. Vertigo runs in the family, and my senior aunties often get hospitalized after attacks, much like what your Mom experienced.\n\nPrepare for future attacks by getting your Mom a dedicated ENT clinic that is always available. Also, I advise that she do walking exercises everyday (with someone to watch her of course), drink plenty of water, and avoid too much sodium and caffeine. One of my aunts also bought a small oxygen tank for herself, but I think it is more for calming her nerves than actually treating her vertigo.\n\nAnxiety and panic also comes with BPPV and worsens it. So I do my best to keep my life stress-free. You are very sweet, and I am sorry this has been so stressful for you. She is lucky to have you. \n\nWhat are her thoughts on all of this? What are some things she tells herself to get through it?\n\nI have had two long bouts of vertigo not BPPV-related (6 months and 3 months), and it is mentally and emotionally draining.  I know I have learned to appreciate my periods of good health. My thoughts are that if there is a chance you could wake up disabled, you should take advantage of the world while you can. Try to have meaningful experiences so that you can sort of live vicariously through your memories when you have to. On days where I have to keep my eyes closed, I have my partner set me up with a bunch of podcasts or audiobooks (and a bucket in case I throw up). \n\nAnyway, I guess my point is do not waste your life worrying about if/when the dizziness will start. It is good to be prepared, but I doubt your mother would want you stressing yourself out over something so unpredictable. Yes it is good to know the Epley and even better find a solid ENT. Do not waste your good days worrying about the bad. Thanks for the reply! Im very glad that those attempts worked for you! Yes I just figured that out now! I think the challenge is to figure out which canal it is when there is minimal nystagmus and I dont think the dix hallpike test is there to determine which canal it is - rather which side ear it is. So much to learn. Worst case scenario, Id probably do everything there is. I think the anxiety and panic are the unspoken villains in all this. I feel like my mother appears fine but I know she would do that anyway to make me feel ok. \n\nI remember being on a ride at a theme park and even 30 seconds of the dizziness was like torture. Imagine this for minutes / hours. Thank you for your reply. She appears to be not worried at all. She knows that I was really affected by all this so I think she is putting on a non chalant indifferent act to make me feel at ease because I am asking her every hour if she is ok. \n\nIm glad you have a partner who can be there beside you. One thing I learned from all this is how important emotional support was.\n\nYeah, I will try not to worry. As time goes by, I suspect it will get less and less. It can be so tricky! My last bout started with the crystal in one canal and then after a while it was in the other canal. I am lucky enough to live in an area with a dizzy/balance center and they were able to treat it although it took a few visits. You are right about the dix hallpike test showing which side it is. Your best bet with the nystagmus might be to record it while it is happening, maybe you can slow down the recording or zoom in? Anyway, it is really awesome that your willing to help your mom out. Yes indeed. I had an attack that lasted for 3 months. I was so scared to stand up and move because I felt like I was in a rocking boat. But my ENT told me to mentally get over it because the BPPV will only disappear once I start moving. So, little by little every day, I did VRT exercises (kind of like physical therapy but for balance) and returned to work. Nowadays I only experience BPPV for an hour at the most, because I do the Epleys immediately. Once I got an attack while at the mall. I stopped, held my father's hand, and continued to walk until my brain re-balanced itself.\n\nBBPV is really tough emotionally and mentally. But what got me through is joining BPPV communities like the one here and on Facebook. Reading the experiences of people from all around the world, what they have done to cope, and the success stories they have while still living a dizzy life is empowering. Hello!\nCan you please share the name of the facebook group? Does the elpey always work for you when you do it by yourself? VERTIGO SUPPORT GROUP:(\n\nBPPV AND VERTIGO WARRIORS:(\n\nDIZZY VERTIGO LIFE:( It works after 5-6 attempts and waiting for an hour after that for the dizziness to die down.  \n\n\nBut... I do not think my normal sense of balance has not returned 100% since my first attack years ago- my \"new normal\" everyday feeling ranges from riding in a boat to a little bit of heavy feeling around the head/sinuses. For me, this is fine because I can still ride a bike, drive a car, and exercise. I just avoid spinning around or tilting my head a certain way. Thanks for the reply!I did the epley myself  last night and today when i woke up..it worked i think! No more spinning but Im lightheaded which is expected and the part I hate the most!! Tired of this heavy head feeling and feeling like im walking on a boat. I know it gets better in time but then i get another bppv attack and the vicious cycle continues. I too can drive and work around my home n do stuff but with a varying degree lightheadedness and i just miss my old head \ud83d\ude05 Same...I feel ya. Oh, to be able to dance ballet-style and do headstands is what I miss the most. But what is important is that we still get to function in our society.", "Question about which side is affected Hi folks, this has not been a fun 24 hours but good to see others have similar experiences and have had good results with the Epley maneuver. I went for a swim two days ago, felt great, then shaved and showered yesterday and used a Q-tip for the first time in a while, felt fine. A few hours later in the evening I started to just feel like my balance was off, then started to get some random dizziness. Thought maybe my blood sugar was just low or dehydrated or something, so I ate and had some water, felt a little better for a while but still just off.\n\nI went to sleep thinking it would be gone in the morning, but it was still there when I woke up. I went to the bathroom, came back to bed, laid down and rolled over and all of a sudden got very dizzy. Most dizziness yet and felt like I might pass out. I did not but it took a while to subside. I looked into the causes and found out about BPPV. So I have seen some of the YouTube videos on the Epley maneuver but I am not totally sure which ear is likely affected. I think it is my left ear because that feels like it could be slightly irritated but it was nothing I noticed until really focusing on it today while reading up and I can talk myself into it being either one.\n\nI tried to evaluate earlier by doing the test, lying down on my bed with a pillow under my back. Turning my head to the left, I did have some dizziness but nothing major. I sat up and still had a bit more dizziness. I then did it again turning my head to the right this time. It was not too much dizziness while lying down, but when I sat up it was then extremely severe sitting up straight, the most that I have had. I have been dizzy since and my balance has been very off. So does this mean that it is actually my left ear? That maybe turning to the right afterwards could have moved the crystals back into a bad spot on the left side? I do not want to try to test again for a while because it sounds like you should not do it again too soon afterwards?\n\nDoes anyone know if this would indicate one side or the other, having that severe of a reaction after sitting up straight after turning to the right side? Thanks! How long did you stay laying back?  Sometimes it takes a bit (perhaps up to a minute) for the vertigo/dizziness to hit. I have always gone right into the Epley maneuver after laying back if the vertigo hit. But, it would only make sense that if you laid back, then sat back up, another wave of vertigo would hit, since you are changing positions again and the crystal is moving back to it is starting point in your inner ear canal.\n\nI am feeling like it might be your right ear, since that is the side you had a severe reaction with. This movement is called the Dix Hallpike (it is essentially the first step of the Epley).  The main reason you would not want to do the Epley a ton of times, is that if you have a successful Epley and get the crystal back up around your ear canal, you do not want to risk it falling back into the semi-circular canal.  Doing the Dix Hallpike (just laying back) a few times is not going to hurt anything, as you are only rocking that crystal back and forth part way around your ear canal.\n\nI would not hesitate to try the right ear again - and see if you get the severe vertigo when laying back. If you do - wait it out, then continue with the rest of the Epley maneuver.\n\nThere is a chance it is something else. Or the crystal could have moved into a different ear canal. There are a lot of factors at play and nothing is 100% (lots of variables). I am not an expert, but am just giving advice with what the 'majority' have experienced.\n\nFYI - when I would do the Epley on my effected side, the severe vertigo would strike initially when laying back (it sometimes took up to 20 seconds to hit). Then it would hit again after all the movements and I sat back up - it was the worst when I sat back up.\n\nHopefully others will chime in on their experiences and what they think. Thank you for this info. I did the Epley last night as if my right side was the affected side. I did feel more dizziness after sitting up and did not feel much relief last night, but I was able to get a full night of sleep and I woke up feeling somewhat better. It is definitely still with me but it is like the dial has been turned down from an 8 to a 5. I also slept on my left side the whole night (I am usually a flat on my stomach sleeper) and that does make me think it is the right side affected because it probably would have caused more dizziness if my left ear were the bad one and it was tilted downwards for the whole night, right?\n\nBut my head definitely feels clearer today even though the swaying is still with me. I do not totally know yet if it is lessening or if maybe I am just getting used to it but it feels like it is gotten better.\n\nI am going to try the Epley again in a few minutes on the right side and continue to go from there.", "Lasting dizziness I have had bppv for a few years, earlier i never really knew what it was because i did not see A doctor, and it always went away after a few days.\nIn january I got it again but it got worse and worse so i went to a doctor and got the diagnosis. It lasted for 9 days. And i have been dizzy ever since, but now it is like i am on a boat and not a carousel, it does not make me sick like the spinning does so i have been back at work. This tuesday i got another \u00abattack\u00bb with spinning, went to the doctor and she did the epley and i have been doing home exercises. Today (sunday) i woke up and the spinning was gone, but i still have the rocking sensation. Is this normal? Is it residual dizziness? Or can it be another crystal in a different canal? My doctor was very unhelpful. What do i do? My experience. Been doing Epley at home since my vertigo attack 2 weeks ago. My Epley movements still produce nystagmus and then after I have disequilibrium, so I do the exercises at night. During the day my balance feels off and it feels like my movements are not sharp. It is possibly you have something in another canal but the doctor should be able to diagnose where it is. Having lived with this on and off for 6 years, here is my advice. \n\n1) Read the historic posts in this sub, lots of solid information posted.\n2) book in to see a PT\n3) residual dizziness is \u201cnormal\u201d and with exercises you can work to fixing this. What is a PT? What type of exercises do you mean , may I know? PT - physical therapist.  Or a vestibular therapist (I found mine in a physical therapy department.) It could be in a different canal, I had the moving on a boat feeling when that happened to me. If you have the option of a dizzy/balance center around you that is the best option, a lot of general practice doctors do not have a lot of experience with BPPV. Vestibular rehabilitation may include:\n\nAdaptation exercises to coordinate the vestibular ocular reflex (VOR). A properly functioning VOR allows you to keep visual targets in focus even when your head is moving. There are several types of adaptation exercises.\n\nGaze stabilization exercises involve moving your head while keeping your eyes focused on a target. For the exercises to work, you must move your head as quickly as you can while looking at the target. It is normal to get a little dizzy or miss the target every now and then.\n\nTarget shooting exercises involve keeping your head still while moving the eyes, or vice versa.\nHabituation exercises designed to reset the sensitivity of the nervous system. They help your brain get used to and ignore movements or situations that make you feel dizzy. This is done through repeated, controlled exposure to signals such as complex patterns and busy environments. You may do exercises indoors and outdoors. You may go on short trips to places that trigger symptoms, such as grocery stores or shopping malls.\n\nBalance retraining exercises are done by standing on different surfaces and with increasingly narrow bases of support. They are helpful for improving steadiness to perform activities of daily living as well as to lower the risk of falling.\n\nBalance exercises done with eyes closed. These help reduce dependence on your eyes for balance by encouraging the use of the vestibular system (inner ear balance structures).\n\nStrengthening exercises to improve muscle support of your body.\n\nGait training, for example treadmill training and learning to walk over unstable surfaces.\nRange of motion exercises if you have been limiting movement of your head of body to minimize dizziness.\n\nLearning and practicing strategies to deal with or prevent your symptoms.\nBreathing and relaxation exercises, which help to regulate the autonomic nervous system.\nWalking and other aerobic activities.\n\nIt is VERY important to start exercises gradually and increase them slowly and steadily. Do not \"push through\" symptoms. This was really helping , thanks You are welcome.

I know you feel like shit now, but it will get better in time (very) small things that might help - are you drinking enough water, cutting down on salt?  eating healthy?\n\nthat majority of it is like the other poster said - time.  but i notice if i am treating my body like shit bppv gets a little worse. I still have it, two months in.. \ud83d\ude14 Interesting, do headphones make it worse? Interesting, do headphones make it worse? thank you for your concerns, but is earphones ok to wear? yea I realized, if I do not sleep properly the next day is not fun at all for me, they regressed the dizzines so horribly, to the point that I almost went back to square one. my doctor advised me to not aggravate my ears, and stop using headphones, and holy shit within a week I got much better. I am 100% sure they are the main reason I got this horrible affliction to start with! I used to listen to audio books for hours daily without stop, for years! I cannot see how they are different. trust me, I could not live without them. I am that guy who always wears his headphones all the time everywhere d: It was really really hard thing for me to do, but cannot argue with the results! that shit bppv, vestibular neuritis whatever it is called, scares the shit out of me! I gave up using headphes because I was REALLY desperate! give it a try for a week at least. best of luck to you. I really hope you get better thanks man I appreciate your help! It is interesting you say this!!! I JUST read today that in-the-ear devices might be to blame sometimes for dizziness/vertigo\u2026 our ears need to breathe and we might be messing up some of our body\u2019s use for earwax \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f :\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading up to my attack last winter, I was wearing my earbuds daily for several hours (6-10), six or seven days a week while working and studying; sometimes I would listen to a guided meditation to fall asleep and wake up with them still in my ears halfway through the night, too. I stopped using them for months after the initial attack\u2014 but started back up a week ago for just a couple hours a day and here I am, dealing with dizziness again (just posted about it, actually). \n\nI love my earbuds but I think I need to give them up. \u2639\ufe0f I can no longer play games too \u2639\ufe0f this is just sad Just one epley maneuver rarely does the trick for me. I do them on my own whenever it gets bad, sometimes multiple times in a row. Hope you feel better soon do you do the epley maneuver to get rid of the spinning sensation or the dizziness? Both? I only get the spins when I dip my head or something and usually goes away after a few minutes of stability. Even during the epley and you should wait for the spinning to stop for each position change. If it does not you should probably go see the doctor again I would go back to the PT if you can! That was the only thing that really relieved any of my vertigo after about a year and a half when I do the eply maneuver I do not feel the dizziness  during the process anymore. Maybe only a bit after the manuver I feel a little dizzy, but idk if that is because the crystal in my head is being put back to place or other reasons. Wow, I will definitely try that as well. It takes time..it is been 5 months for me now and the residual dizziness is not totally gone yet but much much better than before..doing things normally again ..try to be as active as you can and do vestibular rehabilitation if the spinning vertigo has subsided Not sure if this will help but mine was due to an ear infection as soon as i got medication for the ear infection it started to clear up. was your ear hurting at that moment because I am not really experiencing any pain from my ear. also just a random question, how do you listen to music now? Do you just use a speaker? are you able to exercise again? Like running, playing sports or going to the gym? do you still feel the vertigo or just the dizziness? Well i do not go to the gym as i dont have time LOL, but i can walk at malls fine now and supermarkets and actually enjoy it, supermarkets were scary for me but they r enjoyable errands now! i have tried running around the house and it felt fine too..i am waiting for the weather to be be cooler where I live so I can go on walks and runs by the sea cuz exercising  is really good for people who have had vertigo or dizziness. The point is what you are going through will keep getting better even if it seems to you like you will never get better cuz i was in the exact same place at 1 month and 2 months! Now im feeling much better, happier, can think about happy things and make plans with my family and friends..so from someone who has been in your exact place and doubted recovery at first everyday, you will get better! Do not worry and let your brain do its thing. Sometimes people need to do the epley maneuver twice, according to what I have heard. When I had bppv a while back, we actually did a left side epley maneuver and a right side version, too, and I got better fairly quickly, it was like 2/3 days or so when I became fully planted again. Now I am not recommending you do both sides, but just remember to talk with your PT a little more to see. painfully, yes! I use speakers all the time now! the problem my ears were not used to them, so i had a problem understanding anything said! I know it sounds stupid! but i have been using headphones all my life! took me a month to get comfortable ... added bonus, stopped asking people to repeat what they said all the time d: Both.

I have been a sufferer of BPPV since 2007 but have \"only\" suffered 8-10 actual vertigo episodes. The remainder of my symptoms has been low-grade balance issues, and in particular a feeling that I am going to pass out while driving curvy roads (or fast deceleration), which causes G-force disturbance. I have never passed out, but there is a sensation that I am going to lose consciousness that is very scary; I have attributed it to anxiety and have since avoided driving.\n\nDriving long distances has also had the effect of making me wake up throughout my sleep in fits of terror. I am not sure if the BPPV is to blame but I have logged this and it does seem to correlate highly with driving long distances. Has anyone had similar symptoms? Or know if there are other online communities that could help? Thanks much in advance. I definitely get those \u201cpass\u201d out feelings a lot. But it is not driven by g-force. It can happen while I am just walking along... feels like what I imagine a blood pressure drop would be like.

I started having dizzy spins last Christmas during a family trip. I thought I was going to fall back to my right, and I thought it must be because I skipped meals that afternoon. Went away after I ate.\n\nFast forward to four weeks later, I am still treating it. Went to several doctors to have it checked, and they would rule out it is vertigo.

Does anyone have this kind of experience?", "Low Light - Residual Dizziness Hi there! I had BPPV that was treated as \u201callergies and fluid on the ears\u201d for 8 weeks until a different doctor saw Nystagmus in my eyes and treated me for BPPV - I have been dealing with residual dizziness since being cured of the BPPV and it has gotten better, some days are better than others.... I had PT yesterday and today has been a rough day. My question is if anyone has experienced worse residual dizziness in low light or ambient light.... I have searched through this thread and could not find anything pertaining to that and my PT is kind of perplexed too - If anyone else has experienced worsening RD due to indoor lighting please let me know.... It would really help ease my mind - Thank you in advance! Darkness and low light is not my friend.  In fact, I had to sleep with a light on for many months.  And watching TV in low light - not fun. My PT explained it as your eyes/brain having to focus harder in low light, which triggers the gaze instability part of the recovery.  She explained it better - but I cannot remember all of it. Thank you so much for your reply.... It makes me feel better - I have not been able to find anyone who was having the same low light problem as myself. My PT did a pupil dilation test to make sure it was not something with my eyes and my pupils reacted normally. The anxiety has been so bad with this and of course when I start googling it suggested my eye problems could be from MS which heightened my anxiety more.... Did your low light problem eventually get better? Thank you again! Mine did eventually get better.  I made it through the darkness of the winter months (less sunlight), and now am finally past most of it. There is a light at the end of the tunnel!!!! (pun intended!)  And I am no expert - but I did for sure experience what you are saying.  And I found great relief with my therapist explaining it to me. I know my husband likes to watch TV in the dark, and it would send me into orbit. I would always turn a light on, and he would get irritated, which then made my anxiety go crazy. It is a vicious circle. Try to reassure yourself that it is just your body adjusting again....and hopefully that will ease your anxiety. The anxiety just feeds any of this yucky stuff. Not sure if this is the same, but I have had light sensitivity and vision focus issues since my severe vertigo episodes about a month ago.  Is it just dizziness or other vision issues? Thank you for replying.... It feels like my eyes cannot focus and it makes me feel almost like I am out of it.... It is so hard to explain! I had a hard time with low light.  In pt we did a lot of work with my eyes closed, as my whole balance system was off so when your eyes cannot give feedback to your brain the dizziness is worse.  Mine has gotten better.  I am 6 months from initial bppv. Thank you so much for this.... Can I ask you how the low light made you feel? My PT had me do some exercises in a low lit room and some with my eyes closed.... I felt pretty good yesterday but today it almost feels like I am worse - Is that normal after PT? I am not sure what to expect because it was my first session. Yup, been there. Give it time, it will go away. Just know that the problem is not permanent, no reason to get anxious about it or obsess over it. And make sure you go about your normal day. I believe it is a stressed vestibular system and it just needs time to rebound.\n\nBut you are not alone! Yes that is normal.  The exercises push you and over time you will come back to baseline quicker.  I did a lot of standing with eyes closed, looking up, down, side to side and tip head each way.  Some slow 20 seconds each position and then faster.  Once I could do that also did them standing on a piece of foam. Thank you so much for the info - You do not know what a help you have been and have helped my anxiety! It will get better.  Be patient with your body and try to accept where you are each day.  I still have days that are worse.  It takes your brain some time to adjust, but if you work on it and steadily challenge yourself this will not last forever.  Let me know how you are doing! Low light is difficult for me too. The first time I noticed was a week or so out from my first episode. My husband and I were walking the dogs at dusk and I almost felt buzzed or high. Another trigger is scrolling on my phone in a dimly lite room. BPPV is so confusing. You are not alone!  I explain it as being buzzed. A little brain fog and kind of out of it when in dim lighting. Yes that is exactly how it feels!!!! Did yours improve and if so how long did it take? I am still having some brain fog but would estimate about a month to 6 weeks to be rid of daily issues. Im feeling dizzy as i type this in a room with low light and i cant help it since I am here for work! I havent gone to neurologist yet so idk what is happening to me. I was cleared in ophtha and ENT too. This is making my anxiety worse! Everyone told me that over time it does get better and they were right\u2026. The best advice I can give is to not let it control your life\u2026. Feel it and then try to ignore it and you will notice that week by week it is a little less - I promise you that it does get better! Being outside and also VOR exercises helped me tremendously\u2026.

May be Covid related I just started having vertigo several days ago. It comes and goes, but sometimes it gets really bad. Yesterday I had a telehealth appointment and told the Dr that I thought it might be Covid related since I was hospitalized for covid pneumonia last month for 10 days. He said that he had 3 other patients who had post Covid vertigo and that since it effects the nerves in the nose and mouth it could effect the nerves in the ears as well. He prescribed meclizine (which I have only taken 2 doses of so far and I cannot really tell if it is helping). This is just really frustrating. I have experienced vertigo once before many years ago and it eventually went away. Ask your doc to refer you to a vestibular therapist ASAP.  Very helpful.  \n\nI did not like meclizine.

This is turning your head to the left or right (depending on which side you are testing) at a 45 degree angle (not quite to your shoulder), and then laying back quickly with your head extended past your shoulders slightly (by putting a pillow under your shoulders or hanging your head off the bed). You need to lay back quickly.  Sometimes the vertigo does not happen right away.  It may be delayed a few seconds. This is also called the Dix Hallpike maneuver.  The nystagmus (direction your eyes are twitching) also helps determine which canal is effected. You probably already know this - but I am just going over it in case I touch on something new.  Have you tested both sides?\n\nFor me - the vertigo presented twice during each full Epley.  It was initially upon laying back, and then it always happened again upon sitting back up (this is technically the last step to the Epley - where the crystal makes it around the top of the canal and settles. Sitting back up needs to be done correctly as well.  It took 20 times of doing the Epley with a therapist (over the course of 2 months) for my crystal to settle correctly.\n\nIt is possible that a different canal is effected and it would require a maneuver different than the Epley.  Are you able to see a vestibular/dizzy specialist to have them correctly test you and watch your eye nystagmus to properly diagnose and make sure you are doing the right maneuver? I guess I will give that a shot! I do the Maneuver at home, either by myself or with the help of a family member. so I guess it is possible I do not do it correctly? \nI guess I just worry that it is not BPPV or something else that is causing the dizziness. But it generally only happens when I turn my head a certain way (especially up and back) I am sure you have already done this - but Google Dix Hallpike and watch a few videos (same with Epley).  Sometimes you will find a better explanation and guide - or one that makes better sense.  A gal posted a self video here a while back of her own Dix Hallpike. It showed the nystagmus well. Good luck to you! It is a huge dose of NO FUN.", "Residual dizziness, malaise and brain fog for a week, is this normal? Went to bed last Sunday and listened to an audio book for maybe an hour. When I turned over to turn it off vertigo and nausea hit like a freight train.\n\nFought the nausea and did not move until I fell asleep and waking up Monday the vertigo was gone, but some nausea and dizziness remained. Saw my doctor on Wednesday and I felt pretty good after spending the whole week laying down and sleeping, and she was pretty sure it was BPPV.\n\nWent to work on thursday and felt miserable, and on Friday I was dizzy to the point I felt and walked like I would drank a bottle of wine. Ended up going home early and sleeping most of the day. By Saturday I was feeling both poorly and panicky, mostly over the brainfog/cognitive effect I would felt at work that I went to the ER. They still felt it was BPPV but suggested I contact my GP for a possible MRI referral. They tried to induce it by throwing me onto my sides but the vertigo is gone and its just the residual effect it seems. \n\nDoes this sound normal? Vertigo was awful, and I loathe throwing up to the point I will fight it to the bitter end, but the way I feel now scares me more than the sudden onset did a week ago. I had exactly this recently. This was my second round of vertigo. \nI did eply myself at home which cleared the vertigo but the residual dizziness stay about a week.\nIt was uncomfortable and annoying but it did subside after about 5/6 days. Assuming the room was spinning when you turned over it is most likely BPPV.  By the way - do you recall which way you turned over?? was it towards the left or right?  That will tell you wich side \\ most likely has loose crystal\\\n\nGive the Half Somersault Maneuver a try as it seems easier to do than epley.\n\n(\n\nYou are going to feel nausea but this will help get the crystal out of your ear. You will have residual dizziness for up to a few weeks after the episode. I myself know exactly how you feel after I had BPPV in January. I went to the ER and did the whole 9 yards. It gets better over time. I made the mistake by not listening and spent quite a bit on seeing other doctors and such. When I saw a physical therapist the epley did not trigger it. I dealt with residual dizziness for a few months until my doctor prescribed me Flonase, and he instructed me to get some generic Allegra and do a sinus rinse once a day. Also he said to auto inflate which is holding your nose and trying to blow out, which will cause your ears to pop. I did this for 6 weeks and for the most part I do not have any issues anymore. But basically over time you will get better Ooo I am going to try Flonase! I thankfully have not felt nauseous when my vertigo or residue dizziness. Definitely see an ENT or maybe your GP can give you a referral for PT. Some places do not take prescriptions for it. I hope you feel better soon! The residual dizziness is yucky and gross in a totally different way than active BPPV/Vertigo.  Just as you described.  I will keep my fingers crossed for you that it goes away quickly! I had it super bad for months, and it took almost 8 months to completely go away. Well....I still have small bouts of it - but it is not near as bad as it was for the first few months.  My vestibular therapist (dizzy specialist) gave me a bunch of exercises to do, to help the residual go away quicker. (Google vestibular exercises, or gaze stability (instability) exercises).  You basically want to challenge the dizziness to help your body get used to being back in balance.  It seems a lot of people only deal with the residual dizziness for a week or so though and it goes away on it is own.  Do not let the anxiety get to you either - as truly it somehow feeds the residual dizziness.  Again - my vestibular therapist was a god send in helping reassure me and get me through my months of residual. Called my doctor today and got an appointment for tomorrow, a little checkup and a blood draw to check for infections she said.\n\nWhat really sucks is I feel I cant sit in front of the computer without feeling worse, was well into Cyberpunk when this hit and cant even game to pass the time. Super late but thanks for the info. Doctor told me I have bppv in my left ear. Have tried the epley and nothing happens. I do not feel like Im dizzy as much as just an uneasy feeling. Unfortunately mine was lasting for 10-12 hours for a long time and has occurred every day for the last 2 months. Scheduled to have an eeg on Thursday, will try a nasal spray in the meantime to see if it helps. Yeah I did all of that, I had residual dizziness for awhile as I stated before. I went as far as getting an echocardiogram done since I work at a hospital, I only had to pay $25 which is awesome considering the test is very expensive. But try Neil med sinus rinse, using distilled water, and Flonase. Also I find that auto inflating (hold your nose closed and and blow out your nose until your ears pop) works very well. Just do not auto inflate after a sinus rinse as you will force air into places you should not. But it will get better over time. I spent lots of money trying to make it better but honestly time is the best medical terminology anyone could give me which they were correct lol. But hopefully you get better soon! I appreciate it! I work at a hospital as well, so hopefully tests will not be too expensive. I guess another thing that king of worries me is this started about 2 weeks before I tested positive for covid, so not sure if it is related or what. Had never had problems with dizziness before, but have lot of ear infections in the past especially after relocating from Florida to North Carolina. Might just be a need for daily antihistamine and continuous nasal spray. Thanks for your help, hopefully it resolves. Glad you are doing better", "Suffered BPPV for 6 months! This home exercise got rid of it. :)  What test was done to test for horizontal canal vertigo?  I know my therapist did many on me - but I do not remember which tests were for which canal.  Or was it the direction of the nystagmus during the Dix Hallpike?\n\nAlso (sorry for all the questions), when you do this maneuver, does it provoke the violent 30ish seconds of vertigo in some positions?\n\nSo happy you found out what was specifically wrong and was able to treat/fix it! Hurrah!  My PT ran through a bunch of different exercises until one hit the symptoms.", "Please help In February (about 8 months ago) I had a really bad virus that lasted for about two weeks and this was before covid was a wide spread thing.  After this I started to have what I think is vertigo or BPPV but I am not sure. My sister has been hospitalized for her vertigo but it was always caused by movement. In March it started getting more intense. I would just be sitting on my bed not moving and all of a sudden it felt like someone was pulling my head sideways super fast but I was sitting still. The room would start spinning like I was on a boat in the middle of a hurricane. I would feel nauseous and sometimes shaky and sweating. These episodes last anywhere from 1 minute to 3 hours then just stop. I do not know when they are about to come on there are no tells. It started happening while I was driving and scared the shit out of me and made me me super anxious to drive. Since covid started my life has been extremely stressful so that might contribute to what I am feeling but I constantly hear ringing in my ears and white noise and they will hurt or I will partially loose hearing. Ive had ear problems since I was young I had tubes and constant ear infections but never anything like this. I have also felt completely dissociated. I do not know who I am anymore. My coordination is off and I feel disconnected from reality. I have seen an ENT, neurologist had an EEG and an MRI and everything came back okay. I have tried heating pads and have been prescribed anitvert and I take it daily but will still get dizzy. It comes and goes in to particular pattern. If anyone knows anything about this or something that can help please let me know. You poor thing. I can sympathise with vertigo as I have had balance / dizzyness issues on and off for 6+ years. The big culprit has been BPPV which as the acronym states, is driven by head positioning. What you have described does not sound like BPPV but possibly M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease however since you have had all these test you would think the professionals could help you. \n\nIn saying that in my quest over the 6 years I have seen so many specialists and had so many tests and I come back with perfect results with the doctors saying - \u201cit is just anxiety\u201d... \n\nHave you been to a dizzyness / balance clinic? I found that while I went to a lot of doctors it was not until I went to a specialist balance clinic that I started to get some help. All of the dizzy clinics are in Ontario but I live in Michigan. I wish someone could tell me what was going on and why this was happening so it could be fixed. Sometimes viruses can attack the inner ear and cause Vestibular Neuritis or Labyrinthitis  that take a while to get better. Is your vertigo positional? If not, I would look into these.  Physical therapy and vestibular rehabilitation can help. I would definitely see a dizzy clinic.\n\nFeel better love!xx If you have BPPV which you can self diagnose it will cause the vertigo by doing some basic head movements ie lying down, rolling over in bed, looking up at the sky. \n\nWhen the vertigo starts, it will cause the room to spin and your eyes to beat uncontrollably which is called nystagmus.\n\nThe beating and the spinning can be frightening and most people panic (I know I do). To stop the spinning you can  move your head back to a neutral position or you can stay in that position and the vertigo will subside after 15-30 seconds.\n\nIf the above sounds like you, then there is loads of information on the internet (and historic posts in this sub) to diagnose the ear and which canal that needs to be treated.\n\nFor me - I had an episode of BPPV (2nd one in 6 weeks \ud83d\ude14)3 weeks ago, freaked out, went to the PT that specialises in vertigo and they performed the test and the moves. I was not a straight forward case and after 3 sessions and then leaving it for a week I can happily say I feel 90% better. \n\nIn the past I went to a lot of doctors, paid a lot of good money, had a lot of tests ie MRI, CT, blood, etc and was left feeling hopeless as the doctors all said \u201cthere is nothing wrong, just live with it\u201d. \n\nIt was not until I went to a clinic that specialised in these disorders that I finally started to get some answers and the anxiety / stress / fear of it all started to ease.\n\nQuick google shows a number of venues in Michigan that specialise in vestibular thereby. - I would start there. Had exactly what you are experiencing. Saw a few specialists and nothing cured me. Then I saw Dr. Mango and since then have not had any issues whatsoever (knock on wood). \n\nI know you are in MI, but if you could find an excuse to visit SoCal if only to visit Dr. Mango I would. Otherwise, ask him to recommend someone in the greater MI area. \n\n Schedule an appointment with an ENT and get a hearing test. You want to rule out M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease. \n\n Thank you so much for this, mine happens once to 3 times a week. It is so frustrating Sorry I am so late to this I saw an ent and all the tests came back perfect Do you remember which tests they performed on you? Are you still feeling dizzy or getting vertigo?", "Do I have BPPV? Three days ago, I was laying on my bed, then jerked my head back and to the left to check the time on my clock and the room started spinning. I figured I would just moved my head at the right angle to mess up my inner ear fluid and that it was a one time thing.\n\nExcept, each morning since then, the room has started to spin for a few seconds when I am getting up from sleep. It is already to the point where I am freaked out when turning my head.\n\nIs this BPPV? Should I go to the doctor? Should I first try this \"Epley maneuver\" I keep reading about?\n\nHelp me out, folks. I am freaking out. A week ago, I could do somersaults with no problem. It is possible of course, but the important thing is... It is effecting you on a daily basis and keeping you from being able to do what you normally could. That,  alone,  is good reason to see a doctor.\n  I will say this...and this is only my opinion! Others may reasonably disagree.... But I would say DO NOT attempt ANY maneuver whatsoever,  until you have seen a doctor and run it by them first! You do NOT want this to get any worse, which is possible if you try and self treat after self diagnosing. Please do see a physician, and I really really hope you get it sorted out! BPPV is no fun,  and hopefully it is not the issue, but if it IS, there are things can help and we are right here to help support you!\n  If you can,  update us!  Cool. Will schedule an appointment today. Thanks so much and I will keep you updated as I go.  Great! Glad to hear that! It definitely sounds like an inner ear issue, but as someone who has been actively hating my frigging BPPV for the past... Lemme see... 33 years,  I feel I am a bit too biased to give an objective opinion,  ya know? Oh and also, that pesky lack of any medical License,  lol.  Anyhow! I can definitely relate to the feeling of waking up and being severely freaked out about moving my head whatsoever,  so I understand the need to figure it out,  keeping fingers crossed for you.  Good luck! &gt; as someone who has been actively hating my frigging BPPV for the past... Lemme see... 33 years\n\n33 years?? That is quite a while. I am sorry you have had to deal with this crap.\n\n&gt; I feel I am a bit too biased to give an objective opinion, ya know? \n\nYep, makes sense.\n\nSo, I visited my doctor this morning and she told me it is most likely BPPV. We went through the Epley maneuver and I guess we will see whether it has any impact the next time I get up from laying down. She also set me up with physical therapy so they can run me through it a few more times.\n\nHoping it works! Sounds like it!\n\nWishing you luck with this. If it returns, definitely see someone who can identify what type of bppv it is \u2014 there are many maneuvers for different types of bppv so do not get too freaked if epley fails. So glad to hear you have gotten a definite answer and are already moving into treatment  mode!\n I also wanted to clarify-dont feel discouraged by the 33 year comment,  as I literally only this year was diagnosed!  It is been with me a long time but because my episodes were Confined to when I woke,  sometimes a few times a month and sometimes only once every 2 or 3 months, I brushed off treatment, like a dumbass,  until this year, lol... \n\n    Thanks for updating us and let us know if you get some relief!  So, did your BPPV resolve? I am guessing yes, because what you wrote sounds like BPPV and the Epply maneuver should have corrected it by now.  It is funny. It went away for a few days. I started repairing things around the house. Boom-- it is back. But now it is more like, _well, I guess this is my life now_.\n\nIn other news, I finally got the notice saying I can go to physical therapy so I am going to try that.\n\nThank you for checking in on me. Somehow that feels like I am not alone in this. Hi, not the above poster, but I know exactly how you feel. Just got the same thing, two days ago. It is awful and very scary, as it severely affects your quality of life and all said and done, nobody knows how long it will last or if it is for ever.\n\nI guess I just wanted to ask you, did you manage to resolve the issue? Yup. Finally went away (though I am sure it will return at some point), and I was able to build some shelves in my garage without being miserable -- finally. Thanks for checking in. And I hope you maneuver your way out of this soon! Great news! Thank you so much :). Also, I just found this video: \n\n\n\nJudging from the comments it appears to be effective. I am posting it here in case it helps somebody. Have not tried it yet, but I will soon! Aaaaand it is back (as of yesterday morning). Here I go again with the maneuver.\n\nIncidentally, did it work out for you? Did not try the maneuver in the video, as the severity of the symptoms subsided after the first night (did not disappear completely, but I would feel the room slightly 'swimming' only when I woke up after sleeping for a few hours).\n\nI went to an ENT doctor, he diagnosed BPPV and he performed the Epley on me. Did not change anything as far as I could tell. Anyway, as it was subsiding and it was not really affecting my daily life anymore when I was standing up, I kind of forgot about it.\n\n...until last night! That is a coincidence my friend :). I woke up during the night and the room was spinning like mad again :(. Needless to say, I was bummed. Thankfully, it still only happens after I have been laying down for some time, not immediately.\n\nNot sure what my next steps will be, probably try the video above and/or visit the ENT doctor again.\n\nThanks so much for the update! Are you going to try anything else besides the maneuver? That is really interesting. \n\n&gt; I woke up during the night and the room was spinning like mad again\n\nThat is exactly how mine happened. I was just laying on my left side, and BAM! I could feel the room spinning. I was not even moving, so far as I could tell.\n\nAnd I feel your pain. I was also bummed.\n\n&gt; Thanks so much for the update! Are you going to try anything else besides the maneuver?\n\nWell, I did the maneuver and the people at the physical therapy place had me doing a bunch of spatial coordination exercises, which may or may not have done anything. The main thing is the maneuver, not looking down, and sleeping on the non-affected side. That seems to work.\n\nFor a while, at least.\n", "Thank the universe for the Epley maneuver! I have suffered from BPPV for 13 years and each episode would last anywhere from 1 weeks - a few months.\n\nEver since I found this sub and learned about the Epley maneuver, I have been doing it at home to treat my BPPV.\n\nI have not had it come back for about a year until yesterday when it happened again, pretty badly.  I was able to do the Epley maneuver and it is been gone ever since last night.  Going to sleep propped up for a few nights just to make sure, but I am so happy!  I had so much work and phone calls scheduled for this week, I was really dreading this to go on. Right?!!! I do not know what I would have done had I not read about it and then tried it myself!! \nGet better soon, seems you are already nearly there \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb At first, Half Somersault maneuver worked great for me but the next time it did not even tho I performed it like 7-8 times, I lost my hope once again and was mentally preparing myself for the BPPV suffering but thought to give a shot to Epley Maneuver and oh my goodness it worked so great that words cannot explain. I hope we all get rid of this for once and all, or atleast do not suffer from this so often!", "Can doing the Epley cause BPPV again? I had right ear BPPV that I fixed with a PT specialist. Lately I have been getting a lot of dizziness when doing things like leaning back in my chair or turning my head too quickly or sitting down too quickly too. A few weeks ago, I felt spinning but it only lasted two days. \n\nI tried the Epley again on my right ear since I suspected the crystals dislodged again, but it did not trigger anything except the slight dizziness I already feel throughout the day. \n\nNow I am suspicious my left ear may have problems? But if I try the Epley on my left side, could it dislodge the crystals in my right ear? Since I already had right ear BPPV that I just fixed back in December I think studies are a bit sketchy regarding how the crystal can get dislodged again. Since the experts cannot seem to determine how and why the crystals initially get dislodged, it is hard to determine if certain positions could trigger it again. Here are a few things that I do know.....Many have said that if there are tiny crystals still floating around, they will continue to do the Epley or Half Somersault to help those tiny crystals (that are not currently causing SEVERE vertigo) get back where they need to be.  My therapist, who continues to keep current on all the latest studies, told me to not worry about head positions.  Once that crystal gets back where it needs to go, it will stick and you cannot dislodge it again. She encouraged me to keep moving my head in all directions and just be normal doing all the activities I typically do.  She also encouraged me to occasionally 'test' my ear canals if I felt anxious about it coming back or thought it came back, by laying back and doing the Dix Hallpike (first step of Epley).  So, in my opinion, you should be safe testing your left side.  My therapist tested both sides of me a few times after my crystal was cleared and did not feel there was concern about dislodging anything.  Again, opinions vary on this, so you may get different answers.\n\nMy left ear crystal was 'fixed' in February, and I have had some yucky dizzy days since. I have feared that the crystal was dislodged again, so I tested both sides with the Dix Hallpike.  Negative. My therapist said the residual dizziness will take time to go away. And it is changed from week to week.  First it was when looking down. The next week that was better and it was worse turning my head from side to side.  Now it is looking up to either side.  But at least it is not the severe vertigo with the nystagmus.  I cannot seem to figure out what makes it worse or better and am thankful for every single day that I actually feel almost 'normal.' This is really informative, thanks for the info! \n\nHow long have you been having residual dizziness? I finally fixed my BPPV back in December and have had it since, but it got a lot better some time in February just to get worse again the past couple of weeks. Is it like that for you too?\n\nI was told residual dizziness would only last up to about a month or two. I do not know if it is because I have had BPPV every day for almost 2 years before getting it fixed and that is why I am experiencing this dizziness for so long or something. Or if I am having labyrinthitis right now I had 3 bouts of Vertigo this past year, the first two resolved themselves. At that time, I still did not know much about BPPV. With the 3rd episode, it lingered and that is when I started to see specialists and finally found someone that could help. Vertigo struck December 10.  It took until February 12 to finally test negative with the Dix  Hallpike and be assured the crystal was back in place. During those two months, I did my vestibular system more damage by not moving my head and protecting myself. So then I had this visual vertigo as well. I had the positional vertigo when I would move. But even when I was sitting still, whether eyes opened or closed, I would have waves of dizziness (not the BAD kind, just woozy waves of it).  During this time, I continued to run, snowmobile, drive, work, and be active (which surprised my therapist!). Most people cannot function that well during active BPPV.\n\nDuring this two months, my balance system had adapted to being 'off-balance.' My therapist told me that because my BPPV lingered for so long (not to mention the other two episodes), that it was going to take my system even longer to reset.  At this point, it is been since February 12 that I have had the residual dizziness. I have days that are better, and days that are worse. And as I mentioned, it changes.  During BPPV I could lay with my head to the unaffected side.  Apparently my system got used to that, because once the crystal was reset, it made me dizzy (not the BAD vertigo) if I laid with my head like that.  Then I had a week of not being able to look up or down.  My therapist told me that I needed to challenge that to get my system to accept and adapt to it again.  So I would first sit and look up and down 15 times.  I would do this 3 times a day. Then I would do it while walking, then while running (only because I am a runner!). It subsided. Then it was looking up and to the left or right.  So I would do those same exercises.\n\nI also find if I get tired, I struggle with the gaze instability (this is the secondary dizziness I got from having BPPV for so long). It is like when you are spacing off, not focusing on anything in particular, then shift your eyes to focus on something (or the other way around), I would get a wave of dizziness.\n\nAnother HUGE factor - is anxiety. I completely freaked out during this last long BPPV because I could not find relief AT all. I was dizzy if I moved, dizzy if I was still, dizzy if I shut my eyes.  The anxiety made it worse.  So I am working hard at keeping the anxiety at bay.  I am getting lots of sleep. And trying to keep busy to keep my mind off of it.\n\nI do believe, if you had BPPV for as long as you said - it may very well take your system longer to recover fully. I think it is important too - as the studies of BPPV are a work in progress, to check in with your doctor or therapist and let them know how things are going. It is going to help them with future cases, to know to tell them things like, 'Well, since you had BPPV for 2 years before resolving it, it may take a lot longer than 2 months to completely resolve the dizziness.'  They need to hear personal experiences as well, and not just what the controlled studies say.\n\nNow, do not take my word as gospel. You COULD have something more going on! This is just my experience and info I have gotten from my therapist.  And my therapist is truly my savior.  She helped me MORE than words can say.  It took 20 Epley maneuvers over the course of a few weeks to get my crystal back in place and it was the worst few months of my life.  Brutal! The anxiety I would get before performing Epley was outrageous. And now I am thankful each and every day that I feel somewhat normal.\n\nHang in there! Thanks for all the info again. Your therapist seems super experienced and I am glad you are sharing this info! \n\nAnother question. Earlier this week I did the Epley on my right ear, which was my affected side. Even though it did not seem to trigger any spinning, I have noticed the symptoms I am feeling (the woozy, rocking on a boat, floating thing throughout the day) has gotten worse a few days after. \n\nDo you think this is residual dizziness and the Epley I did worked even though I did not feel any spinning or is it possible I messed it up and crystals have moved into the horizontal canal? Gosh - it is so hard to say! I know after my crystal was cleared, and even up to two months later, I have moments where I feel super woozy.  I continued to see my therapist for two weeks after my crystal was cleared and I was still feeling really crummy. She tested all 6 ear canals just to reassure me (and help my anxiety) that I was on the mend.\n\nHere is something to ponder (via my therapist), one time I was so determined to 'fix' myself that I overdid it by doing so many half somersault maneuver and a few Epley myself at home.....that by the time I went back to see her, I felt horrible! She told me that I overdid it, by maxing out my vestibular system.  My system was NOT used to being upside down, head down, head back, turning back and forth - that it just made me feel exactly how you mentioned...woozy.\n\nI would like to say it is residual. But I am no expert and only going on my own past experiences. How are you feeling today? Oh I see. Does your residual dizziness come and go, like some days are better than other days or is it consistently the same? \n\nToday I still have wooziness, but less than yesterday. I checked in with my PT and she believes it might be residual dizziness, but it is weird how I felt mostly fine up until that one day I felt spinning again two weeks ago. \n\nAlso recently I have been having more headaches, neck stiffness, and some weird sensation of feeling my head bouncing when I let my head hang at certain positions like looking to one side or looking down. This is not the first time I have experienced this head bobbing thing while having dizziness. Have you ever experienced something like this? My residual dizziness does come and go.  I am now two months after getting the crystal 'fixed' and I have only had a day or two that I actually do not think about dizziness or have any dizziness.  But then it comes back and I immediately have to fight off the anxiety of it possibly returning. And the dizziness changes.  There is no rhyme or reason.  I cannot pinpoint it.  The head bobbing....I have had a super mild version of it.  Only twice though. I wish you could get in to see your PT - that would help determine what is going on, and hopefully help you! I would hate to keep telling you it is nothing, or just residual, if you truly have something more going on.  But I CAN assure you that I have had days that I feel pretty good, then it gets worse again. This is really helpful. Thank you for the detailed response. I just suffered my third bout of BPPV and feel desperate for information. I have read so much online about this but really appreciate the clarity you have provided on residual dizziness. You are welcome! Please look for my other posts to get more info as well.  I agree with you - there is so much out there online, but it is all the same stuff over and over.  I really appreciated finding this subReddit to hear personal stories from people.  And while we all experience different things with our BPPV - it is reassuring to find others that can share their stories and bring hope. I was clueless with my first 3 episodes. This last episode was really bad and I decided to find help.  It was my PT that specializes in dizziness/vestibular therapy that helped me SO much.  There is still so much to learn, especially if BPPV is going to strike over and over again. Do you have any idea what causes the head bobbing thing? \n\nAlso with BPPV, do you feel spinning every time you move your head a certain way? Because I feel dizziness at random times, not every time I move my head (unless I am lying down where I feel things more similar to BPPV but still do not see any actual spinning) so I am thinking maybe it is just residual dizziness. \n\nIs it normal to feel the dizziness when doing something like slouching or sitting up straighter? Basically any random small movement I am not sure what the head bobbing thing is about. That just started for me.  And it is pretty subtle. \n\nSo with the BPPV - (for me), there are the two very distinct different dizzinesses.  The main one that determines your BPPV is the severe vertigo that lasts for about 30 seconds and has your eyes twitching with Nystagmus. That happens When I lay back quickly with my head turned to the left (the side with the ear effected) and tilted back a bit farther than just laying flat. And if I go through the entire Epley maneuver from that position (Dix Hallpike), it will trigger that horrible vertigo again at the end.  If I should happen to somehow get my head into that position during other times (like if I tip my head into the sink to wash my hair), it will cause the vertigo again.\n\nThe residual dizziness (which I also felt DURING the time I still had active BPPV) is more mild version and does not cause nystagmus. It is waves of dizziness, like when you would spin fast as a kid and at that time it was 'fun.'  Or if you move too fast or something spins around you and you get that wave of dizziness.  This dizziness (before AND after fixing the original BPPV)  happened when I was sitting still, or when I closed my eyes. It also would happen if I would move my head certain directions.  Even still, if I look down to the left or right, I will get a wave of dizziness.  Shortly after BPPV was cured, I could not look up or down without getting dizzy.  That eventually went away. Then the dizziness was looking left or right.  My therapist had me doing exercises to challenge any dizziness to help my vestibular system get used to being balanced again.  So I would first start looking up and down 15 times (and repeat that 3 times a day). And then I would move my head right and left 15 times (repeating 3 times a day).  Then she would have me doing those things while walking, then eventually while running (because I am a runner).  If doing these exercises make you feel too sick - then back off.  There are still times where small random movements bring on a wave of dizziness.\n\nMost of all - I have to remember to not let the anxiety get to me.  So a huge part of healing has been to keep the anxiety at bay as well. How can you tell if anxiety is affecting you? I have been paying a lot of attention to my symptoms and it makes it hard for me to fully focus on whatever I am doing and I have been searching a lot but I am not sure if I am having any anxiety. The other day I did get chills with my body trembling but I cannot tell if that is anxiety. \n\nLately I have been having pretty bad neck and back pain associated with the dizziness I am feeling and sometimes when I am sleeping, I will wake up to dizziness even when I did not move my head and I have ear pain. I cannot tell what this is Anxiety can show up in many different ways. And for me, it can then turn into panic attacks.  If you have ever had either previously, you would know. Anxiety and stress can show up in physical ways as well as psychological ways. If it is constantly on your mind and you worry so much that you feel it is making you sicker, it may be anxiey. Google it and you can find symptoms and ways to help relieve it, if you have it. For me, I had to stop worrying and keep myself busy with other things, or I would constantly be feeling the dizziness and it would just amplify it.", "Acupuncture for BPPV Has anyone tried acupuncture? I was pretty skeptical but use a chiropractor for some joint issues and mentioned it to him and he suggested I try it. I have managed to get my long standing BPPV under control (daily life is fine, but I am always careful) but never quite gone for the last few years. Just a note, was diagnosed and treated by an ENT. Chiro suggested it would probably take 3-4 treatments over a few weeks. After a few treatments, I have none of the lingering mild symptoms I have had for several years and no recurrence so far. For first time in a few years, I have gone back to everything I would put on hold including yoga! So happy They have done double blinded studies of accupuncture: conclusion was there was no positive effect.  Do not waste your money.  I think it is awesome that the acupuncture helped you! I love accupuncture.  Helped my residual dizziness Conclusion for OP was that it helped though. \n\nEvery person is different. It may have been a matter of relaxing too (seems to be a consensus that stress and anxiety can worsen lingering symptoms); might not be a waste for everyone. That is awesome! A nice massage is never a waste of money and double blind studies showed it works on no one. You can stop doubling down.\n\n\nI honestly do not understand raining on the parade of someone who thinks that there is a connection for them. If you think it is a waste, do not do it\u2026 they are not giving you medical advice, OP is simply sharing. The cost is 1) money, 2) forgoing treatments that work.  Stop doubling down on giving poor medical advice. I assume you are not referring the study below which shows a different outcome than you suggest. \n\n I assume you have read this rather than assessing null equals positive:\n\n Acupuncture is a scam, you are experiencing the placebo effect.  I would be embarrassed to tell people I use any alternative naturopathic - or whatever they are calling these scams now - therapies.  They are scams that prey on the ignorant. The placebo effect is still an effect, yes?\n", "Difference between vertigo and \u2018Acute vertigo\u2019 ? And episodic vertigo? Can one be the other etc. Was just wondering to wat extent does it count as acute (e.g. when it starts to impact ur life/functioning? When it is more than once or twice a year? Idk)\nAnd can episodic vertigo be acute vertigo\nNew to this terminology , recently discovered that what I have been experiencing fairly regularly for as long as I can remember is actually vertigo lol, before I thought it was just normal in the sense that everyone had this as regularly as I do (most days, definitely many times a week- it can ruin the rest of my day for me if not from the actual physical/physiological effects of the vertigo itself lasting few hours sometimes then just from anxiety after the episode)", "Just got diagnosed in the ER last night Hello all,\n\nLong story short, after getting my dosage of Prozac doubled from 20mg daily to 40mg, I began to experience dizziness. My dizziness was only at night so I did not bother too much to look into it, then it recently began to stay until morning/afternoon. The last two days it has progressed to the point where I am dizzy all day long with headaches. Because my headache and dizziness were so severe, my husband took me to the ER where they diagnosed me with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. \n\nThey injected me with some Valium but that is about it, any tips? I plan on going to my primary care doctor to see what else I should be doing and what can help me. This interferes with my job because I obviously cannot work in this condition so any tips on alleviating it are welcomed! Hi,\n\n-not a doctor-\n\nThe usual process is: Dix-Hallpike maneuver to diagnose which ear it is in. Then, conduct the Epley maneuver for the affected side. You can do it yourself or get an ENT or physio to do it for you. Often primary care physicians do not know the maneuver. It is easy enough to perform on your own at home; you can watch a few YouTube videos and get a friend or family member to help if you want. You may experience pretty severe vertigo during the maneuver, so be prepared. Hope you feel better! As someone who has had BPPV for over ten years, and also has taken Prozac... it could be a side effect of increasing your med, but the ER docs not knowing what else to do just use BPPV as a catch all. GO TO AN ENT! They will do what the person above me said and perform the Dix-Hal-pike. It is the only way to diagnose BPPV and will do the epley maneuver. I suffered for years before I went to my ENT. you are going to feel like shit and it will make it worse during the procedure but it is WORTH IT! My ENT had to have his nurse come in and hold me while I cried and screamed but after 2 epleys my vertigo was gone. Hi there,\n\nHe did a couple of tests on me and maneuvers but I am not sure what they are called. I also do not remember the names of them since they gave me Valium. \n\nI will for sure reach out to an ENT! He did not tell me what side the bppv is on so I did not know what side to do the Epley Maneuver on When I tried to do the epley at home I got too scared and went to my safe side until the vertigo stopped. If you do it at home try to have someone with you. You can tell which side has the bppv by doing the dix Hal pike. YouTube is your friend. I hope you feel better Get your vitamin D checked and meantime, start taking 5000iu/day. I just got diagnosed on Friday. My primary  sent me to physical therapy and I start tomorrow. Today I feel like absolute hell so I get it. Im dizzy and have a headache and just want to throw up. If you see a primary then they can send you to physical therapy where they will do the maneuvers there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPraying that physical therapy helps because this is miserable. Good luck! Hope you feel better! I have appointments with my primary today and an ENT tomorrow so I am hoping it goes smooth. Yes! Good luck!

I dont have the dizziness for weeks but i do get it right after my vertigo and it can last a few minutes. Do not know if this helps at all but that is just what I have felt. Yeah I have had that before too, it sucks. Best advice I can give is to try your best to reduce your (completely justified) anxiety with calming strategies as the stress does weird things to your body and can absolutely make existing dizziness worse/prolonged. As for the initial cause, It could be a medication side-effect, and sometimes it can just take a while for your head to 'recalibrate' after a bad attack. Definitely talk to a doctor about it either way; maybe a change in medication or some physical therapy will be all you need, or maybe they need to run more tests to rule out other vestibular issues. I have had anywhere from 12 hours to 6-month long bouts of varied dizziness before/after an episode: But the latter was due to mystery/undiagnosed vestibular migraines and stress, and not very typical from all accounts: I would guess the time period of dizziness for 'normal' BPPV is a few hours/days up to about a month? Best of luck, and hope you feel better soon. thank you for sharing, i probably took something like that because it was really hard to take them because of dizziness and also doctor was said that this medication can make me dizzy because it repairs the crystals in the inner ear. \n\nnow i am having same dizziness for a week but i was so fine since the last attack, i still do not know the cause and i am also not having attack. idk vertigo so weird.\n\nalso you are so lucky that you are having dizziness for a short time! \n\nstay safe. yeah i am also having dizziness before/after attacks but this time i am having this for a week and i started to think like did my attack completely changed it is place with dizziness? i hope it did. \n\ni did not know that migraine can also make you dizzy and tired all the time. \ni also think max bppv caused dizziness is a month long so if this dizziness would not end in a month i will probably go to hospital anyway so i can understand the cause of it.\n\nthank you so much for all of your golden advices, now i am just trying to stay positive and keep myself up mentally and trying to stay stable, moving slower and being healthy as possible physically. Sometimes you can have that lingering dizziness and no attack (thankfully) but it is the uncertainty does make it stressful sometimes. Happy to help! It does get easier to manage with time as well. it happens to me to, also to my dad.

Two days ago I was at work feeling fine and a lady comes in and I start talking to her and i get dizzy and it progressively gets worse and worse. All my surroundings seemed to disappear I could not focus on one thing at once and I honestly thought I was going to pass out. I then left work and went to the ER. Which by the time I got there all my symptoms where basically gone. They then did a EKG on me a CT scan blood work urine test checked my blood pressure and my temp and did some other test where I touched my fingers to the doctors fingers and everything was fine with all the tests. And every day since then I have been non stop dizzy.

It is positive that the hospital did not find anything wrong.  I do not know for sure what might be going on with you, but sometimes a dizzy episode can trigger an ongoing feeling of dizziness called pppd.  You have not had it long enough to label it that, but the thought is that the brain kind of panicked when you experie ced the initial dizzy spell, or bppv, or vestibular migraine.  It then is super aware of this and if you are focusing on these dizzy feelings they can kind of become hard wired into your neurons.  There are some good videos on YouTube by Joey remenyi and you can so check out vestibular.org.  ideally you should try to not focus on the dizziness and I stead tell yourself that you are safe and you are alright.  It is ok to feel these feelings.  Be gentle with yourself.  You will get better, and this will not last forever. Thank you for responding I definitely have noticed that I have been paying a lot of attention to me being dizzy because when that massive dizzy spell happened it scared me to death so now I am really on edge I really hope it is this simple so I will try and focus less on it Please go see an ENT asap.  As well get referred to a vestibular therapist asap by your primary doc or ENT asap.  A vestibular therapist can get you moving in the right direction asap.

I just got back he ordered more blood work and a ultrasound of my heart cause my ekg showed i have premature atrial contraction but he wants to check it out more in depth. But he did some test where he held my head tilted back for 45 seconds on both sides and nothing happened and he asked a bunch of questions he basically did not have answer so now I am going to be stuck dizzy until my next doctors appointment Thank you for the follow up.

I mean based off your own experience and symptoms do you have any guesses to what it may be That is the problem in the beginning,  so many of the conditions have the same symptoms at first.\n\nIn the diagnosis process doctors and specialists normally diagnose by elimination, basically what does not fit each condition.\n\nER doctor gave me BPPV diagnosis, but my regular doctor and ENT lean heavily on me having both Menieres Disease and Vestibular Migraines. \n\nI also have an autoimmune inflammatory disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis, which can trigger inner ear inflammation. \n\nLet doctors do their research and tests, and do your research too on Vestibular Disorders. Here is a link to a great organization. Definitely watch their videos on YouTube when you have a moment.\n\n( I have been looking up stuff that it could be and one thing I am really leaning towards is binocular vision dysfunction. All the symptoms genuinely seem to fit what I have going on. I went to a movie last night with my girlfriend and we had to leave early cause my eyes had to keep like resetting themselves on the movie screen if that makes sense The eye issue is common in most vestibular disorders. Even typing this right now my eyes are struggling to stay focused. \n\nI think it is best you get an idea of all the possibilities, but do not get locked into anyone. Let the doctors do their testing. \n\nYou will scare yourself trying to figure it out for yourself. \n\nBest wishes I am going to let the doctors do all the work it is just so hard to explain my symptoms to them cause I do not understand my symptoms either i know my eyes are the main issue and when I go into a busy area like my job or a store or driving that is when my symptoms seem to get worse it is almost like my eyes are getting overwhelmed which in return is what makes me dizzy confused and like brain fog but yes I know my doctors goal is to rule everything out one by one Going to Apple Store shortly, my first trip away from the house in 2 weeks. I took a dramamine because traveling by car, going to stores, lights, and sound bother or trigger me. Wearing my sunglasses all day because light is really bothering me. How did it go?? Heading to store all the light and traffic triggered me, and I became sick. \nI arrived at the Apple store they gave me an appointment for 30 minutes later, so I walked around the area, I use a cane. I actually felt a little better. \nOnce I finished my brother came back for me and brought food. I ate and that really helped, actually felt better on the ride back home. \n\nToday I am going to get out and walk like I used to before the nasty weather came. Should be sunny and 70\u2019s all week here in North Texas. Well I am glad to hear that for you! I am on my way to work right now and I already feel not good I feel a little nauseous after eating and I know when I am working I will be a little dizzy too I always feel nauseous when eating breakfast, think it might be stomach acid from meds, but tied to vestibular too. I took another dramamine today, it is easier, but I also know dramamine effects the brain later too.\n\nHave a great day at work. Are you noticing your dizziness is worse if you look up or down? Is your vertigo worse when lying down and turning your head left or right?\nHave you ever been diagnosed with Benign Paradoxical positional vertigo?

It was so bad I could not get up out of bed. I had seen a physical therapist who did the Epley Maneuver, and it helped right away. The vertigo came back about a month later then, I went back, but it was kind of gone by the time I got back to the doctor. For the past few years then, I have been getting vertigo spells at least every other month. It usually begins by waking me up at 4am from sleeping on my right side.\n\nThis week I was washing my hair in the tub (which I do not usually do) and I had my head upside down...I have had it for 2 days now and it is making me so nauseous. I have also been having migraines a lot lately, which I have also been wanting to see a doctor for...I have never noticed a correlation between the two, but who knows...they could be connected. \n\nAm I just supposed to keep seeing physical therapists until the end of time? I cannot stand it! The treatment is also not that fun to do every other month, even if it goes away lol My internal medicine doctor and neurologist referred me to an ENT. Best worst visit of my life. I had to do some weird test to rule out various things which i cannot recall now. All I remember about the test is how I wanted to punch the nurse or whoever she was after but I was too dizzy to do so. I had to follow things in a screen. Then wear the \"sexiest\" goggles to create sensory deprivation or something and then had hot and come air blown into each ear. I had to fast before it and I am glad that I did not even drink water because I wanted to vomit so bad. \n\n\nIt helped him determine that I am more right sided with my vertigo, and I had to do the epley maneuvers at home for I think 6-8 weeks. He also put me on klonipen because the meclizine (sp?) Was not working at all. \n\n\nGood luck! Bppv is the fricken worst. Vestibular migraine is one of the most common causes of dizziness.\n\nI made a ( about it, mainly for medical professionals. I have been struggling with BPPV &amp; migraines for over two years now. I have seen ENTs &amp; a neurologist. My neurologist said there could be a link between them &amp; the migraines. For me the migraines are triggered by stress which can then trigger the vertigo. &amp; the stress from having any vertigo can also trigger the migraines. It is a fun cycle. Thanks for your advice! I think my doctor prescribed meclizine for me as well and it did not do anything to help. She thought it was a virus, and wanted me out. I do not see her anymore lol.\n\nI guess I will start with an ENT then! Sounds like a blast haha I have been meaning to go see a neurologist for my migraines so I was like hmmm...which one to start with lol Both are incredibly fun!! My migraines seem hormonal (get them all the time with PMS), but also sometimes out of the blue. Could be the weather, as sometimes I have them the day it is going to storm, and then after the storm it goes away. I also use computers a lot for work and fun at home, so that also does not help. I have not been able to find triggers for it. Just had a migraine for like a week and a half and now I have vertigo lol so it could be related! I will definitely check out your video later on when I am not at work! Thank you :) They kind of go hand and hand but the ENT can be more specific with the why and how to help the vertigo. Neuro just goes.. yes you are dizzy \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Residual Dizziness Question! I had my first ever episode of vertigo last Thursday night.  I woke up at 1:30am and the room was violently spinning and naturally, I had a panic attack.  I went to an ENT the next day and was diagnosed with BPPV and went to a PT right after that appointment where we did 3 Epley\u2019s and 2 BBQ rolls (the spins were happening on both my right and left side).  It is also important to note that I had double swimmers ear 2 weeks ago and they think it could possibly be related.  The whole weekend I felt beyond Dizzy and unable to function.  I went back to the PT on Monday and did another 2 Epleys and the PT said pretty much all of the crystals are back in place but we will do one more on Wednesday (today) to be safe.\n\nI am so panicked that I am going to feel this residual dizziness forever.  I just got a peloton bike and I am afraid to use that, afraid to sleep on either side, afraid to go on walks, etc.  I am a pretty active person and I literally have not moved or slept well in 6 days.  \n\nPlease someone tell me that this gets better and goes away \ud83d\ude4f I recently had a bad episode. 2 PT visits and probably about 5 days of some residual effects before I felt normal again. Try to sleep at 45 degrees one night to help everything settle in place? You are fortunate to have gotten on top of your BPPV so quickly and have it resolved within a few days. Hang in there.  The residual WILL go away.  My last bout of BPPV was over two months, and I am now on month 5 of residual.  But since you resolved yours quickly - I am guessing (and fingers crossed for you), that yours will only last a week or so.  Try to remain as active as you can tolerate. That will help it go away faster! My vestibular therapist gave me exercises to 'challenge' the dizziness, to help retrain your brain.  Like, looking up and down 15 times (3 sets).  And then side ways. Then doing those things while walking.  If I moved my head a way that made me dizzy, I would keep doing that movement.  Just do not do anything drastic for a few more days while the crystal settles (such as somersaults or handstands!)  Keep us posted on your progress! i had an episode that lasted around 4 days and felt residual dizziness for another 2 days Hiya!\n\nGlad the otoliths are settled. Follow post maneuver instructions and stay active with your normal routine. It will help get your vestibular system back into sync with your brain. All that spinning will definitely stir up some confusion. The residual dizziness should not last long since you treated the BPPV quickly. \n\nBest of luck! \n\nBelow is a link for instructions for post maneuver. \n", "21 year old possible BPPV? Curious if this is relatable to anyone else\n\n\nIt started with chest pressure. I thought it was palpitations but heart scans all came back normal. Then while studying for exams I had a episode where I felt my balance was completely out of sync it lasted 5 minutes. After this the feeling of the vertigo never went away and everyday I get similar vertigo attacks. Most BPPV vertigo is positional.  Like for instance, you move your head in a certain way, and as the loose crystal (which is the cause of BPPV) moves around the ear canal, you get an intense wave of vertigo with nystagmus (eye twitching) that lasts around 30 seconds. When you move quickly again and the crystal moves, you will get that wave of vertigo again.  Often, as this condition stabilizes, you get residual dizziness.  You can test this by doing the Dix Hallpike (google it), and if you get the intense vertigo and nystagmus when laying back in those two positions, it is BPPV.  BPPV can leave you feeling very unstable and off. There are other conditions that cause vertigo as well.\n\nYour condition has other factors, so it may be something else, or a combination of things. It would be best to get to a doctor and get checked out. yes see a dr.\n\nand to add, if its a vertigo/bppv issue ask your dr if you should see a ear nose and throat (ent) dr who can help resolve the issue. If youre studying for exams and were not doing anything out of the normal in terms of how you are sitting/standing, I am more inclined to believe its something stress related bringing it on. My episode started after a bunch of overlapping stressful events (work, relationship, and apartment flooding). \n\nDo what you can to take breaks and destress. Sorry to hear. I had vertigo and disequilibrium for 4 years, so am very intimate with the topic. BPPV is usually related to having a loose crystal in the inner ear. This can typically by what is called the Epley maneuver. It is a process where they tilt the head in various positions that get the crystal back into the proper position. That said there could be a separate root cause for the dizziness. Mine ended up being related to Lyme disease and mold illness. Happy to chat more on it. It took me more than 4 years to get a proper diagnosis unfortunately. Vertigo can be a tough symptom to figure out.", "Unpleasant \u201ctinselly\u201d feeling when I am in the car I have suffered three bouts of BPPV. Since my last episode about a month or so ago, I have dealt with the usual residual dizziness on and off. But a new thing with this round is a very unpleasant sensation in the car that I believe is caused by the low ceiling. I would not describe it as dizziness but almost like I can feel snow or tinsel in my head - it is like it is in the family of BPPV sensations.

Feeling like there is light at the end of this spinning tunnel.", "Weird symptoms Do you guys also feel excessive thirst from this and stomach feels nauesous?", "How to deal with BPPV? I am a college student (junior), age 20, and since my freshman year I have been dealing with BPPV symptoms. They started when I fainted out of the blue one morning. I did not have the best eating habits when I was stressed so maybe it was out of the blue (I skipped on dinner to study and focus on assignments...). However, a week after I fainted, I started experiencing regular symptoms of what felt like my head spinning or feeling lightheaded. I could not tell. And usually when I was just sleeping and would get up. Also, specifically on the right side. Every now and then all through one night I would experience episodes where I would feel dizzy and it would wake me up. However, usually when people experience this type of vertigo it would usually be the world spinning around them. In my case it seems like it is inside my head. I do not see it, but I feel it. \n\nI would also have problems with getting up from bed as I would feel really dizzy, almost like it was motion-sickness. On the other hand, on the left side, I did not have it at all. I still continued to sleep on the right side until I got fed up and slept on the left side ever since April of last year, and I am way to afraid to change sides at night. I do have a bit of weird chest pain on my left so that is why I am concerned. Sleep has become torturous since my BPPV started. Even when I would not be doing anything but talking to someone with my head turned for a while I would feel dizzy after some time and even just sitting/doing nothing with my head but keeping it forward. What is worse is that sleeping on the back for my fused back (spinal fusion) and chronic post nasal drip that drives me insane (That happens on my left side as well).\n\nI am super afraid of starting to sleep on my right side again, only because of this BPPV. I felt like I have not really had a good night\u2019s sleep since high school, and I am worried about my heart and whether or not it will do damage to my neck, which it most likely will. If I did not have such a scary episode the last time I slept on my right side I would have still kept sleeping on my right. If anyone has any suggestions or tips for how to deal with BPPV, please share, and your experiences as well! Thank you so much to anyone who does. Have you had your vitamin d levels checked? Try taking 4-5000iu/day. Okay.... everything you have written is heading towards anxiety which is only going to make everything feel worse.\n\nYou need to see a GP and discuss all the above. You need to see a specalist such as an ENT to talk about the nasal drip, and the vestibular challenges. you didnt mention if youve seen a dr for your bppv?\n\ni had bppv back in march 2020. once i saw an ent (ear nose and throat) dr my symptoms were resolved. the ent knows certain maneuvers to perform on you that will hopefully resolve your issue.\n\ngo see an ent, asap. I do have a vitamin D deficiency, and I had it for a long time but I have been given conflicting views abt taking pills. I am going to start taking them soon bc I am just going to try them and see how it goes Yeah, I do have anxiety. I just got really scared since my last BPPV experienced. I have been tested by an ENT and neurologist that both said I have it. \n\nMy post nasal drip is apparently the result of a deviated septum, which I am considering getting fixed bc of the symptoms. I did see a doc and I have had the test but I did not do a maneuver bc they said mine was not too severe. I am going to get the test done the next visit I have to see if it helps anyway. For awhile bppv turned my life upside down for a couple months. I am a college student like you and very young too (22 when my first episode happened) I also was working a lot, being a full time student and suffer from anxiety and mild depression. Bppv really affected my mental health and that showed in my everyday life. \n\nI know the feeling of having bppv and then your anxiety takes over and then you are even more dizzy because of your anxiety with your bppv. I know how it feels like it will never end and to feel so hopeless. This is your new life forever, always dizzy. \n\nMy best advice to you is try to stay calm and keep a level head. Think positively, and try to relax. Anxiety will only make it worst. Realistically bppv episodes last a few minutes to a few hours. Even now if I have an episode it is usually gone soon especially after I do my maneuvers. \n\nDefinitely go see your doctor. They will have to refer you to an ent anyways and they can help you and show you what maneuvers you need to do. \n\nEat better and be healthy! Stay away/ limit caffeine, it can make your dizziness feel worst. Reduce salt intake, because it can trigger it and also make it feel worst. Reduce alcohol intake. Alcohol already messes with you head and balance and drinking to much makes you dizzy already. Drinking can make your balance and dizziness worst. Also get plenty of rest. Lack of sleep will make you dizzy, get a full nights rest. Plus it will make you feel better all around. \n\nMy bppv was so bad lying down too. Especially on my right side, where it is spin so fast. I recommend getting up slowly. Every morning when I wake up I took my time getting out of her and I would slowly prop myself up and stay like that for about 5 minutes until I could completely get out of bed. \n\nFinally you are going to be okay, you just got to take care of yourself. I dealt with mine for almost 6 months before it went away. Odds are for the next few years you are probably going to experience occasionally residual dizziness and bppv episodes but I promise those will go away and a lot faster than when you were dealing with them. It may not feel like it at the time it is happening, but you are going to be okay. Repeat that last sentence to yourself, it is what helped me a lot through all of this. Pills sometimes do not get absorbed like liquid. I had bppv in Dec last year. A couple more times throughout the year but other symptoms as well. I really upped my vitamin d, got a multi with iron and it is gone. Took a while bc I was not consistent with my intake. But now I am. Weirdly, flinstones chewable vitamins (2/day) is what I have landed on after months and many hundreds of dollars in supplements. It has iron and vitamin d and bc it is chewable, I think I absorb it better. I will also be adding a vitamin d gummy or spray to add more for the winter. if you truly have bppv ask your dr to do the epley for you. it resolved my issue for me as long as its done correctly. Omg, I am so thankful you replied! You also experienced it on the right! Gosh sleep has actually been really hard with this as I hated waking up frequently w those symptoms. If you do not mind me asking, how did you sleep while dealing w BPPV?\n\nAnd I actually do not drink alcohol, caffeine, and my diet also does not contain too much salt! Ik ik it is surprising to see someone our age who does not drink either XD I definitely used a lot of sleeping aids while at the peak of it. Anything that made me drowsy helped me sleep, and usually not wake up until the next day. For me I had the problem of often feeling the dizzy sensation while having my eyes closed. It made it exceptionally hard to sleep because of that. \n\nSometimes I could not sleep on my right side so I would have to sleep on my left because I just could not handle the overwhelming spinning sensation. This was not often though, only on a couple of bad days or during actual vertigo episodes. Once you start doing the maneuvers they will help a lot with it and the sooner the better! Since I dealt with mine for so long (6 months) I had to have a lot of recovery time getting my body back to normal too.", "First Epley experience + questions Hi all \nI was told by a doctor yesterday that I have BPPV. He did the Epley with me and it was terrifying. The rate at which my eyes moved was intense. He assured me it was normal and actually a good thing because just from that he could tell it was BPPV and not something else.\n\nIn any case, I came home and while the dizziness and extreme spinning head went away, I still felt off balance and my eyes did not quite want to focus. \n\nThe experience of the Epley with the doctor made me afraid to do it at home by myself like suggested. But this morning I finally got up the courage to do it. The eye movement freaked me out again but I managed to complete the manoeuvre. No spinning and no real dizziness for the most part, but still feel off balance and my eyes still do not want to entirely focus. \n\nHas anyone else had similar experiences? Is the off balance thing to be expected? I am seeing some talk about a half-somersault manoeuvre - those that have tried it, is the experience the same as with the Epley? Are the results the same?", "Anyone has BPPV triggered by anxiety and insomnia? Just curious because I just had my second ep of vertigo and similarly, it is triggered by insomnia and anxiety. Anyone else feel the same too? How do you all manage the residual dizziness after that? I made a full recovery from my last ep but it is back again this year haha.\n\nHow often do you all experience vertigo!!\u2019 Hi love!\nHow far apart are each episode?\n\nI have only had one last year  and since treating it I have made a full recovery. I have sleep issues but they do not seem to trigger BPPV. Tbh I think I triggered mine from a medication I had to take. However, insomnia and anxiety have dizziness as symptoms on their own. Hello! About 6 months apart!! I am now talking to a friend w BPPV too and we both have kind of accept that it is part of us since we have survived episodes of vertigo before. It just gets annoying u know the dizziness and fatigue kind of make you unable to do things :( my friend is recommending me essential oils from dottera maybe we can try!! I have not had an attack in 4 years but had to an international move with three young kids solo right in the middle of the pandemic and the next day (after we would arrived) I had another attack so I definitely would guess yes. Have you done the maneuvers or seen a vestibular specialist at a balance center or dizzy clinic?\nThey have goggles that can diagnose the BPPV better and perform the maneuvers on you. \n\nIt is annoying. My first episode made me bed ridden for a month. I delayed testing it in hopes it would go away on its own and I just prolonged the residual dizziness. The whole thing took 4 ish months to get back to 100%.\n\nWe are you able to sleep fully flat or on your sides in between the episodes without symptoms? Yes, mine was due to burnout and sleep deprivation Hi I am able to sleep on sides! And I did went to an ENT specialist and he did the Epley Manouvre on me. But sometimes this manouvre made me more giddy and it does not go away after one Manouvre! Thanks man for the replies! Guess who had a sleepless night again. Hope it does not impact my recovery from the post-vertigo residual dizziness. Insomnia, lack of sleep, anxiety, stress - all of those things tend to feed the vertigo.  And while BPPV is physically a crystal that is dislodged, all of those things make the residual dizziness and mild dizziness so much worse. It is a vicious cycle.  You think you are feeling better, then you feel a wave of dizziness and the anxiety hits.  Do your best to get some good sleep, and try to get rid of some stress and anxiety. You HAVE to try to take care of yourself right now!!!\n\nI have had BPPV now 4 times in the past 3 years.  The first 3 episodes I did not really know what it was and it went away on it is own and there was not much residual dizziness.  This last episode knocked me on my ass and that is when I got some amazing professional help. It took over two months to clear the BPPV and I am now on month 4 of residual dizziness. And the fear that it is going to come back again soon is unreal.  Sleeping is horrible, as the BPPV always strikes at night for me.  Trying to get comfortable in bed without mild spinning is hard.  So - I feel your pain. I am thankful I am slowly getting better and slaying the monsters that BPPV presents!  Also - the lack of sleep makes my gaze instability worse (as my brain/body is too tired to fight it).  The gaze instability came from my initial lack of movement, as I tried to avoid any form of dizziness and never moved my head. One thing leads to another. Ugh.\n\nBest wishes! Keep us posted on your progress!  And be selfish - do whatever you need to take care of yourself and get some good sleep and try to ease the anxiety. It will do wonders for you! Thank you so much!!!!! I have been trying to fight the residual dizziness by forcing myself to head out and walk it off!!! Thankfully this episode is milder than the first one (which left me unable to walk in a straight line and had to be sent to the emergency department). At least I could walk in a straight line this time so I am trying to look at this episode positively! (Though it is still kind of annoying at times haha) \n\nHope it goes away soon so I can get back to being active again!!! And yes anxiety insomnia seemed to trigger these vertigo for me. Imma head to the clinic to get a 2nd referral to an ENT specialist tmr. Trying ginger water now too (seemed to work pretty well) hope you are coping well too! It is strange how this affects people differently. My first episode I was a puddle on the floor and could not even stand up.  But it resolved quickly on it is own. This last episode hung on forever, yet my body somehow adapted and I was able to continue all activities. My therapist could not believe I could go out and run 15 miles and was out snowmobiling. I think because my body adapted so well, it is making the residual take longer to get rid of, because my body is trying to rebalance after coping for so long.\n\nStart slowly. Take little walks. Gradually do more if you are able. Try to think positive. And YES - go see a specialist!!!! Yeah man it affects everyone so differently! Even the trigger factors are kind of different for everyone. Thanks man sure feels reassuring to know that I am not alone in this annoying episodes of vertigo cum residual dizziness. Hopefully I get back to running like you did too! I was pretty active and productive before this whole shit happened so it is pretty demoralizing to not be able to be as productive and active as before. Every day is just wasted away trying to fight the dizziness!!!", "BPPV is really unpredictable I can go months without any symptoms or episodes and then out of the blue I feel like I just stepped off one of those roto-whirl rides, just very dizzy at the slightest move and it is very disorienting. Does anyone else go for long periods of time with no symptoms? Is so, have you noticed anything that seems to bring it on? moving head too quickly or bending over I had a pretty bad spell earlier this year. I have never I have never had one triggered by having a massage, but that is exactly what happened. It took about three weeks and three physiotherapist visits before I could sleep lying down again. Sinus pressure and noise cancelling headphones. Mine usually is like a low-grade dizziness all day, then nothing for a day (beautiful days), then a whole day of world-spinning - rinse and repeat x( Might want to check out my older post.  Yes and I can go years without an episode and then suddenly have one. The most recent bout was caused by leaning over to weed garden beds this Spring, I think. Odd condition to have.... I typically go years between bouts, I have had it 3 or 4 times over the past 17 years. Twice it is been brought on by yoga, which used to be one of my favorite ways to workout. Mines subsided 100% some days, but then I will have nausea and feel my eyes \u201cjump\u201d for a day or two following. I have noticed it is at its worst if I bend a little farther than I should, or from sitting at my computer half the day then reading for hours most days; I am a law student so there is no getting around the amount of work I have to do, so I take 15 minute breaks here and there and go outside. In fact now that I am typing this, going outside seems to help me a ton so if you can, maybe try going outside if you feel it coming on and see if it helps. I have gone as long as a year and half with no symptoms.  I would even begun to hope I was permanently over it then out of the blue woke up with the world spinning I get this too! Mine almost never happens from moving my head quickly\u2014it happens if I keep my head still for a long period of time like when I am working at the computer. I will definitely give gingko biloba a shot! You are right, meclizine is not very effective. Thanks for the advice Mine seems to get better when I ride in the car. This\u2026. \ud83d\ude23 Yeah\u2026 it is crap\u2026 they say if you have had it once you are more susceptible at getting it again.. That is interesting; when I first had the bout it was horrible in the car\u2026 here and there I will get waves of dizziness if I am in the passengers seat. It is really weird, I know. I will be violently vomiting to the point where I will wet myself, but as soon as I get in the car it gets a lot better. Not perfect, but better. For me I have had two real instances of it. Both times I have flipped over quickly in bed and instantly had the sensation.", "BPPV? In January this year I suddenly got extremely lightheaded out of the blue, the room did not really spin but I was shaking like crazy and felt as if I could pass out any moment. The day after that it was a little better but the lightheaded feeling was constant for about 8 weeks. During this time I ended up going to my doctor twice. She asked me about random episodes of dizziness and a dizzy feeling when laying down, both of which I have been experiencing for quite a long time. Eventually she said it would probably BPPV, in combination with a low blood pressure, and advised me to see a PT (and try eating more salt for low blood pressure). I did both but still felt like something was not quite right. It took about 8 weeks before I was back to normal.\n\nA couple of days ago the same thing happened as in January. I had a headache in the morning but did not think much of it (just like before) and ended up getting the \"attack\" of severy dizziness a couple of hours later. I still feel lightheaded and nothing really seems to lessen my symptoms.\n\nWhen I look up the symptoms of BPPV most things seem to line up but the fact that my light-headedness is almost constant for weeks on end, makes me question if this is really it. Does anybody have any idea? I am sorry you are dealing with this. I have had BPPV off and on for over a decade, and usually it is associated with changing head positions, or with being more intense in one head position than others.\n\nI have also had something similar to what you describe here. It felt similar in that there was dizziness involved, but it also felt like there was a nausea element. My head position did not seem to matter. I went to an ENT and a neurologist, and they could find nothing wrong. The only relief I found at first was in alcoholic beverages, but of course that was not sustainable, so I searched and eventually found Meclizine, also known as Dramamine 2 or non-drowsy. It is not a miracle fix, and it does not tell you that the underlying problem is, but it might give you some relief. If it works for you, it is far cheaper to buy in bulk from Amazon under the meclizine name than as Dramamine 2.\n\nGood luck to you! Thank you for your recommendation! I have tried something similar to Meclizine, but it made me super sleepy to such an extent that I do not know whether it is really worth it or not. Might still try it out though, cannot really hurt to try I guess. Hope you are dealing with everything alright! Yeah, worth a try when you do not have anything you have to do, I guess. Thanks for your kind thoughts, I have been all good in the dizziness area for a long while. I have moved on to dealing with TMJ instead! :-)", "Diagnosed bppv. Now neck pain. I was diagnosed wjth bppv around June. I have always had the signs of it but never knew what it was. Anyway, my ent had me go for a brain mri after I started getting a tightness in the back of my head and neck area. Come to find out the muscles in my neck were tightening. He suggested physical therapy and I have been doing that for the last couple months. This last week I have been having some burning sensations in my upper back and neck and today my vertigo has felt the worst it is been yet. Anyone dealt with something like this before? I experienced this last year. I was diagnosed with BPPV but later found out that it was cervical vertigo. Pt and trigger point massages/dry needling helped relieve the vertigo. I still deal with the stiff and painful neck but I manage it and the vertigo has not come back. Yea right now I am having a knot like feeling in the bad of my head.\n\nThank you for answering though! It gave me a lot of headaches as well. I pretty much had a migraine, vertigo, ear pressure and wobblyness for a couple months straight. Did it last primarily all day? Yea. The vertigo came and went during that time but i had the other symptoms pretty much all day. Usually in the morning it was better after sleeping and got worse towards the end of the day. Yea I have been checked by ent he stated it was bppv. It went away for a decent amount of time then came back with headaches and tightness in back of head. Brain mri and neck X-ray showed tightness in my neck which lead to PT. About a month through PT and now my neck will not stop burning from time to time and today the vertigo has been pretty damn bad.", "Feel sick after Epley maneuver I went to a physical therapist and one of the reasons was that I get dizzy spells. Especially when lying down or getting up. So she did the epley maneuver on me twice. The first time went okay, though the whole room spun. The second time I also got a wave of nausea and was sweating and shaking. I felt awful the hours afterwards and then went to bed. \nNow is the day after and my dizziness is in fact gone! But I am still experiencing nausea, my eyesight is a bit blurry, I have a headache and I feel woozy. I just feel sick. Is this normal the day after? It is almost worse than some dizziness laying down. Totally normal.  This might linger for awhile.  If the spinning sensation starts again you should do the epley again.  Hang in there! When I have a bout of BPPV I will do the Eply as many as 10 times in a day. It always helps, even if doing it sucks in the moment or for a bit afterwards. As long as you are doing the maneuver correctly I would say just keep doing it until you hopefully your symptoms resolve. I was told to NOT sleep lying down flat after the Epley Maneuver, to sleep in a recliner chair, for the first 24 hours. Good luck. This is very normal and actually apart of the process. You should note that you may have some Residual Dizziness for days or weeks after the vertigo is gone. Again, completely normal. Even though it sucks, your brain is just re-training itself. It will get better. \"As once, you were. You will be again.\"\n\nBTW I am on my third week of RD, but getting better everyday thanks to weekly sessions with my PT. Good luck to both of us. How are you feeling now? Im feeling better, but not 100% yet. I still feel a bit woozy and tired and have a slight headache. I  have to take it easy still. But it is a lot better than it was the day after and my dizziness is still gone!\n\nThanks for everybody\u2019s comments. Reading that this is a normal response really helped.", "BPPV for a year now OK, so i am pretty sure i have had BPPV for a year now lol, and i really want to fix it. I have went to the hospital and checked nearly everything there is to be checked, including going to a ENT. The ENT tried the epley on me to check my eyes but said i did not have any signs of vertigo.\n\nI have not been able to sit down on a chair and focus on something for more than 15 minutes without getting intense headaches and spinning sensations. I actually got fired from a really good job last year because it was pretty much impossible for me to focus lol.\n\nSo any tips? I am pretty sick of this shit. I exercise often and eat good food, i do not do drugs and such. All i wish is for it to go away.\nI have been taking vit d + calcium which is supposed to help, and it has. But i still cannot get to the point where i can sit down on a chair for an hour or two straight without getting intense vertigo and headaches, it is absolutely shit Not a doctor but a BPPV sufferer.\n\nOther things can cause vertigo and imbalance and dizziness. If Dix-Hallpike was negative, could it be something else like a vestibular migraine? I wonder what your doctor would say about that? Will anyone treat you just in case it is BPPV but no eye issues? I would personally ask my doctor why not try physical therapy if it cannot hurt? (Again, not a doctor, but I do not know why trying it would hurt\u2026?)\n\nMine started with an awful headache that no OTC meds would help; turned into eyes jumping and inability to focus and confusion, then one night BOOM the vertigo and vomiting. When I mentioned headache to my ENT the first time I met him he said that is uncommon with BPPV, but the way my vertigo occurred (laying down) was hallmark of it\u2026 and so he considered whether it is a migraine, but my eyes jumping goes along with BPPV and is not typical for migraine! (What the heck, Lol.) \n\nI have been at it for several months with slow improvement following treatments every few weeks as I can afford, but that might be coincidence and who knows if it is just time passing or treatments really doing the trick (it took me a long time to get to someone for the Epley and have it done right). A year seems really long for having basically no improvement. Hi mate thanks for the reply, \n\nIt is been hard finding a ENT because i live in Thailand and cannot speak the language,  and right now we are in heavy lockdown so a good majority of them are closed down other than the expensive hospital ones. \n\nThere are some meds that help like valium and dramamine but these cannot be taken regularly at all, i only take them once a month or less to feel what it is like to be completely normal again lol\n\nAnd it has actually improved a lot, i can barely remember the feeling but when i first got it around August 2020 it was like a constant spin as if i was drunk from the moment i woke up to the moment i slept.\nI also had really bad disassociation which was absolutely terrible.\n\nNowadays the only hard things are focusing on something for a long period of time and the occasional moment i get a sudden big vertigo attack followed by confusion. The thing is, i need to be able to focus on something for a long period of time without feeling sick because of my work (i need to be on my laptop for sometimes 6-8 hours a day), if i had a construction job or something it would not be an issue.\n\nAny tips ? i tried the epley but it does not seem to work Really do not have advice that would be something you should do yourself because I am not a medical professional. Maybe someone on /askadoctor (I think that is the board) can give an idea of what to do in the absence of your ability to get medical care.\n\nAnecdotally, I tried Dramamine recently after traveling without my meclizine and it worked; I saw it in a TikTok hack for people with migraines that coincidentally popped up in my feed the same day\u2026 and makes me still question if migraine is at play somehow with my case.\n\nI am on computer and also reading most of the day for school; I find myself tensing up sometimes, or tilting my head and keeping my neck stiff too- and that might also be a contributor. They say people on bed rest can get BPPV easily from inactivity; and I have wondered if keeping my head in one position (I do it without realizing and then catch myself after a while) for a long time can be the same as someone in bed not moving around much and somehow affect my ears. After my vertigo spell I stayed in bed because I did not know any better and for days I was unbalanced big time- I wish I knew sooner that I should have done the opposite, and moved around.\n\nNon-medical things that I think have helped include getting outside, riding my indoor bike, staying hydrated, and getting more sleep. If not for making the actual physical part of me better, it is at least stuff that makes me feel like I am doing something overall good for my stress and keeps my mind off of responsibilities and the fact that I am anxious the vertigo will return again for a while. But again, not medical advice- just sharing my experience and what has worked for me. Maybe if you have hobbies or can take one up it will help. Yeah, i find myself tensing and adjusting my position on the chair to not get dizzy which works, but all of this takes away from me focusing on my work which is extremely counter-productive. \n\nAnd yeah i do find that going for a walk in big open spaces helps a lot, but once i am back on my chair staring at my laptop my brain goes back in to vertigo mode. It is become more of an annoyance these days, but a really big one that i would love to get rid of. Everyone is different and will have different results but I do some of the, exercises when I start feeling vertigo-ish. It seems to help. \n\n\nDrinking alcohol really induces it for, me. \n\n\nAlso allergies, seem to bring more bouts out as well.\n\n\nBest of, luck When you are sitting are you looking at a computer screen? Usually, yeah\nIf i just sit down and do not try to focus on anything it is alright what exercises? Obligatory: \"I am not a doctor\" disclaimer. I am not a doctor. Talk to yours.\n\nLook up computer vision syndrome (CVS). It sounds a lot like that.\n\nI get both BPPV and computer vision syndrome. They are similar but different. BPPV can be cured by rolling around on the bed. Computer vision syndrome cannot be. But they both cause me to feel dizzy. BPPV is a relatively easy fix. CVS requires time away from the computer. \n\nWhat I have found works best for me is 1) getting glasses. Turns out I needed them, and 2)  FL-41 lenses. I have prescription FL-41 lenses in addition to my regular glasses. These things take away all kinds of screen related issues and I love them. They look purple/boysenberry in color and filter out various different florescent light colors and are popular with people who get very regular migraines. Not cheap, but it was a few hundred dollars to stop getting dizzy all the time.\n\nAdditionally follow the 20/20/20 rule. Every 20 minutes, take a 20 second break, staring at something 20 feet away. this has been very helpful for me.\n\nI found also that I get less vision issues at a standing desk than sitting.\n\nBetween the FL-41 glasses, standing desk, and the vision breaks, I do not get dizzy from computer vision syndrome anymore. \n\nI still get a spell of BPPV (when I am dehydrated, and I have had too much caffeine) every few months, but its short lived.\n\nI am a professional software engineer, so not looking at a computer is not an option for me. I still look at a computer about 8 hours a day. But no more issues.  \n\nThere is a few, different exercises. This one will bring out a super intense bout for like 60 seconds.\n\nThe key to me, is toughening thru the bouts until I do not get them. Then I am ok for a few days. \n\nGoogle BPPV vertigo, exercises for others! Thanks a lot, i will try it now!! How was your experience with dramamine? I have been experiencing what I believe is vertigo (although I do not experience the typical spinning sensation feeling). What I feel is like I am on a boat constantly falling backwards. I tried meclizine and it helped with the dizziness but it did not help with the falling backwards sensation. It works perfectly (that and valium). I take either of those once a month to give me the feeling of pre-vertigo lol, feel like heaven for a day or three. I do not take them more than once a month to avoid dependency though", "floating sensation when walking not sure where exactly to post this, but for the past few months i have experienced this feeling on and off that i cannot really pinpoint. i have talked to a gp about it and i am waiting on an ENT appointment. i am a 20 year old female.\n\nwhen i am walking in an open space (specifically a parking lot, wide aisles in a grocery store, or outdoors in general - somewhere without a rail to grip) i get extremely lightheaded to the point that i cannot feel my body below my head really. it feels like my legs have gone numb and i cannot walk properly. i have noticed i have lost coordination to some extent and, when it happens, i panic and make it worse. it is very alarming. it also seems to happen more often when i think about it rather than at random - it is a LOT better when i am with someone who is walking next to me.\n\nthe thing is, i rarely ever grab onto something to stabilize myself, even when it is right there. i have questioned whether it is a panic symptom rather than actual vertigo, because it is never been accompanied by a feeling of the room spinning or nausea. it just feels like i have lost my ability to move without feeling like i will pass out if i take another step. \n\none thing i know triggers it badly is smoking weed, which i have cut down on (unless i am inside for the day). even without it, i still sometimes experience this feeling. another issue that is accompanied it is extreme neck stiffness and pain when moving my head from side to side. even when i am propped up on pillows, the pain in the back of my neck and the headaches that often come with it are uncomfortable (though i would not say excruciating or unbearable).\n\nother factors i think could contribute:\n-low iron (though i have had this for a while and this started recently - maybe they have dropped even lower)\n-low vitamin D\n-malabsorption (diagnosed by doctor and accompanied by low weight - though i am working on it)\n-strained muscles in my neck\n\nthe feeling can best be described as \u201cfloating\u201d and on the verge of passing out. again, i have NEVER actually fallen, though i have had to crouch down on the ground before. it seems to come on quite randomly and worsens the more i think about it or panic. it also NEVER happens when i am just sitting down.\n\nif anyone has any advice or a similar experience i would love to hear it. thank you for anyone who takes the time to read. Ok same, I never really thought much of this and just thought it was from low blood pressure. It is so weird sometimes. I have bad neck pain too! Low vitamin D too lol. I am 115 and 5'5\" idk if that is low or average but I am not anorexic. F 20 here too, but I screwed my inner ear over when I had an injury. \n\nIf you are anorexic level underweight, that might be triggering a bunch of issues too. I do not think the neck pain is causing the floaty feeling. Did you get injured somehow? Also, I know weed messes up people's perceptions so maybe try getting rid of it completely? Interesting... what kind of surgery? Another thing I forgot to mention is that my ears get really bad, deep wax build up that I have to get irrigated by a doctor, so that could be contributing. Oh, and I also vape, so I guess it could be a combination of all that. You get the floating feeling too?? I had trouble describing it before I came across someone using that term and it was like WOW that is exactly it I have the exact same thing. That \u00aboff\u00bb floaty feeling. Did the gp rule out low blood pressure? yes, my blood pressure has been normal every time i have gone, and i have actually had someone in my family take it directly after a spell has occurred. GP thinks it is related to my ears getting clogged frequently and that i should see an ENT Can relate to the floaty feeling. My BP is usually low and am being treated for vit. D deficiency. Will be watching this thread", "SEEKING ADVICE I am beyond confused. All of my problems started with sinusitis. I had Fess surgery that basically did not help much over time (surgery was in May of 2021). Now I am sitting here with not only sinus pressure, but im having random bouts of dizziness, and my left ear keeps whistling/whooshing randomly throughout the day. I had a ct done of my entire head just a few days ago, but it did not show anything at all, not even my sinus inflammation. I do not know what to do, it is driving me crazy!", "Potential BPPV Hi everyone! I had my first vertigo episode exactly one week ago, I fell over after getting up from the couch and the whole room turned sideways and this lasted about 1-2 minutes before I gained my balance back. It felt like my eyes were cross-eyed too. I have been dizzy for the past week with some days being worse than others. \n\nI guess I am posting here for a couple reasons, one being to ease my anxiety and see if anyone has experienced the same vertigo. The other reason is to find any cures or anything that has helped ease the dizziness. I am a teacher and start school on Thursday and I would like to try to fix this fast.\n\nI have tried two at home maneuvers: the Epley and the half-somersault/foster maneuver.\n\nIs there anything else that might help? Your absolute best bet is seeing a local physical therapist that is trained in how to do the epley maneuver. These kind of professionals usually work at Balance and Dizziness Clinics. \n\nThey should be able to detect which canal is affected (each has a different treatment) - this is really key to a correct treatment. Agreed I also agree with trying to see a vestibular therapist or someone that specializes in dizziness. I found my vestibular therapist in the physical therapy department.  Getting the correct diagnosis or which of the 6 inner ear canals is effected is key to doing the proper maneuver to fix it.  Did you do the Dix Hallpike and determine which side is effected? I am assuming you did, as you did the Epley and Half Somersault.\n\nFor many, even after the crystal is cleared, there is residual dizziness for a while. There are vestibular/balance exercises for that as well. Otherwise, just give it time, if you know for sure your crystal is back where it belongs.\n\nI spent over 2 months going to a specialist that helped me with maneuvers to clear the crystal (I had a stubborn case). And even though I now know how to test and treat myself, if and when BPPV strikes again, I will go back for testing just to make sure nothing else is going on, and that I have determined which ear canal is effected. It just helps to have a specialist diagnose and guide you. It will help ease your anxiety as well, to have had them test for multiple other things as well.\n\nBest wishes! Hope you have a speedy recovery. Keep us posted as well, as to how you are doing. Up your vit d", "I am suffering from BPPV so badly This is probably the worst condition I have had in my life so far, I am constantly dizzy and nauseous and I do not even know how long it is going to last. Waking up in the morning is like hell and the maneuvers do not seem to be working with me. I have had BPPV for 4 days and I cannot imagine having this for one more day or even for the rest of my life. I am only 19 and I do not want to live like this for my entire life...How do you guys live with this? And what should I do to alleviate this horrible condition? Sorry to hear you are facing this problem.\n\nBPPV is always bad - you will never find anyone who says their BPPV is not bad. Thankfully, you can look at the bright side - it is a common condition so there is a ton of options. You are young so you have a much better chance of recovery &amp; tolerance. \n\nFind a good ENT and you will make your way out of it. All the best mate. Sorry to hear you are going through that. If it is any consolation, my bout of BPPV lasted 2 weeks but it went away after that. Everyone is different, however, and you should definitely go to an ENT to get checked up. They can give you medication to alleviate the nausea or dizziness. Get better! Thank you so much for the kind words. I have an appointment with ENT but it is still 3 weeks away and I cannot even imagine suffering this for another 3 weeks. Have you had this before? Does it gradually get better? Thank you for the consolation. May I ask did yours just suddenly disappear one day or was it a more gradual process? It was definitely a gradual process for me. After about a week and half it started subsiding, spinning was less and less each day. I started noticing the nystagmus was subsiding also. I had gone to the doctor and ENT and was prescribed medication for nausea and dizziness, and muscle relaxers to try to relax and help me cope until it went away. Also I was doing the Epley Maneuver every morning and before bed. Even if it does not feel like it is helping, it is. \n\nHope this helps. Sending you an internet hug. Just hang tight and hang in there. Make sure to check with the doc or ENT. It is not pleasant, but it does get better.  You can also go see a vestibular therapist.  They can do maneuvers and give you PT exercises that will help.  Your PCP may give you a referral and then you can get in before the 3 weeks has passed. Have you seen any specialist for your BPPV? I would not just see an ENT, I would make sure your ENT specializes in vestibular disorders. Otherwise, go to a balance center. Not all ENTs have experience with BPPV. Yes it gets better. Sometimes slowly, sometimes fast. Your brain basically adjusts to the signal coming from loose crystals in your inner-ear.\n\nIn my worst times, I used a cushion collar / gym towel around my neck to avoid setting off an dizziness episode. Also slept on a recliner couch with my head straight up. Stuff like that, see what helps and stick with it until you get help. take it one day at a time. Take non-drowsy Dramamine. It is an OTC.  The maneuvers did not do jack for me. My first last episode lasted about three months. Took Dramamine around the clock and as soon as it wore off I felt the spins coming back. Hope you feel better OP.  Girl, I feel your pain! I have had it for two straight weeks now! Saw my Dr., she prescribed meclizine (which is just Dramamine!) and to watch videos on the Epley method; went to chiropractor where I got neck adjusted and also did the Epley/Semont on me...it got worse over the weekend! Finally, I went to the ENT and he also did these maneuvers in office\u2014I felt a tiny bit better, but still some dizziness...this is torturous, and for those who have never felt it, they just do not get it! I am trying to be patient and go on w/ life (ex: I still need to do my Mom-duties!), but this is such a freakin\u2019 HINDRANCE!!! I am about to check out this physical therapy clinic specializing in balance disorders of this does not subside soon\u2014I can relate! I believe anyone who has these symptoms! It is an invisible curse, so not many will empathize...(((shaky hugs))) You get used to it. Kind of. It just becomes more bearable. When it first started it lasted like 3-4 months. Then suddenly went away for the rest of the year. I woke up this week and i have been dizzy ever since. Seems to come and go. Stop nicotine, caffeine, and stress! Mine tends to get worse around bright lights and excessive movement.  for instance if you scroll too fast on your phone it could be problematic. Best of luck to you. it could be from depression", "Vertigoheel - anyone used/noticed it was useful? I guess i am interested whether anyone found it useful for general dizziness, as I do not expect it to help much during an acute BPPV episode. \n\nOrdered this from UK and cannot find many reviews online. Thanks! I used pill version around 1 week. Then used when I got constant dizzyness more than half hour.\n\nSeems like it is working fine, but does not totally remove the dizzness during the day. It may be just luck but I never wake up due to dizzness when I got one pill before the sleep.\n\nMy doctor advised me to use 3-5 times a day when I need. And use it via putting under the tongue.\n\nJust side info, try cutting caffaine and salt if not done already. Thank you for the reply! I took 4-5 yesterday since I had a pretty bad start with dizziness and it seems to have helped at least a bit. Placebo usually does not work with me, so maybe it does help. Will try taking it before bed too.", "Working with vertigo??? I do not understand how people pay their bills when they have vertigo for so long. I have only had it for three days and lost work and I work for myself so I do not have sick pay. Do you guys work with vertigo??   Eventually your body will get a handle on it. I know it may seems impossible right now so early in the experience, but it will adjust, and you can go back to your normal life for the most part.\n\nThe most important thing is to get a GOOD doctor who is caring &amp; knowledgeable who will prepare you for what to expect.\n\nGood luck friend!   Brandt Daroff exercises, also have you had someone perform the Epley maneover? I have done it myself. Epley worked the first time I had vertigo but this past week has not helped at all. My doc said to give it a week to go away or we will do a brain mri. I should go to a PT though first maybe. \n\nCurrently I am not getting the spins but I have pressure in my head.  There is also a buzzing feeling that move around the perimeter of my head and coincides with my rocking balance. If that makes any sense.  Sorry to hear you are so poorly, currently in the middle of a bad episode myself and have been off work for a while. I know what you mean by the last part, your head feel heavy? Like extra effort to walk with it on your shoulders? The eply should make you feel better within a couple of days, if not it may not of worked for your current situation  This is a month old, but I just stumbled upon it and was wondering the same thing. I took my first sick day in four years yesterday after having my first real bout of vertigo on Sunday. I am still dealing with it (but a lot less) on day 3 so far and I do not know how anyone functions with this crap. I have had it for 1 week and have not worked all week, I do not think I can stay off of work for much longer (even if just for my own sanity - I am bored). I will eventually have to just force myself to go in to work with this and deal with it. I bought a supplement off Amazon called \"Vertisil\" and it has helped me a lot. I still have some at night while in bed but hardly any dizziness during the day. I would try to do the Epley maneuver a few times and then buy a bottle and see if things improve. I take one in the morning and one at night.", "Has anyone considered that their vertigo was from Covid? I have been thinking about my first attack (dec 19), and then my second attack (feb 20) which was accompanied by chills, fatigue, tinnitus and I have hearing loss. My symptoms have since subsided but very slowly and maybe in a month I will think something different entirely. I heard today on the news that hearing loss is a symptom of Covid. I also think I was low on Vit d. But I was not extremely low. I read a study that showed a correlation to BPPV and a positive viral titer, which I thought was very interesting because for me, my BPPV has struck within a week of having shingles, twice now. The study only discussed Hepatitis and Varicella IIRC, but I would imagine Coronavirus could have a similar effect? Ya I would get cold sores, also I got blisters on my toes. All happened more than once. This year. I also take lysine more frequently. As a preventative. Hi I just had Covid and I now have verytigo and I have never had it in my whole entire life Well, there is reports on linking vitamin d deficiency to covid response. Up your vitamin d ASAP! I had the same thought.  My first ever BPPV attack came in March of this year just after returning from a trip. I also had the chills and sweating symptoms. I finally had an antibody test to see if I had had Covid and it came back negative. I had the antibody test in June so it is possible if I had it the antibodies had faded by then. Ya mine happened after a trip to Las Vegas.", "Can psychosis cause vertigo? Title  Thank you! ", "I am on day 5 This shit sucks. \n\nQuick question, do you all have crazy ass dreams when you are able to sleep? I hope it ends for you soon. And nah...no dreams. Are you taking a med to help? It could be the med. You know what.. I have had some crazy dreams the following days after getting it. I chalked it up to not smoking weed/ drinking booze for over a week but now that you mention it maybe theres a correlation? could be coincidence but man some of the dreams were intense and so CREATIVE. I dreamed things in Stop motion clay animation. it was crazy cool. This has all ocurred in the last 10 days, when i had my first episode of what ive come to learn as BPPV. definitely was a miserable week for me but i am feeling MUCH better. No floaty feeling, no more nausea, No more stumbling when walking. I can trigger the eye vibration when i lie back too quickly but for the most part i feel 98%. Im even back to riding my bike! So, hang in there man.\n\nI have since taken this as a wake up call for me to get my shit together. Drinking more water, eating better, cutting down on weed/alcohol. I plan on getting more of the necessary vitamins and nutrients as well moving forward.\n\nanyway sorry for rambling, this is the first im posting about it and felt like getting it off my chest. Sometimes I do. Tonight I slept inclined as I am post-Epley and I find it helps prevent reoccurrence overnight. Had some wild nightmares, the kind where you wake up and you are relieved it was a dream. I did not take any meds last night. No meds for me This is literally the same for me! I wasnt sure if its cause i stopped smoking or because of the bppv! My dreams are crazy now", "Is it normal to feel more vertigo after the Epley Maneuver? I visited a physical therapist who helped me with the Epley Maneuver but throughout the day I felt more random moments of vertigo where I would feel spinning just from standing and moving my head a little bit. Is it normal to feel more vertigo for a while after doing this exercise?\n\nAlso I want to try to do the exercise on my own, but I am afraid my vertigo could get worse if I do not get the exact correct angles and positions for everything. Could it get worse if I do not do it 100% correctly? It probably did not work. Try doing Brandt-Daroff at home 5 x day. Helped me a lot. Do not worry--it WILL go away. I have BPPV in both ears.  When we treat the side that is the worst, it often aggravates the opposite side and makes me feel like my vertigo is worse instead of better. It takes several visits  to finally get them both treated.  You can only successfully treat one side at a time. my physical therapist tested both my ears and seems like it is a right ear problem for me unless the left ear is really minor that i do not really notice it. did you do the epley maneuver everyday? With both of my ears affected I do not treat it every day as that only makes things worse.   Right now we have the left ear back under control but my right one is being a it more stubborn.  This is my second time around with my BPPV being active.   The first time was much worse but  I was misdiagnosed and did not get it treated until it was pretty bad. My therapist encourages her patients to do it at home even though there is a chance you can make it worse.  Most people do not have any problems though. I choose  not to treat it  on my own because there was an incident where the Epley maneuver caused the crystals to move into the horizontal canal  and it was the WORST experience I have ever had. how can you tell if it moved into the horizontal canal? what does that feel like and/or what triggers the sensation when it is in the horizontal canal? I had a very sudden very severe spinning event during the Epley maneuver which did not stop.  She put me through a different maneuver which finally brought it to an end but i was not able to even function for the rest of the day I was so sick.   She said that there is always a possibility that can happen during the Epley maneuver if you hold the positions too long but it is not common.  She says that I really put her through her paces because I have had every possible thing go wrong lol.", "Ugh! I just got into a normal sleep schedule 2 days ago, and BAM! On cue my BPPV is worse than it is been in years tonight! I am having dizziness in any position I turn in. I have to lay perfectly still and as soon as I move it goes crazy and the room even spins. I get BPPV like once a month for years now, but usually it goes away in a couple hours or so...today it is been all day, and it is horrible trying to sleep! Is there a surgery to fix this once and for all? I always found a diagonal angle to help the best for sleeping :( hope your doing ok. I am not sure if a surgery exists which just keep trying epley maneuvers before you really consider that any surgery on the inner ear is always going to come with the risk of permanent damage to your hearing or even worse permanent damage to your sense of balance. Stay strong and talk to as many specialist as you can about different options for you really try to figure out what is best and we are always here for you for advice. If it does count down to surgery or if you talk to a specialist about it make sure to let us know what they say it really helps a lot of people out who do not know what direction to go in since there is such limited information out there on this. Do you take motion sickness medications on rough nights? Have not taken meds much. Usually maneuvers help and usually it goes away within a few hours. It just now is getting better. It is been almost 24 hours. The vertigo itself was worse than it is been in years. I definitely need to invest in Meclizine. Have you seen someone who specializes in vestibular disorders? I am not talking about an ENT. I mean someone from a balance center or similar? No my doctor wants to send me to therapy. Therapy? Physical Therapy?\n\nFind a specialist in Vestibular disorders. Someone who deals with BPPV everyday. For example, google \"Balance Center\" or \"Vestibular Center\" and the name of the closest big city.", "I did it! And I am not head spinning! I did an aerobics work out! For the first time in two year I was able to move my body (almost) freely! \n\n\nAnd I am not feeling like I am about to fall off of the planet, which is a big victory for me. This seems so silly but aside from walking I have not been able to exercise with out putting myself into a month long BPPV episode. I have been working with a PT and being very careful about keeping hydrated and not rolling over fast when I sleep/sleeping on my back. \n\n\nBPPV threw me into a deep deep depression and I have been chugging away at that and re gaining my movement/ balance with VRT. I gained a lot of weight from lack of exercise and depression eating. I am hoping today is day one of a positive change. I was super careful of how I moved my head, most definitely did not do any head dips or whipping my neck around. Kept it shorter. My ears are ringing, so for now I will rest. But fingers crossed I can try again tomorrow too! \n\nThanks for letting me share!", "How do I know if Epley is helping? Hi Everyone\nI have recently been diagnosed and have been tasked with doing the Epley maneuver three times a day. When I do it, it absolutely recreates a dizzy spell, feels like the entire room is spinning and turning upside down....but how do I know if it is helping overall? I had a full day Friday or being dizzy for over 16hours of it coming and going in waves and all weekend I feel very lightheaded. Just not sure if every time I am doing this maneuver if it is helping or making things worse. Any insight would be appreciated:) Thanks From what I learned from working with my vestibular therapist (for over two months &amp; 20 Epley spaced a part) as soon as you no longer get the severe vertigo &amp; nystagmus, it was successful. At that point, you may want to be somewhat careful to keep your head upright for a day (my therapist said that was no longer the case with the newest studies.... But many will still tell you to be careful). On theory that is helping the crystal to settle into the correct spot. My BPPV was stubborn. I only did two at a time. Essentially the second one was testing to see if the first worked. If it had not, I would take a break from the Epley for a few days, then try again. It made me terribly sick each time &amp; my body needed a break in between.\n\nEach therapist has a slightly different theory on how often to do the Epley. But basically, if you lay back doing the first step of it &amp; get the severe spins.... It did not work the time before. I also did the half somersault, because that did not provoke as severe vertigo.... And figured it certainly would not hurt. There are a few other maneuvers that have worked better for certain people as well. Also.... When the Epley finally DID work for me, I had no idea. I still felt horrible. It was not until I went back for therapy &amp; she laid me back &amp; there were no symptoms, that I realized the crystal was finally back in place. Unfortunately, I still felt like crap did a month (but no severe 30ish second positional vertigo). And now I am in month 4 of dealing with residual dizziness. It is a tricky thing. Honestly it is never helped me.  I just wait it out now. I did the Epley twice. Once in my doctor's office and once at home alone. After that, my BPPV was finished. That was almost 2 years ago and so far it has not come back.\n\nIf yours continues, I would suggest visiting a different doctor or therapist. I had to see the PT recently for help with this. I had done it 4 times on my own at home and it was getting better but not resolved. I saw her, we did it twice in the office and she told me to sleep at a 45 degree angle that night. That helped tremendously. I saw her again the next day for two more maneuvers. I had some residual feelings for the next handful of days but then it settled down. \n\nShe suggested that I only do the maneuver when needed. I am not sure if you are 3 times a Day is because it is needed or if you are trying to prevent it. She said preventative maneuvers can actually upset the crystals. Good luck and hope you feel better! Since it has not come back in two years. Have you been able to sleep normal? Like on your sides or flat. Yes, everything is back to normal. Like the way it was before I got BPPV. Glad to hear. I have yet to get back into sleeping normally. Think I am just scared to bring about another episode. But I think I am going to give it a try. Thanks! Um...can I ask how you are sleeping? Sitting up? Lol no, not sitting up. Just on my back, and a little elevated with two pillows. I would say I am pretty much flat since the pillows are thin but I am just trying to get back to sleeping on my sides really. /u/ShanghaiKitty The sleeping thing gives me huge anxiety as well!  Especially since that is where/when all 4 episodes happened. But, as of my last episode that happened in December, was cleared in February (but still dealing with residual), this morning I woke up and was FLAT on my back and felt fine! I start out still propped up a bit, but by morning, am pretty flat.  My left side is the effected side, and I am terrified to sleep on that side.  But my right side has been my saving grace. There were times when laying on my right side was the only time I was not dizzy.  And I started being propped up on my right side as well, but in the last week or so, am able to be flat on my right side.  The left - well, I think it is going to be a bit before I give that a try. So maybe you should start out slowly laying on your GOOD side, then slowly work into your bad side.  Keep us posted - because I am hoping to be able to sleep on my bad side again soon too! Yet the fear of it happening again.....Ugh. My left side is the side that is effected as well. I can lay on either side and have no issues. I just worry about sleeping for long periods on either side bc sleeping is what caused my episode as well. I guess I will not know until I try. Lol I have laid on my right side as well during the day while watching TV and am fine. But at night... Same as you. Nope. Just cannot do it yet! The funny thing is that during my first 3 episodes I had no clue what was going on. I just kept doing everything as usual. I am truly hoping that this time (because I know what is going on), because I am being overly cautious.... It will never come back. My therapist says there is no proof in any of that. But.... If I can do anything to keep it away, I will! Me too. I can say BPPV has been one of my worst experiences - health wise. It just took so long for me to recover fully but also I had active BPPV for a month before treating it. Spins all day, everyday. Now that I am fine, I would do anything to keep BPPV from happening again. But cannot live in fear of it, I guess since I feel normal I want to keep it that way for as long as I can. I have had a lot of sports injuries &amp; even back surgery. But I agree... This has by far been the worst of all of that. You cannot even explain how sick you feel 24/7. I felt I could not even continue life &amp; I am such an outgoing happy go lucky person! It took a toll on me. I had it for over 2 months. And even though I could avoid the nasty vertigo with nystagmus (except when doing the Epley), I had that daily woozy dizziness as well. Felt like puking all the time. I saw a specialist for 2 months before we finally cleared it. I am so happy to hear your story. And that you are better. It helps me! I still have mild residual dizziness. And every time it hits... I panic. In time, hopefully we both will not fear it as bad. And I pray it never comes back! Me too! I have always been athletic and have had many injuries. I dislocated my shoulder and injured my tailbone in a car accident a couple years ago...that was nothing compared to BPPV. Lol\n\nIt took me four-ish months to get back to normal. Even then, I still continued to have days of dizziness. But not bppv dizziness, it is more of a lag like my vestibular system is still getting back into sync. I have had no problem getting back into working out and living a normal life. I would say...from onset of symptoms and treatment...5-6 months to fell 100%. I just kept introducing myself to activities that would give me residual dizziness and kept doing them everyday. Walking and running seemed to help the most. It DOES get back to normal. I just have to get back to not having so much anxiety to sleep. Hopefully we do not have to experience it again! Oh my gosh. You and I sound so similar! I am now going into month 6 from onset. And finally starting to have days where I do not think about it or feel it much. And also like you... I have challenged the dizziness to help it go away faster. I continued to run &amp; train for the two active BPPV months (my therapist could not believe I could even run!) But it was the only time I felt good. I also continued with daily life... As it was expected. No one could see my sickness. And heaven forbid I not be the super over achieving person I always was. And in reality I was dying inside. Each hour was a struggle. And no one cared. The anxiety was horrendous.\n\nSnowmobiling was tricky. Trying to keep up with the guys at 60  to 80 mph.... Flying over jumps... The ground entirely white.... Head whipping around from the force of the wind. \ud83d\ude31 Yeah.... Had some pukey moments there. But I refused to give in! And I am the only girl that CAN keep up with the guys... So I did not want to wimp out! \ud83d\ude02\n\nI had a torn hamstring &amp; had experimental PRP injections (platelet rich plasma, where they draw your blood out, spin it down &amp; inject the white blood cell plasma deep into the torn area). You get no anesthesia, no pain meds, and you need it to be inflamed. The pain was incredible. But I would take that over BPPV any day. You sound like you have a high pain tolerance as well. Cheers to both of us continuing to improve! But if it happens to me again.... I am going to come knocking at your door for moral support! This forum is great for the people that actually can relate &amp; help others out. You are great at that! Girl power!! Absolutely, same here! I am glad you are doing well now. I am hoping it stays that way. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\n\nDefinitely do not hesitate to send me a DM whenever!  This subreddit helped me a lot when I was going through it and the least I feel like I can do is to help spread the love! I see your posts on here too and it makes me happy that there are people ready to help others! Yes exactly! My therapist was so awesome.... But finding this subreddit and people that actually can relate.... Helped a ton! It annoys me that so many docs just dismiss this. And that poor people just suffer needlessly. I love seeing your posts as well. You are so kind &amp; helpful! I often get frustrated at repeating myself, but I am probably the minority that read almost the entire forum before posting anything! It seems like most do not do a search or read previous posts. So.... Cut &amp; paste! \ud83d\ude02\n\nGirl power all the way! \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\ude01", "Vertigo for the past few days Hello! I have been looking for subs for those feeling a spinning sensation and this sub is the closest I have found. I hope this is the right sub to put it on.\n\nI have been feeling quite dizzy for the past week or so. It started a day after I had a really high fever accompanied by colds and some difficulty breathing. I never got tested for COVID-19, though I doubt it was that since I still had my sense of smell and taste. Anyways, at first, I thought it was just because of the fever medicine I took to make myself feel better. However. It is been a stopped taking the meds and I still feel like I am swaying back and forth. While I am typing this, I am thankfully not feeling it, but I did feel the sensation earlier today.\n\nThe last time I experienced this was over a year ago and, if I am not mistaken, it also lasted a week or two then went away on its own. That was not the first time though. The first time I felt this sensation was around four to five years ago, though the sensation only lasted a minute or so and went away after I went outside and took a walk. Thankfully though, dizziness the only symptom I have. No puking, no eyesight problems, no migraines. At this point, I am not even sure if it is vertigo, because I have went to a few doctors already and they also said that it is probably not that.\n\nLong story short, I just want to ask: Could it be triggered by computer posture? or maybe a vitamin deficiency? I just really want to go back to normal and stop feeling this :( Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* There are a lot of things that can cause dizziness. Vitamin deficiency is thought to be one (can Google for peer-reviewed research on that), as well as posture (some people get something called cervical vertigo), as well as viruses, as well as certain prescription medications, as well as dental/jaw issues\u2026\u2026 See where I am going?\n\nSince it seems to be recurring you should consider seeing a ENT (who also deals with other vestibular system issues and can help rule those out), and then perhaps PT/vestibular therapist. Both can do a quick exam called the Dix-Hallpike that will look at your eyes and determine if you have what is usually a hallmark of BPPV (you can YouTube to see what the exam is like). I preferred to see the ENT but some people go right to a PT\u2026 I do have anxiety anyway, so seeing the ENT made me feel like I was addressing maybe any \u201cfoundation\u201d issues and not just treating the symptoms.\n\nBottom line- you need a medical professional to help diagnose because dizziness is broad and has many causes. It sounds like you sort of have a pattern, maybe, but need a professional opinion for sure. Good luck, this stinks! \ud83d\ude43 I have gotten it check and the ENT I consulted said that it was not vertigo. Even weirder, it only comes back once a year or something like that. Then again, that was a year ago lol.  Anyway, thank you so much for taking the time to reply!", "Are the PT therapy sessions expensive? Just wondering. Have not been to one yet. I am mostly concerned that because most of my vertigo has subsided on its own (tho I am still dealing with rapid eye movement and dizziness) that they will not even try and help. Is it expensive to see one? My insurance covers so dunno.  It was worth it for me. Ooh very nicr. I will have to see but most things my insurance covers I end up paying almost half It would be worth it to go for an assessment at least.  That way they can check you and teach you which maneuver to do at home.  You could then look on YouTube for gaze stabilization exercises or vestibular rehab exercises.  Without their help though you may not know what to do when it hits you hard again. I think my appts at fyzical balance centers ran around 40 dollars on the bills. Depends on your insurance. My ENT office charges me something different every time I go in, it is actually kind of frustrating but if they do more at one appointment than another then it is only fair I guess.\n\nI would call insurance if you have it to verify coverage and then the PT office. If you do not have insurance, the PT office might work with you on a sliding scale (income dependent), many doctor offices do. I do not even know which maneuver to do because I need a script just to even get assessed unfortunately Will your Dr give you a script?  I looked at my bills and the full charge for each session was between 180 and 220.", "M 23 - My BPPV story Hello to whoever is reading this. I am sure, like me at the time, you are very confused about why you are so dizzy. I am 23, relatively fit with no previous health issues.\n\nI woke up one morning and looked over to my phone to check the time in bed. Instantly, I could tell things were not normal. The room was spinning, my eyes were twitching as I looked around, my head felt incredibly light-headed. \nI tried leaving my bed to go the bathroom, thinking the dizzyness would go away - I was wrong. After a minute or two of feeling like the world was a vortex around me I *literally* crawled back to my bed.\n\nMy initial thoughts was maybe I had covid - I know dizzyness is a symptom of Covid so I stayed bed bound and isolated from my family and also did a covid test which came back negative. \n\nAfter a few days of nausea, I went to A&amp;E Hospital where I described my symptoms. One possible cause of dizzyness is meningitis - my doctor explained that if I was suffering from this my neck would be very stiff and I would not be able press my chin against my chest by looking down. Fortunately, I did not have this. \n\nMy doctor then believed that I was suffering from BPPV. He explained that this is not serious - I will recover. He gave me instructions for some exercises to do at home as well as prescribing me some tablets for the nausea - I was to only take them if I felt like I needed them. From doing some googling, I believe they are the type of pills women get for morning sickness. \n\nThe excercises he told me to do are called the Brandt-Daroff excercises. They were not that affective for me, but maybe they will be for you: (\n\nI did these for a few days. I must say I felt a lot better than I did on the first day I experienced BPPV, but days 2-8 were still 7/10 bad - with the first day being 10/10. \n\nFrom looking and moving head in various directions, I noticed the dizzyness was most prominent when I positioned my head in a looking \"down-right\" position. Following some googling, I discovered the Dix Hallpike test and the Epley Manouver.\n\nThe Dix Hallpike is supposed to help identify what side the BPPV is, and the Epley Manouver is the remedy.\n\n (\n\nI repeated these instructions every night and morning and found some relief - I did not suffer from nausea as much, but I still felt pretty off balance. \n\nApparently you can correct the crystal position but still suffer from \"residual dizzyness\" for some time afterwards - I believe this is what I was feeling at the time. \n\nThe excercise that worked best for me turned out to be - ( I suggest you try it too.\n\nIt has currently been about 25 days of my BPPV experience, but now I feel *almost normal*\n\nI no longer feel dizzy, and my eyes do not twitch or anything.. but I still feel slightly off balance. \n\nI would recommend a few things; \nKeep your head horizontal, I noticed improvements once I stopped laying in bed all day. Sitting up watching TV or something. Early on, I felt motion sickness from watching TV and seeing things move - good head aches, but this subsided after a day or two.\nI have been taking Vitamin D supplements, apparently this is supposed to help? My experience would suggest yes. \n\nIf you have any questions, please ask me.. I am not used to making long posts like this but I will respond to anything I receive. I am not great at talking about myself lol.\n\nStay safe, stay well and please do not lose hope. I was worried I was going to live with this forever.. but I feel a lot better after a few weeks :) Fantastic post and a great update to hear you are on the recovery! Thankyou for sharing. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d Hi OP!\n\nThanks for sharing your story and your advice! Many of us can relate to your experiences. (Your story sounded very much like mine!) It is so terrible to feel the spinning, nausea, dizziness from BPPV, but I am glad there are people like you who are willing to share their stories and advice to spare others the (literal) pain of hunting down information themselves.\n\nIf you need any more support, we have a ( that you can read (and contribute to by adding a comment if you would like). I have already added your recommendation that people *not* lie down for extended periods of time.\n\nEdit: Oh, wait a minute! We have chatted before on that quick reference guide post! Glad you are doing better! \ud83d\ude42 Honestly this sub has been super helpful - thank you! Thank you so much for sharing. The detail and your reviews of each maneuver are extremely helpful. I am new to BPPV too and just recently did a successful Epley Maneuver. I am saving your post as a resource for the future. Thanks again, and I hope you continue to feel better! Any questions feel free to ask! I hope you can have a swift recovery, I know I was super worried at the start but you will cover with time and positivity :)\n\nOne thing I must stress that I forgot to put in my main post; I was always unsure if I was doing the maneuvers correctly. \n\nIn my case my eyes did not twitch when performing the exercises - this is supposed to happen according to what research I have done, but obviously this does not always happen. \nSo do not be discouraged if you do not experience the eye twitching when performing the exercises - perhaps you still have BPPV, but you have sorted out the bigger crystals and you might just have the smaller particles left :) Very helpful tip, thank you! Thanks for your post! It is really helpful and interesting to compare. I am 24F and have been seeing an ENT since December. We have done a number of epleys which have significantly reduced the spinning since a 10/10 on the first go. Since then he is instructed me to do the Brandt-Daroff exercises at home which also seem to be reducing it each time, with dizziness (not quite spinning) on the first set and then none for the remaining sets. Would definitely say they must be doing something. Back to him for the dix and epley in a couple days to see where I am at. I also feel almost normal now but hope we are both completely rid of this soon. \ud83d\ude0c You are the first person I have come across that is of a similar age to me! Fingers crossed for you :) Your story is very similar to many of us (the folks that have posted and gotten professional help). Thank you for sharing! It helps others to know they are not alone.  And everyone experiences BPPV in slightly different ways.  The professionals also sometimes are NOT helpful - or you get conflicting info. Hearing true life stories help others sort through BPPV and help ease anxiety. I was fortunate to find an excellent vestibular therapist to help guide me through.  And that was after seeing many specialists that did not help at ALL.\n\nI am glad to hear you are on the mend!!!! Fingers crossed it does not hit you any time soon again! I am so sorry you are going through this. I am 26 and I have similar symptoms that only started this year. It is nice to know that I am not the only one also and that other people my age are also going through similar symptoms. \n\n My first time was after running so I thought that maybe I was dehydrated or had a heat stroke. My second time was at 6am  (first thing in the morning) when I lifted my head too. The ceiling light was spinning and the drawer was spinning. I cannot look at anything because it is moving. If you close your eyes it feels like your moving too. Vertigo is the worst feeling in the world. It is so terrifying. I have had 9 experiences of vertigo since those first two times. They happen at the most random times too. Like in the morning just like you, at night, after running, etc I cannot find anything that these times have common. Sometimes it is on my period but I have noticed that other times it is not. Sometimes they come along with headaches too. \n\nGinger helps with my nausea so I have some every night. If I have a vertigo attack and do not have ginger then I will vomit. But if I have vertigo after drinking some ginger tea I will not vomit, but will just feel dizzy. I have also noticed that it helps not to ever listen to any music and to avoid loud sounds. The less noise you listen to the greater the time in between the vertigo attacks. I had another vertigo attack tonight, but it was not as bad as the others. I concentrate on something and try not to stress and it seems to go away quicker than if you do not. \n\nI think you should also look into M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, because it has some of the same symptoms. I am not even sure if that is what I have, but I have had a CT scan and they did not seem to se anything. I also think maybe stress plays a large part in when and how long I feel dizzy. Not wearing headphones and listening to loud music makes sense because it influences your ear canals, the crystals, and your balance. But it does not make sense when we have attacks in the morning. The only other thing that helps is trying not to be stressed.\n\nI am really hoping this will all just go away for us both and literally for everyone. I hope something I said will help with your symptoms.", "Does this sound like BPPV? Started about a week ago. I was playing with my son (8months PP) and I was lying on my back and rolled up back into sitting and become overwhelmed by dizziness and nausea. Crawled to the bedroom and ended up being violently sick and dizziness remained probably for at least 40 min, went to sleep and woke up feeling much better. I initallly thought maybe I had eaten something bad (since I had had take out that day but now the time line seems to quick). Anyway 1 continues going to work for a whole week without recurrence. Now I am on holiday (so spending a lot more time horizontal on the couch) and it is back. Every now and then when getting up the world spins for a couple of minutes and I feel unsteady on my feet.  When turning from side to side while completely horizontal the same thing happens - so does not seem to be a postural hypotension issue. I did Epleys manoeuvre myself (for right sided disease - I am not entirely sure this side is my problem- has not been confirmed), and the sensation and is overwhelming nausea occurred during. Not sure if that is confirmation? Anyway - symptoms have not yet really settled despite doing Epleys a couple of times. \nAny advice welcome. Could be. Mine was triggered by laying on my right side. Saw a physical therapist three times and he cured me. It was an awful experience though. yes its possible. go see an ent (ear nose and throat) dr. i did. im better now. yes - it sounds like text book BPPV.   Can you have someone perform the maneuver on you by watching youtube videos?  They can watch your eye movements to verify that it is BPPV.\n\nRather than epley-  I would suggest half sommersault maneuver \\( \\~3x before you go to bed.", "Test Test Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary.

Did not think much of it since I would feel fine right after the episode. It would mostly happen while sitting and staring at the computer at work. It happened once while I was standing in front of TV too I just assumed it was cyber sickness. Then couple months ago I started feeling off balance when walking and vertigo episodes became more frequent (sensation like I am falling and spinning but it is in my head nothing is visually spinning for me) as well as nausea. I had a particularly strong episode when I was just laying in bed without moving my head or anything it just happened and I jumped out of bed and it stopped. I was left so dizzy after that and nauseated so I saw my doctor. She taught it was a migraine but then she made me follow her finger with my eyes and nystagmus was present. It was the first time I heard of it and I was shocked how difficult it was for me to follow her finger. She told me I have vertigo and gave me meclizine and that was it. I came home research about it and did that maneuver where you lay down and extend your head and nystagmus was present on both sides. I have tried all those different maneuvers to help you get those crystals but nothing helped. So I think with everything I have BPPV. I did call my doctor today and asked for a referral  for ENT so I will see one. But I just wanted to hear your experience. Is it common for it to be BPPV without some obvious head movement as a trigger? Because I cannot reproduce it when I move my head it just happens randomly. But everything else sounds like BPPV. I also get headaches sometimes after the attack. This is all new to me so I would appreciate any input/advice. I am curious as well. I started a week ago getting these ever so slight feelings of wooziness and light headed walking around and one time I felt faint but I recovered. Blood pressure is fine. I can lay down fine and I thought it was all from weaning off Zoloft. Maybe? But still its sometimes triggered by quick eye movement or getting up and walking around. I do not know how to tell if it is calcium crystals in my ear. I want to go see my neurologist soon. I have seen in the past for headaches. Maybe ENT now? I have been trying to research maneuvers to do at home It seems like ENT is the first person to see to get diagnosed. If it is indeed BPPV for me I will go to see a vestibular physical therapist as a next step. It is hard to do those maneuvers at home. But maybe have someone help you do a Dix-Hallpike maneuver or simply make them follow their finger with your eye and see if nystagmus is present. Interestingly enough Dix-Hallpike does not reproduce my vertigo but nystagmus occurs. \nBut since you have a neurologist if you were dealing with migraines in past there is also a vestibular migraine that has similar symptoms to BPPV. I would suggest seeing a physical therapist who specializes in the vestibular system. My ENT diagnosed me with BPPV but he passed me off to a PT to do the head maneuvers and follow up therapy.

They feel exactly the same as the other times but this time I am not able to trigger it using the Dix Hallpike. I have tried to do the Epley maneuver on both sides just to try and get it to go away but that has not worked.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this or have any ideas what I could try? Could it be something else? Currently same. I am usually always able to reset it, it worked once, but it came back for me, need to do it again but I cannot get it to go at all. I feel like I am stuck on a damn boat the urge to puke is fierce.\n\nThere is various other maneuvers you can try to see if they work better and can get it to go. I am about to try every single one I can find lol. There are other maneuvers that work if the crystal is in a different canal. Try looking up Bppv log roll. That being said, it might be worth a trip to a specialist to help figure out exactly what canal is involved. Good to hear it is not just me. Please post back if anything works. I will look up the other maneuvers too and list them here. Thanks, will look it up and have a try. Will post any outcomes. Okay I got the log roll to produce the nystagmus and it helped the nausea once I was done but it is still not 100 so I know it is not completely fixed I just cannot get it to stick. Do you have any good links to the test and treatment? Not the test, but with this one you can do it for both ears but you will know which ear it is pretty quickly. By the second move when they have your head down and then lay back down on the effected ear towards the end I got the spins.

Before my bout, I figured my lifestyle choices (e.g., dehydration, malnutrition, lying around for long periods of time) would catch up with me\u2014but, boy, did I not appreciate how they manifested through BPPV.

I began upping my water intake (i.e., one cup per hour), taking vitamin D supplements, and taking better care of my head (e.g., not jostling or knocking it around needlessly).

Interesting that you were taking Vitamin D like me. It just happened to come up in my blood test the same time I came in complaining of the dizziness. Do you feel it is made a difference?\n\nEdit: also, when you said spiralling, you meant emotionally, right? Haha, I have no idea! I feel like there is no realistic way to isolate a variable like vitamin D in my regular life when so many other factors (e.g., dehydration, low vitamin D levels, low calcium levels, a hit on the head, a dental drill, stress, etc.) could also have contributed to it.\n\nYes, definitely emotionally spiralling! \u2639\ufe0f\u2639\ufe0f", "Could anyone explain! What is the relation between bppv and vestibular migraine? My ENT warned me about vestibular migraine which I experience pre and after menstruation , it triggers same symptoms of bppv \nIs this supposed to be happening or this is irrelevant? Not a doctor, but from what I have read, Bppv can trigger vestibular migraines. Same/similar symptoms between the two.\n\nI had bppv for about a year and then it transitioned into a few years of vestibular migraines. I started taking vitex, coq10, b, d12, magnesium supplements and I got to say... it is going well! Try some supplements. Unfortunately in my experience Vestibular migraines and BPPV go hand in hand. My issues started with BPPV going misdiagnosed for months and eventually it triggered severe Vestibular migraines. I was bed bound for almost a year. Now when I have a BPPV episode I try to figure out which canale its in ASAP and get my butt into VRT as soon as possible.  In the beginning it was easy to be confused as to if I was having a migraine or BPPV. Now I can usually feel the difference and can also tell with a positive hallpike (sp?) Test for nystagmus. \n\nAlso as mentioned above; supplements have helped. I take calcium, vitamin D12, and Ginko. I hear magnesium is also a good option, but I have not added it yet. Also if you get regular Vestibular migraines Emgality has helped me a lot with the frequency and severity of my migraines, mine also revolve around my menstrual cycle. \n\nI think its nice your doctor warned you about it. Many doctors do not understand BPPV or Vestibular migraines especially not how they like to work together.\n\nI hope this was helpful.

My husband has had BPPV for about six weeks. This was his first episode and I had to call the ambulance because he could not move, was nauseous, hallucinating, and terrified. He spent two days in the hospital while they did testing and tried to knock down his nausea and spinning, give him a CAT, etc. He did receive an official diagnosis. He is been doing PT several times a day on his own and going to a PT specializing in vestibular disorders two times a week. Nothing has worked very well. He says he is about 70% better on a good day than when he was in the hospital but he is still exhausted, dizzy, and nauseated especially at the end of the day. He cannot ride his bike (he is an expert cyclist), he is afraid to drive, travel etc. Everything he enjoyed is gone. We were going to visit my family over Christmas but now he is afraid to go with me for the six hour drive (I would drive). I am afraid to leave him home by himself. We are thinking of having him spend the three nights I will be gone with a neighbor.\n\nHe also has a very stressful job and other than those two days at the hospital, he has managed to limp through his work as long as he takes a nap. He is absolutely exhausted and feeling very hopeless. He cries almost every day. I do not know how to help him and am so worried about his mental health. \n\nThanks for any insight or advice. I realize this might take months to resolve. I am not sure mentally if he can take it. \n\n&amp;#x200B; I should also add that he has been on antidepressants for several years and has been taking hemp oil to help him sleep. Other than that, no other meds.\n\n&amp;#x200B; Sorry to hear this. I think that some people that get BPPV have PTSD afterwards. I can certainly understand it. The sudden onset is terrifying and you realize how fragile life is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI suggest to get a 2nd opinion, however. It is great that your husband is visiting a specialized physical therapist. I suggest to visit a specialized doctor at a balance center. Most major cities will have a balance center. The doctor will be able to tell if he has residual BPPV or not (they will see if your husband has nystagmus when he is feeling dizzy). If they do not see any lasting BPPV, they may have other suggestions for him. This may sound weird and I have said it in other comments. When I get an attack of BPPV I have discovered I can reduce the severity of it by holding my nose and gently note *gently* blow. As if you are trying to get water out of your ears after a swim.\n\nOther than the Epley and Semont maneuvers or antivert but other than that I am not sure what treatment is available, BPPV such a rare thing. I had it for most of my life and only found out it had a name a few years ago.\n\nIt must be diet or some environmental factor I have had attacks regularly (two or three per year) then none for years, it is very random.\n\nYou can tell your husband I feel his pain it sucks there nothing worse than vertigo you cannot do anything.\n\n Thank you so much for your kind response. I will tell him. Thanks so much--I will do some investigating for a balance center.  The Epley Maneuver has been helpful for me. See a professional, though. Self-treatment *can* make it worse. For his sanity, ( is what I turn to when I do not know what else to do. Wishing him wellness! Poor dude!

I do not believe those are related to bppv... ? did he have aura or visual distortions indicating migraine?\n\nRe: support\nMy advice would be to supply him with lots of Advil/gravol/healthy meals. It is tough to be knocked out w vertigo, but he should be able to find a way out of his current state! Also never accept one doctors diagnosis, if things are not improving \u2014 find a new PT, new ent, new doctor. Definitely go to a dizziness clinic. He should be tracking his symptoms in a diary as well.\n\n All good suggestions. Thanks. ", "Had this for 5 years, just seen a Physio.

I cannot imagine going on 5 years. I will keep my fingers crossed they pinpoint something for you.", "Waiting to bend down?! Hello!\n\nSo yesterday I had the eply manevour done and I was wondering how long should I wait to get back to normal? I read on google to wait 48 hours to bend down and such- is this true? My PT did not say anything about this but I REALLLY REALLY do not want it to return- thanks! My therapist (earlier this year), told me that staying 'upright' is old news. That it does not matter. She had just been to a HUGE dizzy convention with the latest updates and news. The newest studies show it does not matter if you stay upright for 24 to 48 hours or not. She said resume normal activities immediately.  That being said, it is easy enough to stay upright (not bend over or tilt your head) for at least 24 hours and if it WOULD help, I would do it. 98% of the population will still tell you to keep your head upright for the crystal to settle.  So, I think if you can at least try for a day - that would be good.  I know I still kept my head upright, even though she said it did not matter. It is an easy thing to do. I have no idea when my crystal really returned back to where it belonged, so I know I was not being careful at that point. Thank you so much for sharing. Last night I laid down with only one pillow and got very dizzy so I started using two and also yesterday I was not careful at all after the Epley maneuver because my physical therapist didnt tell me to be careful but now I am being a little bit just because I was that miserable when the Crystal was dislodged .\n\nI am supposed to get an x-ray done but it is a standing up x-ray and I am unsure if they will have me lay down at all and I really just do not want the dizziness to return as you can imagine it is terrible which you have obviously been through also I still stayed upright and was careful for a couple days. I was willing to do all to make it go away lol but I would not limit yourself in the daytime. Try to get back into normal activities just do not do cart wheels and stuff the first week or so haha I still sleep with two pillows. More so for my neck and shoulders (Eds and car accident injuries) but sometimes it can takes more treatment of the Epley to resolve it fully. Hopefully after the first one you felt some relief. :) I definitely felt some relief after the first Epley maneuver it was a godsend. \n\nI went from being nauseous all day to like feeling really good. OK if I am OK to get back in regular activities and I will go to my x-ray today\ufffc after the epley was done on me, twice during the same visit, my ent dr told me not to move my head too fast for several days and i could not sleep on my right side (the side affected) for 5 days. it must have helped because after a couple days of minor residual affects i was back to 100%, Oh that is so good to know my therapist did not really say anything so I was not sure what to do I am still debating if I should get an x-ray today because I really do not want to have to move into a position that triggers it. And I am feeling better but I do still have a little bit of vertigo and it worries me do you exercise? i was road cycling pretty hard after about 5 days of recovery. i believe my exercise may have helped my recovery. I do exercise but I also have undiagnosed leg weakness so I am only able to do what my legs are capable of doing on that particular day it is always unknown I am also getting that figured out but before this happened I did work out all the time through walking and doing other things and also work 40 hours a week on my feet I do miss working out very much and once I get my leg weakness solved I am going to start walking and never ever ever stop. never take the ability to walk for granted I am 27 and one day I woke up and I lost it If you laid down and got the severe dizziness yet - then the Epley (or other maneuver) likely did not work.  If it was a milder dizziness (without the nystagmus), it could just be residual - and may take a while to lay flat again (or get back to normal). It DID take me quite some time before I conquered the residual dizziness and could lay flatter, and on the bad side. Just take it slow. Give yourself some time to recover. Thank you so much for your response.  Yes I am still getting some residual dizziness but overall I am so much better I can finally drive and cook and just do normal stuff the physical therapist was a godsend", "Anyone tried Vertisil? Has anyone tried this product? Did it work for you?", "BPPV after drinking alcohol? I am a 19 M. Last year in June around my birthday, I started experiencing BPPV. My family noticed it would reoccur after I have drank. It usually comes 2 days after drinking. My physiotherapist does not believe it has to do with alcohol, but I have has to visit him 5x since June to perform the epley maneuver. Has anybody experienced something similar or should I be looking at going back to the doctor? They prescribed me with a nasal spray that is purpose is to deswell my inner nose. Also had common experience with ear infections as a kid.\n\nAll help is appreciated Highly unlikely it is cause by drinking. I would call it quinncidence that it happens after drinking. Some people may have bppv once a year or twise a year or in your case frequent. But to be safe I would actually see a doctor to find out why it keeps happening so often. 1) Vertigo is a symptom. \n\n2) Alcohol changes the fluid in your ears which can cause vertigo.\n\n3) BPPV is a mechanical issue\n4) highly recommend reading historic posts in the sub I got bppv the morning after a few drinks. I believe that this was due to dehydration before i started drinking, and then obviously the dehydration from drinking. When I had bppv i tried to drink about a gallon ( of water lol) a day until it went away completely, about a week or so. Now when I drink (alcohol)  i just make sure to hydrate the day before or at least the morning of. Or at least be drinking water in between drinks. Best of luck.", "Does BPPV really go away on it is own..? Wait and see approach vs vestibular therapy? Hi everyone! \n\nI (27F) am on Week 3 of horrible BPPV. It started in the morning after rolling over in bed, I had done yoga the day before so I am thinking I must have moved crystals around flipping my head over. I saw my neurologist 2 weeks in, who diagnosed me with BPPV in the left ear. I can lay on my right ear to sleep with little problems, but if I even move my head an inch to the other side, I am flying out of bed with severe vertigo. I was given a referral to a physical therapist and scheduled a vestibular therapy appointment for the first available slot, which is the end of the week. \n\nI am absolutely terrifying of repositioning maneuvers... I tried the half somersault twice in a row last week and was sick for hours afterwards. It was a really traumatizing experience and I feel like I have developed a phobia around vertigo from the experience. I am reading online that most BPPV cases go away in 2-6 weeks, but I wanted to ask here if it is possible that this could spontaneously resolve, or if I should stop being stupid and just go in for the appointment at the end of the week to do the maneuver?\n\nI had BPPV twice before but it only lasted a few days, this is the first time that it is lasting so long so I am not sure exactly what to do...\n\nThanks! It is POSSIBLE, sure. But it is much more likely to go away with the help of a therapist!\n\nI was in the same boat as you. I had bad BPPV right at the start of lockdown in my area (March/April)so avoided an appt and tried to just do maneuvers at home. Omg, I was MISERABLE! I started only trying them right before bed so I could just sleep it off. By the time I finally scheduled an appt around 3-4 weeks later, I was exhausted. \n\nBut doing the Epley at my appt was a totally different experience- probably because she was able to properly watch my eyes and position me just right. She got it back in position on the first try and I had no nausea. \n\nIt did end up coming back out (or possibly\nI had a clump) and I ended up going back about a week later. Again, resolved in one go, for good (or at least to this point!) this time. \n\nSo- I always recommend a pro. Best of luck to you! Go to a therapist. Do not do stuff yourself, 75% of the time it does nothing really. I have had it for 15 years. Best thing you can do is eat healthy, exercise a bit, sleep well, and try and notice your triggers to minimize attacks. Had BPPV about 4 years so far - did therapy, maneuvers, etc.  It is gotten slightly less frequent (maybe &lt;10% as often) but intensity is the same.  Antivert meds helps sometimes, but also makes me drowsy, so not worth it most of the time. Not OP, but have you noticed your posture correlates with attacks? Everyone on here knows what you are going through: The horrible spinning but also the phobia/dread of doing the maneuvers. \n\nYou really need to get an experienced PT to help you out with this. It will suck, but the overwhelming odds are that after a few minutes of hell you will be so much better on the other side. That person can also teach you how to do the maneuvers if you have to do it on your own (being sick for hours afterwards is a sign that something was not right for you). \n\nI wound up in the ER after my first time and we had to wait for a PT to come on duty. When she finally showed up I was really unhappy and the first Epley made me violently sick. But the second one...well, it was like a switch was flipped and I was instantly so much better. After the third one I remember thinking to myself \"I feel like I could go into work!\". So back to your originally question....yes, it can go away on its own, but this is a time to have the professionals to help you out. \n\nGood luck Yep. If I sleep like an idiot with my head between two pillows 50/50 ill get an attack. Mostly when it is in a position not slightly \"upright\" I am curious to the cases where it goes away on its own. Does your body just adapt to it and ignore the false signals from the crystals or do the crystals dissolve or something? I had it twice years ago and it went away on its own after a couple days each time. I think the crystals can sometimes just make their way back from natural movement. \n\nI also had it happen again a few months ago in the middle of the night. I woke up and made an appt with my therapist. By the time my appt came around a day or two later, I was fine. Negative epley. Therapist said sometimes they just make their way back.", "Doctor said I have BPPV Did a post the other day about my experience with what my doctor believes is BPPV. I went to the doctors yesterday again because of my symptoms and because I have been worrying that it might be something other than BPPV. Cannot wait until my ENT appointment which might be in like December if I am lucky. \n\nThe doctors did some tests to check neurological things, bog standard test where the test your coordination and reflexes etc. Doctor said that everything looked normal in those tests and that I do not need an MRI because vertigo and the aftermaths of vertigo is almost never serious and it takes time for it to go away, and if you have any other serious problem in your brain it would have showed up in the neurological exam and that serious brainproblems do not act like this.\n\nI am currently struggling with kind of like motion sickness, feeling like I am moving when I am not, kind of swaying, rocking and sometimes being pushed and pulled in one direction. If I lay/stand/sit completely still nothing really happens, just a slight imbalance but when I do move my head/body I feel like my balance is moving slower than I am... apparently these are symptoms of an inner ear disorder.\n\nIt is so uncomfortable and gives my anxiety so my doctor prescribed me some medication which actually  is for motion sickness, nausea and anxiety all in one. Took a couple of pills yesterday and they helped a bit... still feel very anxious and scared about my situation.... :( &gt;still feel very anxious and scared about my situation\n\nCompletely understandable. For a condition that is benign it is just horrifying and you may be wondering if you will ever be able to function normally again. You will, but there will be some rough patches along the way.\n\nDid the Dr do the Epley (or related maneuvers) to try to fix this? That is they key. BPPV does not really go away on its own. If he did the maneuvers and you are significantly improved than the the residual \"drifting\" is pretty normal and it will go away. Just take it easy. Sleep propped up, avoid fast movements, and be deliberate in all your actions and think about what way your head will be before you do something.\n\nBut more important than the ENT is a Physical Therapist who deals with balance issues. That is the person you need to have on speed dial. They can diagnose which ear/canal you need to treat, make sure that the Epley is done correctly, and teach you (and whomever you bring to the appointment) the correct way to do it. A warning: when you are actually doing the exercise it is no fun at all, but once you are on the other side you will be glad you did.\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck! man this is me in a nutshell ! I literally feel like car sick , doctor did same tests as you and said no brain tumour . Which i believe because you would have more servers symptoms do you have episodes of nausea , i would\nlike to follow this as i am having same issues , doctor also described me with bppv , It is really difficult to describe my symptoms. I do not get that much vertigo any more I just get a feeling that I am floating and moving when I am not, like I am swaying or rocking etc. I also get this feel like my head and body is being pushed/pulled in one direction, or that the ground is tilting up and down randomly at times, which makes it feel weird to walk. When I move my head/body, let say I turn around, it feels like I continue to move in that direction even though I have stopped. Sometimes I have this sensation as being heavily waited. I think these symptoms have to do with something weird in the inner ear since it is so sensitive in there. I do indeed get nausea, especially in the morning when I wake up. Hopefully we get better soon :) The doctor did the Epley manoeuvre but it did not provoke nystagmus or vertigo as I feel as if my BPPV has \u201cresolved\u201d although it does not feel like it has.. I used to get vertigo, quite severe, and nystagmus as well (nystagmus is what makes the room loon like it is spinning apparently). I am just left with these weird symptoms at the moment. I have tried Epley at home several times and other exercises to like the deep head hanging excercise (saw it on YouTube) and that made the room spin but it was manageable. Does it mean that you have had lose crystals If you used to get vertigo from changing your heads position?

I felt a little nauseous and did it again and i am not nearly as dizzy as i once was doing it and it took my nausea away . You should give this a go! Great that you are feeling better! I will give it a go :) It sounds like your situation is not fully resolved. I think that you need to visit a PT. You are probably right... it is so annoying! It is really affecting my university studies... hope it resolves soon and hopefully I do not have to wait too long before I get an appointment with a PT This is so true.  I worry for all these people trying these maneuvers on their own from some video they saw on YouTube.  It is so important to know which ear is affected or if it is both. It is possible to make your situation even worse. Yes it sure is better letting a specialist to perform the manoeuvres instead!! vestibular therapy! I have the exact same issues after suffering from bppv for months. You need to retrain your eyes brain and balance system. One exercise that works for me significantly when I feel like the ground is on an angle is a peripheral vision exercise. PM me!", "My BPPV Struggle I woke up on April 21st with the room spinning, I was lying on my back and in complete panic, my screams woke up my wife. I had some very bad days where I could barely walk around, but with the help of Epley maneuvers I seemed to have gotten rid of the vertigo. However, it is 6 months later and I am still feeling residual dizziness, sometimes debilitating. My trigger is lying on my back, so that makes it much worse. I stopped drinking caffeine and starting exercising and eating better, but not much has changed. I saw an ENT a month ago and he recommended VRT. I still felt no real change. I saw him again yesterday and thinks that it should have gone away by now, so he is sending me somewhere to do more tests to localize the issue (VNG Ulmer + CDVAT). If they do not find anything he is going to send me for an MRI.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am an anxious person by default so my brain immediately jumps to me having a brain tumor or something equally terrible. I guess I am just looking for some reassurance. I am also nervous about these tests since they will probably trigger a pretty bad episode. Man sorry to hear that. I think finding a GREAT, older, experienced, ENT who specializes in balance issues was the key for me. I must have visited like 15 doctors but none of them knew what was going on. Apparently it is pretty common. There is a channel online by an Australian therapist called Joey Remini. She has interviews with people who have had to deal with a lot of shit for years. Their interviews helped me figure out and prepare.\n\nI have been in the same exact situation. First time in my life I felt totally helpless. Felt like I was disabled. It is a terrifying feeling. Give it time. Find small things that trigger and avoid them. I sleep on 2 pillows. It fucks up the sleep but it is worth it for me. Let me know if you wish to talk. I am 35M been dealing with this for 4 years. Thanks for the reply! I am 37M and it is only been 6 months but I am hopeful that this appointment can localize the issue and treat it properly. Every new doctor is a new hope to figure it out, I guess. Yes all the best! A lot of people do find solutions and get out of the woods. Hope you are one of them! I agree with above.  I watch Joey remenyu on YouTube and am halfway through her book, rock steady.  You should buy it.  I have episodes of bppv which are followed by dizziness for weeks or months.  Do not think the worst, your experience sounds similar.  My mri came back fine and I am guessing yours will too, especially since your onset was bppv.  You may now have pppd, which is often triggered by an acute episode of vertigo.  It will get better, and I suggest you read her book.  Best of luck! 27M dealing with it for 2 years now. its finally starting to get better for me but i still feel extremely limited in what i can do vs what i used to be able to do That residual dizziness combined with headaches, and other weird shit will probably take a long time to go. I have it since February, went to a lot of doctors, tested everything couple of times. It is no use, and it is the same story everywhere. I am sorry. For me personally i try to live with it. Exercise, and eating healthy helps a bit. \n\nOh and do not use headphones, I know it sounds random but i got so much better when i stopped using them! This happened to me. Minus the Epley Manoeuvres.. those did nothing for me. I have been re diagnosed over 5 times now and It just keeps changing. I have been dizzy and off balance over a year now. Some days I am bed ridden and some days I am not.. VRT has helped a bit but only minimal improvement. She said this would be a very long, slow, thing. You will have manny ups and downs. Just when I feel like I am getting better, I have a horrible flare up and am bed ridden for 1 week. She said everyone is different and some people get better within a couple months. And some take MONTHS. Even years. I must say tho. I thought the exact same thing. Brain tumour. I was in panic. I was not even 99% sure. I was 100% sure. I have had 2 MRI's and they said nope. That Is not it.. I am certainly glad you dont have a brain tumor! My situation isnt as bad, i dont feel like my issues leave me bed-ridden. I just feel really dizzy. I saw my audiologist last week, she did some epley on me (interestingly told me i shouldnt do it myself) and I felt better after but then slowly got worse over the next few days. Seeing her again and hoping for a more permanent fix. Keep us updated!! I would love to hear more! I hope it helps you!", "BPPV for more than 4 months I had my first vertigo on Sept 6th 2020 and then got EPLEY done after one month. Spinning gone after Epley and then till now I face blurred vision, Imbalance, dizziness (not spinning). I tried doing Epley if symptoms are more and last month I got BPPV on right ear(first one was on left ear). Then I went to hospital and they did Epley on right ear. Spinning stops and the same dizziness , blurred vision, imbalance from Sept still continue. Can anyone advice what is next treatment option. I do vestibular exercise and symptoms are reduced, but still not going away It comes back randomly. Have had it on and off for 15 years. Just try to find the trigger and avoid it if you keep getting it. \n\nFor me it is passing out (lots of food, stress, super tired) and not moving for 8 hours at an \u201coff\u201d angle. So I have to make sure to eat normal and get good sleep slightly propped up every night. have you seen a vestibular specialist or an ent (ear nose &amp; throat) dr? if not i recommend seeing one asap. i saw an ent. resolved my bppv issue.\n\none other note: i was told bppv is not a major ailment as long as its not causing you major issues like falling and potentially hitting your head. That is residual dizziness and all you can really do is see a vestibular specialist for help with more exercises, as far as I know. They will be able to advise you if there is any other things you can do for treatment. With my last episode, I had active BPPV for over 2 months, and suffered from the residual dizziness severely for at least 4 months after that. It was almost a year before I felt almost back to normal. I was working with a very good vestibular therapist this whole time, so I had expert guidance. We often rechecked the BPPV to make sure it was still gone - and she checked all 6 ear canals, in case the crystal moved elsewhere (and in this case, there are different maneuvers to do to 'fix' it).  During the 2ish months that I had active BPPV - we did the Epley over 20 times, and I did the half somersault at home as well.\n\nMy best advice would be to find someone that specializes in dizziness. They can help a TON. Otherwise, hang in there and keep doing what you are doing. For some of us - this lingers on for a LONG time.  My first 3 episodes were not near as bad as this last one. In case this is helpful, I have consolidated a lot of information, including advice from previous BPPV posts and comments, in ( and I am updating it as I am able. We are working to have it pinned to the top of the subreddit for easier access. I have a question. You mentioned that you had BPPV for months. I have had dizziness for about 2 months now. It is calmer now though. I went to an ENT who denied that it was BPPV because it had been so long. Can BPPV last for months? Thank you in advance! Did the ENT actually test you for BPPV? They cannot just look at you and tell you if you have it or not. If you get tested by doing simple maneuvers (most common is the Dix Hallpike) and it provokes the severe brief vertigo with nystagmus, THEN you know you still have BPPV. By watching the direction your eyes twitch during this brief vertigo, they can determine which ear canal is having trouble. There are a few other tests they do as well, to check other less common ear canals. \n\nSo yes - my BPPV was active for over 2 months. And this was verified weekly by my vestibular therapist who tested me each week. Some people have stubborn cases and it takes a long time to go away. We were treating it with maneuvers once weekly, then twice weekly.\n\nI was left with residual dizziness - and that is a whole different monster. I felt horrible for MONTHS after my BPPV was resolved. But dizziness is different from the BPPV vertigo. It is still very unpleasant. More like waves of milder dizziness. I had this for close to 8 months, and still some lingering problems.\n\nGoogle Dix Hallpike and perform that test on yourself. Be aware that if you do still have active BPPV, it will provoke the vertigo when you lay back. If you test both the right and left side and have no symptoms, likely your BPPV is resolved.  OR - it could be one of the less common forms of BPPV effecting a less common ear canal.\n\nBest wishes to you in finding some relief! (and on a side note - many of us have found that 'specialists' often really do not diagnose and treat properly. It took me a while to find a vestibular therapist that specializes in dizziness to truly diagnose and treat me.) Thank you so much! My ent did do the maneuver and I am assuming there was no nystagmus. I am going in for an MRI tomorrow.", "Where are you guys from?

I usually sleep on my right side, but should I be sleeping on my left side instead after doing the exercise? \n\nLast night while sleeping, I do not know what happened but I randomly got vertigo. I might have accidentally turned from my right to my back or something.", "Not sure if BPPV? Hi there! I am new to this and I have a question that hopefully someone can help! A few years back I went to an ENT for dizziness and was diagnosed with BPPV. It has not been too much of a bother since except in the past month or two I have had a handful of extreme dizziness. Until today, they only happened when I was in the car and looking around or when I was tilting my head a certain way.\n\nHowever, today I had a sudden episode while I was just sitting at work, looking at my laptop. The dizziness feels like something shifts in my head (typically the sensation is in my forehead and left ear) and I am dizzy for about a minute. \n\nAfterwards, my head feels fragile with some slight pressure. My understanding of BPPV is that it is only brought on by head movement so I am not sure if that is what is going on. Anyone have any insights? BPPV can be diagnosed via the Dix Hallpike test. When performed you will experience a sensation of the room spinning around, known as nystagmus. If you experience this then there is a good chance you have it. General dizziness can occur if some otoconia has been displaced and your brain has acclimated to it. In my experience it means that performing Dix Hallpike would definitely trigger vertigo. \n\n\n I had multiple instances of BPPV episodes triggered while still or almost still (one was while I was watching tv, comfortably laying back on the sofa). Ugh - I have been living for 6+ years with intermittent dizzyness of what you have described. Brings on stress, anxiety and makes work tough. \n\nMore insulting for me is that I can have days or months without any episode and then BOOM it hits. I too was tested for BPPV and up until now (last week) I could not trigger severe vertigo. Prior the vertigo was so mild the PT could not suggest which ear or canal we could work on. \n\nMy theory is that I have had \u201cdebris\u201d in one of my ears for a long time that maybe has built up over time and then bang I am now I am having the full on event. \n\n\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nWhat did work prior to having the full on vertigo was doing gaze stability exercises 3 times a day and after 6 months I could tell I was noticeably better on my feet and the dizzy episodes at work settled down.", "READ BEFORE POSTING # Have you checked the following for answers?\n\n* ( This post contains a preface (that should be read in case you do not have BPPV), as well as general information about BPPV (i.e., background, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention).\n* **\"Tip\" flair.** On the Reddit mobile app, tap the green \"Tip\" flair on a post to show all posts tagged as containing a tip.

So even though it has not disappeared completely, since doing these stretches I feel much more in command of my own body which is great :) I know I am making it sound like cheese cake but the first time I attempted these stretches I simply could not. I would go and throw up constantly. I felt like an astronaut in training when they make them go through all the motion tests. I hope your eyes begin to feel better :) 15 lbs of solid gold is worth about $385031.57. 15 lbs is 6.81 kg sorry to hear that :( hopefully this goes away for you soon man did you try it ? really hope it works for u Have you been diagnosed by a doctor? BPPV vertigo lasts less than a minute and can be triggered by head movements until it is resolved. See a doctor and a vestibular therapist. Did you figure it out? How is it going? thx mate! hopes the same for you! it is a debilitating disease, more than people think! it really takes joy out of life Mine was similar. I woke up with dizziness, was bed ridden for 2 weeks, It has now been over a year and I am still dizzy all the time with no relief from the dizziness! I heard from many doctors that it takes months to years for full recovery! some days are better than others! sometimes I feel getting better, other days I feel like it is getting horribly worse ... I wish I could understand this shit yes it helped a ton thank you!! feel much better after doing ur guy\u2019s suggested stretches :) thanks a lot !! That is great! If it comes back soon, do not panic. It is very common for it to re-occur within the first year. Hi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo nights ago I turned in bed. World started spinning immediately. The spinning is now gone but there is still \"odd\" feeling. Like fog and stuff. Is it normal? I think the nervous system gets taxed so much when the world is spinning and when it try to compensate that maybe this is after effect of the bppv? Does it go away ever? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have to say; I have experienced bone fractures, muscle ache, almost everything; this is by far the worst \"disease\" I know. I read about Meniere's, where the spinning effect can take hours. I can only imagine what kind of hell that is. I wish this fucking disease to no one. It is horrible. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne good thing about this; it really kicked me in the butt to take a grab from my diet, sleep, exercise. If I have slightest possibility to prevent this, I will do anything for it. My mind is now totally \"healthy lifestyle\" -mode. This was my third attack. First one I experienced in 2012, second one last September and third one now. I have been eating poorly (high sodium), fast food, etc. I think it has somehow linked to your lifestyle but it is also genetics I believe. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny comments? Same thing for me! Woke up with head spinning when i turned to my left on Wednesday and I had the epley maneuver done at the doctors office yesterday. No more vertigo for me, but still have an odd/off balance feeling. I read that it eventually does go away (can take days to weeks) and it is normal to feel funny even after you get the epley maneuver. Glad I am not the only one experiencing this!", "I think I may have BPPV Hi guys, I think I may have bppv. I have been feeling suddenly dizzy when I look up/down. I also feel dizzy if I turn my head when I am laying down. I woke up twice with the room spinning this morning. All day, I have been feeling dizzy and I am currently laying down and I feel like I am rocking on a boat. This only started 3 days ago as well. Is there anything I could do to help with vertigo? I cannot go to the doctor right now because it is unsafe where I live. Any advice will help, thank you. My medication makes mine worse. Check your leaflet in the box, if you take any meds?\n\nYou can maybe try this out\n\n nope, i have not taken any meds. \n\ni will check out the video. thank you so much :)   thank you!", "after vertigo attack anybody else have small waves of that vertigo feeling that only lasts for a second or two and they come out of no where, then all of a sudden the \u201cbig\u201d attack comes for like 10 seconds and this process is just repeated over and over? also when i move my right leg during those small waves i get more dizzy", "Medication on bppv Hi guys, I had my first vertigo episode 2 nights ago and did not know it was that scary. I am a 37yo male currently on medication for diabetes, asthma, and anxiety disorder. I did some research on vertigo and it does point out to bppv as the symptom only happens when I turn my head to the left while lying down. So I went to see an ENT today, and she said she suspected bppv and prescribed Betahistine 24mg (Betaserc) to be taken for a week. However the ENT did not want to to do the epley manuevre until next week. I tried to do the epley before seeing the ENT and freaked out when the vertigo started to happen so was a bit dissappointed that the Dr did not do it at the office. My question is, does anyone have any success while being on this medication without doing the epley manuevre? Or this medication does work only for Meniere\u2019s disease and not for bppv patients (I read that it was usually prescibed for Miniere\u2019s). I am not familiar with that medication.  Since BPPV is actually a dislodged crystal in the inner ear canal, medications cannot actually fix it. Meds CAN help alleviate the symptoms for some. Studies have shown that the displaced crystal can dissolve on its own, but it may take up to 6 months. The Epley (or other maneuvers to work on other ear canals) is the best and quickest way to resolve BPPV.  Unfortunately, doing the maneuver DOES provoke symptoms as the crystal works it is way around the ear canal. Take comfort in knowing the severe vertigo when doing the Epley only lasts up to 30 seconds as you change positions. Try to ride it out and get though the maneuver.  It is strange that the ENT did not want to do the maneuver. Is there a vestibular therapist (often found in the PT department) or dizzy specialist you can get into see? I also took Betaserc for a week - at my doctor friend\u2019s recommendation. I am not sure it really helps, but I was happy to take it, even as a placebo. Similarly, my BPPV only happened when I turned my head to the right while lying in bed, so I made sure to avoid that, and I tried my best to control my anxiety the rest of the day. I was actually so happy and relieved that I could function normally during the day. I still had it a week after the first vertigo episode - I accidentally rolled over in my sleep one morning. Then, one week after the onset of my bppv, I had a mild dizinness and just felt off for 4 or 5 days, then boom - back to normal. I finally found the courage to change head positions while lying - I did this already a few times, and I am fine. Bppv can return and I understand there is nothing to do about it... but try not to worry too much. The good news is that it goes away on its own after a while. Hold on tight! Thanks for your comment. I agree with you that it might reduce the symptom but not solving the root of the problem. I still have the vertigo effect when I turn my head to the left, despite 2 days into medication. I have tried 3 secs the most with the Epley technique, before giving up due to the dizziness. In your experience, will it take 30 secs or more before the symptom starts to subside? It is weird that the ENT did not want to do it right away since she diagnosed it as bppv. Thanks for your comment. It is amazing that you had relief without doing the maneuvre as I read the crystal would dissolve on its own in 6 months. I noticed the medication has helped alleviate the symptoms a bit, but the problem is still there when I turn my head while lying down. Hope I would have the same luck as you for it to heal on its own, as I cannot stand the dizziness when doing the Eppley manouvre myself. Betahistine did not help me at all. I also suffer anxiety so I feel for you, and was also wishing there was another solution besides vestibular therapy. \n\nThe treatments were so difficult to stick with but take comfort that there is a high success rate. Take some Ativan before you go, hunker down and let them throw you around a bit and look at your eyes. It gets better, I promise. Thank you for your encouragement. Will certainly take an anxiety pill before doing the proscedure. It sucks when you have anxiety and the feeling of waiting for the panic to come, only that you know this will definitely appear, the violent vertigo during the proscedure. I think the longest nasty wave of vertigo I had while doing the Epley was 27 seconds. I had times where it only lasted 16 seconds.  It typically took around 6 seconds to start the vertigo once I was laid back.  I believe I remember my therapist saying that if the vertigo does not subside in about 30 seconds - it is something else. She talked to me a lot during my Epley to help keep my mind busy and distracted from the vertigo as she moved me through the different positions.  After the vertigo subsides in each position, stay in that position for at LEAST 30 seconds (and up to 2 minutes) to let the crystal settle before moving to the next position. For me, it helped to close my eyes while the vertigo was there. And stay calm if you can (anxiety makes it worse).  Know that it will pass. I also initially took Zofran (anti-puking) meds before doing the Epley. Towards the end, after numerous appointments with my therapist and about 15 Epley with her, she had me do them at home, as I knew the technique well.  It does help to have someone help you, as keeping your head in the proper position is key.\n\nI agree that it is strange that the ENT did not want to do the Epley right away. I do not understand that. It is possible she could have corrected it right away for you - versus waiting another week.  I saw many people (ER doc, regular doc, ENT, neurologist) before finding the vestibular therapist.  None of those others could really help me. Dizziness was not their 'thing.' Hey! It is only fair to let you know my vertigo is back as of this morning. I have had a week or so of careless sleeping and turning to whichever side I liked, well not anymore. But I saw it coming. I felt a bit weird last night when I put my head on the pillow - somehow dizzy and anxious, so it is not really surprising. I panicked less than the first time, though it still takes me a while to get back to sleep after this.", "I have vertigo and I followed the steps to determine if it is BPPV, but I did not feel anything different in both sides. Can I still try the Epley Maneuver? I tried following those steps:\n\n```\nSit on your bed so that your head will hang over the edge when you lie down.\nTurn your head to the right and lie down quickly.\nWait one minute. If you feel dizzy, the right side is affected.\nIf you do not feel dizzy, sit up, wait a little bit and repeat the test with your left side.\nIf you feel dizzy when you repeat the test, your left side is affected.\n```\n\nBut I did not feel any side more dizzy than the other, just the same constant dizziness I have been feeling all day long. If it is BPPV, I cannot determine for sure which side is it. Can I still do the Epley Maneuver on both sides, or can that be harmful? BPPV is positional, you should have a stronger spinning on one side when testing for it, also your eyeballs will move really quickly involuntary, someone can watch for that while you test. The most common form (which the Epley maneuver treats) is sometimes called top shelf vertigo, because tipping your head up or down will bring on the vertigo. If you have constant spinning that probably means it is not BPPV. That being said I have been diagnosed with BPPV and lately I do not have the vertigo as much as I just have a motion sickness sort of feeling all the time, so your best bet would be to see a doctor. Yea, I definitely do not feel a stronger spinning in either sides, and my eyeballs do not move or shake at all (my gf watched and recorded). This is worrying, if it is not BPPV then I have no idea what is causing me to feel dizzy all day long. Thanks for all the info, I will see what a doctor has to say. There could be a lot of things, sinus infection, blood pressure...I know it is hard not to worry, hope you get an answer quickly. I did the epley maneuver myself too and nuthin. Then I went to a PT that specialized in vestibular disorders and she did it to me, threw myself off the table the spinning was so bad. So...have a professional do it. I second this.\n\nI also tried it on my own and all I did was in spin every direction and not be able to tell which ear was affected because it all felt the same. \n\nWent to a pt and they were able to do it correctly and I DEFINITELY knew which ear had BPPV bc the spinning was way worse. \ud83e\udd22 I was not able to do it correctly because I told her to stop. It was too much. I may go back but I have ptsd from the session. \ud83e\udd2e I understand. I did too but it is almost like you have to feel worse to feel better. I am glad I got it over with. I just fear it coming back eventually and having to do it again. \ud83d\ude29 Same since it is subsided on its own but lingering ever so lightly but feel like it could come back any second, esp at night laying down. It is a trip. Went to an acupuncturist to deal with the allergies and going to make an appointment with an ENT to check my ears.", "DISCOVERY! Headphones has been causing my recent bouts of vertigo They are noise-cancelling good quality headphones and previously I did not notice any connection in attacks with wearing the headphones. This is presumably because it only gradually aggravated it to the point I did not notice. But for the last 2 weeks, I did not wear them as an experiment and sure enough I stopped having attacks. I still have tinnitus (always have) but a lot less (maybe none?) vertigo. Will be over the moon if this helps someone else. You might be on to something! I only owned one pair or noise-canceling earbuds and it was from January 2019 till sometime earlier this year and all my vertigo happened within that time frame. hmmm Hmm.. I use Bose QC35 II headphones but I am currently not using them as much due to technical difficulties switching between face chat apps. I noticed less vertigo as well. I am going to have to test this on myself. Right before I got hit with my first ever bout of Vestibular Neuritis near the end of April, I had my Turtle Beach M1 earbuds in.\n\nMaybe you are on to something. It would make sense for the vibrations (the sound delivered right into your ears) to dislodge some of the crystals - at least in ppl who are susceptible to bppv for other reasons. So plausible for a mechanically induced ailment like BPPV! Others have discovered the same thing\n\n ( \n\nAnd this:\n\n ( I posted here five months ago asking if anyone noticed a connection between the airpods and vertigo. I got vertigo have I was gifted my airpods for Christmas and I remember using the noise cancelling function for a long period of time.\n\nIdk if it is the noise cancelling of just wireless headphones/earphones in general This might be me! I keep my Samsung ear buds in a lot, and loud, for weeks on end. I have never had an issue until last week, i started getting little waves of vertigo and mild anxiety attacks. I was thinking this too Okay I am a bit late to this but I definately think this is what is happening to me!!! \nI bought my first pair of in-ear noise cancelling earbuds like six months ago; I had my very first bout of vertigo only 4 days after I started using them, but did not make the connection...\n\nI have since been to an ENT about this (+ other tinnitus/hearing issues) and I brought it up to him but he did not really address that it could be a factor.\n\nCurrently I am on my 3rd day of a vertigo episode, I have been using those earbuds quite a lot during this time, but now I will stop and see if that helps! meh. just had a quick one today so I guess the theory does not necessarily check out I have been lifting heavy with my wireless ear bud headphones before my first BPPV episode, maybe i will switch to speakers and see if that helps. Thanks for this. I also have been having vertigo on and off for the last few weeks. I have been using qc35 since COVID hit. Went to the docs and were given bvvp exercises and find they are helping me. \n\nI will stop using them from today and see if that fixes everything. Did it help?", "Bppv back again. Hi everyone!\nI have posted and commented here several times about the recurrent BPPV attacks. Last night it came back after almost 3 months bppv free! It is mild thank God and mostly  when i look down but still very frustrating! I honestly just do not know what to do or how to handle it anymore. If it comes back mild then it can come back severe! It is a condition that cannot be controlled i mean how do you control the freakin crystals in your ear? There is no medicine to keep them intact and prevent them from dislodging! I certainly cannot keep going to a vestibular therapist or audiologist every 3 months! I have been taking vit D for 6 months. I hate that this is a hopeless condition..every time i have made progress with the residual dizziness and came close to saying goodbye to it i get another attack again!! Like im having that mild internal spinning sensation as i sit down to write this post and my head is a little swimmy. I really do not know what to do or how to feel at this point. I wanted to be someone who gave hope that dizziness got better and it could be just a memory in your life but I afraid there will not ever be a night without the fear of it happening again! \nAny tips or good news? Any tips if i should start learning the maneuvers and do them myself? Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Did it come back while you were sleeping and wake you up? Yes..dont know if it woke me up or if i felt it when i woke up in the middle of the night..it is better now but im a little lightheaded I have a similar story.  Mine has recurred about 8 times in the past year.  It is frustrating.  I have gotten so when I have those off days I do the maneuver.  Mine is always my left ear for some reason.  I also get the residual dizziness that lasts a long time, where I cannot tell if I have the bppv again or just the dizziness.  In some ways you have to embrace it as a new normal and know thatbits not dangerous and that you need to be gentle with yourself.  The more you focus on it and get angry the more you encourage your brain to look for it and pay attention to it.  I really like the book rock steady by Joey remenyi.   You will be fine and it will eventually get better!  Hang in there! Thanks for your reply. What makes the bppv so frustrating is that it is a mechanical problem, crystals that dislodge and move freely in the semicircular canals so that is something I do not think the brain can ignore like other dizziness cases where neuroplasticity can work. I was reading annd watching youtube videos on neuroplasticity to cure PPPD which i think i got after my initial labyrinthitis 6 months ago and the subsequent bppv attacks. I was really feeling hopeful that eventually i would make a complete recovery and that all those weird sensations would eventually go away 100%, but then the spinning came back last night and I just do not know how to live in quarterly cycles of spinning-residual dizziness-spinning!! How can i accept this as my new normal? I have 2 kids who are 7 and 1 and all i feel like doing right now is just crumbling in bed and not do anything or talk to anyone\u2026there is no hope for bppv or a permanent cure and it makes me sooo sad. This is honestly getting too much on my brain! For 6 months I have had some kind of dizziness and I do not know how to take it anymore now that I know this is a hopeless case. I cant go to a PT again for maybe the 20th time this year!!So sorry for ranting so negatively about this. Very sorry to anyone reading this about the negative vibe! I just cannot help it right now.  I just want my old life back before all that started! Same here.  My theory is it is because of the position I am sleeping in (on my back head tilted in a weird position.)\n\nI am only sleeping on my side or stomach with a pillow and (knock on wood) so far it is OK.\n\nTry only sleeping in these positions and if you want to train yourself to do it, tie a tennis ball on your back so every time you roll over you will wake up. Thanks for the tip. I usually try not to roll over fast and i wake up and roll myself gently to the other side. But last night i woke up and  looked quickly to the right because my kid was awake and bam! I also know from a therapist that changing positions or moving the head doesnt cause it its not what makes crystals dislodge. I just it want it to go away for at least a year! &gt;  I also know from a therapist that changing positions or moving the head doesnt cause it its not what makes crystals dislodge.\n\nwhat causes it then? Well she says other factors like having underlying causes like meniere\u2019s or vestibular migraines. Other risk factors include vitamin D deficiency, high blood pressure. She says u cant cause bppv by moving ur head it just triggers the sensation of spinning if that makes sense. weird, then why does moving your head put them back in place... A lot of factors can play a part: allergies, low sugar, stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, dehydration, too much caffeine, medicine changes, weather and our own minds sabotaging ourselves. Keep a journal, list when you are dizzy, what happened before and after... What helped, what did not. See if there is a connection. I spent months in a dizzy world, it was rough. Hi thank you!\nYes I know all of these are factors and I had been avoiding them but just dont know still happening.\nHave u been able to stop or reduce your bppv attacks? My vestibular PT told me that for recurrent bppv, look for an underlying condition and try to keep it in control as much as possible. Things like high blood pressure, migraine, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease  and diabetes are comorbidities for bppv. I do not know the exact specifics but with those conditions, more crystal particles tend to slough off, and then higher chance of them getting into your semicircular canals and causing issues. Ur absolutely right, that is what i know from one vestibular therapist too\u2026i have not been diagnosed with any of those though..only vit D deficiency and i have been taking that for 6 months and im probably in the not sufficient level now..maybe that is why! Absolutely! When I read about the vitamin d connection several years ago and started taking it religiously, I did not have any attacks for 5 years. But I can imagine it can take some time to build up the levels in your body. I also recently read a study to take calcium as well for recurrent bppv How often were u having them before you increased your vit D level? Have you had attacks lately? Prior to taking the vitamin d, I would get them usually 2 times a year\u2026Spring and fall. Truly believe that allergies cause mine. \n\nSo I got an attack in March. And I was self treating with foster maneuvers cos I was too scared to do epley on my own. So it kept going away and coming back. Finally went to see a legit vestibular physical therapist and she tested me. I had bilateral bppv. The one on the right side went away with 1 epley. However because of all the self treatment, my left sided turned into cupulolithiasis (particles stuck to cupula instead of free floating in canals), which is harder to treat. So I have been in PT for it since September. It is slowly going away though, as each session my nystagmus time goes down. Sorry that you are going through this too! My last attack in August was cupulithiasis type as well if i remember right, went away in 2 or 3 sessions do do not worry it does go away.\nI did the epley myself this time because i thought it was unilateral so i just though what the heck im going to do it, it worked i guess my nystagmus is like 95% gone..\nDo you usually get residual dizziness? Yes. And usually the residual dizziness is worse for me than the actual bppv spinning. That was another reason why I started PT cos I have a feeling once these crystals are finally back in the right place I will need a general course of vestibular rehab to reset my brain. I hate residual dizziness too! I had progressed so well right when that last attack hit and now i just feel too tired to go through it again even though it is not that bad this time! But again the rocky boat sensation and imbalance, mild but annoying because man they had gotten so much better and now i got to feel it again? I need a break \ud83d\ude05 i love this subreddit though it keeps me going, the support of people going through the same makes it better! I am right there with you. I had an attack, then 3 months of peace, then back again this time in a different ear. I do the maneuvers myself and have not had vertigo in six weeks but I have had the residual effects the entire time that will not go away..sucks.\n\nI started getting BPPV right after I got vaccinated, apparently it is a pretty common issue but if you mention possible vaccine side effects on Reddit you become a leper. Oh my God!! Same for me, the whole thing started 2 weeks after my first pfizer shot!! Started with labyrinthitis then bppv after bppv, not sure if its scientifically related and will probably not know, but in my head they are related If the science cannot explain why the vaccines cause heart inflammation or blood clots, they would have no idea why they would cause neurological or vestibular issues either. I just wish it would never come back! Good luck to you Yes, I did. I had a mastoid effusion, and once I took the right medicine for it, it cleared up. Sometimes I am still really off balance, but nothing like before. Sending you virtual hugs. I have been dizzy since March and as a parent, it really freaking sucks. I just want to crumble too. \n\nA suggestion\u2014- if you are getting recurrent bppv with no known underlying condition\u2026 is having inner ear testing done. I believe it is called a VNG. It is a whole battery of testing that can reveal any other vestibular deficits that you may have that can be exacerbating the bppv. \n\nFair warning, the testing can make you dizzy as hell. But it can give you and your doctor some insight as to what is going on. \n\nThat testing is next on this lovely vestibular journey for me. My PT wants to resolve my current cupulolithiasis before I get it done. It is testing that I have put off for YEARS because I have been too scared. But at this point I will do anything for relief/get to the root cause. Thank you!\nI have done the VNG many times before, also the caloric test once and I could not repeat it again. Those revealed labyrinthitis of the left ear so that was probably the reason I got the recurring vertigo attacks . But that was 6 months ago! So why am i still having them if the inflammation shouldve eased off by now u know what i mean. The reason i do not want to go into further testing is because what is the point you know! Im sure i have hypofunction on my left ear but There are no medications for it or for most vestibular issues and no stopping the bppv from recurring. All there is will be VRT exercises, time and supplements. Maybe betahistine which i took for 2 months but gave me headaches sometimes. It is something the body has to heal on its own and im not sure how it can do that when my crystals are so weak and keep breaking off every couple of months!\nSometimes i do not know if it is easy or hard.Im not doing badly im just not the way i used to be physically or emotionally because of not really fully understanding what im dealing with since i have other symptoms, oscillopsia being the most concerning for me. It is hard having to push with kids but im trying to take it easy.\nThanks again and wish you a speedy recovery.", "Bppv? I know about a million people have asked this already, so I am sorry I am advance. For the past few years I have experienced what I think is vertigo. I will be standing or sitting and suddenly I will have the sensation that I am moving or turning when I am not and these episodes only last for a few seconds. I have had the occasional episode where I will be in bed or wake up one morning and everything feels like it is spinning, but it does not happen often. The dizziness or vertigo when I am standing or sitting happens way more frequently. \n\n\nI only ask if this is bppv because most people do not describe their vertigo the same way I describe mine. From the posts I have read here, most people have the \u201croom is spinning\u201d vertigo while laying down, so I am confused. Any help is appreciated! I have heard BPPV be referred to as \"top-shelf\" syndrome, because looking up at the top shelf can cause symptoms. I have had symptoms when lying down, walking, driving, and nearly anything else. What seems to be important in my case is head position, or sometimes head movement. Sometimes tilting my head to the left will do it no matter the position I am in, sometimes looking up. You might want to try experimenting with different head positions and see if you notice any change. I think it is different from case to case, but the sudden onset with a few seconds to settle that you describe sounds consistent.\n\nOf course the only person that will be able to say for sure is a medical professional, so if possible I would suggest seeing one. You may also get some relief from meclizine. Good luck! If it is a form of BPPV, there are 6 inner ear canals that can be effected. It is from an otolith (calcium crystal) that has gotten loose &amp; is floating around your inner ear canal. That why a quick shift of the head in a certain direction causes a brief, severe wave of vertigo, often with nystagmus (eye twitching) as the crystal moves &amp; settles again.\n\nOften a vestibular therapist or dizzy specialist can help diagnose way better than an ENT or neurologist. They will put giggles on to video your eye twitching as they do positional moves to test all 6 ear canals. Then they can help perform the proper maneuvers to get the crystal back. It may take more than one session to 'fix' the vertigo. The most common test is the Dix Hallpike. You can even try it at home to determine which side is effected. The Epley Maneuver is also the most common treatment. It took over 2 months and 20 Epley (and Half Somersault) to cure me.... And then I was left with residual dizziness for 7 months. Still dealing with it.\n\nThis sub has some good info on those subjects if you take the time to search. There are some good video links as well. Best course of action is to get a professional diagnosis. Some have self diagnosed &amp; cured their BPPV.\n\nBest wishes! Keep us posted on your progress.

So you arent alone at least. :) Yep. It is more of a pressure for me in general but very bad migraine before.

It is definitely worse for a few seconds if I move my head suddenly in any direction (and more spinny than floaty, surely those are the scientific terms for it), but the mild floatiness is constant. It is also worse if I am lying down on my right side than my left (which is how I know which side to do the Epley on). It varies in severity, but it is usually pretty mild - I have never had problems walking during an episode, or any real nausea or vomiting. \n\nThe Epley maneuver absolutely helps; it makes me feel measurably better in the short term, and if I do it a few times a day, the floatiness gets milder and milder day by day. It is never really interfered with my life but it is 1000% annoying and distracting. \n\nI am at (fingers crossed) the tail end of a bout right now, that started in mid-April. This is my third bout of vertigo in the 8 years since I was diagnosed. \n\nA super weird thing I have noticed, and was curious if anyone else experienced this - when I am on a  bus, my symptoms completely vanish. It does not work on the train, and it does not work in a car, and bizarrely, it still works on the bus even if the bus is stopped at a light and not moving. I live in Chicago, and the last time I had this, I went out of my way to take buses wherever I had to go, just so I would have a few minutes of feeling normal. That has not been super possible this time around, because I have not had a ton of places to go while things are still a bit locked down, and it also feels dumb to take public transit \\*recreationally\\* during a global pandemic, lol. Now that I am vaccinated I have actually taken a few bus rides to get places, and it still works like a charm. The second I step off the bus, the floatiness is back, but for the few minutes that I am riding, it is heaven. I mentioned this to the poster below you, but, for your residual dizziness, maybe check the ( for mention, in the treatment section, about persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD)?\n\nRegarding your experience with buses, what an interesting finding! I tried Googling \"PPPD bus\" (PPPD is still rather new, and finding information about these two variables in particular would have been unlikely, but I wanted to give it a shot anyway)--but I ended up with porn results. \ud83d\ude11 Will try other keywords.\n\nGood luck resolving this, and happy posting on Reddit! I also get the floating after a bout of BPPV. Doing some gaze stability exercises tends to help me, might work for you.\n\nHope you feel better! Interesting. I have noticed my residual BPPV symptoms almost disappear when I am cycling. I assumed it was the distraction, but obviously I have no idea why I feel better. Almost as soon as I get off the bike they come back. BTW - it is actually a recumbent trike so no balance issues. This! There have been many names for this over the years... chronic dizziness, mal debarquement syndrome, now pppd. All essentially the same thing. PT can help. I also get a floating feeling that is more uneasy, or 'off' than anything. \n\nI used to live in a big city and would take trains and public transit and never had an issue. I also never felt the uneasy feeling when driving myself. Exactly! My bppv is just like that. 24/7 floatyness and offness. Im so happy that someone can relate to it Thank you so much for this! I had read through the guide but somehow missed the part about PPPD. My doctor did not mention this - altho since I was diagnosed 8 years ago, she probably would not have known about it. This makes so much sense to me, especially the connection to anxiety (which is *definitely* an issue for me).   \n\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed, my doc sent me to a physical therapist who did the Epley maneuver for me a few times, and then had me do a bunch of random balance exercises, including gaze stabilization ones. At the time I thought I really only needed the Epley to get the stones back in place, and he was just trying to pad out his hour with me with other stuff. So cynical! :) This time around I figured I could just do the Epley myself to get out of it, but I think the next time this happens I might go straight back to physical therapy and get the full treatment. Yeah, I also thought the Epley maneuver would be the end of my BPPV episode--and then I had residual dizziness. Thankfully, that resolved quickly for me, but it has remained much longer for others. There are quite a few suggestions in the quick guide to help with that, so \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e that hope (that there may be _something_ people have not yet tried) will help pull people out of their misery. It was the hopelessness, I remember, that was the most debilitating. I went to the doc last week for that boat like feeling. She mentioned BPPV as a possibility. I am seeing an audiologist in the near future for some testing. But your description is what I have to a tee almost. I do not ride the bus, but car rides do help me.", "my vertigo will not leave and now it is making me really concerned. i seen an ear specialist a while ago and he told me that i probably had bppv and to see him if it got any worse. so my vertigo has gotten worse to where i cannot even get a good nights sleep and it will not leave if i lay down. is this close to what you guys have? please get back to me ASAP! If it is BPPV, YouTube the Eply Maneuver to help deal with it for now. Long term, you are going to want to see your doctor about a potential ear infection in the ear that is causing it. If it is caused by an ear infection, you will get some ear drops (steroids), or tablets, that will get rid of the infection and the vertigo. Although the vertigo might take some time to completely go away (for me it was 2-4 weeks after the infection had gone). i tried the epley but it has not worked yet, going to keep trying it. i am just very concerned that this vertigo could be caused by something life threatening or something that can ruin my quality of life. Does your vertigo only happen when you lay down and when your head is upright goes away? Does it happen on one side or both or all the time even when you are upright? Does it come and go and how long does it last? Do you have any ringing in the ear or full ear sensation? These are all symptoms that will determine what kind of vertigo you have and how to treat it. It is better to get an MRI to rule out anything central and most probably it will be a peripheral issue( ear related). Do not worry vertigo is annoying as hell but not a serious life threatening issue and eventually your brain adapts and gets rid of it through a natural process called compensation. That specialist sucks if all he did was dx you, you should have been referred to a physical therapist or technician in his office at least to help provide treatment. That is like seeing the MD and they say you have the clap without prescribing antibiotics. That specialist sucks if all he did was dx you, you should have been referred to a physical therapist or technician in his office at least to help provide treatment. That is like seeing the MD and they say you have the clap without prescribing antibiotics. I have been re diagnosed SO MANNY TIMES. I have been dizzy like this over a year now, no relief ! My recent diagnosis is PPPD! it is only when i lay down but it is constant when i am lying down Maybe that is bppv..it happens when lying on one  side and sometimes both..a vestibular therapist can help you..manuevers are done to put crystals back where they belong..", "I do not think I have bppv but I need some assistance I woke up today and the room was spinning and if I move my head or close my eyes it feels so weird and I become naeusus, please help Could signal an ear infection. You really need a Dr. to diagnose. Look up the Epley proceduce on you tube and try that to see if it helps at all. Sounds like BPPV.", "Given my circumstance, should I see an ENT? I am not experiencing vertigo at the moment but I did February 2020 and I went to an ENT week after week to do the Epley and while I did not have symptoms it never actually went away (when the doc lowered me I felt it) \n\nThen covid hit and I never went back. Every now and then I feel \"off\" it could be nerves or just anxiety but do you think I should go back to do an Epley?\n\nMy main concern is that I am afraid. I hate getting the manuever because that feeling when the world spins sucks. I am also afraid because that means this shit never went away, and I may have a serious problem and it may never go away. Or maybe being lowered will bring it back.\n\nThoughts? What should I do??? The thing about BPPV is that it needs to be managed. \n\nMight not hurt to go back and have the ENT do the Dix-Hallpike to see if you need another maneuver\u2026 ? While the spins suck in the short term, it is probably worse in the long run to not address it at all. Agreed.\n\nThere is a crystal in a canal. It needs to be moved out of the canal for the problem to stop. Yup, I do not believe the crystal will dissolve on its own in the canal, it has to be guided back to the vestibule. What is equally as bad as the vertigo spins is the aftermath \"off\" feeling everyone seems to get.\n\nI think theres a correlation between how long the crystal is allowed to cause vertigo and how long the post correction recovery takes. If the brain gets used to compensating for the crystal, i think it can take a lot longer to recover and return back to normal. \n\nMy first episode occured at 4am when I woke up to the room spinning...I had no idea what was going on so I just tried to go back to sleep after the spinning stopped. After closing my eyes for more than 30s, everything would start to spin even with my eyes closed. This lasted for a few days...then I started researching, did a self dix-hallpike and identified the right ear with nystagmus. Did an epley but I do not think I held it long enough. I tried the foster somersault and I believe that got it. The residual off feeling phase lasted about a week after that. During the 'off' phase it was difficult sleeping as I felt when I closed my eyes for more than a few minutes my eyes would want to move and then I would instinctively open them. Eventually it stopped after a week.\n\n3 months went by with no problems and then a few days ago I had another episode, again in bed, when I rolled from my right to left side. Then when I sat up the room started spinning. This time I was on it right away, and identified it as the left ear this time with nystagmus. Did another epley and somersault...did not quite get it because it came back in the afternoon when I was laying down again. Did another epley and then somersaults every hour or so .have not had it again in 3 days so far, I do not feel nearly as dizzy or uncoordinated as I did last time. This time I can keep my eyes closed and not feel any movement or spins.\n\nHope you feel better. Glad you have got the tools now to know what to do and the experience to know what to expect.\n\nI remember wondering how things somehow seemed worse after the Epley maneuver--but then things got better.", "What form of BPPV do I have if it attacks when sitting up? I have previously had BPPV that occurred when lying down and facing left. The doctors suggested the Epley manoeuvre.\nRecently I have started to get vertigo that occurs when sitting up. I am trying too fond out what is the best manoeuvre for testing this variant. Any suggestions please? It sounds like your left side might be affected. In this case, I would recommend doing the BBQ roll/Lampert manoeuvre/\n\nLie on your back and wait for the dizziness to stop, then quickly roll onto your RIGHT side while tucking your chin in (you want to turn AWAY from the affected side). Hold this position for 30 seconds OR until your dizziness stops (if there is any). You may experience severe vertigo while doing this, but whatever you do, please hold the position! \n\nThen roll onto your stomach for 30 secs and support your head with your hands while tucking in your chin (I typically never get any vertigo in this position). Then roll onto your right side quickly while tucking in your chin and hold for another 30 seconds or until the vertigo subsides. You may get another wave of severe vertigo in this case.\n\nThen roll back onto your back and lie there for 30 secs or until the vertigo stops. \n\nDo this position 2-3 times a day. If you are not getting any more vertigo, then do the opposite and lie on your back and turn LEFT first. If you get BPPV, it does not mean you messed it up. It just means that it now is the other side that is affected. You can alternate sides until you get 100% better. I hope this helps! Thanks MM. Why do you recommend the  BBQ roll over the Epley manoeuvre? No problem, Nepentanova! The reason I recommend the BBQ roll over the Epley is if the Epley maneuver is not working try something else. The Epley is for the posterior canal. However, some people in rare cases (like me), get it in the lateral canal and the BBQ roll helps with getting those dislodged crystals back into its place. \n\nThe last time I had BPPV, it was my right side that was affected. I did the exercise on my left and right sides and it worked after a few days. However, one day I got vertigo from just drinking some water and I immediately did the exercises and when I sat up from the right side I had dizziness still. So I did the exercises again, left side, and then right side, and no vertigo.\n\nIf you want confirmation, I would definitely go to a clinic that treats dizziness and balance issues and see what they say. In my experience, it does not hurt to try maneuvers on your own - it will not make things worse, however, you may experience some crazy vertigo while doing the exercises but that just means things are working.", "Can the Epley or Half-somersault make things worse? I am having an episode of dizziness that I think is BPPV. I do not get outright vertigo but i get a whooshing dizzy feeling when I tilt my head back to look upward, and a little bit when I lie back. I also just have a general \"off\" feeling, like my head is light or fuzzy. \n\nI have had other ear problems, so I am wondering if those maneuvers could make BPPV worse before it makes it better? Like if I am just having this mild dizziness, and then try the Epley or half-somersault, could it move the crystals in such a way that I would be worse off in the hours and days after I have completed the maneuver? I am afraid of trying anything because at least I can sort of function right now. When I am dehydrated I get dizzy, fuzzy, light headed ever since I have had BPPV. \n\nMaybe see if drinking something helps ? \n\nOtherwise I do not think it is bad to try the maneuvers- it\nWill either move the crystals or do nothing. Yes, I have noticed that when I have BPPV episodes the dizziness/fuzziness is worse when I am hungry. Thanks for your reply. If done correctly there is little chance of making it worse. You will feel pretty crappy in the moment but it will bring relief. Remember too that BPPV is almost always concurrent with anxiety. I am in no way saying it is in your imagination, that feeling is extremely anxiety causing-but square breathing and other exercises really help. Thank you! I guess I was worried that if I have a crystal that is only a little bit dislodged (no outright vertigo), a maneuver may move it more toward the middle of the canal which would make me dizzier.", "Residual dizziness for how long? Hey there!\n\nI had BPPV with intense symptoms about three weeks ago. Went to the hospital and was diagnosed with BPPV (right ear, horizontal). After a few days performing the barbecue exercise, I got better and could go home.\n\nEver since then I have residual dizziness, mostly when laying down, but also when walking it feels like the floor is moving a bit.\n\nHas anyone had residual dizziness and can tell me for how long he had these symptoms? It is been three weeks now and it does not go away.\n\nThanks in advance. Nice, upvoted Have you tried the manuver again?  There may be crystal\\ still present. I am on pretty much the exact same schedule as you! I am still having some dizziness mostly when I stand up from bed, do yoga, or put my head upside down. However, it is about 95% better and does not impede me from daily life. If circumstances permit, I would highly suggest a PT who knows vestibular system therapy- they can fine tune any movements you are doing. Good luck! Three months it was really severe residual dizziness.... Then the following 5 months it was milder. If you search the sub you will find a bunch of discussions regarding it &amp; also find some vestibular exercises that can help speed the process. It is a whole different type of yuckiness you have to deal with after BPPV is resolved. Not fun. Thank you! It mostly impedes my sleeping, since laying down triggers the dizziness. I have trouble sleeping and I am dealing with anxiety of waking up and having vertigo again. It is maybe 80% better than when I left hospital, but it still affects my life. I think I will go to a neurologist next week. Thanks again! Wow, sounds awful! I cannot imagine having these symptoms for seven more months, but I am glad that I am not the only one. Thanks for sharing, I will go see a neurologist. Yes, I have been doing the maneuver from time to time, but I have not experienced any vertigo so I think the crystals are gone. I will ask my neurologist. If you can find a vestibular therapist (mine was in the physical therapy department) or someone that specializes in dizziness.... They will likely help a ton more than a neurologist. It seems a lot of us have found that to be true. The specialists can rule out other severe things.... But usually do not help much with actual dizziness! Thanks a lot, great tip. I have found a few, I will go there next week. I got it just after going to bed on Sunday the 13th, still got bouts of residual dizziness over a week later. Went to the doctor today and did some quick grocery and xmas shopping, 2 hours on my feet drained me and started the dizziness again. 3,5 months later,its almost gone completely.Looking at sceens for over 2-3 hours brings some of the dizziness back.After a certain point,i think there is a visual element to the whole thing I am almost in the same boat. Had my second bppv about 1.5 months ago. Then saw my PT and she performed epley and the bppv was gone. I continued seeing my PT and doing the exercises and also epley but no more nystagmus (cause the first epley resolved it). But I still feel residuals some times. When I sit somewhere and walk, I am pretty much (99%) fine. But whenever I am laid down, I get so nervous, and feel like the vertigo is going to come back every second. It has not yet, but sometimes I feel lightheaded maybe because of anxiety and/or illusion and/or imagination (and maybe some real issues). Not sure!", "Vertigo Exercises 2021 ", "BPPV and nausea Hi, I got my first yesterday at midnight. Scared the crap out of me. The doctor diagnosed BPPV. What really bothers me is the nausea/vomiting spells. The habituation exercises are really hard because I would feel like vomiting after for some time. Anyone has these issues? Any coping strategies I could use? Take travel sickness pills, they should help with the nausea and vomitting. I take Dramamine whenever I have an episode. It does not cure the nausea, but it makes it a hell of a lot easier to keep under control. I went from literally dry heaving after getting dizzy to just feeling a little queasy. In my opinion that is good enough to keep taking it.", "22 M dizziness sensation Hey everyone I am a 22 year old male and recently Ive been experiencing weird vertigo sensations im going to try the best to describe. Ive felt a little off in the head for a long time but since december of last year i feel like my symptoms have definitely intensified, my head feels floaty especially when I do what Ill call \"Micro movements\" triggers include turning too quickly in the shower, washing dishes, shopping and sorting through products(like digging through clothes at a clothing store) , standing in lines, and working my retail job and standing talking to people, and also when raising my head to straight posture. The sensation lately feels like a falling or sinking feeling, almost like fainting but I have not fainted from this but I always feel like I have to move when this feeling hits. It also manifests as like an internal swaying or rocking, I can provoke it by standing up straight and closing my eyes. My symptoms disappear near completely when driving a car, jogging, or making big \"Macro movements\" I went to urgent care earlier this week, my vitals were all good, they attributed it to chronic anxiety and prescribed me flonase(I do have chronic allergies both food and environmental ive never treated) and im also going to my primary doctor this friday, im going to request a blood test and a head mri. Can anyone please tell me if my symptoms sound familiar to you? Im terrified of having something awful like a brain tumor. It could be BPPV but it sounds like the symptoms I had when I was at the peak of my anxiety. I would get a sense like my entire body is falling ever so slightly, that weird sinking feeling. This became a cycle and things kept getting worse until I confronted my anxiety.\n\nThat said if you can consistently trigger it there is a good chance it is BPPV. Have you gone to a balance center or ENT? I know for certain my anxiety is a factor, and no I have not yet im going to go to my doctor first then ask him to guide me from there. When you were at your peak of anxiety was this feeling near constant? This summer I had a long bout of it. Lasted like 6 months. I read the book DARE and downloaded the app and it is completely changed my life. I still get some anxiety but I can easily deal with it now. It does not send my body into panic mode anymore.\n\nThe feeling was definitely best constant for about a month and then I found something new to worry about and it went away. 6 months is crazy, but im glad that it seems like you found a way to keep it under control. Im going to download that app right now and also see the dr. Thank you for sharing your experiences. The biggest mindset change was that anxiety does not go away. It is part of who we are and it is a defense mechanism our body needs to survive. So fighting to get rid of it just makes it worse. You have to accept it and learn how to respond to it I am a healthy way. DARE taught me that and it is better than anything my doctor has put me through. do you think it is anxiety? i have had BPPV previously for years and what i am experiencing now is really different, i cannot keep my head straight easily. i feel like my balance is off especially more to one side. i can constantly feel my heart throughout my whole body which makes me feel weird and also little movements makes me feel off. this is been like for 6 months now which is when my anxiety took a sudden turn for the worse so i am wondering if this sounds like anxiety?? It MIGHT be... bppv is usually triggered by sudden head movements when and I think the most common is when laying down. When I was anxious though my balance was all off. It is because your nervous system is on overdrive. I also had this feeling like my head was leaning to one side but it was not. You become extremely sensitive to many sensations. I had bppv 3 years ago and now as someone with extreme anxiety, I am also experiencing that dizziness caused by the anxiety and what you called micro triggers. It is very prominent at night when I lay down and feel like the room could almost start spinning but it never quite gets there, which is why recently I have been wondering if the bppv was making a return. It is certainly difficult having anxiety affect your life like this. I would love to keep in touch just to have someone to share this experience with. I can also provoke my dizziness from turning in bed at night, its definitely upsetting considering your bed is one place you should feel comfortable most in. Im sorry youve been going through this awful anxiety too but im glad you shared your experiences, reminds me im not alone. Do you have any copes that help you? Yeah I was already having a rough time managing my anxiety these past months but just a couple of days ago I turned around in bed and felt the room spin briefly and that has opened a whole new can of worms for my anxiety. The only thing that I can do is attempt to sleep in a fixed position and just pray that the dizziness goes away. If I have trouble sleeping bc I am working myself into a panic attack, I will put on a guided visualization or meditation at a low volume to have something to focus on. So far I have not had much luck, though. thank you! this is exactly how i am feeling. when i have had BPPV is what really awful dizziness whenever i moved my head and especially when lying down. this is exactly like you explained. it feels like my head is leaning to one side and i feel so off-balance like i am standing on a boat. when i am walking it is fine though, just when standing I have had BPPV to, this summer and then again in November. After that I got left with what you guys describe, a strange cloudy swaying feeling inside my head. I figured maybe there are some lone crystals still left and started doing an Epley every night before bed, cause what harm could it do. It seems to help! I have also started to take Gingko Bikoba like one member recommended. So far so good \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffb Good luck for you guys!! Im going to start integrating the epley too, good luck on your recovery Good luck to you too \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb I just downloaded the DARE app after reading your comment and their series on health anxiety has already started to help me...it is just the part about trusting your body but it is hard to know with BPPV being like such a sudden thing that could come at any time. Any tips on how to get rid of that mindset? I been going through the same feeling for 2 years now , especially if I am in a store I get the sensation as if gravity is pulling me down for a few seconds , if I am looking for clothes or looking some groceries I start to get this rocking gravity sensation , when this first all started I thought I was having a stroke lol . It use to be bad but I learn to live with it now , I did the whole MRI all the blood test you can think of , I was prescribe anti depressant nortriplyn , I took it for a while , it helped a lot but I kind of do not like to be dependent on medicine , basically my neurologist diagnosed me with vestibular migraines Yes the gravity feeling sounds so very familiar and it sucks but it is possible to power through it. And my drs always recommend me antidepressants but im with you on not relying on them. Today when I had those sensations I tried repositioning myself to perfect neck posture and they sort of subsided, part of my problem may be just poor posture or cervical vertigo so Id recommend trying to fix your posture if you havent already. Good luck in your recovery. Exactly! I had the same experience when using the app. I suddenly started feeling better hearing what Barry had to say and it is literally changed my life.\n\nRecovery is not going to be instant and it is not going to be a straight line. Practicing the DARE response takes time but I promise you if you stick with it you are going to feel better and better until you realize you are not fearing your anxiety or what your anxiety is telling you.\n\nI realize there is only so much we can control. BPPV can come back but it is benign and it is fixable. Having anxiety on top of the the BPPV I think exaggerates it is symptoms so try not to worry and figure out what triggers it. For me it is sleeping with my head tilted too far back.\n\nDo not let anxiety or BPPV rule you. The body is amazing and can recalibrate to deal with the false signals and keep practicing that DARE response! I paid for the membership so I could get access to the Facebook group and it was well worth it to have others to talk to. What you have discovered is 100% spot on. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "Got my diagnosis this morning (sharing experience) This started for me a couple weeks ago, did an at home Dix Hallpike last night due to it being harder to get to a doctor. I got really sick, really fast, and nystagmus was really apparent to myself and my wife (who helped watch). Had the phone call with the doctor this morning. Started my Epley maneuvers after the call. An interesting observation was that immediately after the Epley maneuver I felt like a rush of refreshing cold in my effected ear (left). Similar to what you would get after allowing circulation to a arm/leg after it getting cut off for a time.\n\nInitial presentations were light sensitivity, blurry vision, nystagmus, and nausea (motion sickness), but no discernable dizziness just the nausea after the fact. Very intense for a few days. Steady improvement since initial presentation. Worsens after long periods of stillness (sleep, or working at computer) \n\nIt could be that I noticed the nystagmus and not dizziness because I have had congenital nystagmus my whole life (voluntary latent nystagmus). Yet after the nystagmus would hit, the nausea would ensue shortly after.  All of the old tricks from my time in the Navy would help the nausea: keep the head still, look at the horizon or some stable focal point far away, get some fresh air, and get the blood moving (exercise).\n\nI am just grateful to have a diagnosis. It makes it a lot less scary. Have you read  ? I have! Since I had to do the Dix Hallpike at home and report back to the doctor my findings due to COVID, the video links in there were very helpful for confirming the type of nystagmus I am getting as consistent with posterior canal BPPV. \n\nSo grateful for this subreddit and that quick reference guide. I have done the Epley maneuver a couple times today (once in the morning, once just now after lunch) and my symptoms have been reduced to a remarkable extent. Do not overdo the exercises. A PT will do the manoeuvre once and send you home to try again the next day if required as it is possible to make things worse. Best of luck \ud83d\udc4d Got it. Thanks. I will be done unless symptoms worsen or persist for a couple days. Keep us posted \ud83d\udc4d I sure will! Its incredible how much better I feel already. I am just kind of stunned by it.", "How many times have you had an BPPV episode? And what are your theories for causes or if you have had many, what did you find that correlated each episode? \n\nFor me, I have only had one episode (last year). No theories on cause besides a new medication.\n\n\n*edited for spelling and more info. 3, twice in 2016 and once last month just one this past march, lasted about a month before my ent  (ear nose and throat) dr resolved my issue. asked my ent about causes and said its not really known exact causes. Five or so major episodes in the past 10 years. A dozen minor ones. \n\nYoga twice, so I have cut that out. Other than that, I know of no correlation. The literature is fuzzy and filled with guidelines that are key to good health in general: enough sleep, plenty of water, reduce your stress, etc. Low Vitamin D may be a contributor so I take a suppliment. Four total over the past three years. The first three resolved on their own and I knew very little about it. Went to the ER with the first episode. Was told it was BPPV (with no 'real' testing) given Meclizine &amp; Zofran and told to give it time &amp; it will go away. The next two episodes I waited out as well. The last episode was horrible &amp; I got professional help &amp; learned a ton about BPPV.\n\nAs for a cause.... I have searched high &amp; low. I am active &amp; physically very healthy. I am on no medications. For the most part I get plenty of sleep &amp; have little stress. Vitamin D levels are good. Blood work is excellent. Eyes &amp; ears are good. I have no real history of head injury (minor concussion 30 years ago). I have had no major illnesses. \n\nI shoot trap &amp; often wonder if the concussion of my 12 gage O/U and loud noise (I wear ear plugs) contributed to it? Knocking something loose? (I am a small female &amp; the gun kicks pretty hard). That is the only thing possible I could think of. This summer our trap league is cancelled, so we will see if not shooting makes a difference). I also snowmobile, bike, run, run my dog in agility, water ski, trail run.... And many other things. There are no common triggers for each episode. But this time I am doing my best to keep it away. My therapist who specializes in dizziness &amp; is up to date on all the latest studies.... Told me there is basically nothing I can do at this point to prevent it from happening again. There are theories.... But none proven or tested. And that is sad. We need more info on this horrible condition! I agree, I started this sub in hopes that we could find similarities. Looks like it just happens when it happens. I am pretty convinced mine is from increased inter-cranial pressure from a medication. But again, I will not know unless it happens again.\n\nFingers cross that it does not! You know... That makes me think about something when you mention cranial pressure. When I run &amp; get super hot... Or during a race.... I feel like I get pressure in my head.... And it is like my heart is beating in my ears. To the point whet it feels ready to explode. I have been trying to avoid this from happening. And with all races cancelled due to COVID.... No reason to bust my ass running either right now. Now you have got me thinking.... \ud83e\udd14 (I figured it was a blood pressure thing) The idea that it can be helped with head movements to get crystals to move in the inner ear leads me to believe it happens when those crystals get dislodged with head movements, like when doing yoga, tilting your head to one side extremely, etc. That is why I am still terrified to sleep on my left side... The side that is effected. Every single episode I have had is when rolling over onto my left. I know the BPPV is cleared and I can tilt my head any direction now with no symptoms.... But holy cow... At night, it still terrifies me to do so. And why that crystal would dislodge while barely moving all night. Ugh. Wish the experts could come up with better answers! I have had 2 major episodes (one which made me vomit all day, and the other made me fall over completely - thankfully I caught myself on the couch). \n\nNot sure about triggers or causes, but the PT I went to for help with the maneuver mentioned stress and that even allergies can sometimes trigger it. She said she had not seen a patient in 6 months with this, but within a few days had over 5 patients come in for the same thing - so maybe if a certain something blooms and triggers allergies?? Who knows! Only the once, a mild case probably, and resolved quickly thanks to advice from u/colmanson1 \n\nMy guess is bashing left side of face into built-in furniture did it, as it started not long afterwards.\n\nHit the back of my head same side a couple weeks later, no bppv symptoms this time thankfully.  5 over the past 17 years. 2 completely out of the blue, 2 came on while doing yoga and 1 while doing a cardio workout. My last one this year was during yoga, it sucks because I am really paranoid about doing any kind of workout, and that episode started 6 months ago. my first one was in may. it lasted 4 days and now i am having another one starting today. I have had 3 severe episodes of vertigo within the past 5 years. The first episode was diagnosed as vestibular neuritis. The second episode I was told I had recurrent VN which is extremely rare. The most recent episode they decided to look outside of VN and said they thought I had BPPV. It is possible that my second episode was also BPPV and not VN. I was told that a previous case of VN could make me more susceptible to BPPV. The 2nd episode I had came immediately after extreme lack of sleep (I decided to drive overnight to get home by morning bc I wanted to see my infant). The 3rd episode occurred during a beach vacation with friends where I was drinking more heavily and more often than I would in my everyday life. In my case, it seems like this occurs when there is some sort of atypical stressor on my body. My first experience with vertigo was 15 years ago.  Over the last year and a half I have had episodes of vertigo nearly every 6 weeks. My largest gap was 3 months. I have no idea what kick started it again, but I just started another episode. The only thing I can think of was an evening at the beach bending down picking up rocks must have dislodged something again. I am incredibly frustrated that this keeps returning for me. Sorry to hear that. Did you have episodes before this last year and half?\n\nAre you going to a balance center or dizzy clinic? I was supposed to go see a physical therapist, but I was hesitant because I wanted to know why it was happening and I was not sure PT was going to be able to give me that answer. I was considering going to an ENT instead then the episode I had stopped, and then Coronavirus happened. So I have been waiting and now debating who I should see or if I should just wait it out. \n\nI had a very severe episode in my late 20s that lasted about 3 weeks and slowly subsided. At the start of it though when the episode happened I could not even see a house in front of me because of things shifting side to side so fast. I absolutely could not drive. I had not had the feeling of vertigo again until the last year and half, but never as bad as that first episode in my 20s. Hm. I would look for a balance center or dizzy clinic near you. They can test for all sorts of vestibular issues including BPPV, VN, M\u00e9ni\u00e8res, etc.\n\nI am sorry you have been experiencing symptoms on and off for the past year and half. I could not imagine dealing with vertigo constantly for that long. I had an episode last September that lasted a month and slowly went away. Kind Of sounds like your episode you had as well and I was pretty much bed bound. But I  recommend getting seen ASAP. I know covid has made things difficult but you can always use telehealth to consult with an ENT or Vestibular specialist and see what they think is going on and how to get test done but also staying safe. \n\nI hope you get it settled out soon. Sending my best wishes your way! xx Had maybe 5-6 from beginning 2019 till fall. Had not had any since until I had a quick one this morning. 3-4 a year for the last 5 years. Most are minor, maybe one major each year. Flying seems to bring in smaller episodes, so I take a Sudafed anytime I fly, which seems to help.", "So tired of this, not getting any better So tired of this feeling every other month, today and yesterday I got it back to back.. Vertigo woke me up at 5am yesterday 1/21 and now today this afternoon it got me again. Body tingling sensation and I could not separate my finger because they were stiff as fuck while I still felt tingling in all of my body. Today I had tingling in my bed, but I could move my fingers and they did not stiffen up, I vomited today unlike yesterday (yay!). I am so upset this keeps happening. I went to bed last night feeling good and I woke up fine today. I did the Epley yesterday and when I sat up the first time I got that tingling feeling in arms and hand then eventually everywhere, second go round I was better and focused on a single object and I was feeling good after 2-3hrs...\n\nToday 1/22 was odd though.. Vertigo was there, did Epley did not exactly help first time.. I got the tingling sensation throughout my body, I could separate my fingers.. The vertigo was not as intense as yesterday morning, but my head was extremely light, I did not turn cold/hot while this episode happened.. I could focus a bit on a single object but moving head up, down, side to side, was bad. I was in a bed for 3hrs or so and now.. I could walk a bit but did not want to risk too much falling over so I stayed a bit longer..i drank ginger tea and Gatorade.. Right ear is ringing like always.. I guess it is residual vertigo I have, I will do the Epley tonight like I do every morning and night.\n\nMy episodes used to never be like this. It was always just, intense spinning, right ear ringing, vomiting. Now a days I get tingling sensations throughout my whole body from my mouth to toes, I cannot move my fingers because they get paralyzed and are stiff as fuck, sometimes I get really hot and cold, then there is loss of general strength in my hands and I feel weak. Unbelievable, my episodes are getting worse as time goes on.. First one was when I was 13/14 years old.. Now I am 25 and it is not getting better.\n\nWho else gets these feelings? The thing that scares me the most is when my hands stiffen up so much, that I cannot separate my fingers or move them.. I encourage everyone to write down how they feel throughout the day, if you cannot, record a video and voice what you feel to write it down later, I personally am forgetful. Any idea what Dr. I should look for? I am not ever going to a general clinic or the ER for help with this, they do not know enough and will give me that shitty Meclize pill. I hope you all are fighting this and getting better. Do you have a Dizzy/balance center near you? Otherwise an ENT or physical therapy referral would probably be more helpful than a general practitioner. I am currently going to a dizzy/balance center, I was told not to do the Epley every day, at most they said about every 4 days. My first visit they did the Epley, now apparently the crystal moved to a different canal so last time they did a different maneuver, it is called a Barbecue roll if you look online. The fingers going stif, feeling hot and cold sounds a bit like an anxiety attack, possibly. I have had them in the past and my current vertigo is causing them again. Hope you find someone who can help! What is the tingling thing about? Is that a anxiety or migraine symptom or something related to bppv? No idea, but I only get it from vertigo, first time it happened was in 2015 and my hands felt weak I could not hold a tight fist. Maybe consider seeing a neurologist or neurotologist at a dizziness clinic. It might be more brain related. That is what I am thinking, I have not seen one since 2015. I have an appointment tomorrow with a hearing and dizzy center though, so I will see how it goes, thanks! Hi thinking, I have not seen one since 2015, I am Dad\ud83d\udc68 Have an appointment tomorrow with a place like this, hopefully it goes well! Thanks!", "Best physician for BPPV? I have been experiencing dizziness with certain head movements for about a week, so I decided to see a doctor. The GP scheduler said they could not make appointments for \u201clife-threatening symptoms,\u201d so I went to urgent care and was diagnosed with BPPV. The doctor told me to look up vestibular exercises online and try those, so I am going to attempt the Epley maneuver (on both sides, since I was not diagnosed in a specific ear). \n\nHowever, if my symptoms do not improve or get worse, I am wondering what type of doctor I should see, and what language I can use to get past the scheduler. Any advice you can provide would be much appreciated. Thanks! For me, going to see a physiotherapist that specializes in vestibuar rehabilitation helped me a lot. She did lots of tests to confirm the diagnosis of BPPV and she performed the Epley manoeuver in a safe and controlled environment. Helped SO much. I went to see a physiotherapist as well! It really helped my case. \n\nhere is a quick link I found on this: ", "My experience I have been reading through here and though it is scary because of some of the possibilities that you guys have revealed to me I appreciate that there is a place like this. \n\nMy vertigo started super early for me, the first time I must have been 12-13, my parents freaked out of course and I got a bunch of tests and scans done and they all came back negative, back then the doctors never even thought of vertigo as being a possibility because of my age so I was never tested for it. That episode lasted for about 2 weeks and after it went away it did not come back for a long time. I was 26 when I got my second episode it was bad, nausea and vomiting. Had to come home from work, went to the doctors office my family doctor in fact, I know a lot of people here do not trust them much but mine was on the mark the first time I mentioned my symptoms, he did a quick test laying me down with head turned and boom diagnosed with vertigo in less than 10 mins.\n\nHe told me that there are drugs I could take but that I should see a physical therapist and an ENT that he knew specialized in this subject. I did not go to either because I had just started my new job and though I had insurance even just the copay would have set me back. I looked around on YouTube for some physical therapy exercises I found one with a female doctor that had figured out how to do these exercises on herself one morning when she had woken up with vertigo. I did this exercise one time on each side  and it was like a miracle, it went away so quick it was surreal. After finding this exercises and moving the crystals back I could literally feel when the crystals would, what I call \u201cdrop\u201d, because my world would spin instantly. I would do the exercise though and it would go away. Now after trial and error I figured out that my trigger was in fact a mix of mushrooms supplements I was taking that had a combination of lions mane and few others that were supposedly good for brain health, I stopped taking these and it went away no more reoccurring episodes. \n\nNow I am 28 I got an episode last week and every morning since I have had to the exercises they help but no where near as helpful as last time. I lead a healthy lifestyle, I eat well and I exercise but in the last few weeks I have not had the chance to workout as much as usual, there is been a cold going around in my family that I suspect may be affecting my vertigo due to congestion,  the weather has turned cold where I live, and I am getting married in a couple weeks. Reading your comments and posts would lead me to believe that any of these could be a trigger this time around.\n\nSorry if it was a long one, but reading your stories has helped to make me feel something good. So I hope mine does too. What I plan on doing is going to the ENT and seeing if he/she can get to the bottom of the cause I also plan on fighting through like I did last time and still go to the gym on a daily basis because that seemed to help a lot, I am also going to add yoga to my regime because I suspect that the fact that we do not usually ever move our heads in the way yoga makes you move it might have something to do with it. Like maybe our crystals are weak from lack of movement kind of thing. I am not a professional in the least but apparently no one really knows what cause this shit, so I will try my best to figure my own out at least. Thank you for reading \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffc Hi! I find your positive attitude towards this very refreshing, just wanted to say that first of all :) from what I have gathered from reading a lot about this condition and speaking to my doctor, the only way for it to go away is if you go to a specialist and have the performed, or you can perform them yourself. This condition can resolve on its own, but it may take several weeks or months. I think I have read on several websites that it tends to resolve on its own within 6 months... BUT it is very important that you do not avoid movements that make you dizzy because then your brain will not be challenged to adapt to the situation (if that makes any sense). I live in Sweden and all the doctors I have spoken to have emphasised that you should not make any drastic head movements but you should not avoid living life as normal (meaning you should not lay in bed all day unless your vertigo is so bad that you cannot walk) because that will hinder your progress. You will be fine, I am sure of it :) Interesting that you had your first experience at 12-13. \n\nI had the same experience of having my first episode at 15 and then again at 29. \n\nI have been wondering how hormones play into vertigo and/or vestibular migraines. Yes I think you are right about living your life as normal as possible, I try to do that as long as my spins are not too crazy. This recent episode has subsided almost completely but I still intend on going to an ENT so that he/she can asses me. Thank you for your insight much appreciate it \ud83d\ude4f That is an interesting point I had not even thought about, I tend to lean more on the nutrition and healthy lifestyle side, but they are all connected in some way are not they. I hope that there are more studies on this soon because it would great to pin point in order to avoid it. Well, everyone has an endocrine system regardless of lifestyle... \n\nRegardless, best thing to do is keep a diary of all your symptoms and possible triggers for your ENT including: food, caffeine, alcohol, weather / pressure systems, sleep, cycle if applicable etc \n\n\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc", "Got BPPV a month after epley manoeuvre When I first got BPPV I had it on  and off for around 2 weeks. After I had the epley manoeuvre it went away after a couple days and I did not have it again until now. I do not know what to do. Am I going to have to be careful all the time for the rest of my life to prevent this? Will it ever fully go away or will it always keep coming back? I cannot put up with this anymore pls help :( I know the feeling... does this ever go away? I have found that severe cases are a rare occurrence but the dizzy feeling sensation has stayed with me but only here and there. I get \u2018attacks\u2019 more than anything. It will go away back and you will have a \u2018normal life\u2019. Just got to get through these crazy bouts whenever they arise. Any idea what made it come back? Did you hit your head? Did you move into strange positions? Can you locate the trigger?

But there is really nothing you can do. I know, that sucks. But stay healthy physically as that will help your emotional state when you get an episode, take Vitamin D (there may be a link) and go see a physical therapist who deals with balance issues as it is not unusual to have to do the Epley over the course of many days. \n\nIt will go away at some point, but it is not always easy getting there. Keep your chin up!", "Long stretch, but it is back I went a long stretch without any issue- the last few months have felt pretty normal. Then picked up after my dog this morning and that was enough to send me feeling drunk for a good 20 seconds. \n\nI noticed some nausea last week and my eye \u201cdragging\u201d a few days ago while reading, and maybe should have started some light exercises to prevent this so I plan on doing them tonight. \n\nJust sucks; I was hoping to be the type of case where it happens once every five years or something and not dealing with it multiple times a year.  \u2639\ufe0f\n\nNow I get to go back to being nervous every time I need to drive. Ugh. My last incident, I tried driving too soon.  I usually have residual symptoms for about a week afterward.  I did the maneuvers, I try to avoid it for a few days afterward.  I was doing okay around the house, and did not want to call off again.  I was doing okay till I turned onto the highway and suddenly the world lurched.  It was early so no one else was out, thank goodness.  Slammed on my brakes and sat on the side of the road for a few minutes.   It stopped, and like a moron I decided to continue to work since I was already on my way.  Thankfully it did not happen again, but it scared the shit out of me. That is what I fear- the world lurching, as you say.\n\nI live where people drive like maniacs and I worry that I will get slammed trying to stop, or slam into someone else, or just fly off the road altogether. When I drive it is usually with my kids in the car, too, and I do not want to hurt anybody on the roads.\n\nMy residual symptoms last a few months; I was not able to be seen fast enough last time to learn that recovery happens by moving around, not laying down- and I spent a week in bed after the last episode because I was scared to even walk, so I screwed myself there, sort of. \u2639\ufe0f I guess a good thing is at least that I have a doctor who can fit me in the same or next day to call when I need it and a partner working from home for the near future to help with driving.", "Any Advice or Reason So this is my 48th day dealing with vertigo. Had an inner ear infection and its cleared up but the residual has been basically been kicking my butt. so it went away i had no vertigo for about 7 days straight. But I guess i got a cold and now im getting the vertigo back again! not as excessive as it was before. but its still kicking my butt. I have been drinking teas and what not but i have noticed I cant seem to pop my left ear (which was where i had the inner ear infection). I had a cough but now its just a runny nose. Is there any way this cold could be the cause for my residual to act up? Because i just would not know what else it is. Or why its still getting triggered. I had three BPPV episodes happen to me after a bad cold - the first two were 2 or so weeks apart, then about 1.5 months later the third one. There might have been more mild ones, but these are the intense ones I do remember (and that Epley's did help). When I described this to my GP and ENT, they both just shrugged. Medically unimpressive, apparently.\n\nJust give it time to settle. Try to be hydrated at all times, eat well (vit+minerals), etc. Gl! Go to physical therapy and do their homework.  Try some Benadryl.  I take children\u2019s melt tabs three times a day and it helps.  Exercise.  Try acupuncture. The longest residual dizziness I had was 3 months. And that is because I was so anxious that I stayed in bed for a month and rarely stood up. After finally getting an ENT to check me out, he said the only solution was Epley and moving through the dizziness until one day you will not notice it anymore. I did not like that advice, until I read about a guy who had vertigo for 9 months but still kept his walking exercises until it disappeared. I decide to return to my old life again but with better habits.\n\nI returned to work still slightly dizzy. I avoided driving for a while and commuted to work (sometimes I walked since I lived near the office). I took betahistine on bad days and ginko biloba capsules when my eardrums feel plugged. I signed up for a gym membership. The coach was understanding enough and suggested exercises that had no head movements or vibrating machines (like the treadmill). And 2 months later, I just realized I hardly noticed it anymore. \n\nIt is been 3 years since. I am back to driving, I am still exercising (at home), and whenever I do get vertigo, it only takes an hour or less for the dizziness to go away thanks to the Epley. \n\nEveryone is body is different, so I do not know how long yours will last. But as they say, tough times never last, but tough people do. I appreciate it that, Everyone around me tells me to go back to a normal life setting. It just kicks my ass at times and then I make more excuses. I try to push myself more and more to continue to do more things I am nervous on doing but I just get humbled when it comes back. I am trying to be positive Baby steps is key :) Vertigo is indeed humbling. There was a point that I really lost hope of me ever returning to normal. I decided to let go of that desire and said to myself, \"Well at least I am not dying, I can speak and comprehend, many people worse than me are doing well...\" Thank you so much, how are you feeling mentally and physically now ?", "Idk if it is bppv This started the first week of April. I was laying down on my bed watching YouTube on my right side and when I turned to my left side I felt everything spinning so I got up and had the same sensation and I notice when I laid back down and turn my head to the right side I got the spinning sensation same with the left side and it would not go away took me about 2 hours to go to sleep. Then I woke up fine the next day then after maybe a week it happened again this time when I woke up I felt a swaying sensation or rocking went to see a doctor and gave me Meclizine which did not help or do anything for me. The symptoms were constant I would feel it throughout the day with ringing in the ears. The last week of May I notice that my symptoms got worse. when I was fixing our basketball hoop and I was looking up at the hoop and felt a Wave like something is not right so I went inside and I felt really dizzy almost like the spinning sensation so I took a nap and when I woke up I felt unsteady and was having problems with balance every time I lay down it feels like I am on a boat rocking and it is constant I feel it everyday.I dont Know what is wrong with me I never experienced anything like this before. it sounds like it could be. i had bppv in late february and march '20. your symptoms sound similar.\n\ni recommend seeing your dr asap. ask your dr if you should see a ear nose and throat (ent) dr or a vestibular specialist if your dr is not familiar with the maneuvers that resolve bppv.\n\ni saw an ent dr and im very happy i did as my symptoms were resolved. Sounds like BPPV. I got diagnosed a few days ago, but the symptoms started a week ago. Same like yours. Turned to snooze the alarm and *very quickly* turned back to my right side. The spinning sensation was excruciating that I started to scream. \n\nGo to an ENT and get formally diagnosed. Take the medication prescribed and DO NOT stop it. The medication takes time. The whole thing is a slow process. The ENT specialist will give you a few exercises to do. \n\nI have been prescribed meds for a month and have been told to not drive, make any fast movements (turning too quickly or looking up etc), heavy lifting (which even includes lifting a bucket of water) or intense exercises for the next three to four months. Do what you are told and again, DO NOT stop your meds even if you feel like it does not work. This could hinder your healing and could turn into a chronic thing. We obviously do not want that. A day or few seconds of this is painful enough. You may also feel an imbalance while walking? Just do everything slowly, like an old person using a walking stick. Stick to a healthy diet and drink lots of water (not cold). \n\nHang in there! If it is BPPV, I would highly recommend seeing a dizzy specialist or vestibular therapist. There is a crystal loose in your inner ear that needs to be put back in place. There are 6 inner ear canals &amp; a specialist can perform multiple tests to find which canal it is in. From there they can perform maneuvers to get the crystal back in place. It may take more than one time doing the maneuver... And it is not pleasant. After the crystal is back in place, it is wise to stay as upright as you can for a day, so the crystal can settle. Medicine (meclizine) will not cure BPPV. It does help some deal with the dizziness.... But for most people, it just makes them tired. It is not going to dissolve or move the crystal. Continue normal activities as quickly as possible so that your vestibular system can get back in sync with being balanced.\n\nMy BPPV took over two months to cure. In the meanwhile I stopped moving my head to keep the vertigo away... And that caused gaze instability (I was dizzy even when I did not move and when I closed my eyes). So it is best to stay as active as possible. I had many exercises from my therapist.\n\nAll this info comes straight from my therapist. Before I found her, I saw my regular doc, an Ent, and neurologist. None of them helped me. Finding someone that specializes in dizziness is key. Also, the longer you wait... The harder it will be to cure. And you may get residual dizziness, as your system tries to rebalance. I am on month 5 of residual dizziness and do daily exercises of moving my head up &amp; down &amp; sideways to challenge the dizziness. There are a few on this forum that can give you really good support,that have worked with some really good dizzy specialists. \n\nGoogle Dix Hallpike. That is one of the most common tests for bppv. You can try it at home. Also the Epley maneuver is the most common maneuver to clear the crystal (of Dix Hallpike is positive you can just move into the Epley, as Dix Hallpike is the first step to the Epley). These maneuvers WILL provoke the vertigo of its bppv. Ride it out &amp; get through the maneuvers. \n\nBest wishes! Keep us posted on your progress!", "My old tricks are not working Usually, when I have an episode, I do the Brandt-Daroff exercise and my vertigo gets less with each repetition. This time, it seems to be getting worse with each repetition. This is the longest episode I have had in years. I am already taking meclizine. What do you do to help ease the discomfort? The crystals could be in a different canal. I would perform a Dix Hallpike with a professional  if you can to determine what ear canal is effected. Then they can advise you on which maneuver is best to perform on yourself. Some other maneuvers to look into include: The Epely, Half Somersault, The BBQ roll.\n\nHope this helps and you feel better soon. There are no professionals willing to look into vertigo issues in my location, so I have been left to my own devices since about 1992 when I had my first episode. \n\nI will try the other maneuvers, though and see if anything helps. Thanks for your advice!! Epley is gold standard for posterior canal bppv (90%) of cases. But if you are getting dizzy in laying flat, not with head tipped back (over edge of bed or pillow) then may be horizontal canal and would respond more to barrel roll maneuvers. Great suggestions! Thank you! I am going to try all the maneuvers until I find one that helps. Where are you that there are no physical therapists or doctors willing to assist you? The middle of Wyoming. Our medical community sucks here. Please use caution. The first time this happened to me, I tried doing at home and it made it worse. I went in finally to have it treated and the physical therapist explained to me that I likely shifted crystals to a different canal.\n\nI saw you mention you are in Wyoming - is there any chance you can travel to one of the larger towns? I looked up and there is a physical therapy/balance center in Cheyenne I can give you the info on. They mentioned you could have a free 15 minutes consult to see if the doctor can work with BPPV. I am not sure how far away you are. I am about three hours from Cheyenne. I have heard they have a clinic there, but was told that you have to have a referral by a physician. I am also afraid to drive three hours for yet another doctor to tell me I am not worth fixing. \n\nI have been to dozens of doctors, as my first episode was about 30 years ago. Every doctor has an excuse as to why I have vertigo and why I should not be treated. When I was an adolescent it was \u201cOh, it is just puberty\u201d. Then in my 20s, it was \u201cstress will do that\u201d. Now it is, \u201cWell, you ARE overweight.\u201d I am going to message you - I called them and they said you could have a free 15 minute phone consult. At least maybe you could call them and see what they have to tell you. One moment. I was just told I may have BPPV and was wondering if these techniques work for general dizziness not just during episodes. My issue is over last few weeks everything has felt a bit wobbly (like trying to adjust to glasses that are the wrong prescription) with very occasional 1s bouts of dizziness. Was given prochlorperazine but has not really help so far You are in good company. From what I hear, it depends what canal the canaliths are in. I would definitely consult your doctor or your physical therapist for the right exercises for you. \n\nI have never had the luxury of a doctor listening to me or even diagnosing me, but through trial and error, I had found something that worked for me. Thanks to the lovely folks on this sub, I tried new techniques this time and it is helped a little. Necessity is the mother of invention.", "Long road for mild symptoms Any input on this story would be helpful. I am a 31 male mostly healthy. So after crawling under a truck and changing a starter on it, I experienced lightheadedness with head movement and overall fatigue. This was about 80 days ago. I remember because i spent the rest of the weekend thinking i was sick and laid up in bed. Went to GP, and he told me I had allergies. 3 times. I would take meds for 3 weeks and come back and he would say allergies, wait another 3 weeks of dizziness and come back and finally referred me to an ENT. I have had hearing tests come back perfect. Again was told allergies. Now at this point I am losing my mind. I finally got referred by a friend to vestibular rehab facility and i just started there last week. Just got an MRI as well and am waiting on those results. \n\nSo here were some of my symptoms.in the beginning. I would feel lightheaded anytime.i looked upwards like i was going to fall. And overall disequilibrium. No falling, no rotational vertigo attacks, just consistent disequilibrium and lightheadedness when looking upwards.\n\nWhen i was scheduled to see the ENT my GP threw out the term MENIERES and scared the shit out of me. I had to wait 3 weeks to see the ENT and I actually took off from work from the panic it caused. I was reading people with Menieres suffer from this type of dizziness for life and all kinds of things even though I did not fit the classic symptoms at all, I assumed I had a different variation of it. I was basically bedridden and wanting to die. During that time, I couldnt stay sitting up for more than 10 minites at a time because of the pressure on my jead was so severe. When I walked around outside it felt like an anvil was on my head, and when I tried to watch an action movie, the fast movement would actually hurt and strain my eyes and head. \n\nAfter the week off i forced myself to go back to work. I am in sales and travel around quite a bit and driving does.not affect me one bit. If anything it makes me forget i have an issue until the car turns off and the vibration stops.\nAfter a couple weeks I noticed that I can stay up and walk around without having major pressure but still some pressure. My vision bounces with my walking and certain head movements give me a dizzy spell. And my left eye constantly throbs. Again no rotation nothing like that, just the feeling of dizziness. Very aggravating and scary.\n\nSo finally meeting with the ENT he more or less said i dont think you have Menieres but idk and scheduled an MRI. In the meantime I got hooked up with a vestibular therapist who has been doing this for 25 years and sees dizziness everyday. She hooked up the goggles on me to watch my eyes. Did the whole BPPV thing and saw a slight nystagmus in my left eye. I did not get dizzy from any of the maneuvers. She said I may have cervicogenic dizziness, so she massaged the neck, put a heating pad on it, and even laid my neck on a hoist and had me sit for 30 minutes. Felt weird when leaving but no difference later that day.\n\nI have been doing vestibular exercises for over a week now. It seems pointless sometimes because idk if they are helping or its just so gradual its hard to notice. I can now look at an object and move my head back and forth and not get dizzy. Grocery stores still give my head confusion and disorientation but not as bad.\n\nSo second physical therapy appointment yesterday. Let me know if this seems normal. My therapist has 3 people in a room at a time and bounces from room to room to room and quickly asks how you are feeling and then has the assistants put you in various positions and then she comes back and checks on you. I get it, bringing a lot of money in but I cannot help feeling like my dizziness is different from those people. \n\nHooks the goggles up to me again and the therapist starts the manuevers on me. This time she sees something. Both eyes have slight nystagmus today. And even though my eyes are covered in darkness i see the blackness start to swirl just a little bit. Not a lot. So she puts me in different positions I have never been in before, one with my forehead facedown on a towel and then I finally got hit with a small vertigo movement while in that position. \n\nAfterwards I left feeling all kinds of weird but feeling like some kind of relief was lifted off a bit? I was told to baby my head, no quick turns or bending over or extending my neck. \n\nWoke up this morning, walked around, got dressed, hit with a few light spells. I am at work, walking around the warehouse, experiencing pressure in head, brain fog, and basically hardly any difference at all. I go back again tomorrow morning.\n\nSo based on what I have so far any kind of reassurance or similarities to someone else who has this would be helpful. I am going to stay after it, I am just frustrated and depressed from it. Thanks in advance. Dude, I feel ya. I have been dealing with this for almost 8 years. It comes and goes, they can never figure out what exactly it is. Doing certain things terrifies me because I am worried that it is going to cause a dizzy spell. Keeps us posted. I do find that it makes me tired and sleep helps. Try to get rested up and see if that helps a bit. No tv. No phone. Just sleep. Hey there, I have bppv and it honestly sucks more than anything. It never really goes away. I have done the maneuvers and it usually works for a little bit but I can always tell it is still there. I think I am going to go to my doctor and see an ear nose and throat doctor because it really does bother me! I constantly feel like I am going to fall over especially when my head is in a certain position, this always causes light headedness. My vertigo triggers my anxiety as well because I think there is something wrong with me at all times. I do not have much advice I guess you can say but I definitely can relate with you. You will eventually find what works best to treat it but be aware that it does come and go. All the best :) \\&gt; disequilibrium and lightheadedness when looking upwards.  \n\\&gt; the pressure on my head was so severe. When I walked around outside it felt like an anvil was on my head, and when I tried to watch an action movie, the fast movement would actually hurt and strain my eyes and head.\n\n\\&gt; experiencing pressure in head, brain fog, and basically hardly any difference at all.  \n\n\nThese experiences sound like possible vestibular migraines. It is one of those things that is not that well understood by your normal physician / family doctor, as they often think migraine == head pain, when really migraines can equal vertigo, brain fog and a whole bunch of other garbage. Ask to see a Neurologist IMO. But also -- start a very detailed diary of your dizzy experiences, dates, times, what you ate, weather changes, smells, anything that may have triggered the initial dizzy spell/weird feelings/brain fogs. Yeah but then what? What does a neurologist do for it? I usually get them every other day and i summed them up to having eye issues with the dizziness. Like i said, random head movement triggers the dizzy feeling. Walking makes my brain feels like it is bouncing. What treatments besides dealing with it do they offer for vestibular migraines Also I have been on Amitriptyline for a week and did not have any effect on my head. Good question.  \nIf you can validate that they **are** migraines and/or you fit the profile as a migraineur type, your journey in treating yourself will be totally different. I have heard that physiotherapy is still good for vestibular migraine sufferers for strengthening all-the-stuff that helps you balance. However, I believe migraine sufferers have specific triggers/causes that lead to migraines and if you can sort out some of your triggers, you may be able to radically reduce your migraines. Amitriptyline looks to be an anti-depressant? I do not think that would necessarily cure a vestibular migraine. I never had headaches much before all this but I was severely stressed for a while leading up to the incident. Is it possible that this is why my dizziness seems so arbitrary and not classic bppv or neuritis Oh I see it can be used for vestibular migraines.. interesting. I do not know. I have only tried triptans for migraines, and they did absolutely nothing for me. Your case sounds so similar to mine in a few ways..  \n1. Stressful incident before 1st attack  \n2. Meniere's scare (woof)  \n3. Mysterious nystagmus that comes/goes (mine looks to be of \"central origin\")  \n4. Brain fog, bouncy feeling when walking\n\nExcept I used to get \\~12 hour days of fully rotational spinning. Which resulted in a lot of sad days.  \nHoping that /u/VertigoDoc is checking on this sub from time to time too. :-) So went to my physical therapy and do not see anymore signs of BPPV while wearing the goggles. They checked the eyes and they also specialize in neck issues so they always put your neck in a hoist and a heating pad on it for a while and massage your neck. Well I have spots on the bottom of my skull that they press on and they hurt. Also they laid my head on the mat and pulled my head away from my neck and shoulders and i noticed the ceiling rippled in my vision. So now I am thinking its cervicogenic dizziness which they say is a common issue to have.\n\nMy therapist also wants me to see a neurologist for the headaches just to see if there is any correlation with migraines causing dizziness but she thinks the neck is causing the dizziness which brings on the headaches. So I am still chasing the dizziness away. Im lucky I can function but I find myself avoiding activities or socializing because the dizziness can get pretty distracting.", "BPPV and weight gain. Hey everyone, \n\nIts been almost a year since I had my very first experience with BPPV. I was bed ridden for months and to this day I cannot be bent over for more than a few seconds and I cannot be on a step ladder without experiencing some slight wooshiness. \n\nNow when I was bed bound for those 4 or 5 months I ate a lot of take out. I have a son and rarely got a home cooked meal and he had to eat so take out was the go to. \n\nBecause of this I put on quite a bit of weight. So much so that it is pressing on a nerve in my leg that causes thigh to tingle and start to go numb (I have talked to my doctor about this and she agrees that is the issue). On top of that I cannot be standing for very long other wise my lower back starts to ache and feels like its going to give out. \n\nI was already over weight to begin with so I am concerned for my health. \n\nSo my question is, does anyone have any BPPV friend exercise tips? I am afraid of setting it off again so I do not want to be rolling around and jumping and all this stuff. I have never been very active so I know its best to start easy and slow. I do not have a lot of free time to get out and go for a walk some weeks I do not even have a spare 30 minutes until I go to bed.. so things I can do at home? Maybe while even sitting at my chair between calls at work? Things like that? Just to get me started and build up a little strength you know? \n\nAlso going outside is difficult for me because I have a sensitivity to the sun due to a medication I am on. Usually anything more than 15 minutes and whatever body part was exposed to the sun gets super itchy for a few days. \n\nAny advice or suggestions would be appreciated. \n\n\nHope you are all well and if you are dealing with BPPV right now I hope it passes soon. I know you said you do not have much time to get out and walk - and that the sunlight bothers you as well. But - walking is such a GOOD exercise to start with.  Are you perhaps able to wake up a half hour earlier and get out to walk a bit before the sun comes up?  Even start with 10 minutes and gradually work to be able to walk longer.  Or - do you have stairs at home? Make a point to go up and down those stairs a certain amount of times. Even if it is twice, or four times - it is a start.\n\nAlso - at work while sitting - try to make a habit to stand up every 15 minutes. Then just sit back down. Or walk down the hallway.  Try to find a routine that you can build on. You could also get hand weights and do those while sitting (you can google different exercises to try).\n\nJust remember - everyone starts somewhere. Baby steps.  Another recommendation is joining a gym. If you can walk inside on a treadmill - to keep you out of the sun. Not sure if there is a gym handy - but it is an option.  Best wishes to you! Thanks for the tips. I do have stairs in my building but with a torn ligament in my knee and the higher I go getting a bit dizzy is not too smart for me. (You can see over the sides and it sets me off) \nI would not join a gym but I can see about getting a space savor treadmill at home. And realistically I will not wake up earlier hahaha I am not a morning person to begin with I treasure my sleep \n\nI will look into those other suggestions tho! LMFAO. Explains so much.", "Free Vestibular Rehab Program for those suffering with vestibular disorders.  Me ! &gt;here\n\nLink is in the post. Or (", "Why...?

I had no idea what was wrong with me and it was very scary. I spent the morning vomiting and staring at a blank wall before I finally had the strength to go to urgent care (my husband drove me). I was diagnosed with stomach flu and dehydration. I went home and laid on the couch all weekend. Monday I went to my Doctor and she diagnosed me with BPPV. I was prescribed anti vert and given the Epley Maneuver and a referral to a physical therapist. I scheduled the appointment with the physical therapist (a week away) and did the Epley every day. When I finally got to the physical therapist she said I was cured, but was not sure why I was still having dizzy spells. She sent me home with different exercises. \n\nIt is now been about 3 weeks and I am having anxiety/panic attacks when out in public. I cannot sit in restaurants, I cannot grocery shop, I cannot stand around and talk with the other parents at the bus stop. I cannot handle crowds. My heart starts racing and I feel like I am going to faint. Fight or flight mode kicks in. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this after BPPV? How long before it goes away? Any treatment options? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you.  I do not understand this. How can the therapist pronounce you cured despite face that you still have dizzy spells? Is there something that triggers your dizzy spells? Does it feel different now than before you started with Epley? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am guessing you have some kind of Post traumatic stress going on. BPPV can be scary as hell. You do not know what is going on. Suddenly the world starts spinning and you cant move.  Could it be that you are still stressed because of this experience and scared it might come back? The vertigo was cured but was still having some residual dizziness. I definitely do not have spinning anymore it is more of a light headed feeling. Going out in public and having to wait, sit, stand around or talk to strangers seems to trigger it. I cannot grocery shop because looking down at the grocery list and then to the shelves makes me uneasy. I am definitely traumatized and get nervous/worried whenever people are around.  I can understand it, because mine scared me too. It happened when I was on holiday on an island. I just had to tough it out and wait until I got home to treat it. Really bad timing. But now I feel OK. Maybe you need to discuss the trauma with a therapist? If I cannot move past this soon I will definitely talk with a therapist. It cannot hurt right? Thanks for responding. For what it is worth I get at least 1-2 episodes a year and maneuvers always fix it.  I never have it for more than a day.  The first time is definitely the scariest.   Some q's:\n\n  \n\\- Any history of migraines at all, at any point in your life?\n\n\\- Was the physiotherapist certified to treat vertigo specifically?\n\n\\- Which came first, the flu thing or the vertigo?\n\nI suspect this experience may have triggered a panic disorder for you - the feeling of feeling dizzy/off can be really disorienting, sort of feeling like you are drunk/in a haze or something. If so, you may be feeling *weird* which then in turn triggers anxiety, which triggers the vertigo to worsen and so on.\n\n  \nI have experience developing a panic situation similar to what you are describing, but not specifically in relation to my vertigo.  I was feeling faint while on my period and almost passed out at work (which has never happened to me...I am not a fainter!). The whole thing just made me anxious for whatever reason? And it kept getting repeatedly triggered at work. I think anxiety/panic is like a muscle that once you flex it, it sort of awakens and then it becomes really easy to trigger. It will fade with time, buuuuuut you might need to talk to your doctor about this specifically if you feel like you need something to treat it immediately. If you can get a handle on the anxiety piece, your dizziness may lessen. Anxiety/vertigo are deeply linked. \n\n&amp;#x200B; -I do not have migraines but I do have headaches regularly. Specifically when on my period or when I do not get enough sleep. \n-Yes I am pretty sure she was certified to treat Vertigo. The first place I called referred me there. \n-the vertigo came first, 4am I rolled over and the world was spinning. I woke up and made it downstairs to get a drink. Started to feel better and took a bath, got out and flipped my head upside down to towel dry and the world was spinning again. Then came the vomit. \n\nPrior to this I had no anxiety or panic disorder. And I so desperately want to be my old self. I am fine inside my house but once I get in public or around people (even family/friends) I go into panic mode. I cannot live like this forever, I have 3 kids I have to take care of. My daughter has a holiday play on Monday and normally I would be front row cheering her on and now I do not know if I can even attend. I am desperate for help or reassurance that it will pass. I am so afraid this is my new normal, I will never be my old self again.  Yeah anxiety/panic disorders can be triggered all of a sudden, exactly like you have described. It is most definitely reversible. See your doctor ASAP for help and acquire a therapist.\n\n&amp;#x200B; Hi. I am in the same boat, only several months later. I had my first episode upon waking on a Friday morning two weeks ago with plans to drive halfway across the country the following Wednesday. I had panic attacks the entire time I was driving. Just had several at Target. I have had the Eppley maneuver done, have done the Brandt-Daroff technique daily now for past three days and just took a Sudafed out of desperation. I also have TMJ which appeared at the same timer roughly, and I am thinking there is a connection although the ENT says it is just coincidence. I feel very spacey and anxious with a slight headache. I have a child as well and it is difficult not losing my cool when I am beginning to panic and worry that Im going to faint.", "24 y/o male with some dizzy questions  Vertigo can be caused by an infinite number of reasons. You could always postpone your trip. Or follow up with a different doctor for a routine check up. I do not know if this subreddit can help much, as your symptoms do not sound so much like BPPV, rather than just generalized vertigo with an unknown cause. ERs are simply to make sure you are not dying and to patch up emergencies like broken bones and severed fingers. They did their part by running a few tests and prescribing meclizine.\n\nYou are supposed to follow up with your doctor as soon as possible. Your doctor would then ideally figure out the cause of your dizziness and help you treat it and/or send you to a specialist.\n\nMeclizine makes me feel drugged (especially when I screw up and take another antihistime.) Or I take more than 1 or if I have taken it for a few days in a row.\n\nI have had episodes last for a few hours, a few days and unfortunately, weeks.\n\nThere are maneuvers that doctors can do to determine the kind of vertigo you have and ways to treat and sometimes end your vertigo. You should continue with the doctors and if at all possible postpone or cancel the trip. Thank you for the response! \n\nI am scheduling an appointment with an ENT tomorrow so hopefully I can get in ASAP. I just actually saw another general doctor and they checked my ears and said they did not suspect any fluid or irritation. He also advised that I should be fine for my flight next week.

It did not really help my vertigo, just made me sleepy and drowsy It did little for me.  And the ENT doc I went to says it actually slows recovery. I took one meclizine 2 weeks ago and went to the ER the next morning. I was very dehydrated. I saw my GP a few days later and he told me to drink lots of liquids when I was on it.", "Short burst of BPPV Has anyone experienced a short burst of vertigo from BPPV and then it was gone after a few hours? \n\nJust had an episode of BPPV after I woke up. The room was spinning turning to my left,  looking up and sometimes just straight ahead. Just moving made me feel nauseous and the room spin. Did the Dix-hall pike test to make sure I know which side and it was definitely left side (bad side). \n\nManaged to get in to see an audiologist who also specialises in vestibular conditions and treating BPPV. Gave it a couple hours of feeling sick and then went to see her. \n\nWhile I was there I got no symptoms. Did the Dix-hall pike maneuver twice. First time only a small flicker on the right side but my bad side (left) was fine. Second time with sides fine no issues. \n\nStill did the Eppley on my left side because audiologist said I was symptomatic earlier so there is no harm doing the maneuver. Just a little bit of spinning on my bad side (left) but it was so minor. Otherwise nothing at all. \n\nWondering if this has happened to others and if their BPPV came back in full force soon after such a small incident like this? \n I have had a couple of quick ones.  Shorter I think than you have described.  For me, once it is gone it is gone.  At least til the next episode months later. Thanks for your comment. Was thinking it was just the start of a bigger episode tomorrow.

I get dizzy if I tilt my head in any direction. \n\nI am guessing again work on one ear and leave it a few days to do the other?\n\nThanks. Yes. I had both sides tested via Dix Hallpike and both were bad. She (the Vestibular PT) wanted to work on one side at a time. \n\nHorizontal canal BPPV is much more common than bilateral posterior canal BPPV.  It is also under recognized by many clinicians. Thanks. I had seen mention of Horizontal canal BPPV when researching. I had been offered a referral to the ENT department of my local hospital but with the current COVID situation my GP is keen for me to exhaust self help options. (Im in the U.K.) Can this be treated as successfully with manipulation?\n\nI notice going from prone (on my back or either side) to vertical or reclined to vertical is a trigger. I wonder if that is consistent with Horizontal canal BPPV?\n\nThanks for your reply, it is very much appreciated. Why do you say that horizontal canal is more common? 90% of what you read on the internet for BPPV covers the Epley manoeuvre and not the BBQ roll.... my PT also said horizontal is harder to treat which is what we think I have :( Having Horizontal Canal BPPV in one ear is more common than having posterior canal BPPV in both ears (bilateral).\n\nWhen people say BPPV without mentioning posterior or horizontal or anterior canal, they mean posterior canal BPPV in most cases.\n\nPosterior canal is more common, and lasts longer when it is untreated.\n\nSo if patients have to wait a long time before getting diagnosed, posterior canal approaches 90% of BPPV.\n\nIf patients seek medical assistance right after the onset of BPPV, then the proportion horizontal canal BPPV increases to 30 or 40 percent.    The most common varieties of horizontal canal BPPV are fairly easily treated.   I prefer the Gufoni maneuver, which is shown in the video I linked. That is very interesting. Would be good if there was a FAQ to put details like this on the sub. I am 1 day old to the group and I have read a lot of the posts with a lot of repeated information and then there is interesting information like what you just posted that needs to be shared to everyone. \n\nSounds to me what you are saying is that if BPPV resolves it self it was probably horizontal and if it does not, it is probably bilateral?\n\nFor me when the PT initially diagnosed me she thought I had it in both ears but after a few more tests she could see that the left side was worse then the right and after the epley failed for my left, we did the BBQ roll which gave some relief at the time but was just dizzy and sick from all the rolling about. - had a stemetil (5mg) to try and help which I think just made me sleepy and took the nausea away, did not help with the vertigo. \n\nFast forward a week and when I roll to the right or lay back I feel slight vertigo but no eye movement (I think I somewhat suppress the movement by focusing my eyes) however my left kicks off the vertigo albeit a lot milder then before. \n\nFor those reading, I too have the lightheadedness, the feeling of rocking, feeling like I am being pulled to the left, my brain even plays games on me where I sense I am rolling one way, then back the other like I am on a boat - all of this happens while just standing, sitting, walking, etc. \n\nI have my follow up appointment tomorrow and I am hoping that with another treatment I will be on my road to recovery with gaze exercises and no more vertigo... \n\nIn the past (over 6 years) I have had ongoing \u201cbalance issues\u201d that no one could diagnose and put me down as \u201cit is just anxiety\u201d as the BPPV was not present when testing however after 6 months of balance exercises about a 2 years ago, it made a HUGE difference to my quality of life.\n\nJust sucks to be back here again :(", "How long will it last? Hi! I started having BPPV 2 days ago. I searched researched all about this on the internet and I think BPPV is the reason for my dizziness. I do not have any symptoms just dizziness whenever I move my head on the right side. I just want to know how long does this kind of dizziness lasts, I can bear it tho but the problem is when I woke up it feels like my room is moving, I think because of how I sleep every night. I hope someone can answer this question or give some tips abt this kind of thing. Thanks! Hey! My recommendation is to see a physical therapist or ENT doctor who treats BPPV. They evaluate if BPPV is the correct diagnosis and will likely perform some procedures of you to help get the crystals aligned in your head again. Look up Epley Maneuver - this is the most common procedure iirc. \n\nIf your dizziness does not subside by tomorrow, book an appointment for an evaluation because it gets exhausting and potentially dangerous to be dizzy for long periods of time. After Epley, it took me 3-7 days to feel normal and have all the residual go away. \n\nHope this helps! Thanks for this. It is getting hard to focus everyday. damn \ud83d\ude13 Eppley maneuvers are the best for this. I have been through this and had a hard time. Before I visited my ENT, I checked out how to do them at home with some help from my bf. I had in my right side too. The crystals will align soon, do not worry. Just do the maneuvers correctly and they should go away soon. I feel like I am doing the eppley maneuvers wrong tho. I will ask a help with my parents on this. Thanks! Yeah, you need your parents to help with moving the head from side to side. After my first episode, I had nystagmus (rapid eye movement) for atleast 10 seconds which made me feel really nauseous on my right side. This means that the crystals have moved and they need to go back to the right place within the ear. Spent too much researching on this back in Nov 2020. But it will get better in a few days. Thanks for this. I have had an anxiety few days ago because of this. Cannot even focus at work because of the dizziness. \ud83d\ude13 I did not sleep for days and had insomnia worrying I will start feeling dizzy and nauseous if I sleep. \ud83e\udd72Hope you feel better soon Hi! I did the exercise earlier, It lessen the dizziness but there still a lil bit of it. When you did the exercise did it goes off after that or it takes days before it will be gone? Jumping in here to give some encouragement.....For ME - it took over 2 months of treatment with a professional (once a week) and then adding treatment at home in between appointments.  We would do the Epley twice in the therapists office at each appointment. The second one was basically to test if the first one had worked. Over 20 Epley's later - it finally resolved. You can tell if it worked, if when you lay back in the first step of the Epley, you no longer get that 10ish seconds of intense vertigo with nystagmus. Sometimes getting the angles correct is tricky. Especially the last two steps.\n\nAfter the BPPV was corrected - I had HORRIBLE residual dizziness for months. So, for some people, it is corrected right away. For others - it takes a long time. Finding a professional that can help is a good idea. My anxiety was SKY high too - and the therapist helped reassure me.\n\nBest wishes to you! I hope you find relief quickly! Thanks for this \ud83e\udd7a", "Cannot tell which side my BPPV is in, or if it is even BPPV 20M\n\nI feel lightheaded a lot, and if I turn my head to either side I experience a lightheaded feeling. I also feel as if I am more sensitive to light than usual. I tried figuring out which side is affected, but both feel the same and it is never to the point my world is spinning. Maneuvers do not seem to help, either. ENT thought BPPV but I felt like I was left without much else other than a \"well this is my best guess, good luck\". No fluid in ears, hearing intact, tinnitus in right ear though. Labs all fine. \n\nAlso, when cleaning my ears with peroxide, it appears that when I fill my left ear while laying on my right side I feel more dizziness than when on the other side. I dunno, mine's always spin city.  Never had lightheadedness.  Did you try any maneuvers? No luck with them. I tried right sided ones for a couple weeks and nothing, left sided ones for the past week oe so and nothing either.\n\nTried all different kinds, no dice. I am so frustrated.  I am not even sure what you mean by \"lightheadedness\" and why that would be an indication of BPPV. Mine was the room spinning like I was on an amusement park ride...or faster.  If you have light sensitivity, you could have vestibular migraine.   Like a subtle dizziness. Not enough to make the room spin, but enough for me to maybe have a harder time focusing, which is already hard from an astigmatism  That seems to be the only symptom I have of that.  I have got the same symptom that started about 2 months ago. I wonder, did you happen to have a cold at some point a few weeks before yours started?\n\nI saw an ENT about my issue and he mentioned that viral infections could sometimes \"knock things out of place\" in the part of your ears that maintain balance. I did have a cold about 2-3 weeks before the light-headedness started but did not think much of it. I had an sinus infection that turned into an ear infection, which I feel made it worse, but it was still noticeable before.  Which maneuvres though? Epley? BBQ roll?   Would you describe it as a haze-y feeling? I have tried epley, half somersault, and  sermont Yeah that sounds about right.  Sounds migraine-y to me. But bppv and vestibular migraines can sorta mimic each other, or something, who knows. I would recommend a neurologist before an ENT. If you are not spinning it are not vertigo. ", "Worse nightmare for 4 hours first episode I had my first BPPV experience last Thursday waking up from a nap with my husband. He got up to the bathroom and I was quickly turning my body to the other side of the room. And boom! I felt like the room split into five like how it looks in Doctor Strange movies and started to turn crazily. I thought oh I turn too fast... probs going to go away in a bit. \n\nNope. The spinning last for over 20s ( but I did not know at that point it has something to do with my head positioning yet). I try to adjust myself in bed to other positions and it kept going, every time I even tilt my head the slightest I feel a strong wave of spinning. \n\nMy husband quickly ran back to bed since I was kind of screaming at one point. He sat on the bed, that caused some bed movements and boom the spinning hits me again. He tried to touch my head and boom I felt like I need to throw up right away... \n\nThen I started to sweat like crazy, my heart beat is going super fast and my whole body was shaking. ( I had panic attacks before, which lasted 4 months last year. So I was experienced in dealing with the dizziness that caused by panic attacks) but no matter how I try to calm my brain, my breath and my body down, the spinning goes off if I am not staying perfectly still. \n\nNot going to lie at one point I thought I was dying or I needed to call for emergency medical care. \n\nMy husband put down the shades and made the room perfectly dark; put some blankets on me; stand by the bed instead of being on the bed and held my hand. I could barely speak... and felt extremely nauseous. Basically stayed perfectly still for 30 mins until I feel like I can attempt to get up from bed. (That is the worse 30 mins in my life!!! This is so much worse than panic attacks!!!) \n\nI got up, used the bathroom with my head tilted exactly like how it was in bed. At this point I realize as long as my head is position in a certain way I am free from the violent spinning. My husband literally walks me back into the living room which he made it pitch dark for me ( seems like bright light definitely make me super dizzy)\n\nBut I still feel SO SICK. I had bad flue before and this is worse than anything I ever felt. I constantly feel like I am uneasy. I am nauseous and feel heavy headed; I wanted to lay down but I cannot. I try to sit up right to meditate and it works for a bit and then I feel dizzy again. ( not vertigo spinning just dizzy) Husband made me drank lots of water and I eventually puke my lunch out ( which I ate 6 hrs before the episode happened) \n\nAfter four hours of uncomfortableness finally my first episode ( and its lingering effects )went away. What a relief.....\n\nI feel woozy for the rest of the week, completely dropped my exercise, constantly battle the feeling of it is coming back, done some manuver on my own( seems to work but not fully), done tons of research online and now I am more educated about my situation. I will see a physician once my insurance kick in next week. (bad luck I was switching insurance this month and the episode literally happened in between time when I am not covered) \n\nDefinitely going to a balance center. \n\nTo everyone who is that is trying to tell us do not lose hope, thank you!  All your encouragement help me so much when I felt so desperate. I hope every one here fully heals and BPPV never comes back ever for you!!!!!!!! So sorry that you are experiencing this. Yep - it is a HUGE dose of no fun. You cannot even explain to people how absolutely horrible it is.  And trying to 'fix' it with certain maneuvers is equally as horrible, but necessary.  This community has brought a lot of reassurance and help to many. I hope your BPPV is resolved quickly and you do not have a long recovery! Keep us posted on how you are doing. I am not sure I understand what is happening now. If you move your head now, does the dizziness return? \n\nAnd no matter which way you turn your head, it sets off the dizzy spells?\n\nAlso \" not vertigo spinning just dizzy\"? Not sure I understand what this means. To me, vertigo, spinning and dizzy are all pretty much the same thing..no? Dizzy is more like light headed... general dizz you would get when you are sick. Vertigo is spinning, even if you are not moving, you feel like you are moving Thank you so much !!! Definitely got so much reassurance from this community! I will keep you guys posted :) If I move my head now, ( I am not having an episode), it is either slight dizzy or nothing. \n\nWhen I am having an episode, at the beginning is no matter what I do it will spin, and then when it gets better I realize it is when I tilt my head to the right it will spin. Not sure I understand about \"having an episode\". With BPPV, there are crystals in your inner ear that move when you turn your head. The movement of the crystals cause the \"spinning effect\" As long as those crystals are there, a head move will cause the spinning to happen. If the spinning does not happen when you turn your head, it means the crystals are probably gone...and your BPPV is probably over. This was insanely odd to read. It is almost exactly like what happened to me 3 weeks ago. Every thing you detailed. In almost the same order. I was laying on a picnic table bench with my head bent backwards. I got up too quickly. I am still dealing with side effects (had to sleep sitting up the first night), but i am going to physical therapy tomorrow. Finally. \n\nFeel better !! This is untrue.  A certain movement or position can trigger the bppv and does not need to be any head movement. An episode is when you are actually experiencing the bppv spinning.  Then after that is stopped, you can still have residual dizziness without the spinning.  The residual dizziness can last up to weeks for some, without having another episode. &gt;Sorry, but did you read what OP wrote? Or you just reacted to my response? I will make it easy for you:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Before: \"every time I even tilt my head the slightest I feel a strong wave of spinning.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Later: \" If I move my head now, ( I am not having an episode), it is either slight dizzy or nothing.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, before a movement of the head made a strong wave of spinning, but later a similar movement caused no spinning.... and this is without doing any maneuvers? The vertigo just magically disappeared? This just seems odd to me. Yeah... my situation is pretty common among BPPV patients. The crystals are not gone when the spinning stop... they probably stuck somewhere mid way in the canals and they can get lose again with some other head movements. Also the amount of crystals that loose also may affect it.... Yeah exactly Thanks!!! It is an odd and terrible experience I would not wish it upon my worse enemy....hope you feel better soon too!! Thank you!!", "Ears popping and feels like waves in my head Hey guys, posting to see if anyone has had the same experience as I saw my ENT yesterday with no diagnosis. I have had BPPV before but lately I have been having other vertigo type symptoms. My balance is generally bad, escalators and elevators are a problem for me. I have had several days where I just feel unsteady even walking and like I might fall.\n\nLately I have had a lot of popping in my ears, and when I lay down to sleep it feels like there are waves going through my head. Like I am in a wave pool. The ear popping seems to amplify when I lay down also. It is so frustrating and really affects my sleep.\n\nMy doctor said there is no fluid in my ears, and prescribed me a week of prednisone to see if it clears up congestion. If not I am due for blood tests and a brain CT. Anyone else experienced this? my left ear occasionally pops. i am not experiencing the wave thing. my ENT could not give me a diagnosis either. other than a deviated septum. unrelated she said. I have a perforated septum, and my left ear feels like it is clogged/pops sometimes. Almost too coincidental it is unrelated", "Seasonal BPPV Hi folks. This is going to be short and sweet but wondering if anyone else has a similar experience to me.\n\nAfter 3 years of dealing with vertigo - I have noticed a pretty solid pattern. I think mine is connected to seasonal allergies or at least a change in seasons. \n\nEvery year since I first got BPPV, I have without fail had an episode around May/June and another around Oct/November I have come to expect it now, perhaps as something that comes with the shifting climate between Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter. \n\nI am wondering if anyone else has this experience too? Oh yeah. It is all anecdotal I think, no real proof, but it always pops up for me in the spring, and same for my friend. Even my vestibular therapist said \u201ctis the season\u201d when I first saw her in April. My friend swears that taking daily allergy meds (10mg loratadine) has helped her fend it off for a few years. does your dr/ent/specialist say it could be related to allergies?\n\ni had my first case of bppv and i have allergies so im curious if there is a relation.\n\nthanks My specialist did not make the link for me but did say that BPPV can occur for a variety of reasons for different people. Personally this recurrence has really led me to believe it is related to at least maybe air pressure changes between seasons or temperatures because without fail I have been able to predict it is occurence around the same time each year. Moreso curious if anyone can relate. I would write it off because of a lack of research - there is so much to be understood about our bodies and I would not be surprised if BPPV research still has a long way to go (at least to me it seems like docs always say the medical industry does not understand it entirely yet). um air pressure or maybe when the barometer rises and falls which is also considered pressure. interesting. you actually might be on to something.\n\nit was explained to me, or at least how i understand it, is that we have calcium deposits within our ear canal. the calcium can become loose (like small rocks jumbling around) within our ear canal thus causing the dizziness. i wonder if the calcium that becomes loose could be caused by the pressure within our ear? ummm Yeah! Please revive this. I had my first vertigo attack just over two years ago now. Every March/Early April and early November since I have had an episode, but not nearly as awful as the first time. \n\nThere is little research on seasonal vertigo, however the studies done show influx in attacks in spring and fall and small correlations with humidity/barometric pressure/temperature change, but correlations nonetheless.  \n\nThere is a study about vitamin D helping to improve vertigo symptoms. I started taking Vit D/magnesium religiously last summer and the past two spells I had were not bad at all, very manageable compared to the first two I had. To my surprise, I talked to some family members and my Grandpa experiences seasonal vertigo, and his mother also struggled with it as well. So I am not convinced I did not inherit this.\n\nI am honestly about to start taking Calcium and see if that helps any. I feel like I am getting close to making these spells even less drastic by getting the vitamin combo right, considering that ENTs are at a complete loss on this. \n\n\nGood luck to everyone out there. After going through 4 spells now, one lasting 2/3 months, the words of advice I can give you are this:\n 1) BREATH.  No seriously, breath bc this shit is scary, and world altering. But you will be okay. This WILL pass. \n2) STOP reading shit on the internet after a certain point. Please. I had myself convinced I had Menieres and other diseases. Get yourself to a doctor to confirm it is not the big shit and then STOP. after I did this my life got better. \n3) If needed:therapy. I had bad anxiety/borderline PTSD that I needed professional help for. It did wonders for me.\n 4) Trust yourself to take care of whatever comes up. Whenever you get an episode, trust that you now know what to do to help and not help. Breathe through this. You got this. \n5) last but not least, WALK OUTSIDE. I swear to you, all I wanted to do was sit in a ball and feel awful. During the vertigo spell that lasted 2/3 months, about halfway through I had a breakdown and said fuck it. I started walking outside everyday, even though nothing looked right. When I tell you this changed everything for me. It is like moving/walking outside was the only thing grounding me. I felt so much better and took 3-2 mile walks a day. Get yourself moving, you have to tell your brain to adapt and re-adjust. You are only hurting yourself by staying stationary, load up on some meclizine and go for it. \n\nYou got this my vestibular challenged friends.", "Recovered I just wanted to write this in case anybody is feeling discouraged about getting better.\nMy dizziness is 99% gone now after 4 months of waiting it out. In the beginning it was very bad where I could not move my head at even a slight angle without feeling sick. I did try a manoeuvre on myself but it did not do anything. If you are feeling hopeless just hang in there. This has been the slowest journey of any progress in my entire life and I cannot believe it actually went. Look up Go Patches for Nausea/Dizziness, they are homeopathic patches you wear to give you relief. My wife has used them and they work really well. That is awesome. So jealous :( I am goign on 6 months of not feeling like myself. I feel you! honestly, hang in there because it will improve Hurrah! I am on month 4, with this being week 3 of the crystal finally clearing from my inner ear canal.  It is been awful.  And the residual dizziness is a whole new monster to deal with.  But I am getting there. It makes me happy to hear other success stories!  And trust me - I was knocking on deaths door for a while it was so horrible. And yet I was expected to carry on with life, as I did not look sick.  And folks are like, 'so your dizzy - yeah, I was dizzy once.....'  They just do not get it.  I had the Epley maneuver performed on me 20 times before it worked and saw a vestibular therapist that was amazing in helping me through this.  I am going to check out those Nausea/Dizziness patches next time, as I could not find anything to help with the nausea. (I hope there never is a 'next' time, but I am not setting myself up for a let down if and when it happens again).", "Anxiety about going into stores/offices now--afraid to go to the doctor Hi everyone &lt;3 \n\nI am not sure if this is BPPV or something else as I have not been able to see a doctor yet. The problem is that now I feel I am too anxious to even go in to see someone, because part of my issue seems to be visual vertigo, and I am afraid that office buildings would make me pass out or something.\n\nI have had some unsteadiness for awhile, not super bad, but that feeling of not being quite balanced. Sometimes I would get it if I stood too long in a store without moving, like at the checkout, but popping a mint would help me get through it. A little over a week ago, I rolled over in bed and got a vertigo spell. Everything was spinning, even with my eyes closed. I slept propped up which sort of helped, and the bad spinning was pretty much gone by morning. But ever since then, I have dealt with this weird off and on headache (feels almost like pressure behind or near my eye), and overall some balance issues. \n\nThe worst for me is that I now cannot seem to go into a store without feeling like I am going to pass out. I went into a new grocery store last week, and there was something about the lighting or something in the store that made me have to walk out after about 5 or 10 minutes. I have never had to do that before. Once I was outside, I started to feel better, and I was able to make the trip home. I went into a farmer's market the next day, and did okay, and I thought maybe it is just the fluorescent lighting. I tried wearing some Theraspecs into another grocery store, but although I did not get as dizzy as I did at the initial grocery store, I still had to leave after a few minutes. Yesterday, I went to Bath and Body Works, which involved walking into a mall first. I did okay in the mall (normal slight-dizziness) but once I was in B&amp;BW, I had to leave within about a minute. The B&amp;BW was definitely brighter and more chaotic than the dimly lit mall, and I started feeling better once I left the store and went into the mall, and even better when I was outside. What happens is that it almost seems like everything around me is moving, or maybe I am moving, I cannot even explain it. It just feels like I cannot focus on anything and like I am going to black out or fall over or something. I have tried not really looking at things on shelves, tried not moving my head too much, tried focusing on something in the distance. I have tried Bonine to see if it helps with vertigo/motion sickness, Klonopin to see if it helps with anxiety, and Mucinex/ibuprofen to see if it helps with any eustachian tube issues or any kind of weird inflammation causing it. Nothing seems to help or prevent it.\n\nI have an appointment with an optometrist in a few weeks, and I know I need to make an appointment with a doctor. The problem is that I am now TERRIFIED to go into any office building because I am afraid that I will just get really dizzy or disoriented or black out or something. I am thinking about making an appointment with a vestibular rehab PT, but I am afraid that even their office will trigger my symptoms. \n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this? Does anyone have any advice? Does this sound like something just lingering from BPPV that might just resolve as time goes on?  I had similar problems after a bppv episode.  It is very common and I did vestibular rehab for it.  It took 2 to 3 months before I could go into stores without that feeling.  On a good note, if it is just residual dizziness you do not need to worry about anything other than the uncomfortable feeling.  Watch some of Joey remenyis youtube videos.  She is great! That is so reassuring to read! Thank you for the youtube recommendation, and I am going to set up an appointment with the vestibular rehab clinic I was looking at. I am hoping that, over time, I get the progress you have had, and I hope you are doing well &lt;3 Definitely sounds like BPPV combined with anxiety, which only exaggerates dizziness because our bodies can be drama queens. \n\nTry the eply! You can find great videos on YouTube, and you can do it super easily and safely without a doctor. You will likely trigger a bout with the first couple movements, but if you can complete it it definitely helps. If you find that it works for you (even a tiny bit) after the first try, just keep doing it. I will do it like 10 times in a day when I have a bout of BPPV and it always fixes it eventually. I will also do it one time here and there if I am feeling some residual dizziness. Hi, I know you posted this over a week ago (hope you are feeling okay) but I thought I would chime in and say this is exactly what I experienced when I had vestibular neuritis several years ago. I dreaded going into stores more than anything. I had to have an ENG and VNG and they determined vestibular neuritis and I had to do rehab for it. It cured it almost completely, although ever since then I cannot spin around suddenly or I get insanely dizzy. But I just wanted to share as it could be something like BPPV or it could be something else, but going to see a doctor will be worth it in the long run. Hi! Thanks so much for commenting &lt;3 \n\nDo you recall if anything happened before your vestibular neuritis started, like an infection or anything? Or did it just happen? Did you have a lot of \"on a boat\" feelings, or was it mainly the spinning room vertigo kind of feelings? How long did rehab take to work for you? (Sorry for all the questions!) It is weird because it is like I have three states of being. The first is when I feel like I am walking on clouds and sometimes I feel like I am almost not real. The second is feeling like I am on a rocking boat and I have to work hard to maintain my position (other people do not seem to see any difference in how I move so I am not sure). The third is the feeling in stores, where I just.. it is like this horrifying terror and I will fall over or black out or something, just like a total loss of control of my senses almost. \n\nThe good news is that I seem to be having more normalcy off and on, but I am definitely not who I was before a few weeks ago when this began; I am trying to do more normal things again but I still cannot work up courage to be in a store because I am pretty sure I will just get that horrible spinning again. It is so overwhelming thinking about the different things this could all be and I know that is why I need to see a doctor but.. I just have so little faith in the doctors in my area and I know I need to get past that. I had a stomach flu about 10 days before it all happened. I was working on my laptop one day and suddenly felt a wave of dizziness, and the intensity subsided after awhile but I was left with a constant motion sickness feeling. Things were not \u201cspinning\u201d but it felt like everything around me was moving. When I would turn my head, it felt like it took my eyes a few seconds to catch up and then I would feel dizzy/nauseated, and I would be unable to focus. Walking around stores I would do the same as you, try to just look ahead and not look around because that just made it worse.\n\nI also had problems driving. My depth perception was off. I backed into a pole and another car not even realizing they were close. \n\nBy the time I got diagnosed this had gone on for about three months. Some days were really bad and some days it was much less noticeable, but it was always there. I did rehab for a couple months and I noticed a big difference just a few weeks in.", "Anyones VERTIGO..... ...just go away, kind of like that...after an experience of legs not working properly and could not \"clear your ears\" for several hours(like me)???????

Currently going through extreme Anxiety and vertigo returned after I had not had an episode for maybe 5 months.  Does anyone else find this to be the case? Mine seems to be linked to stress. ", "Does anyone get a sense of impending doom before an attack? I have not been diagnosed with BBPV, but I have been having vertigo attacks off and on for a couple of years now and based on my symptoms it seems to be the most likely explanation. I am hoping to see my doctor soon to get a proper diagnosis and/or referral, but it is been difficult to see a doctor for anything that is not considered super serious during the pandemic and I have also kind of been putting it off as long as possible because I am not super comfortable with medical environments/tests (trauma-related.) \n\nBut anyway, I was wondering if anyone else experiences this symptom or other signs of an impending vertigo episode a few days or hours before the symptoms start. I have had enough episodes at this point that I can usually predict when they are about to happen because I get this prodrome phase or something where I feel kind of floaty and dissociated for a few days, will often walk into door frames and railings as if I am just *slightly* off balance, but not quite enough for me to notice it consciously during normal walking yet, briefly feeling like I am falling through the floor, kind of similar to that falling sensation a lot of people get sometimes when you are just about to fall asleep, and a sense of impending doom or something being very wrong, but not being able to explain exactly what it is.\n\nIt is the last one I am most concerned about because of course it is most commonly associated with life-threatening health issues like heart attacks and I am not sure if it is common for people who experience benign vertigo to have these feelings before an episode or if I should be concerned about it. I am also kind of nervous to bring it up to a doctor because I have had a lot of medical professionals dismiss my health problems as \"just anxiety\" in the past and I have had to suffer through a lot of pain and discomfort on my own without any kind of real assessment or treatment so I am debating whether to just not bring it up if it is normal because if I say the wrong thing, I could end up being sent home without answers again. I have had my fair share of panic attacks and generalized anxiety and it feels very different\u2014I do not feel very panicked when it happens, just a sense of \"something is very off and I need to do something about it\" and when I have had panic attacks in the past, my fear of hospitals/doctors tends to become even *more* heightened, whereas in these \"impending doom\" moments I feel more dysphoric than afraid and the uneasiness is enough to make me almost *want* to go to a hospital\u2014so I am pretty confident what I am experiencing is not related to my normal anxiety, but I do not really trust doctors to trust me to know the difference, if that makes sense. \n\nSo far this feeling has always led to a vertigo attack and nothing truly disastrous has happened so I assume it is just my brain picking up on changes in pressure or balance that I am not consciously aware of or something, but I am curious if other people experience something similar or any other kind of \"prodrome phase\" before an episode. Or if you have experienced something like this and it turned out to be something more serious (although I am assuming most of you have benign vertigo, considering where we are.)", "Is it normal to have BPPV at a young age?

I hope in a few weeks or so I can say that I am back to normal.\n\nAnyway, back a few days to Sunday when this all began. I had a few small instances of dizziness Saturday night that I thought were weird but they were short and relatively mild. I woke up and went to get a shower. I turned the shower on and sat down next to it to let it warm up and was reading something on my tablet. Then, out of nowhere, I got incredibly dizzy. The room was spinning intensely. It came on in the span of seconds. I crawled to the bedroom, threw up several times, called my dad to come pick me up and take me to the ER.\n\nA few minutes later I stumbled out to the living room where I threw up a few more times and called an ambulance because I could not stand. I was sweating. The 911 operator made sure I could unlock the door and sent an ambulance. The paramedics helped me get dressed and helped me stumble out into the ambulance. They shot me up with Zofran I believe (anti-nausea medicine) and an IV as I was already feeling dehydrated from throwing up so much.\n\nThey dropped me off at the ER and they gave me some more anti-nausea medicine and a dose of meclizine which I would continue to take for several days until my first therapy appointment. Later on they would give me a few doses of Ativan/lorazepam as well as it was supposed to help with the motion sickness.\n\nThey did the Dix-Hallpike test to confirm nystagmus and then did a bunch of cardiovascular tests to confirm I did not have a heart issue. I had electrodes all over me. I found that if I kept my eyes closed, I felt pretty decent. As soon as I opened my eyes and the room started moving around, I got pretty sick. My eyes seemed to trace out an oval shape that was oriented diagonally down and to the right.\n\nBy the end of the day I could at least take some pills and could drink a little bit of water. They had talked about releasing me as I was less dizzy by the end of the day but I could barely walk and asked to stay overnight.\n\nThe next morning I felt a bit better although turning from side to side gave me a huge amount of motion sickness. I had an MRI done which showed no brain issues which was good. They had me keep taking meclizine and by mid-morning I was able to walk/stumble around a bit. I ate breakfast and lunch and by early afternoon I could look at my phone for a few minutes at a time but would have to stop and close my eyes to help with the nausea.\n\nAbout 4pm they took my IVs out and released me and I went back to my parents place. I am using \"potential\" for now as the vestibular therapist has not made an official diagnosis yet but thinks that is what it is. This story sounds so similar to mine. 30F. \n\nI had a few dizzy sensations in the morning, went for a CT scan (was checking to make sure pulmonary embolisms were resolved, they were) in the afternoon. Did yoga after that. Cooked dinner. Then, out of nowhere, I was spinning around 7:00pm. Violently started throwing up around 8:00 and could not keep my eyes open for long without them pulling in an oval shape (also to the right), making me so sick.\n\nWent to the ER, got the same treatment, plus scopolamine patches which stopped the vomiting. Still spinning for days until I saw a vestibular therapist who confirmed BPPV on the right and she did the Elpey on me. It slowed the spinning, and I saw her a few days later, where she said my nystagmus was gone. But my right eye was still slow to respond to one of the tests where she manually helped me shake my head then stop it suddenly, telling me to focus right on her face. \n\nThis was in January. I still have some dizziness that feels like it could turn back into spinning with the wrong movement. Overall all though, much better. I was ready to die when I just kept getting sick over and over. Terrible. \n\nSince then, I have seen two neurologists, an ophthalmologist, and an ear doctor. All said it is most likely residual BPPV. I went to so many specialists because my brain MRI was abnormal with some demyelination, that I have known about since 2016. Apparently it has not worsened so no one thinks its that. \n\nI have an appointment with a balance center on the 7th. They do the whole works - goggles to check nystagmus, different ear tests involving water flush, all to try to find where the balance system might be off. I am exhausted trying to pursue this, but maybe it is just my new normal... feeling like it could set off any time. Maybe it is my anxiety making it worse. We shall see. \n\nGood luck in your journey. It is not a fun one! I recommend the vestibular therapist or a balance center, especially if you are still having symptoms. &gt; I was ready to die when I just kept getting sick over and over. Terrible.\n\nHaha I can empathize with this. I wanted to Google of doctor-assisted suicide was an option but I could not read anything.\n\nI am hoping that Monday I will be able to get a positive diagnosis and start working on it from there.

My father and I have had a sinus infection for months now, do not know what from but we are trying to move away from our home to see if it helps cure us.\nWith that, for these past few months, my dad has had such serious dizziness bouts, like they are so bad all he does anymore is sleep because he cannot drive, he is always so dizzy he cannot do anything anymore.\nHe also gets these really bad shaking fits when the dizziness hits him hard. Like I was crying yesterday watching him because he cannot do anything, doctors act like they could give a single fuck that he is dizzy or they do not care to figure out what is causing his dizziness. He is literally shaking so bad and so dizzy anymore, he just cannot have a normal life anymore.\n\nI do everything for him, because he cannot even work on his computer or anything because of how dizzy he has become.\n\nWe think it has to do with his ear. We thought it was BPPV but he is done the Epley maneuver 10 times at least to no help whatsoever. We think it might be vestibular neuritis, or maybe meneirs disease. But we do not know for sure.\n\nDoctors here in Kentucky are not doing a thing to help him. One ENT even said he does not think it is his ear, but I swear almost anything I have studied that causes vertigo has to do with issues regarding the ear.\nHis ear constantly hurts and shit, but the doctor says it is not his ear, like how the fuck does this ENT think it is not his ear?\n\nOur next step is going to take him to a neurologist have an MRI done, because the ENT says it is not his ear, because he thinks he fucking knows everything apparently.\n\nTl;Dr I do not know what the fuck to do, watching my father become so disabled from vertigo is killing me. What the fuck could be causing him to be so dizzy and shake so badly every day? I am just at a loss at what to even do anymore. It makes me want to cry watching him suffer this way, and we cannot find a single doctor in kentucky that gives a fuck enough to help us apparently. Not all ENTs can treat vertigo.

Or is that a neurological thing? \n\nCan you be more specific with your information on his bouts of vertigo?\n\n- how long do the episodes last \n- what direction is the spinning sensation \n- does lying on either side make the spinning sensation worse or better\n- any history of migraine or headaches? See a specialist. Vestibular PT or another ENT. You need someone to do the epley for him. They do not always work if doing them without a professional. Not sure if you had help with that our not.

I cannot find much about it online besides a couple of academic articles. \n\nI had some vertigo issues recently, and when I went to my ENT they thought I had BPPV (I was diagnosed with it a few years ago) so did the Epley on me. When the audiologist did my Epley, he said there was no nystagmus seen during the treatment. I should say I felt dizzy during the treatment. I had some dizziness that night, but after that I had no issues at all for the next few weeks.\n\nRecently I have had some vertigo come back. It is only really noticeable though when I: sleep on my left ear (I am a stomach sleeper), look straight up, especially when lying down, and close my eyes and look down when washing my hair in the shower. \n\nIt screams BPPV to me, so I think the diagnosis is correct. Should I do the home Epley or the Carol Foster maneuver? Or is there another inner ear/nerve issue that I should consider and just go back to the ENT? I am just worried about making the symptoms worse by doing the maneuvers at home. \n\nThanks! I had BPPV without nystagmus! If that is what you have, the maneuvers work wonders ( or at least they did for me- but I had a PT help me do it the first time).\n\nOf note, if you are going the maneuvers correctly, you WILL get dizzy while doing them. Thanks for the response. \n\nThey said it was rare, but he never said he is never seen it before so I did think it was possible. Did your home treatments work right away, or did it take a few days?\n\nAnd yeah, I have done the Brandt-Doff (sp) exercises at home before when I last had the issue and it made me absolutely sick to my stomach. Never doing those again. Seems like most people do not get it to work, looks like Epley at home can be over 90% successful (Brandt was only about 30%). Yes. My eyes are clear of movement now but I am still getting vertigo episodes about once a month. I still do not have a clear cut diagnosis, one dr thinks it is bppv and another thinks it is vestibular migraines.\n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Pay attention to which side you are most spinny on, esp when lying down. \n\nTbh maneuvres that make you nauseous are not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 if it is bppv, it takes a few steps to reposition the crystals so you are going to get dizzy. \ud83d\ude43 \n Thanks for the response. \n\nIt is weird. The worst of the symptoms are either lying down flat and looking straight up or on my left ear/side. But I have some ringing in my right ear, I guess I will just chalk that up to listening to music too loud and getting older. It is pretty mild ringing, do not even notice it most of the time. Hmmm the ringing thing might not be a big deal, I think that is an ear pressure changing thing and maybe bppv people are just more sensitive to it. If you get a loud ringing/whooshing sound in your year DURING your vertigo episodes that is another story. But if it is occasional ringing, I would not be concerned. I would be more concerned about which side is spinny as that gives clues about which ear is affected which informs the maneuvres you will have to try. I honestly would not be surprised if you do have nystagmus during your episodes and your ent just could not detect it at the time of your appointment. Have you tried filming your eyes when you are spinny? No, but I will try and film the next time I get a vertigo session. \n\nI pretty much only get it when in bed, either trying to go to sleep, or it wakes me up, or lying back looking straight up. My ringing is generally throughout the entire day. I have it when I am dizzy, but I also have it when I am not so I do not know what to make of it. Yeah I have the same thing now (my symptoms have changed over the past year) and I only get it when lying down,  and will wake up with it randomly. Is the ent the only person you have seen about this? We should have a wiki in this sub about how if your bppv is confusing then you should try to get into a hearing/dizziness clinic, and go see a physiotherapist. I have seen maybe 6 medical professionals for my vertigo at this point and they all have different opinions about what is going on, because it is just a guessing game! Especially when your eyes are not cooperating. If this is affecting your life and not improving, get more help: whether it is a physio, neuro, osteopath etc. When I first had it I saw a neurologist and he said he thought it was likely BPPV. I know after seeing him I felt better, and no real symptoms for years. I would be waken by dizziness and the room moving side to side a couple times a year, but that lasted a few minutes at most and if I put my head in the right position it would \nend.\n\nOnly recently has it come back, and I now get it in those positions like I said. I also feel a little imbalanced at other times, but it is very minor and it does not affect me at all when walking or driving. Only when I think about it does that happen! \n\nI have seen two different ENTs and they both think it is BPPV but I have another appointment next week with the second one just to make sure. I find all of this so fascinating (although I am so sorry you are going through this too).  I just got diagnosed with BPPV by a physical therapist.  I did have nystagmus on my right side, which she said could indicate right side posterior canal involvement or left side anterior canal involvement.  She did the Epley maneuver on the right side, however.  She also thinks I have some central nervous system and/or cervical involvement (I do have a history of both basilar and vestibular migraines), so that further complicates things.\n\n\nIn your case, they still want to give you the diagnosis of BPPV, even without the nystagmus?  Have they ruled out other, similar conditions?  Are you seeing a vestibular therapist, either physical therapist or audiologist?  I am trying to learn as much as I can about this condition and the treatment. Find it hard to believe it would be any thing other than bppv for yours if you spin only in certain directions. Otherwise, research occipital lift on YouTube and google, part of my dizzyness is from my occipital nerve and my chiro fixes it with the occipital lift.  Right? When I get vertigo it seems positional, but when I am feeling normal and get tested I have mixed results \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nMmmm interesting about the nerve thing, which seems to relate to migraines? Yeah the occipital nerve, the occipital lift adjustment, that is also tied to migraines. For me, sounds like dishes clanking together and such made my eyes dizzy, moving my jaw forward or left made me dizzy, to the right I was fine, turning head side to side caused vision needing to catch up. Did the occipital lift for my right side and bam, it is all gone. Unfortunately I also get bppv lol, geez. \n\n\n\nNot sure what to say about your mixed results", "The main principles of Scott Davis' method for BPH ", "Does anyone else\u2019s residual dizziness last longer than their vertigo? Hi! I have had vertigo on and off since I was 20 I am 30 now so I have been through the gambit with this thing including physical therapy. \n\nLast round I had vertigo for a month straight and then residual dizziness for 4 months after. \n\n\nI finally stopped having vertigo with nystagmus about 5 days ago but the residual dizziness after just drags on and on and it absolutely drives me nuts. I am on a boat with neck pain until it just randomly stops one day. Anyone else? Is it bppv or something else? What sort of physio did you do? It is bppv. I get the whole room spin nystagmus ect ect then do the Epley to move the crystals out of the way. \n\nBut after that the residual woozy stays around. \nI went to a vestibular physical therapist. \nShe had to put crystals back idk how many times for me, one time I even had it both sides but it is 99% my left ear. \nThen we did the whole vestibular rehab exercises for about 2 months frequently checking to make sure the crystals did not fall back out and I was good for quite a few months not a single symptom but as soon as summer hit and my allergies got worse here we are again. Oh, I feel like I wrote this post!! Had the worst episode of dizziness ever a month ago and still have residual dizziness. My anxiety makes it ten times worse. The only time I do not feel woozy is when I drive. It really stinks. \ud83d\ude14 I actually said that to my other half the other day. I was like you know.. the only time I do not feel like I am moving on the inside is when I am moving in the car. It is completely gone. But as soon as I get out and walk around it is like ooooooooof :(. Completely sucks. Same. My residual dizziness lasts 3 months after the intial attack. BPPV diagnosed as well. I only things I do are:\n\n-Live with the drunk-sailor symptoms \ud83d\ude11\n\n-Avoid the gym during this time and continue working out at home. I also avoid any sudden head movement exercises. Just strength training with dumbbells or resistance bands.\n\n-Do vestibular exercises every morning when I wake up.\n\n-Epley manuevers with my ENT once a week\n\n-Only take betahistine during the first month when the dizziness is at its strongest\n\n-For my tinutitis, I drink plenty of water, avoid too much salt, and take ginko biloba capsules. Mine lasted 2 months after resolving BPPV.\n\nIf you are getting symptoms again after feeling fine for awhile the otoliths are probably loose again. Does supermarkets make yours worse? I feel like a few people come up with this question and it is often written off as anxiety - but this is an actual thing. Let me explain as best I can with how it was described to me and I hope this makes sense. \n\n  \nWhen I first got BPPV about 3 years ago, and it eventually dissipated without going to a specialist - I never felt back to normal again afterward. Things like looking up or down, taking a few flight of stairs (if I had to keep turning), or even a random motion in the corner of my eye made me feel this strange woozy feeling, sometimes almost like a I was being pulled in a certain direction by some kind of gravitational force or I was going to fall down. \n\nThe second time I got a BPPV episode that same year, it was so bad I could not walk without toppling over and I caved and finally saw a specialist (I did not have insurance at the time so it was pricey). The vestibular specialist did some tests with me to try and induce my spinning, did not work, did the epley maneuver on me anyway for both sides and we scheduled a follow-up.  He helped me understand the difference between vertigo and residual dizziness and gave me a few exercise to help with the woozy feeling you are describing. Here is how he explained it to me: \n\nHe told me that our brain relies on both our inner ears for balance. He described it something like this: if you are turning left, your left inner ear is telling your brain \"I am turning to the left\" and the right inner ear tells your brain \"I am not turning to the right.\"  \n\nWhat happens is that when we get BPPV - our brain begins to clue in that something is off with one of these systems (the affect ear). Let us say my left ear is my affected ear in this example. My brain starts to IGNORE my left inner ear and rely solely on the right inner ear for balance. What ends up happening now is that if I turn left, my brain does not even communicate with the left inner ear anymore (the ear that was last affected) it only relies on the right ear that tells it \"I am not turning right\". This reliance on one ear that continue long after we have done our maneuvers and resolved our crystals. Our brain still does not \"trust\" the inner ear that was affected. \n\nWhat happened next was that for my second appointment - the specialist had me explain what motions induced that woozy feeling (like I said, for me it was looking up and down). He had me walk down a long hallway and continuously look up and down, up and down in fast motions trying my best to walk a straight line. I was extremely off balance obviously and could not walk a straight line. He told me to continue these exercise about 2-3 times a day and I did. It basically was a way to train my brain to regain trust in the inner ear that was previously affected. I did this for some time, along with some other exercises and this effectively resolved my residual dizziness.  Now I sometimes get residual dizzness and re-do the exercises, the exercises are all catered to each individual depending on what induces their residual dizziness (some people for example get woozy looking left right not up and down). \n\nObviously I am no expert and this is how it was explained to me. If I can find the exercise sheet he gave me I will try and make a post for this community to see because I find this question about residual dizziness comes up a lot and in my personal experience the exercises I was given did so much to help me. If you are willing to see a vestibular specialist again I would ask them maybe specifically for exercises that can help with the residual dizziness or balance issues (if you have not already) and hopefully they can offer help. \n\nBest of luck to you, vertigo is awful and I would not wish it on anyone. It was only with the help of my physio that I have been able to finally feel in control of managing my episodes and I hope the same for everyone afflicted. Yes this, exactly what /u/timtamcookies said! This is what I have tried to explain over &amp; over.... You said it so well! I always refer to challenging the residual dizziness. And would do these exercises first while sitting still, then while walking, then while running (the running part because I am a runner). For a while it was looking up &amp; down. Then I would get dizzy looking to the side... So the exercises changed to that movement. And on &amp; on.\n\nMy BPPV lasted for over two months &amp; I got super good at being very active &amp; my vestibular system adapted to being off balance. Now that the crystal is cleared &amp; my bppv is gone.... The residual dizziness is taking forever to go away, since my brain was so used to ignoring my 'bad' side.\n\nThank you for your explanation. It is perfect! And yes.... There is a huge difference between the violent vertigo &amp; residual dizziness. It is impossible to explain to someone that has not experienced it. I also have my vestibular therapist to thank. She is a God send! In the initial days they do. I even tried to go into bass pro shops and about toppled over just from looking around. Eventually that dissipates. Ahhh yes my vestibular therapist said the same for me. But in her words we have neuro pathways in our brain and we have to train the brain to use a new neuro pathway for our balance to reconnect and trust our movement/ears and shoulders sometimes it happens fast and sometimes it takes forever because we are basically telling our brain to not use the same neuro pathway that we have been using since childhood. I feel god awful for people who just never recover (it happens rarely but it is terrible from what I have seen) They gave me the same exercises to do as last time which help somewhat I have the same ones of looking side to side when walking then up and down, then finger in front of my face movement I tend to do it outside as it is more of a challenge for my brain. It seems like my brain just takes forever to catch back up to itself. &gt;:( My residual dizziness is going on 9 months now and it put me into a really rough depression and anxiety (both things I have never had in the past). My life feels like its completely ruined because of it. It truly is not fair. Have you spoken to doctors about vestibular neuritis? I have to keep poping my ears in supermarkets its so strange. I read somewhere once it is to do with the fans on the refrigerators creating a pressure. Its annoying This is really interesting - and may explain something for me! We built a 32x48 garage and right after my BPPV was resolved (and I was still having a LOT of residual dizziness), I could not STAND going into it. It was the middle of winter and fully enclosed/insulated. The furnace, and multiple other fans were always running, along with a dehumidifier (trying to get the excess moisture out).  And it was so all completely bright white. OMG - it was horrible for me to be in there.  And I was so excited to have this huge garage - and it tortured me.  Yet - I had to be in there painting.  The noise, the brightness. Ugh.  I still get a pit in my stomach going in there - but no fans or anything running this time of year.\n\nAlso - in grocery stores.....the mix of looking/scanning up and down the rows and the strange noise/pressure/buzz in the stores drives me nuts! Luckily that has all gotten better with time. We sound similar, annoying for me where i work there are massive fans everywhere and i feel a bit light headed for a few hours till i kind of get used to it. I swear the light doesnt help for me as well. That Is what i thought was causing it to begin with as everytime i went into the too bright stores i would feel out of it and anxious. Even happend to me outside because of the sun once. I definetley feel better by poping my ears my left ears always makes a loud sound until its properly poped then i feel a lot better. I had a foreign body in my left ear once and had to have it removed and ever since ive sufferd. Yea, I have seen about 2 dozen doctors at this point trying to figure it out and never really got a straight answer, but the ENT I saw basically diagnosed it as vestibular neuritis and my understanding is that there is really nothing I can do about it but see if I recover. Oh gosh - I cannot imagine working in that atmosphere!  I struggled a bit too with snowmobiling this winter - all the white/bright and the continuous sound of the snowmobile. But interestingly, all was good as soon as I would hit the throttle and start moving forward fast! We get only a few short months to enjoy snowmobiling, and I was not going to let BPPV keep me from it! But seriously, imagine putting a snug helmet on, and the sun and all the bright white snow.....and the snowmobile noise. My therapist was totally amazed that I could even ride! Ha, ha!  A lot of the riding was during my active BPPV too - so once we would stop, it took my system a while to just chill back out and get used to being still and quiet. I often wonder if it was my riding that somehow bounced my crystal back into place, or it it was truly the 20th time I did the Epley that fixed it.  There was no 'ah-ha' moment that I knew it was fixed. Until I laid back to do Epley #21 (over the course of 2 1/2 months), that I finally had no severe vertigo and nystagmus. You did do well i can imagine what that must have felt like. I think this is why i have a new fear of heights, it all makes sense. I thought i was fixed. i had been good for months then i did that laying down quick with your head at 45\u00b0 to one side test, but then it come back the next day. Not sure if it was a coincidence or not. It helps to know we are not alone.  \ud83d\udc4d Allergies, or just changing of the seasons, if I get a seasonal flu in the autumn or the spring, then it triggers it off. If I knock my head into something, too. \n\nI have had BPPV again and again since 2012. Finally I was diagnosed in 2016 after having tried five or six different birth control pills, that my doctor prescribed to me. So in 2016 I started doing the maneuver at home, and immediately the residual dizziness came - I have never had it worse since (it must have been also 4 years of brain ignoring right ear, according to the answers here!) \n\nIt lasted for two months. During that time it was so bad that I had to concentrate hard on the pavement ahead of me when walking outside. When I walked, I had the strange feeling that an extra inch was always yet to come when stepping down on my right foot (it is the right ear). That feeling when you thing there is an extra stair and fall short. I described this to my ear doctor and he sent me to an MRI to rule out multiple sclerosis - which it was not.\n\nSometimes I am lazy, and do not do the maneuver until ... two, three, four weeks ... maybe longer ... after the vertigo comes again. I have never thought about the consequences of delaying that until reading this thread - I did the maneuver yesterday and today dizziness is disaster.", "Sinus infection/vertigo I have been seen countless times from ENT to ER to UC. Everyone just says do the eppley maneuver and take Sudafed and nasal spray. That is fine and dandy but it is not working. My head is still woozy. My right ear feels full but every single doctor says it is clear and dry, even tho I wake up and both ears are wet inside and horrible feeling. I am not crazy. But feeling like crap all the time and dizzy is sure making me feel like I am. You go to vestibular therapist? I have never even heard of that. I will search for one around. What should I expect? Thank you in advance They are teaching you exercises that help your vestibular system handle the dizziness better.\n\nThey can also help you determine what makes your dizziness worse. Any good physical therapy place has therapists who specialize in vestibular.  Ask your ENT to refer you to one asap.", "Any help here, desperate Here is my story thank you in advance for reading. Truly appreciate it \n\nFirst week of august is when I first experienced what I believe is bppv or some type of vertigo. I have been a mess due to a back injury involving a few disc bulges in my lower back mentally and physically, mentally it has shaped me to something I cannot believe. I was having a break down one morning  almost two months ago in tears mad and afraid due to my circumstances and how my current quality of life was being lived. You can say I was extremely depressed anxious and in pain due to this injury. After breaking down I hear my phone ring and immediately lift my body from  my bed.\n\nThat is when I first had a taste of whatever this may be I stood up in bed and immediately felt like I was falling back in bed  then the room was spinning and spinning fast. I call for help I am currently staying with my parents and was taken to the Er. They did blood work and a ct scan of my head I explained how I felt this severe dizziness keep in mind I have experienced dizziness in the past due to anxiety but never like this. In the past the dizziness was more of a passing out feeling now this is far worse. While in the Er bed the room is spinning I  have no control whatsoever and if I lay flat I can feel myself sinking in/falling back fast. If I turn my head while laying down the room starts to spin, when I stood up the room will spin for a few seconds 10-20 secs. \n\nThe results came back negative on the ct and they sent me out with iron tablets, my iron was low. I was told to follow up with my primary but no real answer as to why this happened. \n\nA few weeks of dealing with the similar symptoms getting up from bed or getting up from a chair or sometimes sitting down in a chair I would feel the same issue the room will start to spin fast and aggressive or when I would stand up it would feel like if I was on a boat rocking back and fourth.\n\n\n\n\nI dealt with this issue for about 2-3 weeks and felt like the symptoms were getting better. They had lasted for about 3 weeks mostly the month of August yet the month of September I was clear from the symptoms. Suddenly middle of October I fall asleep with minor anxiety  yet I was excited due to a new mattress for my injured back. I wake up suddenly around 5am to use the restroom and bam\nI fall back into bed I could not control myself from staying up in bed. \n\n\nThe room is spinning even more aggressively then the first incident almost two months ago. I want to yell for help but I do not want to wake my family members up sadly I lay there in disbelief why would this come back as I am laying down flat I feel myself\nFalling back but I am in bed already so it is not making sense  now around 9 am my mother wakes up and I am in tears I am sure this is something here. I start to think of the ct scan that was done two months ago and a mri I had done back in late 2019 for dizziness and headaches/migraines  not the same type of dizziness but in a way similar just less extreme. I have had several ct scans and mri in the past and all come back negative I am lost here and what to do next.\n\nThe first day of this return I lay in bed depressed and desperate wondering why. The next following days I experience the same symptoms while laying in bed or turning my head in bed . Again it feels like if I am rolling back I could feel my eyes rolling back as I sink down in bed while laying flat  or when I turn to my right side the room would spin and spin fast. Now last night I experienced a severe headache almost around my neck and lower back of my head. My brain automatically thinks it is a brain aneurysm a blood clot of some sort and my time is coming to an end. The headache seems to come and go  yet when it comes it feels like my death is close by. \n\nCould this be a brain issue?  Brain aneurysm or something similar related my head or perhaps heart? But then again if it were serious in that sense it should not come and go? If it was \n\n I have never had this issue  in my life up until 2-3 months ago and now every time I get this I feel like I am drying Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary.

Get your Dr to send you to pt for vestibular rehab if they rules out other things with the CT scan.  You will be fine! Oh wow I feel so horrible for you \ud83d\ude29 What a horrible go you have had. I thought the exact same thing as you did. Immediately thought cancer. Tumour. Had to be severe. I have been dizzy for over a year now. Constant. No relief ever. I did nothing to start this. No concussions. Nothing. One morning I woke up and was HORRIBLE. Dizziness. Room spinning. Off balance. Everything. The feeling of drunk and hungover at the same time. Two weeks in bed. Did not even move. I thought I was dying. After two weeks I said enough. And forced myself up. What a horrible go i have had.. I have had every test I can think of done.  I started vestibular rehabilitation almost immediately I recommend this if your off balance and room spinning. It has brought me a very long way. Very slowly. But it has helped so much! I have had every symptom ever. Tingling body parts. Vertigo, room spinning, off balance. Headaches. Migraines, pressure in head, pressure in ears, pain in ears, my eyes feel like they Are bouncing around, anxiety, high anxiety.. anything you can think of I have had it... \n\nWhat really caught my attention was that you said you had disk buges in your back... can you tell me anymore about that? I was actually diagnosed about a month ago with Mild degenerative Disk Disease.. idk if this is the same as you but Now i am wondering if this could be the reason why I am so dizzy.. \n\nYou should look into MS, BPPV, PPPD, and minieres disease. \nI hope you feel better soon! I had bppv. Once I saw an ENT (ear nose &amp; throat) dr my symptoms were resolved. Go see an ent. Sounds like bppv to me. I highly recommend finding a physical therapist that specializes in vestibular issues. Thankfully bppv is benign and easily fixable. Bad news, as you may now know, is that it can come back. \n\nPhysical therapist does a quick few tests on you to see what ear and what canal(s) in your inner ear are affected, and then can treat it with the appropriate maneuver to get the ear \u201ccrystals\u201d back where they belong. There are lots of videos on YouTube that show you how to do it yourself, but since this is the first time it is happened to you I highly recommend seeking the help of a professional. Hi\nThat sounds like BPPV and yes it tends to recur sometimes, but when it does it is usually due to an underlying cause like high blood pressure or Vitamin D deficiency, dehydration or other chronic vestibular issues. Id say first say go see a vestibular therapist if your ENT exam, CT and MRI have been cleared. Bppv symptoms are treated by repositioning manevers that a PT can do. Then check ur vitamin D levels and your neck issues and get them taken care of, it should reduce recurrences. Best of luck.", "BPPV - posterior canal occlusion surgery Hello Everyone! \n\nBackstory: I had my first bout of BPPV in the middle of Nov 2019, which took roughly 4-5 weeks for symptoms to totally resolve. I went to the ER because the first episode was awful, and me not knowing what it was, kept looking around and triggering it. They diagnosed me with BPPV, healed up, went back to work, it was history. \n\nFast forward to 3 weeks ago, I woke up in the middle of the night from a nightmare, super hot, flipped over and BAM, vertigo. Dealing with this before, I got up and stabilized myself, went for a walk. Weird thing: this episode was not nearly as disorienting as the last, but has lingered far longer.  Most of you probably have the symptom of after having the episode just constantly feeling like you are floating, everything is not quite right, but it is manageable. Issue is: my symptoms have almost healed up twice now and then I will get another bout of vertigo, and back to felling like I am floating and everything is not quite right. \n\nI have done the repositioning methods, and they do not seem to help. \n\nMy question to you: has anyone here heard of posterior canal occlusion surgery? Also, has anyone had the procedure done? I am calling a balance center today to see what they can do for me, I am hopeful. \n\nCurrently I am in the mindset that this is not the worst thing that could be happening to me, it is very disorienting and I am tired more than I usually am, what is helped me most is going on walks and staying active. After much research and many long nights lying awake at the fact this may be a recurring issue for me, the best comfort I have found is to keep living life as normal as possible, the more walks I go on and the more active I stay, the better I feel.\n\n For you first timers experiencing BPPV, I am so sorry that this is happening to you, yes it sucks, and yes you are valid in feeling like your world is crumbling around you. My first episode was so awful, and I cried so much because I thought it was going to be my reality, but it went away. Yes it came back in my case, but here is the deal at least for me: Accepting that this may be something I have to battle potentially the rest of my life and just accepting that almost as if it were a fact, gave me great comfort and control over it. There was a point for me where the nausea has pretty much subsided and I am just left with dizziness/floating feeling. I can handle that, you can handle that, it sucks, it is disorienting, it is a invisible \"illness\" that no one can see the struggle of dealing with, but you are alive and for the most part, healthy. Stay active, stay present, and do the best you can. Go to the doctor and stop googling horror stories. \n\nSorry this was long winded. \n\n\n\n\nSummed up: second episode of BPPV in a 4 1/2 month span, has anyone had posterior canal occlusion surgery, or considered getting it to fix your reoccurring BPPV. I am on my 4th episode in the past 2ish years. And yes, the first episode was horrible and I went to the ER, not knowing what it was.  It resolved on it is own fairly quickly. The second two instances were similar, but I knew what it was and was not totally freaked out by it. They resolved on their own.  This last episode lingered on and on and became absolutely miserable for me. Anxiety took over. I saw many specialists and saw a vestibular therapist that really helped me understand it. She did many tests to make sure we knew exactly what was going on. She helped ease my anxiety. She performed the Epley maneuver 20 times before it was effective. She would perform it twice in a row on me, once a week. And then I would do it myself a few times in between. I also did the half somersault.  When the Dix Hallpike (first step of the Epley) finally was negative, I still felt like crap. I am now a bit over 2 months of dealing with residual dizziness. I was told it is going to take longer for it to subside, since the BPPV went on for so long this time.\n\nAlso, similar to you, I continued to be very active. I snowmobiled, I ran, I was constantly active. I felt better if I could be busy. And my therapist encouraged activity. Part of my therapy was challenging the dizziness to get my system to rebalance itself (after the crystal was back in place) with certain exercises. Many people with BPPV are so unstable, they cannot do much, so everyone was pretty amazed I could still function.\n\nThis last episode got SO horrible that I was certain I could not continue living that way. I looked into the surgery you talked about, but did not get much info on it. If BPPV continues to plague me - I would certainly consider it again.\n\nTypically I would only get nausea during the severe vertigo (the part that lasts for around 30 seconds with nystagmus). But during a few weeks this last time, with the daily dizziness, wooziness....I had nausea. And THAT make it 200 times worse. I could barely function. I could not eat, lost 10 pounds, and was just miserable. I could not escape the dizziness (the milder dizziness). It was there if I moved, it was there if I was still, it was there when I shut my eyes. Torture. Pure torture.\n\nYour post pretty much covers everything I have been through and thought. I do have my fingers crossed that maybe this last episode, since I know for a FACT that we resolved the BPPV - it may not come back again. But I do not want to set myself up to be let down. As there is a pretty good chance it will come back. I will be curious to hear if anyone has had the surgery, or looked into it further. Keep us posted here! I find it interesting that it took 20 times for the Epley to work, I have must have done it around that many times myself and nothing seems to get them in place. I have not gone back to the doctors after they confirmed it was BPPV, after all the things I have read it seems as though most people just do the exercises and hope for the best. I honestly have just been waiting this one out and going on week 4 now it is just consistent \"offness\" about everything, just a lingering dizziness that does not seem to go away. I only had 3 months of no symptoms before it came back, I am just hoping that after it clears up this time it is the last. \n\nI have been telling myself that if this reoccurs two more times this year that is when I will consider surgery, and look more into it.  Just do to the fact of how long it takes you out initially, it just is not reasonable in today's working standards, and is really hard to explain to an employer who has not gone through it or has had someone close to them experience it. \n\nDo you feel as though you can do the maneuvers yourself, or was it helpful for you to keep returning to your doctor to have them performed? \n\nDid they have reasoning to why it kept returning? Was it because the initial crystal was never truly back in place? \n\nI have called to make an appt with a balance center, who is suppose to give me a call back today or tomorrow for more information, hopefully they can help me out.\n\n\nI also do not really have a nystagmus, which leads me to think that this go around is milder. In between my last episode and the one prior, I saw an ENT specialist. My ears had been doing strange things too. By the time I saw the ENT, all symptoms were gone and he even did the Dix Hallpike (laid me back both directions) and nothing happened, which I knew at that time it would not, as I was better. So I know at that point the crystal was back where it belonged.\n\nMy vestibular therapist was a life saver. She, herself has had BPPV and anxiety and panic attacks that sometimes go with it. She continues to study BPPV and is up to date on the latest studies. She put goggles on me to video my nystagmus, as depending on which way your eyes twitch, can determine which canal the crystal is in. I also developed gaze instability, as I had BPPV so long. So I had a lot of hurdles to cross to get better.\n\nI kept returning to my therapist as she kept giving me more and more exercises to do. She talked me off the ledge many times, as I was not getting better. I was losing hope. And she also monitored my weekly symptoms, as sometimes it would get better, sometimes worse. I needed to understand what was going on when the Epley was done. I wanted to know exactly where that crystal was in the canal. For ME - I would get severe vertigo for about 30 seconds with nystagmus when she initially laid me back, and then again upon sitting back up after doing the rest of the steps/positions. I did it in front of her using a pillow under my upper back.  She said my positioning was perfect and I could do it at home. Mid week if I needed to. I also did the half somersault, as that never provoked any symptoms - and I figured, 'why not?' Each time, after doing the Epley, I was just wiped out the rest of the day. It takes a lot out of you and I would feel so incredibly sick.\n\nMy therapist told me that the Dix Hallpike is the golden standard. If you lay yourself back and there is no vertigo and nystagmus, the crystal is cleared.  Yet.....I still felt SO yucky. There was no 'ah ha' moment where I knew the Epley actually worked. I know the last time I did it, and then did the half somersault a few days later, and then snowmobiled HARD all weekend.  Went back to see her that next week, and the Dix Hallpike was negative.  Not sure what actually was the 'fix.'\n\nUnfortunately - there are no answers as to why it returns. Or why one person gets it and another does not. And it is sad that a person who has never experienced it has no idea how horrible it really is. Like you said, it is an invisible sickness, as you look perfectly fine. I did not miss hardly any work and continued with life. But it was exhausting to try to get through 'life' while feeling so horrible.\n\nThis residual dizziness really sucks too.  And mine does not improve daily. It is more like weekly I will notice a tiny bit of improvement.  And mine changes as well.  Initially I could not look up or down. Now it is a sideways movement that gives me waves of dizziness. The therapist said I need to challenge it to help my vestibular system get back in sync. Part of the therapy would be looking up and down 15 times, 3 times a day. Then do it while walking, then for me (because I run) do it while running. Again, she was shocked I could do all of those things while running. But I felt best while being active.  \n\nOn a side note, my regular doctor, the neurologist, and ENT all were not really trained in BPPV. They had no good info or help. I realize this is not the case with all those caregivers. But for me they were all just like, 'you are healthy as a horse! Just give it time. It will go away.'  I needed more than that. The vestibular therapist knew SO much.  She would continually retest me to reassure me it was not anything else. I did get to the point where it caused me so much anxiety to go see her, as I knew how sick the Epley would make me, that I almost had to take a valium or something to go!!! I cried tears of joy the day the crystal was finally cleared. Even to this day, when I have a super dizzy day, I will lay myself back to see if the vertigo/nystagmus is there.\n\nPlease let me know what you find out from the balance center. I am a work in progress, and I want as much info as I can get regarding this.....in case it is now my new normal and I have to live with it as well. Have you heard about PPPD? It sounds like your BPPV episodes may have transcended into that. I had an episode back in September 2019 and I am still feeling like complete shit as a result of it. The only reasonable explanation for it at this point is PPPD. It makes me so fucking miserable to think about dealing with this for the rest of my life. I actually do not care about living anymore. I have never felt anxiety or depression in my entire life and now it runs my thoughts. Vertigo is not fucking fair. Residual dizziness is different from PPPD - at this point, considering what OP has been describing, there is no reason to suspect it is not just residual dizziness. (NAD) \n\nUnfortunately, I feel you, vestibular issues are quite debilitating. I have heard of it, I do not feel like it exactly fits my symptoms as I am pretty sure I recovered and had another episode of BPPV and it just seems like the residual dizziness is from the crystal not being completely in place. \n\nI did the Epley manuever last night and today I feel weird. Usually the Epley does not work on me, as I have tried it at least 10-15 times before hand. But today I feel heavier, which I think is a good thing considering that I felt like I was floating most of the time. \n\nI felt very hopeless when I had my first episode, it was so be and so disorienting, once most of the nausea had subsided, or was very little, was when I was finally able to pull myself out of my thoughts and try and look at the bright side of things. Are you staying active? I know it sounds terrible but that was probably the biggest help to keep me balanced, honestly the first 5 minutes of walks/exercise sucked but after that it is a good experience. \n\n\nI feel like this group is seriously underrated for support with vertigo, quite frankly we are probably the only people who get it. Feel free to DM me if you need anyone to talk to, it sucks to go through this and your valid in your feelings. I am curious if you pursued the surgery option?", "Best resource to help in understanding bppv related vertigo? Hi everyone, someone I know has been suffering from bppv and vertigo and I am wondering if any of you guys have come across any medical journals, books, videos that you have found helpful in understanding or even navigating through the throws of bppv and related vertigo? Especially if it highlights treatments for chronic symptoms instead of acute. I would like to get a better understanding on how I can physically/mentally help. Or even personal experiences that you have found helpful! I would be interested in this as well! I ordered a few books that looked promising, but in the end, they just basically reiterated the same basic stuff I found on the internet. I was happy to find this subreddit to get personal experiences that I could relate to. I think I read every single post here - and learned a lot.  Thank you for trying to learn more to help your friend cope. I respect that a ton - as it is a horrible condition to deal with. It is hard for others to understand, as it is not always visible the pain, suffering and misery that is going on with the person that has BPPV, not to mention the anxiety that goes with it.  My vestibular therapist is who helped me the most - as she continues to study the condition and has the most updated news on it. She is also experienced it, and has treated so many people, that she can offer a lot of help, physically and mentally. Same! I ordered a thick book and read it in the span of two days. All it offered was basic information you could find anywhere and just regurgitating a lot of the information on there. I think what I would like to do most of all is understand how I can support my boyfriend that is been dealing with this for a long time now. Especially not having gone through this myself I know how annoying it could be to hear stuff like \u201cyou will get through this\u201d and \u201ceverything will be okay\u201d I have also decided to change my topic of research for my dissertation to vertigo and bppv because it is baffling this has not been studied enough. I find \u201cit will go away on its own\u201d such an unacceptable response to something that is affecting a persons life this much. Thank you so much for responding and I will definitely fallow suit and try to read as much of this sub as I can :) Hello,\n\nVestibular PT here.  BPPV is commonly treated in Physical Therapy and perhaps the best information can be found in resources developed by Physical Therapists.  See links below.  It is common to have significant anxiety related to this condition due to the sudden onset of severe vertigo that significantly affects your ability to function.  Hope you will find these resources helpful.  I would definitely try to stay with peer reviewed resources.  Namaste.\n\n\nGood Resources:\n\nAPTA Vestibular Rehabilitation Special Interest Group:\n\n\nClinical Practice Guidelines:  Thank you for sharing this! You are quite welcome. Hi! How long after the repositioning maneuver should i wait until getting back into a workout routine ?? I had vertigo horribly for 2 days, was diagnosed with left BPPV, did the half somersault maneuver", "I have read here that I should not take meclizine before ENT appointment because it masks symptoms, but what about Ondansetron? My doc gave me meclizine and ondansetron for BPPV a while ago and I have some left over.  I have an ENT appointment tomorrow, should I take ondansetron to help get me through the night? I cannot imagine it would be an issue, especially if you are taking it the night before. \n\nSide note:  does the meclazine do anything for you? I cannot really tell, by the time I got meclizine the first time, it seemed like my dizziness was calming down already...the meclizine made me sleepy.  In other words, it might, it might not have. No, that is okay. In fact, many recommend Zofran prior to those appointments to prevent vomiting during corrective maneuvers.", "Vertigo and neck pain does anyone have vertigo BPPV and neck pain? Anything to help with the cervical neck pain ? pillow suggestions , cause , ? thank you in advance The U shape pillows combined with your usual pillow are great. Also the inflatable ones that give your neck a little traction are nice once in awhile. Interesting question. I have suffered with BPPV on and off for 6+ years and have self diagnosed (doctors are useless sometimes) that there is a connection with my neck (not just my ear canals). Over the past 12 months I have gone from a sleeper that slept anywhere and everywhere to someone who has a special neck pillow and I only sleep on my back. This came about from my last episode where the BPPV was that bad my only reprieve was to lay on my back. \n\nIn doing this over a 6 month period I felt the tension and pain (that I did not realise I was carrying) release and the residual dizziness reduce to an almost minimum. \n\nThe last 6M have been the best I have felt in over 6 years. I had BPPV 4 months ago.  Lot of residual dizziness and headaches.  Physical therapist went from just doing vestibular rehab to that plus doing a serious neck massage for 15-20 minutes a week.  The headache and dizziness are at bay since!   I did not have neck pain but she said I was carrying a load of tension in my neck.  If you see a physical therapist talk to them about it. So\u2026 I have been living with on/off dizziness and tinnitus since November of 2017. I have never been diagnosed so I am not sure if it is Meniere\u2019s (though I do not believe it is), BPPV, or PPPD. The thing is, I do have neck pain sometimes, almost about 2-3 days a week. This discomfort has been there since I can remember, it is a subtle pain in my lower-right part of my neck. I sometimes reach back there and feel a small lump compared to the other side of my neck, which I believe has to do with my overall posture and also the fact that my cervicals and my spine are a bit off. I can send you a picture of my x-rays if you like. DM me. I have not been officially diagnosed with BPPV though I suspect I may have it due to feeling off balance and dizzy whenever I turn my head but at the same time I do carry tension in my neck due to anxiety and posture which leads me to wonder if maybe it is not only an inner ear issue but a cervical one as well. I have never had continuous pain or headaches but just overall discomfort. I tried a contour pillow but it never worked for me and regular pillows do not do much either. I read that sleeping on your back and at an incline helps with vertigo and helps keep the spine and neck in a neutral position. What neck pillow do you use? Medium profile memory foam. \u2026 took me a while to get use to it\u2026 but what a huge improvement it made and now I cannot sleep without it. Massage Therapy has been a life saver for me.", "Questions/concerns about BPPV Reposting this from r/AskDocs since no one answered me and I thought maybe I can get some answers on this subreddit\n\nSo around 3 days ago I woke up at 5 AM and when I turned to sleep on my side I got severe vertigo, as if the whole world was spinning. I later realized that I only got vertigo when sleeping on both of my sides with my ears pressing on the pillow. Went to urgent care a few hours later and the doc diagnosed me with BPPV and said I had fluid in both of my ears (no idea how I got fluid in them, maybe from my dust allergy? I think he said the fluid was behind my eardrum but I do not exactly remember), but since I did not have any signs of infection, he did not prescribe me antibiotics. He instead prescribed me meclizine (which I have not taken because I am scared it will give me extreme fatigue + tachycardia and also because, like I said before, I only get vertigo when I lay on my sides, so I thought I might as well just sleep straight on my back) along with otc Maximum Strength Mucus DM Extended Release Tablets from CVS, since according to him, my Eustachian tubes are probably clogged which is preventing the fluid from draining. I guess that theory makes sense because even though my ears do not feel clogged/full, they pop when I swallow. He also gave me a packet that had diagrams of how to do certain maneuvers (like the Epley maneuver) that I could do at home. \n\nHere are the main concerns that I have:\n\n1. How would this doc know that I have BPPV rather than vestibular neuritis or Meniere\u2019s? From what I have read, people with BPPV do not have fluid in their ears but instead have a problem with the crystals in their ears, while people with Meniere\u2019s do have fluid in their ears. I am so confused lol\n2. How would this CVS version of Mucinex DM help get rid of the fluid in my ears? I am definitely not a doctor by any means, but after doing research, I could not find anything that supports this idea, especially since the description of the OTC product indicates that it is used mainly to alleviate coughing: \u201cThis cough suppressant and expectorant helps loosen phlegm, thins bronchial secretions to rid the bronchial passageways of bothersome mucus and makes coughs more productive. These extended-release tablets also provide 12 hour relief of cough due to minor throat and bronchial irritation\u201d\n3. Why did not the urgent care doc perform the Epley maneuver on me? Most of the stuff I have read from people who have had BPPV is that when they went to a doc, they had the doc perform the Epley maneuver on them, and they later learned how to do it themselves. I would have no problem performing the maneuver if perhaps the urgent care doc performed it on me and showed me how to do it, but because this is my first time with BPPV, I am very reluctant and scared of performing it myself in case I make my vertigo worse.\n\nFor those who have had (or currently have) BPPV, what should I do with this vertigo and how can I potentially get rid of it? I unfortunately will not be able to see my ENT doc until Sept 14th and I am in the midst of finding a new PCP. For now, I am trying to just ride this out and simply wait until the vertigo disappears, but it is causing me a lot of stress and giving me a lot of grief. I feel dejected at the fact that the BPPV I have in both ears is extremely rare (from what I have read on Google). I cannot speak to 1 and 2.   But I had same experience with 3.).  ER visit said BPPV and handed me some lit.  I did do the maneuvers myself.  They got rid of the nasty vertigo and nystagmus.  From what I have read and from my physical therapist, doing the epleys cannot really hurt you.  My PT made it clear to do dix halpike first to determine proper epley side.  \n\nA few other things:  you may have residual dizziness after getting rid of the bppv.  Many say not to use meclizine as your brain needs to habituate fast.   As well, go see an ent to follow up and make sure you get vestibular therapy (physical therapy for balance and dizzy issues).  \n\nGood luck.  Do the epleys ASAP as the longer you wait the longer you may have residual dizziness. No do not do this yourself. There are specialist doctors, usually ear and balance clinics, and they have special goggles that they put on you and turn you in different positions and they can see your eyes on a screen and they can tell by the way that your eyes jump around and move which ear is causing the problem in which way to turn your head and perform these maneuvers to put the crystals back in place.\n\nThere is really no way to know if your problem is vestibular neuritis or BPPV. I had the same problem I got misdiagnosed with BPPV and it turned out to be vestibular neuritis. Of course it took me self diagnosing myself to figure this out. All of this and these conditions are actually difficult for them to diagnose. What I did was research why vestibular neuritis Exists and what can cause it. Everything that I read points to vitamin deficiencies. So I began to take a pretty hefty dose of liquid vitamin B12 tri-blend, liquid B complex, liquid vitamin C and magnesium. Along with being as active as I possibly can for now and drinking a lot of water it seems to have helped\n\nI hope this helps good luck When I have bppv episodes I usually also have fluid in my left ear.  Research I read does not talk about this.  Perhaps the fluid or pressure makes it more likely for crystals to become dislodged in the inner ear?  I really do not know.  Also I have not had any Dr's ever do the dix hallpike or epley on me.  They always just send me to pt, which I agree is frustrating.  I would recommend watching YouTube videos on the dix hallpike and epley.  If you have a friend that can watch them with you and help you that is great.  I have always treated myself at home, as it always takes awhile to get in with pt.  If you still are having vertigo it is worth trying.  I think the main difference is that if the vertigo ends within a minute when you switch positions it is probably bppv.  If it continues and does not stop within a minute when you move it could be one of the other vestibular problems you talk about.  Do not get discouraged!  This will not last forever and you will feel better!", "First time getting BPPV and at work! Hi guys! As you can tell from the title I had a  BPPV attack at work. I have (24f) never dealt with vertigo before and was really scared when this happened at work Monday. It started when I felt my ear pop after I turned my head swiftly. Then starts what feels like a panic attack. I excuse myself to an empty room and that is when the dizziness and room spinning sensation and never ending vomiting ensues. I was able to go to the emergency room and was treaded along with doing exercise. Going on day 3 now of trying to get over this and return to work. Anyone have any suggestions/tips to help get over it? Or what helps you? \n\nThanks!!! Hello there..\nI am on my second attack in 1 yr. The first one lasted 3 days and went away with an antibiotic prescribed. Then this year was a doozy. The whole month I have been dealing with BPPV. I have learned that the Epley Maneuver helps me out a lot. So far I am on day two of feeling at 100%, although I moved my head too quickly at one point and got a quick reminder to take it easy. The spins went away after the first two days but the general unbalanced feeling stayed around the whole month. So try the Epley Maneuver. Also try to figure out what position.. Left or right that triggers it. Yeah I have heard good things about the Epley Maneuver. I am planning on looking  at a YT video to try and do it myself at home. Hope you get to feeling better as well! Same to you. I watched one in particular. I think her name was Dr Jo. She explained it well. I hope you feel better. Do not plan on doing too much after since it can induce some feelings of another attack! The Epley is good; some people like the \u201csomersault\u201d too. \n\nTry sleeping on your back propped up a little bit, stay hydrated. Hmm I will have to look up that exercise! Thanks for the suggestion. Back in 2006, I was diagnosed with a persistent, but benign attack of vertigo. It felt like continuous, gentle rocking. I ended having it for 7 weeks and miss a month of work. In 2019, I was hit with the sudden, spinning vertigo and vomiting. Not sure what started out other than stress. I have since been hit with it one more time (this post New Year's eve). Ever since I have a constant unbalanced feeling and I often feel like the whole world is trying to turn me (that is the best I can describe it). Ugh. I empathize completely. Oh no I am so sorry. 7 weeks is so long. I am glad you got through it though and hopefully will not be bothersome as much anymore! Ask your doctor to get you into vestibular therapy.  It helps a lot. One Simple Way To Maintain Your Balance And\u00a0Prevent Dizziness!\n  How are you doing now ? I am doing better now! I had a total of two weeks of brain fog and balance issues after the initial BPPV, but have not had any issues since. I can definitely tell my anxiety is heightened though at work in fear it will happen again. Glad to hear it. I am on day 6 now and finally woke up today feeling refreshed with significantly less fog..hoping to be back to my normal self within a day or two. Last time it happened to me 3 months ago and took 7 days to recover. And this was only for about 10 seconds of vertigo total. Crazy. I am glad you are starting to feel better now! So you had two episodes within 3 months? Did you notice it coming on more the second time? Thanks! The first episode I had it in my right ear, I woke up at 4am with the room spinning. I did not know what was going on so I just tried to go back to sleep, but any time I closed my eyes longer than 30s it would start to spin again. I dealt with this for two days until I figured out the dix-hallpike, epley, and somersault maneuver. \n\n3 months later I got it again, this time in my left ear, when I rolled in bed from right to left, and then when I sat up in panic it really started to go. This time I was on it right away, did the dix hallpike and identified the left ear with nystagmus. Did an epley and waited for 20 min and could not reproduce it...however it came back mid afternoon when I laid down for about 20 min. Did another epley and then Foster somersaults every 30 min. Did these about 6-7 times...have not had another episode in 5 days but felt like utter crap. I never had dizziness issues post vertigo but the brain fog and \"off\" feeling accompanied with mild nausea lasted for days. \n\nI am really hoping now that I have had it both ears 3 months apart I am finally out of crystals to relocate lol. Oh wow that sounds miserable. At least you were at home when it was happening! The maneuvers help so much and wish I would have known about it sooner the first time it happened.", "Well this is new So vertigo for 2.5 years, off and on but the last year has been manageable. It is been back the last couple of days but it is form is funny: it happens when I am in bed, then when I roll over and about 3 minutes after I roll over, my crystals fall(usually it is right away). I say that bc that is what it feels like. Not a full blown head spin but a head fall. Usually I lift my head right away to \u201cget me balance back\u201d but the time it takes after I move is what is surprising. It is only happened a couple of times each night and very mildly. But I thought it was interesting.", "Is BPPV inconsistent? So, for years now I have experienced sudden intense dizzy spells. The last two years its been happening even more constantly. About two times a month. \n\nThey are VERY intense and last about 2 or 3 seconds. And are obviously very scary.\n\nMy doctor suggested that it could be BPPV. Now, if BPPV is an inner ear problem, as Ive read, it would be consistent, would not it?\n\nI can go on roller coasters and get put of them feeling pretty ok. I think if I had an inner ear issue then those type of activities would throw me off but they do not. \n\nFor the most part I have an ok sense of balance. So, I would like to know if any of you experience BPPV at random times or if its consistent with certain positions or activities. \n\nThanks I have both BPPV, set off by moving my head to the left side (as simple as tipping my head the wrong way when looking into a low cupboard) and vestibular migraines. These migraines generally leave me with a feeling of unbalance and sometimes very brief spinning sensations that will strike with little warning, though I have found some clues as to what sets them off. I do not have headache pain, but usually notice a pressure in the base of my skull which proceeds these attacks. Dehydration, too much caffeine or alcohol and some supplements tend to cause the problem for me. I also noticed this after snorkeling on vacation last winter so I suspect water in my ears is also a culprit. \n\nI would suggest checking into the half somersault method for possible BBPV, but also consider other possibilities like migraines. Unfortunately, it can be a challenge to figure out what is causing these symptoms. \n\nGood luck! BPPV is often called top shelf vertigo because it is triggered by specific head movements, usually looking up high, down low (mine was triggered by bending over at the waist, to wrap a towel around my head after a shower), and usually rolling or looking to one side. It causes nystagmus  \n\nYou can try doing the Epley maneuver to see if it is BPPV, but you might want to find a doctor who knows more about BPPV. Thanks for the info\n\nWhen it happens to you, is it a sudden two or three second episode? Thanks.\n\n I wonder if it could be a type of migraine. \n\nWhen I look up my symptom in google the first thing is BPPV too. Apparently there is not much else than can cause sudden dizzy spells that last one or two seconds. \n\nBut I will look into silent migraines. For me it could last a few seconds to maybe 30 seconds. My BPPV would go symptom free for years, then I would have a trigger and be a mess for a couple of years where I would have to sleep with my head raised and watch turning in bed. Would not be full on dizzy but have fatigue from feeling not balanced. If you want to test for the most common form of BPPV - do the Dix Hallpike Maneuver.  If you get the few seconds of vertigo/nystagmus, you can be almost certain you have BPPV. Keep in mind that there are 3 different ear canals on each side of your head that could be affected.  And they way your eyes twitch help to determine which canal is effected.  Also - there are other tests to determine if the crystal is in a different canal, which can also cause different symptoms.\n\nMy body adapted so well while I had active BPPV, that I never had balance issues.  I continued to run, ride horse, ride snowmobile.....and in fact was most comfortable when I was busy.  This could also be why I had residual dizziness for 8 months after my last 2 month bout of active BPPV.\n\nA dizzy specialist could do some more specific testing for you and help you resolve what is going on.  So often doctors that are not trained in dizziness just say 'Yeah - I think you have BPPV. Give it time, it will go away.'  And many times, BPPV can resolve on it is own.  My first 3 episodes resolved on their own (and I did not know much about it at the time).  This last time, it held on and got HORRIBLE.  So I went to a specialist and learned a ton about BPPV.  Also - if you are active enough - you could be doing maneuvers on your own that are rotating the crystal around your ear canal and resolving it. But then it could be falling back out again. It is a complex thing - that is not quite completely understood yet.  You could very well be dealing with the same BPPV that is not resolved, but like me - have adapted to being 'off balance.' There are a lot of vertigo disorders that get lumped with bppv by primary care doctors bc it takes a lot of testing, trial, and error, to really figure out what is causing it. I technically do not have bppv but chronic vestibular neuritis. So, if it is seriously troublesome, get checked by a specialist. I did a lot of vestibular rehab, I move pretty well now, even when extremely dizzy. If it was BPPV you would be getting consistent, predictable, short duration dizzy and/or vertigo spells with certain head movements/placements.  And you would have this problem over a relatively long period of time (weeks or months).  In BBPV you have crystals loose in the inner ear, that is why you would get dizzy everytime, not just once in a while. Makes sense.", "An update Sometime ago I posted my story and experience BPPV since then I went ahead and saw a ENT who, because I live in a town where there is a lot of retirees, specializes in vertigo. He looked me over asked me questions about pain and what was going on I gave him the backstory, this took about 10 mins. He then said we are going to fix you up I need you to go see this person (an audiologist). I did not even know they existed but this lady tested my hearing to make sure I had to hearing loss which could indicate a bigger issue, then she took me to an adjustment table and through testing by moving my head and asking me when it was induced she was able to pinpoint in which ear  canal and where in said canal the crystals may be. She made me do a few very specific head movements and then she said (here is the important part I believe) Do Not move your head for at lest 24 hrs and if you can manage it 48. Apparently when your crystals are loose even if they place them back where they need to be they remain loose for some time so the least amount of movement is necessary for them to \u201csettle in their home\u201d. Now this fixed my issue for about two weeks and then I had a milder episode, I went back to her and explained she explained that just like crystals \u201csettle in their home\u201d they also could settle in the wrong place so sometimes it takes time for all of them loosen up from where they should not be and this causes the milder episodes the amount of misplaced crystals is less therefore the episode is milder. This made sense she did another specific head movement or crystal adjustment and same procedure no head movement for 24 hrs preferably 48 including while you sleep so I slept upright for two nights. Now I am 3 months out and no more reoccurring episodes, I am very happy with my results and I am thankful that I was able to find someone that is very knowledgeable about this issue. I hope that some of this information may be of help to you \ud83d\ude43 So happy you found an answer and relief!  I learned so much by going to a specialist. She put goggles on me to video and help see my eye movements as she tested all 6 inner ear canals (Dix Hallpike). And with each head movement, only one provoked the vertigo and nystagmus. The direction in which your eyes twitch help tell which canal the crystal is lodged/loose.  She performed the correct Epley maneuver for me (twice) and set me free.  The only difference, is that she said new studies do not require you to keep your head still for 24 to 48 hours.  I still was cautious. Unfortunately, I had to have the maneuver done 20 times (which provoked the violent vertigo every time she laid me back, and sat me up).\n\nThank you for sharing your update! I think this forum brings hope to anyone suffering from BPPV.  This is my 4th long lasting episode of BPPV over the past 2 years.  This time it lasted a good 3 to 4 months.  I saw a neurologist, audiology specialist, and then the one that REALLY helped me, a vestibular specialist.  The key is finding someone that actually KNOWS about BPPV.  I learned SO much and am hoping because I got treated correctly this time, it NEVER comes back! I still have a ton of residual dizziness, but the Dix Hallpike still is negative for vertigo/nystagmus. So I have hope! I am very happy for you I hope that this time is gone for good for you too. I could not agree more it really does take someone who cares and is knows about this specific issue to accomplish a good result. I cannot praise my specialist enough she reassured me every step of the way that she would figure it out and not to worry and that really touched me after having dealt with this for so long.", "Does shopping or hanging out affect my vertigo ? As you read ,  I was diagnosed with bppv last December and since  then my life isnt the same anymore \ndoes anyone feel that shopping has any relation that triggers vertigo? \nI noticed this after any outdoor activity ! I am afraid that I am going to be a home prisoner forever \ud83d\ude22\nPs\nl had 4 sessions of epley maneuver by an ENT \nHelp v You need to see a PT that specialises in vestibular disorders. They will work with you on exercises to help you recover. Prior to seeing a PT for balance rehab I found I could not drive car, go to shopping malls, large crowds, essentially anything with a lot of movement would cause anxiety and vertigo after BPPV. \n\nIf you do not address the BPPV and the residual dizziness you can end up with PPPD - \n\nHighly recommend you read historic posts in this sub for more advice. Thanks a lot this is really helping I wonder why my ENT did not mention anything about vor , she advised to live my life normally ! , taking some medication and  wanted me to check the clinic after one month later That is not something that should happen, I would consult your doctor. After my BPPV was resolved (and during), I had months where shopping was difficult. It did not trigger the vertigo, but it was like waves of dizziness.  Like, grocery shopping, scanning the shelves for an item, it is like it was all moving and would leave me feeling so woozy.  As Slash5k1 mentions, anything with a lot of movement as well (large crowds, busy traffic).  My vestibular therapist encouraged me to get back to normal activity as soon as possible and had a ton of exercises for me to do, to help my body get back to normal more quickly.  There were even youtube videos I had to watch  (search visual vertigo exercises). Oh man - those were yucky! But I got to where I could watch them without getting sick.  The gaze instability exercises helped a ton too.  Sadly - it takes a long time for some to get back to normal. And, I have just accepted that some of the dizziness will never go away. May god \ud83d\ude4f help us ..Time heals as I hear from most of bppv cases Many cases mentioned feelings of dizziness or floating after shopping or outdoors activity , I am confused \ud83d\ude15. THIS is why I go on Reddit, to find out I am not the only one!  Thanks for sharing your experiences. Totally agree!  For me, MD=0 help  ENT=0 help  PT=100% relief It is called \u201cgrocery store syndrome\u201d. I have it from having a concussion, which gave me vertigo and paralyzed my optic nerve. It sounds crazy, but my developmental eye specialist is the one that told me about it. It is exactly like you say, it is from the overhead lights, scanning shelves, the overstimulation. Look it up! Sorry to hear that , wish you getting better soon. For sorry we do not have professional pt in my area , so I have not other choice You should look up vor exercises to retrain the brain to help with your dizzyness. It only takes 1 to 2mins a day and you should try it morning and before bed. I am no specialist. But just going on by what help mea. Take care and I hope you get better.", "Constant feeling of un-steadiness/balance issues for a week. Doctor printed me exercise to help BPPV, and said he is quite sure it is something inner-ear related 24 M\n\nSo I have had this feeling of unsteadiness for a week now. Good way to put it is that I feel like I am on a boat and I am rocking back and forth constantly. Sometimes it is really strong and sometimes I hardly feel it at all. Important to note is that it is still a constant feeling.\n\nBeing in motion helps, like being in a moving car. However, when doing something on PC, like scrolling an article, or playing video games makes me really dizzy (this did not happen before).\n\nSometimes dizziness feels so intense that I can feel tingling on top of my head. Also, loud sounds, like loud music creates this tingling on my head and dizziness too.\n\nI also went to a doctor yesterday, who suspects it is my inner ear. He said that my left ear was a bit red-ish, but no signs of inflammation. Told me there might be some grain in my vestibular system, and it should fix itself in a week.\n\nI also went to see a physiotherapist, and he said it might be upper back and neck muscles being under constant pressure, but he does not know for sure.\n\nBut anyway, it is been a week since my symptoms started and it has not got any better. Anything pointing me to right direction to what it might be would make me feel a lot better, since googling the symptoms only gives you really blueprinty answers. I am not really sure if this is BPPV as I do not have that spinning sensation at all. I did not have the classical spinning sensation either bur had BPPV - one of the biggest misconception is that it is intense, but the sensation can also be subtle. See and ENT specialised in vertigo and get a videonystagmography - only way to tell if it is positional and BPPV. Good luck! Very similar symptoms for me, M33, been going on for 3 years but improving over time. I have seen 5 ENTs over the time, having a great doc really made a difference. I would highly recommend finding an OLDER doc who has seen 25+ yrs in Otolaryngology. Also keep a diary record of your symptoms every day. Really helps track things over time and any sudden changes. Going through something really very similar since the past two and a half months Did it get better? How long did it take? It is been a week and a half for me Hi Cabbage. I am sorry to hear about your trouble. This can be a challenging situation to deal with and I can totally understand.\n\nDid it get better? Yes. About 3 weeks ago, I went to a physical therapist for an evaluation. They ruled out BPPV and suggested that the condition I am suffering from is called vestibular hypofunction. I have been visiting the therapist since 3 weeks and I feel significantly better. I still have issues but I have returned to close to normal functioning levels overall. \nIn physical therapy, they have been giving me exercise to work on my neck stabilizer muscles and neck muscles in general. They have been also making me do eye exercises. Like placing 3 letters on a wall, and telling me to quickly change focus from one letter to another. Also one more eye exercise, where I place my thumb at one arms extension in front of me. I am supposed to turn my head left to right while keeping my focus on the thumb.\n\nSo I have been feeling good and been seeing results for sure. However, there is still some way to go. I would suggest go to a primary care doctor first, rule out other things. Then maybe ask the doctor to recommend some physical therapist. \n\nHope that helps. Please let me know if something does not make sense. Thanks Hi Lurker,\n\nLike I said in another comment, I have been in a similar boat recently. I have had these issues since the past 4 months and it is now (since 3 weeks) that I have started seeing some improvement. I am just adding all information here in the hopes that it may lead someone in the right direction. (Additionally, please understand that I am not a medical professional and do not take my post as medical advice.)\n\nSo about 3 weeks ago, I went to a physical therapist for an evaluation. They ruled out BPPV and suggested that the condition I am suffering from is called **vestibular hypofunction**. I have been visiting the therapist since 3 weeks and I feel significantly better. I still have issues but I have returned to close to normal functioning levels overall. In physical therapy, they have been giving me exercises to work on my neck stabilizer muscles and neck muscles in general. They have been also making me do eye exercises. Like placing 3 letters on a wall, and telling me to quickly change focus from one letter to another. Also one more eye exercise, where I place my thumb at one arms extension in front of me. I am supposed to turn my head left to right while keeping my focus on the thumb. \n\nApparently my vestibular system is out of whack causing me balance problems. My neck muscles have also been weak because of having poor posture for years (this is a contributing factor, not the cause). My vestibular system is also sensitive to motion or even the complexity of the environment. Making my neck muscles stronger so that my head and ear position are more stable and desensitizing me to the motion in the environment, or motion of my neck muscles or head is what the physical therapy is trying to achieve.\n\nTry visiting a primary care physician to rule out serious stuff. Then visit a physical therapist for an evaluation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, for the time being, try sitting on a chair which has neck support and/or buy a neck collar and use it when dizzy. Maybe that helps. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that was helpful. I have kind of written everything in a hurry, so if something does not make sense, please do not hesitate to ask. Additionally, I know how this situation can give you a hopelessness feeling. Just realize that there is hope and a cure to this situation, so just hang in there, okay? All the best!", "I am pretty sure I suffered a severe attack of BPPV Backstory: I am a 20 year old male who is an active gym goer and powerlifting athlete. There was a powerlifting meet being hosted at my college on April 1st, 2021 which was announced in October of 2020, so naturally I am excited and want to get ready for the meet. I trained at least 2 hours a day for 5 days of every week except the final week. That was when the worst illness pretty much killed me.\n\nThe Attack: So a couple days before the sickness, me and my roommate wanted to grab something small to eat the night before his birthday at Dollar Tree (dumb idea, I know). The following evening I went out to have my roommate's birthday dinner at Texas Roadhouse where I had a 6 ounce sirloin (medium), mashed potatoes, and broccoli (important for later in the story). I hang out with a girl I was dating at the time and she spent the night and everything felt normal. Following morning (March 23rd, 2021), I suddenly wake up early already feeling off. It was not until I got up that I knew something was wrong. The room was spinning violently and I had a hard time making my way over to the bathroom to then heave and vomit into the toilet every hour for a day and a half. This was my first time feeling anything like this, but the vomiting felt almost forced to where when I could not vomit anymore I would dry heave for minutes at a time. In between the times of the excessive vomiting and dry heaving I was trying to figure out what I possibly could have had. At first, I thought it was bad food poisoning from either of those two places I ate at. I also thought of the probability that it was vertigo, even though I have not had it before. After all the regurgitation ceased, I was stuck in bed for several days because the room would not stop spinning and my balance was severely compromised. After about a week and a half, I was feeling better, and my roommate took me to the campus clinic to see if they could figure out what was wrong with me. The first doctor said it could possibly be food poisoning given the time frame of when I ate and when I got sick. At that point he just told me to wait it out and brushed me off. I went back again and the second doctor said that it was gastroenteritis which I knew was complete bogus because I have had a stomach bug before and that was nothing like it. Yet again I got brushed off. Third times a charm right? At the point of the third appointment visit, the spinning was gone, but still occasionally had balance issues. I described everything in detail and he said it was a possibility that I had BPPV and a combination of food poisoning. Mind you, they performed 0 tests to prove either one. Ultimately, I was never given a clear answer of what happened to me and to this day I am still trying to recover the lost strength from being nearly bedridden for over a month. Can anyone give me some insight into this mess? Another little side note, when I was less than one year old I had to have tubes inserted into my ears for a bad ear infection. Do not know if it has anything to do with it, but might as well share. From reading I have done and my own experiences with bppv it does not sound like it.  With bppv my episodes are brief and only come on when I move my head.  Once I am sitting still for a bit they go away until I move my head again.  Usually laying down to sitting up or turning head quickly, etc.  It sounds more like something like labrynthitis or some type of inner ear inflammation, virus.  If it ever happens again I would suggest going to the er so they can give you some meds and observe you when it is active to see if there is nystagmus, eye movement.  I am glad you are feeling better, but you should not have had to suffer for so long.  Check out YouTube videos by Joey remenyi and the veda website for vestibular disorders.  You may want to ask your Dr for a script to go to pt for vestibular therapy to help you get over the balance issues quicker.  They really helped me out. Could have been BPPV, also could have been viral labyrinthitis. Usually my bouts of BPPV last a day or less but I had labyrinthitis a few years ago and it knocked me on my ass for months. Symptoms were similar to yours and were resistant to typical BPPV treatment, looking back I probably should have been given steroids but because of my history at the time the doctors dismissed it as severe BPPV. MD student &amp; BPPV patient here. Your first episode's symptoms were very similar to mine and that landed me in the ER - room spinning vertigo sensation, vomiting because I get so \"carsick\" despite being still. I suggest you check out the Epley maneuver, as the ER physician did this for me and cured 90% of my symptoms in the ER immediately. This is a good source: ( (just reading how to determine side &amp; Epley is enough, the rest is not necessary unless Epley does not work for you).\n\nPersonally, I do not think your ear procedure when you were very young affects this, but there is not a cut and dry cause to BPPV. Some people have looser crystals in their ear, coupled with minor head trauma (as small as a violent sneeze) or prolonged weird head position (mine was brought on by sleeping in a bad position), it would be enough to bring on an episode.\n\nWhen episodes get very bad, take some Gravol (this was recommended by my ER physician) &amp; I usually found that to be enough coupled with Epley. Obvious but do not drive when you are feeling vertigo. Try to keep your head upright during the day (do not lie down every hour), and lie down/get up slowly (to avoid sudden head motion bringing on BPPV). I also found sleeping with an extra pillow helpful. Hope you feel better soon! That makes total sense now that I think about it. When it first started, the girl I was seeing was woken up by my vomiting noises. Asked her if she could run and get some Dramamine which had little to no effect on the vertigo. Thanks for the input! Yeah, someone said it could have been a form of labrynthitis which explains why the Dramamine did not work when I used it. Thank you for the insightful information! Although, another person pointed out that it is most likely the case that I had a form of labrynthitis which normal Vertigo medication is ineffective against. During the first instances of my vomiting, the girl was woken up and I asked her to get me some medicine. Came back with Dramamine which hardly had any effect on my recovery at the time.", "I am very worried if it is BPPV or something worse So for about one year and a half I have dealing with this dizzyness + lightheadness + vertigo when moving my head (reaching down, looking upwards, etc). At first people told me that it was my anxiety, and since I am a VERY anxious 23yrs old guy, I believed it. I ended up not going to a doctor because it simply disappeared. But well, some time later it came back.\n\nIt varies A LOT. Sometimes it can happen as soon as I wake up and last throughout the day, other times it happens during the day and lasts even after I wake up. And then, it can go away for days, weeks, months and... come back.\n\nWhen I am 'Dizzy', I know for sure that if I look down fast, or do sudden movements with my head, I will have a very short episode of vertigo, like less than a second, not enough for me to fall or anything. It is more like a scare. When I am not, I can do whatever the hell I want and I will not get dizzy or vertigo. Now, a few times I actually got full on vertigo (everything spinning). It NEVER lasts more than 10-20 seconds at most, but it is scary as hell. Also, it is very rare. At first I thought it was random (and I developed a fear of it being Meniere's) but I realized the full on vertigo would only happen with head movements, that is what kind of keeps my hope up that it is just BPPV.\n\nBecause of the quarantine, I decided to wait to go to my doctor (things are real bad where I live), but few weeks ago I manage to schedule with him and I am going this 15th. But the problem is that I am really really scared that it is something worse. I am very anxious and I am hypocondriac and fear is basically overcoming me by this point. Somehow I think anxiety makes the 'Dizzy' days worse.\n\nLast week I discovered some maneuvers that can help with BPPV, I have not tried the Epley because I thought it was too complex, but I tried the Half Somersault and after 3-5 minutes, the dizzyness actually kind of of went away. But it comes back. Is this normal? I was set on waiting the diagnosis before trying these things, but I am just way to scared and anxious to ignore it.\n\nWhen I google my symptoms, some very scary stuff comes on, and I should understand that I am not a doctor and I should wait for professional's diagnose and also I should keep in mind that I have no other symptoms, but being who I am, it scares me to death, it is getting through my work and my fun time. The good news is that BPPV, while super uncomfortable, is common (80% of all vertigo visits to doctors are BPPV), and fairly easy to treat/diagnose, even at home.\n\nFirst, look up a video of the Dix Hallpike. This is the diagnostic test to discover if you have BPPV and which ear it is in. It sounds like you probably have BPPV based on the main diagnostic criteria (vertigo brought on by head movement). But check out the Dix Hallpike first.\n\nSecond, look up a couple videos for the Epley. I promise it is not actually that complicated once you understand it and have done it a few times. Epley is the most commonly used method of resolving BPPV.\n\nIt may not work right away. When I have an episode, I usually do it several times in the morning and before bed. It can bring on intense vertigo as the otolith (a small calcium crystal) returns to its proper location in the inner ear.\nThere are three canals in your inner ear, and it is possible to have BPPV in any of them. According to what I have read, Epley is the most commonly used maneuver, although there are several others (such as the half somersault) that may work better for you.\n\nIt is common for it not to go away entirely - you may have \"residual\" vertigo for days, or a couple weeks, as things settle back into place. Take your time, read about the maneuvers, and try them out at home. You can do it! Hope you feel better soon! I am going Monday to see physical therapist and hope is this and not something more serious. It is fucking horrible, specially the lightheadedness and dizziness that follows. When you say dizziness, you mean vertigo? No because vertigo is when the whole room spins like a washign machine right\u00bf this morning woke up very lightheaded when trying to get out of bed, could not get to the restroom and when I did i felt like I was going to faint, got sweaty and had to get back to bed and drink water.  \n\nI had vertigo attack on Tuesday and Wednesday morning where the whole room spins. Not anymore since then so far. Just feeling very lightheaded when waking up and unsteady at times during the day *Disclaimer: NOT A DOCTOR* If its dizziness or feeling lightheaded only in the morning it could be due to low glucose level, does the feeling of lightheaded goes away after eating? You should check your blood glucose in morning.\n\n As for the vertigo that you had, it could be BPPV or could be anything other than that, a doctor might be able to tell you better. Hi, I have anxiety and have had issues with panic attacks so I get it. It does sound like BPPV is quite possibly what you are dealing with, especially if the half somersault made it temporarily go away. A lot of times it takes more than one time through a maneuver to fix it, the typical suggestion I was given was to do the maneuver a few times through, then do not do it again for a couple of days and avoid quick head movements and up and down head movements during that time. Some doctors have you sleep propped up, some say it does not make a difference. So you can try that while you are waiting for your appointment. Hopefully your doctor has experience with BPPV. Good luck! I cannot begin to thank you for your response. Yesterday I did the Hallpike manuever with the help of my mother, and as soon as I layed down, instant vertigo and she said my eyes were moving a lot. I tried it with the head to the opposite side and nothing happened. Only on the left. Does it mean that it is a high chance of being BPPV? Yes, it means high chance of BPPV. Sounds like you are making progress! High chance. How are you now? Did you try any moves? Always good to provide feedback / results so everyone can learn. Well, I went to my doctor. Just general doctor. He said he has no doubt what so ever its BPPV. Says my sympts are way too specific.\nI told him I was doing the epley manuever and I thought I was getting better and he said to keep doing it.\nI am sure that if my symptoms indicated something more serious, he would have me going to a neuro. Yeah. - your symptoms do read text book BPPV. Epley is only one move, there are others that are designed to work the other canals. For me it was the horizontal canal so I had to do the BBQ roll to get any improvement but it was not instant relief, did the move maybe 2-3 times over 2 weeks with the PT and now the vertigo is gone but I am left with the residual \ud83e\udd22 feeling. \n\nI too suffer with anxiety so the mind does wonder if \u201cmaybe there is something else going on\u201d which led me to a number of MRI, CT, blood, etc only to come back all normal. \n\nOnly silver lining I can see is that it is only BPPV and not MD, MS or something worse.", "Seeking Professional Help Usually when I experience vertigo, it would go away in a day. This would happen once a year or so. However, I am currently experiencing it again and it is been about three days, which would be unusual for me based on my previous experiences.   \n\n\nWhat I am wondering is, if I were to seek professional help, should I go to urgent care or try to get in with a physical therapist? My reason being that I am not sure if I can get in with a physical therapist as soon as I would like compared to urgent care.  I am hoping this would resolve when I wake up in the morning, but if not, I can at least go to urgent care. However, I have seen people mentioning urgent care was not helpful and they just prescribed them medicines. Vestibular physiotherapists are quite understanding the urgency to get in. I would try and make some calls to see... they get a lot of cancellations opening up random spots... worth a shot. The PT are not doctors so if it is not BPPV then you could end up wasting your time. \n\nI would book both just to be safe and ask to be in the cancellation list. Yeah it should ease up after a day. If it has not you are not moving around enough or it just flared back up at night (what happens to me). Probably worth getting checked out if it is effecting your ability to do things and it is not too expensive. Otherwise, it will fix itself since it is just stuff floatin' in the ear. Your best bet is to get a confirmed diagnosis.  For ME - the best person for that was a vestibular therapist in the PT department. She performed numerous tests. I had seen an ER doc, regular doc, ENT and neurologist prior to that.  My first 3 episodes of BPPV resolved themselves. This last episode lasted over 2 months. I have been told that BPPV CAN resolve on it is own, as the crystal can eventually get reabsorbed into the body.  But being miserable for over 2 months was more than I could handle. So I saw the therapist weekly who helped with the Epley maneuver to get the crystal back to a safe spot.  \n\nYou are also correct in thinking urgent care will just prescribe medication and send you on your way. Unless they are experience with dizziness. Best wishes to you in quickly getting your BPPV resolved!", "What if antihistamines do not help my BPPV? I have had BPPV for 6 days now. Was diagnosed with it 2 days ago. I was given antihistamines and exercises to do to help but the antihistamines do not seem to work. I am wondering if there could be another cause of my virtigo? \n\nMy virtigo is not at the same level 24/7. It comes and goes. It gets worse after bending down and sitting up again. I also do not feel like I am spinning. I feel like I am floating on some waves, going up and down and up and down. It is not so severe that I cannot walk or function, except the occasional moment where I get lightheaded. Does anyone know what this could be? have you seen an ent (ear nose and throat) dr? if not see one.\n\ni also suggest searching for my many other bppv posts in this subreddit. So many good posts in this sub that it is unfortunate that it is unmoderated\u2026\n\nHave a read of this post - \n\nFantastic information about BPPV. very good comment in that thread that is a must for newcomers imo, I am just learning about this: \n\n&gt;ENTs and Drs may not be the most familiar with the treatments, and finding a vestibular therapist (read: A physical therapist that specializes in balance issues) is strongly suggested\n\nFor instance, a quick-care ENT might just give you general info and just a wax check. There are some ear-focused ENTs that might look more into it (like Eustachian Tube Dysfunction), but can be harder to book an appointment. Really depends, just know your options. You might need both, a Dr and PT Yep \ud83d\udc4d- shame we cannot sticky the work that others have done in the past to make this type of content far more accessible for others to find. Depending on your insurance and location, sometimes you can use direct access to just go and see a PT. Try one who specializes in vestibular therapy. The vestibular association has a running list of people and places in your area that specialize. Hello, I have the same exact symptoms you have, but for about 5 months now. I do feel as though I am on a boat and I am floating, but it only happens when I am laying flat in bed or sitting in a chair. I have tried antihistamines such as meclizine and it helped get rid of dizziness but it did not help with this swaying sensation at all.", "BPPV again or weird residual dizziness? About a week ago, I woke up because I felt spinning around the time of my menstrual cycle. This is not the first time this has happened after a successful repositioning of inner ear crystals with a PT specialist. \n\nHowever it has already been about a week and I still feel some dizziness sometimes when doing things like moving my head left or leaning back in a chair too quickly, etc. It sort of feels similar to the residual dizziness / motion sensitivity I had when I first cured my BPPV with the epley maneuver. \n\nI am not really feeling spinning anymore, but my residual dizziness was mostly gone since about late January to February (did the Epley back in December). \n\nWhy am I suddenly feeling this again? Did crystals dislodge again? I would try the Epley again myself, but I am always concerned about accidentally dislodging crystals somewhere else if I do it in the wrong angle. It is possible the crystals dislodged again. I would go see a vestibular PT and have them check and correct it for you. \n\nIt can also just be residual dizziness. Mine lasted weeks and I still get the occasional dizziness randomly. Recently I started intensely working out again and it has seemed to cause me to have a little dizziness/ off feeling in certain positions. I think your brain and your inner ear take a long time to  sync back up. \n\nAre you sure it was BPPV? Sometimes Vestibular Neuritis can have similar symptoms but last a lot longer. It takes years for the vestibular nerve to heal. Maybe look into that if the PT does not think the crystals dislodged especially if you had a bacterial/viral infection before all this started.\n\nHope you feel better soon! xx first, im just recovering from bppv (feeling about 90-95%, still feeling a slight bit dizzy but better everyday).\n\nim not in the medical field so just my opinion...ive read that it is possible that you may need the epley maneuver performed again. for some it takes more than one maneuver to fully recover. i recommend seeing your dr again, couldnt hurt. they will probably test your eye movement to determine if the maneuver is required again or if more time is necessary for your symptoms to resolve. \n\ngood luck, hope you recover. You can always do the Dix Hallpike (the first step to the Epley of laying back with your head 45 degrees one direction, head extended) to test if it provokes the Nystagmus and severe vertigo.  Then you will know for sure if there is another crystal dislodged.  That can give you some reassurance of whether or not it is just residual or the crystal being dislodged again. It took me 20 Epley maneuvers to get the crystal cleared. Week after week, we would just keep testing and going through the Epley two times.  When I finally had a negative Dix Hallpike, I was shocked, as I was still dizzy (but with no nystagmus or severe vertigo).  You should not assume going through the Epley automatically is successful.\n\nMy crystal was finally cleared in February - and I am still feeling residual dizziness.  And it changes.  Sometimes I have a good day, then I have a bad day. And occasionally I get freaked out that the BAD vertigo has returned. I will sometimes lay myself back testing both sides just to reassure myself and calm my nerves.  The residual dizziness - I cannot pinpoint it. I am very active and sometimes that makes it better.  Sometimes it makes it worse.  I just keep trying to be as active and 'normal' as possible while challenging my vestibular balance system to reset itself and get used to being correct again.\n\nJust curious, when you say you had a 'successful' Epley repositioning, were you tested again with the Dix Hallpike to make sure the vertigo and nystagmus was gone?  The first time my vestibular therapist did the Epley to me, she was like, 'There - you are fixed!  Now, lets just test it to make sure.'  She started the procedure again and nystagmus and vertigo were still there.  I was so sick by that point, that she sent me home and had me come back a week later.  She was still certain the 1st two Epley's had cleared the crystal, and was a bit disappointed when she laid me back and I still had severe symptoms.  18 maneuvers later spread throughout a few weeks, I finally tested negative with the Dix Hallpike.\n\nHang in there! Keep us posted as to how you are doing. I get some residual dizziness, I almost describe it as just feeling \u201cspaced out\u201d, but not usually for as long as you are describing. I first got BPPV in January. Had two episodes, did Epley manuever myself after watching youtube videos and it went away. Happened again a few weeks later and I went to ER where they did the same thing and gave me anti vertigo meds.  Just had another episdoe this morning. Unfortunately it seems I have chronic BPPV.  Also the past few days I had the \"spaced out\" feeling off and on so I now know that is a sign that crystals are dislodging.\n\nI do recommend learning to do the maneuver yourself if you can. It will reduce the amount of time you feel vertigo.  I had to do it three times this morning before I started to feel better.\n\nBest of luck Hey I usually get residual dizziness sometimes a couple weeks after an attack and then a repositioning. Mine went away in two weeks. Some episodes I have no residual dizziness and some I get it not sure why. You could try to get a medication from a doctor called Betahistine, its usually used for people with minears disease (sorry cant spell it) it is unhelpful for bppv because it takes a week to work but if you have residual dizziness then maybe it would work for you!

Are you getting enough Vitamin D and magnesium? \n\nMagnesium and Vitamin D deficiency and BPPV: \n\n\u201cGrowing evidence is beginning to build linking a vitamin D and magnesium deficiency and vertigo, specifically peripheral vertigo. As mentioned earlier, one example of peripheral vertigo is benign proximal positional vertigo, also called BPPV.\u201d", "Unstable/Shaky Vision with BPPV? Hi,\n\nI recently got diagnosed with BPPV. I also noticed that during this time, my vision feels weird. When I stare at objects or a room, it feels like my vision is shifting/trembling very slightly . I noticed that it tends to get more pronounced after a walk or movement. I have been doing the gaze stability exercises my PT, I was wondering if anyone else experiences this. Well, the way drs diagnose BPPV is nystagmus.\nThey put goggles on you while they do the epley maneuver to watch for your eyes to move back and forth. So that may be what is happening to you. Maybe. I do not feel or see any nystagmus, but it could be that are micro movement of my eye and that might be causing it. Sorry!! I literally had to stay in bed when I had BPPV because everything made me sick. I hope it gets better! Mine went away after my physical therapy sessions Ya. It is hard for even the dr to see the nystagmus hence the goggles that record it. Hi there -yup I am having the same sort of thing. My PT gave me gaze stabilization exercises too, they seem to be helping albeit slowly. Yea same. I have been doing them. Some days are better but some are worse. Does your seem to be more apparent in the morning and also when doing vestibular excercises? When I am on the computer is the worst. Otherwise, it seems to be almost random - I never know what I am going to feel like in the morning when I wake up - it is almost like my head/vision is buzzing or humming? Do not quite know how to describe it. Vestibular exercise is fine now, but it was not at first. I am about 6 weeks into it. Its been about 9ish weeks for me. I felt better for a whole week but then I got the residual dizziness coming back.\n\nHopefully we can get through this. Wish you all the best!", "I have had vertigo for a few years now since 13 and I have recently gotten a brown dot and patch across my lower spine does anyone know what this could be?  Alien abduction I would see a doctor. Do not think there is any correlation with this and BPPV Do you lean on that spot or does your chair or clothes rub you there? Would not be related to BPPV. It seems to look like a bruise, but no one here is equipped to diagnose anything unfortunately.", "Question about BPPV please help Hey guys ,\n\nMy doctor yesterday told me I had BPPV , \n\nHe made me lay down on the table tilt my head back and hold and not close my eyes for 30 seconds . I did not get naucious or dizzy in that position but when i sat up straight i could hardly hold myself up and felt like throwing up . I repeated on other side and it did not happen . Certain neck movements cause dizziness as well .\n\nI feel nauseous most of the day currently , \n\nDoes this sound like BPPV ? \n\nAny advice would be appreciated\n\nThank you so much Sounds like BPPV. You should find a physical therapist who specializes in BPPV and balance.  They can diagnose which side is affected and treat you until it clears up.  In the meantime meclizine may help you manage and dizziness and nausea.  That is what my PT has suggested and has worked for me.  Good luck. thank you for your respond", "Hmm, I think I have BPPV. 30m, 5'9\", 210lbs.  \n\nAbout 2 days ago, occasionally when I tilt my head to one side in bed, the room just goes into a spin.  Freaked me out a fair bit.  I have not really had anything similar to this until recently, the first time the vertigo came was a few weeks ago when I was on vacation, I suspected I ate something that did not agree with my stomach, that spinning sensation was followed by me vomiting up everything I had for lunch and dinner and the symptoms never came back until now.  I do not think it has anything to do with food this time, because it happens almost every time I turn my head in bed.  And although I get some feelings of nausea and dry heaving, I never actually vomit anything out.\n\nI have been taking some prescribed Serc to try and manage it, but I think I will need to get it looked into a bit more.  Any tips/thoughts? Sounds like it!\n\nHave you tried any maneuvres yet? Epley or otherwise? You can look them up on YouTube.\n\nGPs are not necessarily experts in vertigo, so they will prob forward you to an ear/nose person and/or neurologist. They will want to make sure it is nothing serious (your case sounds like classic bppv but obviously there are other vertigo causes that are less benign).\n\nIf your GP makes you lie down and watches your eyeballs when you move your head from side to side, they may be able to guess what is going on but if they just look at your ears and stuff, I would recommend being proactive and immediately seek more help if this persists:\n\nI would recommend seeking out a Physiotherapist or osteopath in your area that specializes in vertigo. The tricky part with vertigo is figuring out which canal is affected (not sure how much you have read yet about the canal stuff). Once you can figure out your canal you should be able to quickly reverse the vertigo with specific head and body movements. Which is pretty neat!\n\nIt took me a long time to figure out my vertigo because I have the rarest form of bppv that affects my horizontal canal, but chances are you are the classic type (95% of ppl get the vertical canal).\n\nAnyway, hope it clears quickly for you and good luck!  I have found it helps if I hold my nose and slightly blow, just a tiny bit be very careful. It does not cure it but it seems to reduce the severity and it does not seem to last as long.\n\nI have had 12 hour long episodes. My all-time record so far. I am going on a few weeks. Have been taking meclizine to stop the spins.  I would recommend against home remedies. I tried some maneuvers at home and it fucked me up quite a bit. BPPV is common so there are good ENTs out there who have treated hundreds of patients. I would say find a good ENT who is willing to listen to you and go from there. Do not take this lightly. I take ginger pills everyday when i know its been a bad week or ill take it when i can feel the vertigo coming on. Ginger pills have saved me so much iv gotten rid on ibuprofen which i was eating like candy when i first found out i had BPPV. I can not lean my head to the right or lay in bed once i wake up, iv noticed those are a few triggers.", "Has anyone heard of/used the DizzyFIX device? It looks interesting  Maybe provide, a link?

I like the visual representation.\n\nIf you would like to see what might be going on inside (as opposed to only feeling it) as you are doing a maneuver, this looks like it might help! I have it, and I do recommend it. I thought I was doing the procedure correctly but I wanted to be sure. When I wore it, I was kind of amazed at how your chin had to really, really tuck in before you get up. That is when I realized I was not doing it right before. I have seen it in clinical use. Helps know if you are in the right position. I cannot recommend this device enough. It has completely resolved my BPPV, and the angles required to take make the crystals move is something I could not have accomplished on my own. Worth every penny.", "Please help! Has anyone else been diagnosed with binocular vision dysfunction? Since January, I have dealt with near constant dizziness and feeling lightheaded and off balance. Went to my primary care in March for my yearly and was told I have bppv and prescribed meclizine. This made my symptoms worse so I called back and he referred me to a vestibular therapist. He did a couple maneuvers and I felt really dizzy after. He did not see any nystagmus and does not think it is BPPV but did the treatments anyway. My doctor then referred me to an ent who did a hearing test and looked in my ears and asked about my symptoms and said does not think an inner ear disorder, bc I am lightheaded and off balance as opposed to interludes of spinning.he sent me on my way. I was getting so frustrated and my friend suggested I have my eyes checked. I actually am mildly near sited in and mildy far in the other and have agistimatism but the new glasses make the symptoms worse. \ufffcI have had the perscription checked twice and it is correct.  I read about this condition of misaligned eyes online and the symptoms match up with mine and I am seeing a specialist next month and I am hoping that they have answers because I am honestly incredibly depressed and despondent and cannot have a normal life\ufffc\ufffc.", "Could it be BPPV? I was hit with a massive panic attack 2 weeks after a sinus infection. I thought I was having a heart attack and was about to pass out. The Er diagnosed me with \u201cpanic disorder.\u201d Since then, I have dealt with constant anxiety and panic symptoms (heart rate shoots up, feeling like I am dying, trembling), wooziness sometimes, blurry vision, pressure in the back of my head....\n\nToday I saw my PCP and she told me I have a pretty bad sinus infection and both of my ear drums are infected, which could be the root of my panic and anxiety issues. So....I am wondering...can you have BPPV without the \u201croom spinning\u201d feeling? Man, this all sounds really scary. Panic attacks are the worst. I am sending you positive vibes and well wishes to get some medical relief. And soon. No, this has nothing to do with BPPV. Vertigo affects your balance and nothing else. I had a gnarly sinus infection once that sent me to the ER, and I felt like I was dying too. Get some decongestants and relieve some of those symptoms, homie! I do not think you have BPPV. It sounds like you have a sinus infection that is causing some symptoms and your body is freaking out and causing secondary panic symptoms. You should not listen to the panic (harder than it sounds, I know), it is your body responding improperly to a non-existent threat. You simply have a common infection that is treatable, you will get better! Your best bet is to see a therapist about your underlying anxiety.\n\nBPPV is very much characterized by extreme dizziness that is brought on by being in a certain position. For me, I can have it come on if I do a weird movement onto my left side while laying down. I can do the Eply make it 90% better. Get yourself a Netipot... it will help clear out your sinuses faster than anything else- then take a decongestant to try and keep the mucus from blocking everything. The thing is....I do not really have bad sinus infection symptoms. Like I know something is going on in there, but it is not too bad...My problem is with my ears and trying to figure out if there is something going on that is causing the panic attacks, ya know? Because they came out of absolutely no where and I have read that inner ear infections can cause panic and anxiety symptoms. It is all just strange and it is hard to know what is related and what is not! So you think it is possible to have something minor like a sinus infection and ear pressure and then boom....your mind freaks out and panic (literally) ensues? I have done some research on labyrinthitis and how it can cause anxiety and panic attacks so I am extremely curious about this theory....Like...do I have a mental illness or do I have a physical condition that is causing the mental illness like symptoms secondary, ya know? It is hard to tell which is which. Yea, I know what you mean! I went to the ER because I had no idea what was wrong with me. I was not having any sinus infection symptoms that I was aware of. Maybe a little headache. I always pictured a sinus infection as being completely stuffy like you see in the movies. It is a sneaky little guy! And I could see how it could definitely cause lots of random symptoms, including anxiety and dizziness. I am sure you will feel back to 100% after a few days of antibiotics. Hugs to you! I have got two doses of antibiotics in and I am feeling a lot better. At one point, I thought I was going insane with the constant anxiety and panic...then my mind started to think all kinds of crazy things, which made me think I was losing it even more. \n\nI am not sure if I am actually getting better and my mental health is going back to normal or if I have just convinced myself I am...I still have had some moments where I am just like \u201ceverything feels weird,\u201d but I have just took a deep breath and pushed passed it.

My BPPV started about 6 years ago. I did the Epley maneuver but the BPPV came back in about 6 months after that, did Epley again. Ever since I have been sleeping on my back and avoided laying on my sides at all cost, vertigo has not come back. Every now and then I would feel off-balance, like missing a step or the floor is moving while it is not. But if I get enough sleep, the feeling goes away.\n\nNext week I am going to Orlando and very anxious about all the rides there. I do not want to miss out on the fun or make my husband feel bad about missing out on the rides (he loves them). What should I do to calm my nerve? Take Dramamine before hand? What should I do if I am mid-ride and feel vertigo attack? Any advice is appreciated. I do not know. I would not go on anything that moves you upside down and all that. If that crystal goes in the wrong spot no amount of Meclizine is going to help you. I agree with this. If you are going to Disneyland, there are only 2 or 3 rollar coaster rides (space mountain, thunderball express, etc). Skip those. The rest of Disney can be enjoyed with no problems. I had a really bad BPPV episode 4 years ago after no history of vertigo or BPPV and have not been on a rollercoaster since because I know it would ruin me. Honestly, I would just avoid them.", "Still feeling dizzy/foggy less than 48 hours after vertigo episode Hey all!\n\nSo less than 2 days ago I was gaming and all the sudden the room started shaking around me and I just had to leave and go lay down.

Is this normal?\n\n- Why did diziness get more intense yesterday without vertigo but happened exactly 24 hours after vertigo episode from the previous day?\n\nThoughts? What are you doing when it gets worse at night? Have you googled BPPV to determine if this is likely what you have? The specifics around what brings on the dizziness are important. Does it come on with head movements like changing position in bed? Do you have nystagmus? Just last night it got worse its only been 2 days so far.\n\nToday earlier on I was still feeling dizzy but now its actually much better. Curious to see if I am gona get intense dizzy tonight as well. Not rlly sure if i can say I have BPPV, I experienced episode of vertigo that is for sure and then for past 2 days even though vertigo is gone, I still feel somewhat dizzy/foggy if that is the right word.\n\nIts like my brain took so much damage during the vertigo episode that its still recovering from it which is why I still have dizziness 2 days later.\n\nBut yeah not sure why dizziness got super intense yesterday.

Hi, I have had on and off BPPV for years. The most recent one I have had was two months ago, which was also the most severe one I have had. It is been quite a while without any residual symptoms though I still have bad anxiety that it will come back. Most of the time my BPPV attacks are at least a year apart so as of now, I feel like my worrying is for no reason and is affecting my mental health. Does anyone have any anti-anxiety tips or any tips in general to prevent future BPPV attacks? Thanks in advance! Saving this post-  my anxiety about it is awful too. I have trained myself that even if I am asleep I will sit up and turn and lay down like a crazy robot to switch sleeping sides because I know tossing over in my sleep triggers bppv. I do not think I even let myself fall all the way asleep anymore I wish I knew. I have had it 4 or 5 times over the last 15 years or so, the last time was early this year and it was the worst bout since the first time I had it. I am still anxious about it happening again, I avoid any exercise that involves laying on my back like sit ups or Turkish get ups etc. because that is when the last bout started - during yoga. It sucks, I do not remember being paranoid about it this long the other times. I do not know if it is paranoia if it actually comes back.  I went 4 years without getting it and it took about that long to start being able to go to bed without being afraid of waking up with it.  Then I had it three times in 4 months.  Would rather at least know to be careful about planning my day now.  It is miserable. I have bad anxiety anyways, and it skyrockets when I am dizzy because I am afraid I am going to spiral back into bppv. My boyfriend always tells me \u201cyou will be okay. You will get through this the first time and you will get through it again. It is sucks. But you can overcome it again\u201d he also always tells me \u201cyou will be okay. It may take awhile, but you will be okay even if you do not feel like it now\u201d and I always tell myself that. And knowing that I will be okay helps a lot The fear and anxiety is real and SO hard to get rid of! I wish there was an easy way to ease the anxiety. I mostly fear it EVERY night yet (4th BPPV episode in the past 3 years - and I am 7 months past a 2 month long bout.....still working on getting rid of residual dizziness). My vestibular (dizzy) therapist told me that you cannot spend your life fearing it. It is like cancer - you do not spend every day worrying if you are going to get it. If it happens, you have no control over it.  And worrying will not make it NOT happen. Yes, this is easy to say. Hard to follow.\n\nI never knew much about BPPV for my first 3 episodes.  The last one was horrible and that is when I saw specialists and found a vestibular therapist to help treat me (for 2 months, over 20 Epley maneuvers done to clear it). Another thing she said to reassure me - was that THIS time, I learned SO much and now I know how to fix it RIGHT away.  I have a direct link to her work and can get in right away if need be. So that is comforting.  And yet, I go over and over in my head, 'So, if it strikes tonight and I am laying this way, then I should automatically go into Epley and try to fix it by turning over this way, or that way.....'\n\nAs days go by - I tend to not focus on it as much. But then I think, 'OH MY GOSH - it is been almost a year since my last episode, it is SURE to hit again soon!'  Ugh. It just sucks that we do not know what causes an attack. No way to prevent it. So we all just sit.....waiting for it to strike again. As someone who suffers with anxiety and panic... I do not think there is an easy answer. I find I just have to push my self and try to accept this is life. ... for me I have had 4 BPPV episodes over 6ish years. The first on reflection I was mis diagnosed as being symptoms from anxiety :/ The second was 3 years ago which lasted 24 hours with no treatment but left me with bad residual balance issues for a few years. The third was 1 month ago that lasted 24 hours with no treatment and left me better then I had been in years :/ and this time which has brought me to this sub... started a week ago and continues to ruin my sleep. :( I have seen a PT and they diagnosed the horizontal canal. We did the BBQ roll (not fun) and it is probably made the vertigo go from severe to mild. ... how have I coped trying to sleep? Cuddling a plush toy as I hop into bed to enjoy the spinning with while the GF looks at me thinking I have lost my mind. I wish I had the answer love. I had my first and only episode one year ago. It took me forever to get normal again. To this day I have completely changed my sleeping habits and have slept on my back ever since. Honestly it was for the best bc I have neck problems but I completely stopped sleeping on my sides because of the fear. I even sleep just a little bit elevated too. \n\nHonestly, I do not know if that fear will ever go away but I just keep going and try not to think about it. If it happens, it happens and I will get through it again. xx Hiya! Remember me?! It is shanghai_kitty! I lost my login and had to make a new account. I saw your username and I am glad you are still symptom free!! Same here, last time was a TMJ episode luckily but I am glad you are still well! xx I was so worried about you! You disappeared! Happy to hear you are doing well! And are back! I have BPPV and it has changed my sleeping behaviour for life eg. my pillow cannot be too flat, my head and body has to almost be straight and in-line with the bed etc.. it is not the same for everyone so I cannot say but my advice would be to try and understand how BPPV is triggered for you and then manage your sleeping position, diet (regulating salt), and correct manoeuvres to balance the crystals out or make them fall back into place.", "Do I have to see Physiotherapist or ENT? I suffer from general anxiety and been doing okay but all of sudden yesterday woke up dizzy out of nowhere like the whole room was spinning fast. Freaked out, settled and went about my day. Last night went to sleep and every time I turned to one side my head starts spinning for 20 seconds and then it stops. When I get up from bed I start swaying from side to side losing my balance\nis this regular anxiety dizziness or vertigo? I have lightheadedness since my GAD started 4 months ago and it doesnt bother me, but this is a new one I have never felt before and it is intense.\n\nI cannot afford doctors right now but ill try. Can I go an urgent care and they would be able to tell me or do I have to go to an ENT or physical therapist? If it is only turning to one side it is quite possible it is BPPV. You can try doing the Epley maneuver on your own and see if that helps, that would be the most common fix. An ENT or dizzy balance center would be your best bet for a doctor, urgent care would be hit and miss unless you can call and specify asking for a doctor who has experience with Bppv. I turn to both sides when laying down and head starts spinning :(\n\nI am tempted to do kt on my own but scared I will make it worse You get dizzy turning to either side? What about when looking straight up or down? I have never had it affect both sides, maybe it is not BPPV after all. Another way to test is if there is someone who can watch your eyes as you get into a position that makes you dizzy, letting them know when you feel it starting. BPPV causes your eyes to vibrate. \nOtherwise you can try to record your eyes if no one is around to observe. \n\n\nEdit to say I do not think you can make BPPV worse by doing a maneuver, but you also need to be doing the correct maneuver for which canal and side is affected, otherwise it can make you feel really shitty without any relief. Unfortunately that is why getting to a doctor is the best thing you can do, then you get a proper diagnosis. Yup when looking up I do get dizzy someties too or when bending down.\n\nUgh vestibular migraines maybe? I do not know anything about that, sorry. You can try the eye check, maybe someone else will answer with some other ideas. Good luck! It is possible to have BPPV turning to both sides. Generally, if you go to the doctor, they will first do Dix-Hallpike to diagnose which ear it is in. You can find videos of it on YouTube.\nThen they will do the Epley for the side that the BPPV is on.\nNote that it is also possible to have anterior or posterior canal BPPV which triggers looking up or down. In that case, they may use the Epley, or a different maneuver. \n\nAs to whether you should go to a PT or an ENT, it comes down to experience - whichever one locally has experience dealing with BPPV is the best choice. Maybe you can call the office and ask if they deal with BPPV commonly.\n\nHope you can get some relief soon! 4 weeks ago - I woke up the same, both sides and looking up and down... was horrible. Went to the PT, diagnosed it was the horizontal canal but could not determine which ear. We ended up treating the side that was the worse vertigo with the BBQ roll manoeuvre. 4 weeks later I am 90% back to normal. \n\nMost of the stuff you read on the internet says it effects one side but if it is both then it is both ears. ... after having this on and off for years ... I think it is more likely that if it is posterior canal it is going to only affect one side and you can google what fixes that... but if it is all orientations and it really kicks off by lying flat rolling ether side then it is horizontal. \n\nJust my 2cents. Would highly recommend seeing a specialist tho and not going to a Gp or a random ENT that does not specialise in balance disorders. How many times they had you doing the manuvers So... the initial visit, we did the dix-hallpike test where you lay down over the edge of a bench to trigger the vertigo. For me we had to repeat the test it a few times as the results were very inconsistent.\n\nWe then did the Epley move on my left side which gave me no relief. We then did the bbq roll for the left ear as a just in case for the horizontal canal which did not appear to help but at that point the nystagmus was fatiguing which makes it hard to continue doing the moves to figure out where the misplaced crystal(s) are. \n\nWe left it a few days, went back did the dix-hallpike again, same inconsistent results, however my PT decided we would just do the BBQ roll for the left as both sides when I would roll left or right would trigger vertigo but the left was more intense.\n\nWe only did the roll once as she did not want to stir everything up and suggest I wait another week before I see her again. She did say, when I go to bed to lay down on my left side for 30 seconds, roll to the middle for 30 seconds and then sleep on my right. - each step / turn would bring in vertigo and obviously not pleasant but you have to push through it knowing it will stop. \n\nAfter a week, my vertigo symptoms had gone from a 10/10 to a 4/10. I went from what I can only explain as a spin that would be 100rpms to 10rpms when rolling left or right in bed with what felt as very mild eye beating if any at all. \n\nOver the next week I would slowly lay down on my back, the room would slowly spin but instead of that 10/10 intensity, there was no eye movement and it would last maybe 3-4 seconds. \n\nI called the PT, told her how I seem to be improving and she suggested we wait another week and here I am... the vertigo is gone however I still feel light headed, I have a sensation of being pulled to the left when I walk, head feels heavy... but at least the spinning and horrible eye movement is gone. \n\nI have had BPPV before, I think 3 or 4 times over 6+ years. Each time apart from this one resolved it self by its own within 24-48 hours where I did nothing. This time I decided to do something and maybe the moves aggregated everything which caused the vertigo to stay a lot longer. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nIn all honesty, everyone is different and hence the advice to seek a professional. My PT has been helping people with balance disorders for 20+ years.\n\nEdit - I did not do any extra moves at home, only what the PT told me to do when I went to bed. \n\nHope my story helps \ud83d\udc4d I wonder If I should stop then like you said so it resolves on its own.\n\nLAst night I slept on my right side and no vertigo, did not wake up with vertigo either. Most f the day have had lightheadedeness and off balance a little bit as you said.\n\nTomorrow I have a PT appointment but I wonder if I should do it or will make it worse :( I suspect that you can overdo it and possibly stir everything up more with too many exercises at home. But then again, I always felt better seeing the PT so if the crystal moves to another canal, they could help me with what to do next instead of me guessing and stressing at home aimlessly tumbling about to try and resolve the problem. \n\nI also understand the feeling of not wanting to go unless it makes it worse especially if you feel it is getting better... but I found in my sessions that it never made it worse, she just forced me to endure the vertigo which I hated and maybe I needed that second session to get everything back and then it was just residual side effects. \n\nMy advice would be if you still have vertigo with eye beating, go to the PT, if the vertigo and eye movement is mild or practically non-existent maybe wait it out a week. So today I woke up with intense dizzyiness and felt like I was going to pass out or faint when I got up. I had to lay down and drink water until it passed\n\nI wonder if that happened to you\n\nSo confused, do not know if I should go to the physical therapist, ENT or Urgent Care ugh I never woke up with dizzyness per say, I would wake up by rolling in my sleep and the head movement of left or right would trigger the room with violent vertigo. That initial spin, would be enough to wake me up, cause panic and I would roll back to make it stop. \n\nI would feel nauseas, the room felt like I was on a boat rocking left and right as my brain (I am assuming) was trying to figure out how to cope with the dud signals. \n\nI never felt like I was going to pass out from the BPPV, it just caused panic and fear when the vertigo and eye beating would kick off uncontrollably by rolling over. \n\nI have however felt your other symptoms but I am not sure if it is BPPV related?? Last night, out to dinner, noisy restaurant and my left ear (the side we treated) started to feel full, both ears started to ring and my body was making it hard to walk, balance and I thought I was going to pass out... \n\nWhatever we all have that brings us to this sub, it is genuinely unfair. I have not drunk a drop of booze for 6 years, cut all the salt out, no coffee, etc... cannot win :(\n\nIf I was you, do what makes you feel mentally better about the situation. 6 years ago when this all started, I wanted to go to the ENT as they are the \u201cspecalist\u201d and should know what is going on... in my case after seeing 3, they did not BUT they did organise CT and MRI so we could rule out the \u201cworst\u201d stuff like MS, Cancer, etc. Secondly, I went to a GP that specialised in discovery work and it was him that made me do so many test that ultimately sent me to the PT to get my spine, neck, jaw, etc looked at along with another PT to work on my balance. \n\nTotally understand the worry and the anxiousness of not knowing what to do. Unfortunately I do not think the doctors quite know what to do ether unless there is something physical that they can see which they can cure by cutting it out OR giving you a pill. Dizzy and vertigo mean two different things. \n\nDizzy is where you feel off balance - like you have had too many drinks \ud83c\udf7a \n\nVertigo is when the whole room spins like a washing machine on spin cycle. - this can happen slow or fast. \n\nI would get vertigo looking up, down when standing or while laying flat and rolling left or right. \n\nI did not get vertigo if I was standing, looking left or right or leaning my head left or right. \n\nWhen the vertigo happens, it will cause your eyes to beat and you will feel that along with the spinning and then after (worse case I have felt) 30 seconds it will stop until you move your head again. \n\nMake sure you understand the differences and explain everything in great detail when seeing specialists. Thank you so much for all the detailed responses. I am going Monday to therapist to see if it is BPPV.\n\nAny tips for sleeping? that is when its the worst, especially upon waking up Before I could see anyone, I slept on my back, slightly propped up and with pillows on the side of me to stop me from rolling. \n\nAfter having my first treatment, I was then told to lay down on my left side (the side we treated) and to wait 30 seconds while the vertigo stops, roll to the middle and wait, then roll to the right and sleep on that side. \n\nIn all honesty, I do not think the rolling before bed did much.\n\nKeep us posted on how the visit goes and I hope you find some relief over the weekend. Thank you, I did try to sleep on my back but  it is hard because I have never slept like that before.\n\nOne last question sorry, did you take any meds for the nausea? Yes and No. \n\nYou cannot be on meds when you see the PT as the medication will numb the signals of your vestibular system which means the nystagmus (eye beating) that the PT needs to see to help determine which manoeuvre may not be present. ...\n\nI did however after my treatment have a Stemetil which made me drowsy and took the edge off so to speak. \n\nBTW - I would recommend going to the PT with someone so they can drive and provide support. I definitely could not drive after my visits but then again, others report instant success. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I live three blocks from the place so I can walk when I feel better haha\n\nThanks for everything! So just an update since you were so kind to respond before. \n\nI went today to the PT and was scared before hand but she was nice did balance tests which I did not fine except one which was hard. Then we did the Epley maneuvers twice for each side and I did not get any spinning, dizzyness, nausea or lightheadness when doing it except briefly when going to the final sitting position i got slightly lightheaded. \n\nRight now I'n feeling \"normalish\" so I am relieved. Hope it stays thsi way Thankyou for the reply. I wondered this morning (I am in Australia) how you went. Did the PT give you any advice on how to sleep tonight? Some suggest sleeping propped up, others suggest no bending down or no sudden head movements to make sure everything settles properly. I have been sleeping laying back the last three nights but It is hard for me cant sleep like that so I asked if I can sleep like I did before and she said yes. I will sleep normal like before and see how that goes. and keep active because this is scary and can make things more difficult with stress and anxiety Checking in - how is everything going? No more BPPV? I have a follow up on Monday but the last few days just been feeling off balance and woozy at times when walking. Just doing some daily exercises and hopefully it gets better What about you The violent vertigo has stopped but just like you, woozy, off balance with on and off nausea... just trying to push through, but wow wee it is tough! Did they give you any exercises to donat home Yeah - each visit they get progressively harder. You can google the exercises - I believe they are called \u201cgaze stabilisation exercises\u201d. I have to do them 3 times a day, each day. ... takes about 15 min per session.", "Tai Chi for vertigo? Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, but I read that Tai Chi can be good if you have a balance disorder. Does anyone know of any Tai Chi programs that are tailored to vestibular issues?", "Are these the standard exercises for residual dizziness and off balance feeling?  I was prescribed many of these exercises by my vestibular therapist. I did them last bight except the last one. Could not do that one standing one leg eith eyes closed. But the idea is to challenge the dizziness right?\n\nLike I want to go jogging but if feeling dizzy should keep going? Or the idea is to take it slow Yes... You need to challenge the dizziness to retrain your system. But in the same breath.... Do not overdo it. If you feel off balance &amp; feel running would not be safe, hold off for a while. Jesus Christ is this real?\n\nI would I tried any of those during a dizzy spell I would fall over, puke, or lose hearing from the amount of balance that my brain would be trying to do. Like turning my head side to side could legit turn me blind I feel like. \n\nI some these are a horrible idea and others rather tame and helpful though. I am going to do them once a day. Did you do them once a day?\n\nYeah provably will just walk for now.. I do my exercises 2-3 times a day. 3 times ugh. Are they similar to the ones in video? I was told to do them 3 times a day. Again... If it feels like it is too much.... Back off. Maybe start with twice a day. Similar...\nI do not do the eye movement while seated or standing. Here are some I do. - can be done in any order. \n\n1) head movement up and down then side to side while standing at an arms length away from a point of reference (I sticky taped a X to a wall) that you keep in focus and try to keep still through the movement and then move 2-3 meters away to repeat. - when I first started doing this, I found the X would move all over the place, now I can keep it locked pretty much in the one spot. \n\n2) standing one foot in front of the other, I scan the room side to side and up and down in the corner of a room, swap feet and repeat. - I find that as I move my head my body will pull me in the opposite direction. The idea of this one is to retain how you handle eye and head movement with balance.  \n\n3) I do the ball toss in the video but it is thrown from waist height and above my head to the other hand with one foot in front of the other, I then repeat with my feet swapped. - I find my body tries to pull me like the exercise above with the added difficulty of catching a ball and trying not to fall over. \n\n4) I walk around for 2 minutes throwing the ball side to side like I did above forcing me to move my body, head, arms. - l try to walk in a straight line when I do this otherwise I can be somewhat wonky. \n\n5) I do thumb over thumb with my arms in front of my face and move my whole body left and right to simulate focusing on an object with the background moving. - simulates busy environments like driving, shopping, etc\n\n6) feet together, I lean / sway forward slowly, trying to go as far as I can until I am about to fall and then lean back. I then repeat this with leaning/ swaying back. - I find this one rather hard. \n\nAll the above I do 20 times for each position and it can take 15-20 minutes to get through then all. \n\nBTW when I first started doing exercises I over did them and they made me rather sick which led to me kind of gave up on them. \n\nI also became very frustrated and upset that I could not do what appeared as the simplest of simple tasks but over time I have improved. \n\nMy advice is to not over do it, build up to all these exercises you see on the internet or better yet, see a PT that specialises in this stuff :)\n\nI am by far from cured, but life has become a lot easier ie driving the car, going to the shops, using the computer, etc etc... Thank you. Will keep this in mind. Anxiety makes it worst \ud83d\ude11 I totally agree. Anxiety feeds this ugly monster! Hang in there.... And know that it WILL get better! So the idea behind this is not retraining the Vistaubler system but retraining your body to use its other systems for balance. That is what these excersis do. They are suppose to make you feel a bit dizzy at first but the idea is the longer and my consistent you do them the more you will not be as dizzy. However it is always better to be assessed by a physical therapist to see what type of stuff would work best for you Thank you for this. My PT gave me 5 to do so we will see how it goes. \n\nThe standing one foot in front of the other while open eyes is fine but I tried with eyes closed, too and nope, cannot. So instead I am trying with both feet together and that way I can do it.\n\nNo gaze stabilization either, the exercises are five total and I just did them no problem. Wonder if I should add just one gaze stabilization Yes! I agree with all that /u/slash5k1 said! And those are some of the exercises I did as well.  My therapist re-evaluated weekly and added to the degree of difficulty and added new things to challenge me. I wanted to be an over achiever as well - to help myself get back to normal quicker. But she cautioned against that - and as you said, too much, too fast, makes things worse. It is not a quick fix. It takes time - and there is not a whole lot you can do to make it go away any faster. I often noticed subtle changes weekly - not daily. Gaze stabilization was a huge thing for me as well. I have always done them when most of the effects of the BPPV incident have begun to dissipate (just residual 'off' feeling remains).  I find them quite helpful and typically do them 2-3 times per day. Did you get waves of dizziness when sleeping or when waking up? Well.... It is hard to explain. When I shut my eyes I would feel a wave of the dizziness. Or if I would wake up in the middle of the night I might feel it.  It is not the intense vertigo of when I had active BPPV. But just a feeling like I am in a boat.  Usually by morning I am feeling pretty good. Like my body has adjusted to laying down.  Also, if I get up in the middle of the night, I am typically fine. Sounds like me. When i close my eyes i get a little dizzy hut then sleep fine. In the middle of the night no problem but when waking up the last few days wake up woozy dizzy.\n\nI cant sleep flat, i sleep on my stomach so I wonder if that is  affecting it or the anxiety makes everything worse:( It has taken me almost a year to be able to sleep/lie flat again! And I have just recently been comfortable turning and laying on the bad/effected side. And yes - for SURE the anxiety is not helping. I still have enough residual dizziness that I think about BPPV a few times each day. I try to keep busy so that I do not think about it, because that darn anxiety creeps up, and before you know it....it makes things worse.", "Alcohol and bppv Does alcohol or other substances (drugs, coffee, ciggarettes) affect your bppv?\n\nAlcohol makes my bppv way worse, probably cuz of the nausea and dizzy Dizziness* Alcohol affects mine so bad. I cannot lay down to rest/sleep when I am drunk or I will feel like vertigo death has taken over for so so long. It is not even like a regular hangover. I pretty much quit drinking. I gave up drinking after my first episode of BPPV. Have not had a drink in 7 years!", "Caffeine &amp; dizziness I assume coffee does not help with the dizziness and nausea associated with BPPV? A few days after having the Epley performed by a doctor and then doing it myself the next day, I was feeling probably the best I had in a week and a half. I had not had coffee in nearly two weeks and I was feeling well enough (not great, but better) that I wanted some. I had one cup, that I drank probably over two hours and I ended up feeling dizzy, which in turn, kicked off minor nausea. \nWas this to be expected? I have been drinking black tea instead and I have felt fine. But was it the coffee that set it off?", "What can I take to make the spins less intense during a maneuver?  I get a panic attack once the spins are provoked.  Also get really nauseous.  If I take meclizine and Ativan together, should that help the spins not be as intense?  Or will it hinder the maneuver? It might hinder treatment,  but I get so anxious I take a xanax anyway before I get professional treatment  Does it help you get through it? Yes", "What medication do you take for your vertigo? Anyone took Cinnaron? What is the best medicine with least side effect haha Meclizine.  I do not notice any side effects. My wife took meclazine and she felt worse on it then off it. All our Neurologist did was continue to up the dose instead of try anything else. She felt extremely light headed on that. Her Primary Care gave her Lexapro but it is only been two weeks so it is too soon to tell.\n\nEdit: a period. Lexapro. And BPPV for 4 years now. What I have seen help her most is Marijuana which is medically available here but she had to discontinue that because she is seeking disability payments and that federal program does not allow marijuana use and they may test her later on while we go through the application. Meclizine. It makes me really tired, even the daytime version. I was also told not to take it before an appointment because it can mask the vertigo making it hard to treat correctly. I was initially prescribed Meclizine (anti-vert) and Zofran (nausea med). The Meclizine may help with the nausea and/or dizziness, but it will not 'fix' the BPPV.  But truly, it never did much for me. It was maybe a crutch, to help me sleep.  Once I got in with a specialist, she told me to not take it before therapy, and to try to not take it at all (especially before therapy) because it will mask the vertigo and make it hard to treat. (I see u/passesopenwindows states the same thing).  The Zofran - (not a vertigo med), there were times I wanted to puke 24/7, so I took that!  Also - the Meclizine is also available over the counter now as Dramamine N (not the original Dramamine). Diazepam when I feel an attack coming on.", "Had my worst vertigo experience on tuesday Have been diagnosed with bppv now 3 times. First time was bad, but got better in the end and went about my day no problem. Second time I was at work and was very mild. Didnt even need the meclazine prescribed. ..now this is where it gets fun. This wednesday was a normal day for the most part. Had some slight dizziness the week before but went away usually within 5-10 seconds. No problem. I got home from work and instantly felt like I just was on a nonstop rollercoaster. Went to the bathroom and threw up my lunch and kept dry heaving for the next half hour. I was sweating buckets of sweat and my wife said I was paler than snow. No matter which way my head was I felt like was going to die. I finally got the courage to get into my wife's vehicle and she drove me to the ER.\n\nWhen I finally got there they had to put me in a wheelchair to go anywhere and I was breathing heavy from panicking and the intense nausea and dizziness. I waited what felt like hours to realize I only waited 10 minutes due to how bad the nurse said I looked to them. They wheeled me into a room and helped me make the adventure to the wheelchair onto the bed.\nHooked me up to an IV with valium, fluids to rehydrate me due to all the vomiting and sweating (which was still happening) and diagnosed me with bppv. I refused the epley maneuver at the time due to how bad and intense everything was and was terrified of going back in that state once I started improving a small bit. They had me take some meclazine, prednisone,and anti nausea then told me to see an audiologist. \n\nIt is now sunday and I am only now able to get out of bed and not feel like the world is going to kill me, but I am still dizzy as hell after a few minutes. When I lay down with my head elevated a bit I generally feel like myself but still have small bouts of dizziness.  I guess my question is, has anyone had it as debilitating as this?\nAny tips or tricks to help alleviate it? I have done the maneuvers multiple times with ok results, but not great. \nMy town does not seem to get too many bppv cases due to the last two times I was in they called in nurses and students to observe what the symptoms look like. I have had an experience similar to yours. You are not alone. In 2015 I had an episode that started with throwing up once or twice and then going to sleep. About an hour later I woke up, starting hardcore vomiting non-stop and going from alternatingly sweating profusely to getting the chills. I had absolutely hellish nystagmus and I could not stand up or move and all and could not see a damn thing in front of me. I threw up for about an hour or two straight until my girlfriend and I decided we needed to get to the ER. I had two friends literally carry me to the car because I could not stand under my own power. \n\nI literally took a trash can with me and threw up the entire drive there, threw up in the waiting room, and got admitted almost immediately. They hooked me up to all sorts of shit including valium and IV fluids. I kept throwing up while they did tons of tests including an MRI, an EKG, and an epidural to check for meningitis. Nothing was out of the ordinary.\n\nI was admitted and stayed two nights while my vision was still completely fucked with nystagus. A vestibular specialist came and diagnosed it as a vestibular migraine. Had I known more about my issues at the time I would have thought it was more of a viral thing such as Labyrinthitis. \n\nThe craziest thing is that after I left the hospital, I took meclizine and stayed in bed for about a week and then I was 100% back to normal for nearly 5 years. I had an episode a few months but it was NOTHING like what I experienced in 2015. Your story helps. Tha k you for sharing it. This has been one of the worst experiences of my life when it comes to medical. I am 27 m and generally in 100% health.\nI am hoping after this episode that I am done with it for awhile, or at least it never gets this bad again! I had an episode about a month ago that was so terrifying I was genuinely concerned I was having a stroke. I have never been so dizzy in my entire history of having any vertigo. I did not throw up, but, I nearly fell to the ground and the residual vertigo was for weeks. Hang in there. That was pretty much exactly my first BPPV experience - was dead asleep and woken up by feeling like I was being thrown around on a roller coaster, made it to the bathroom and fell over, vomiting for a while before my husband carried me to the car and I went to the hospital because I thought I was having a stroke.  I was there overnight and the next day the PTs did an Epley on me and I remember crying because of the relief.  I believe I had PTSD from that experience because I was terrified of going to sleep for years after that and I re-arranged my life around the assumption that it would happen again at any time.\n\nI have had two more attacks (one six months later and then one four years later - last week actually) but the most recent attack especially was the mildest.  I make sure I sleep with meclizine by my bedside and I find walking - not lying down - helps abate symptoms, but I feel better after this last attack because it was not as bad as the first one, and the second one was only really bad because I tried to Epley myself (do not recommend), so I feel like things are at least manageable, if not predictable. Hey dude, I hear you completely. I am a 26 M. My first episode which I talked about in that post hit me when I was 21. I was in the best shape of my life (college athlete). It made no fucking sense to me. At 26 I got hit with something similar which I am still recovering from. There is a condition called PPPD which I think is what I have developed. Basically when I started to feel dizzy again, the dread and anxiety about going through another episode from 5 years ago permanently scrambled my circuits and now I am dealing with anxiety and depression issues. BPPV does not discriminate lol\nI am 27 f, and I am healthy and athletic. Got an episode last year for the first time that lasted a whole month straight. I wanted to die lol I woke up with it one morning and had to crawl my way to the bathroom.\n\nSucks that they do not really know what causes it. \nMy advice is to get yourself into a balance center or dizzy clinic that diagnoses BPPV with the goggles. That way they know exactly which ear is having issues and which canal. There is different maneuvers that help with certain canals. The Epley is just more common bc that canal is more commonly effected. Then sleep in a recliner or elevated in bed for a week or two. Just to make sure the otolith is settled where it needs to be and will not cause more issues. \n\nGinger tea helped with my nausea that the vertigo caused. I had a prescription for something but honestly it did not help. Also, keep moving. Once it is repositioned you may have residual dizziness for awhile (at least I did). Getting back into working out and running helped that go away.\n\nWish I could tell you how to prevent it, but it does go away and gets better. Hope you feel better soon! xx", "Advice / How do you cope with the feeling while doing the maneuvers (like Epley) to fix it? I believe I have this stupid bppv thing, it actually came back worse after a week of not having it anymore. The day of the recurrence, I tried Epley and had a terrifying vertigo episode, and did not even complete the maneuver. The following day I tried again, and had the same, just as bad an episode, but actually completed the maneuver properly. It did not help, as I still have it. My question is, how do I keep doing it? I mentally cannot force myself to do the maneuver because I know that I will get another episode by doing it. Is there any way to suppress the feeling of vertigo temporarily to do the maneuver? Is there any way for me to I do not know, hold a pressure point or something so its not as bad? I seriously cannot endure it and I do not know what else to do. I would also like to know, last time I did epley, I got it so bad I threw up :( hang in there. If you are able to, do it with a friend or family member. That helps me a lot. They make sure I follow through the maneuver properly and I can grab onto them if I get anxious.\n\nOtherwise holding onto something while you do it kind of helps suppress the panic of the entire world spinning. I had to do the Epley 20 times over the course of two months.  During each Epley, it provoked the violent vertigo TWICE (first upon laying back, and then it would happen again upon sitting up).  I often took Zofran (anti nausea meds) or even Meclizine (it is now OTC Dramamine that you do not need a prescription for).  Initially - if you are being seen by a specialist, they do not want you to take those meds, so they can fully see your nystagmus/symptoms and accurately diagnose. You may even see if a doctor can prescribe something like Ativan to keep you a bit calm and ease your anxiety.\n\nKnow that the feeling will only last for less than 30 seconds.  Typically even less than 20 seconds.  Make sure to stay in that position for at least 30 seconds after the vertigo subsides.  Sometimes moving too fast through the positions can make the procedure fail.\n\nAlso - having someone there to talk to you - to keep your mind off it, is really helpful.  Or even if you can try to talk as you do it.  I would get terrible anxiety every time I knew I needed to do the Epley again (which was weekly, then twice weekly)\n\nMy BEST suggestion is to find a GOOD dizzy/vestibular therapist.  They can do testing and make sure you are treating the correct inner ear canal. They will help guide you and make sure you are doing the maneuver right.\n\nAnother maneuver that you could try is the Half Somersault (Foster maneuver).  It is easy and does not provoke the symptoms as bad.  It is not as well tested or as proven....but has helped MANY.  I did my share of Half Somersaults!\n\nHang in there. It is horrible. But you WILL get through it! I agree with the previous posters. Have someone there with you, or play music or a podcast. I usually play a podcast, my VT office always plays music while they work with me lol. I am currently seeing a dizzy/vestibular therapist and they say the dizziness should stop after 10-30 seconds, no longer than a minute if the maneuver is done correctly. Just hold out. Vestibular therapists will help ensure you are doing the Maneuvers correctly, As well as use your nystagmus to determine what canals are affected/which maneuvers are right for you. so if you decide to go to one you may want to pause on the meds if you decide to get in touch with one.\nStay strong, there is hope! Keep at it and you will see results It is really helpful to see an ENT or dizzy balance center to find out for sure if it is BPPV and to verify which ear canal is involved. I went to urgent care with my last bout, the doctor knew enough to recognize that it was BPPV and performed the Epley and told me to keep doing that at home. I did it twice and it made me feel so horrible it brought on an anxiety attack. I made an appointment at a dizzy balance center and they did further testing and discovered the crystal was in a different canal, the Epley would never have helped. I know it is hard to get into doctors right now but knowing exactly what you are dealing with is the best way to fix it. If you absolutely cannot get to a professional there are videos online that might help you figure out which direction your eyes are moving in, that can help determine which ear canal is involved. Having someone around who can watch your eyes or videoing your eyes while doing the first Epley position is helpful. Take Dramamine It is comforting to read that I am not alone and that no one enjoys the vertigo or the manoeuvres. ... For me, just like everyone else it brings on panic, I tear up, I shake, it is genuine fear... What gets me through it is what others have said. Having a family member present, having a specialist with you that understands what is happening to calm / guide you and knowing that each spin will last a maximum of 30 seconds. \n\nWhen doing it at home, I found closing my eyes helped however with the specialist they want eyes open to see which way your eyes beat. \n\nYou do have the option of doing nothing which I have done in the past as it resolved it self in 24 hours (who knows how??) but this time I am not so lucky. Off to the PT tomorrow for another spin session... hopefully my last \ud83e\udd1e", "Frequent BPPV When Stationary (Not Moving Head) Hey all. I have been dealing with some strange dizziness sensations for about 3 weeks now, and I would like to inquire the forum. I already have an appointment with a specialist, but I am looking for maybe some solace and help with calming my mind. I am wondering if symptoms of BPPV can occur without any head movements, that is, if you can still experience a quick sensation of vertigo while your head remains still. Is that possible? I notice that if I am trying to read or watch a movie, it feels like someone is kind of pushing my head in any one direction, and the sensation can be very quick and intense, but not enough to call me to fall over or even close to it. It is a very strange sensation that I have had before. Almost like a hypnic jerk before falling asleep that jolts your head. It is worse when I am feeling stressed or tired. If this is not BPPV, could it be PPPD? Wondering if anyone else has this kind of symptom. Thank you to the group. Typically BPPV is positional.  And when you  head is moved into a certain position, it causes a severe episode of vertigo that lasts about 30 seconds, with Nystagmus (eye twitching).  My vertigo took quite a while to correct, and it triggered other dizziness symptoms and gaze instability. I DID experience what you are mentioning - but it was not BPPV.  It was mostly attributed to the gaze instability and my system being out of whack and trying to correct.  And it was more of a mild dizziness, floating, woozy type of feeling.  I am not familiar with PPPD - but there are a few on the forum that are. And, with these 'non BPPV' symptoms I had - it for SURE was worse if I was tired or stressed.  Anxiety made it worse as well. I hope you get some answers with your appointment.  Please check back in and let us know what you find out with the specialist! And in the meanwhile, hopefully others will chime in regarding the PPPD. I got your PM, it is most likely Mal De debarquement because of the car motion relieving it. No other disorder or \"disease\" is relieved and basically cured like MDDS is via car travel (that I know of...). I am guessing this is not from a boat trip? Anxiety plays a massive role in this disorder too That is what I was thinking too, that no other vestibular disorder has that peculiar quirk of going away while driving. I have had it before but it seemed to come out of nowhere after only a 30min car ride. This time around, I started driving for excessive amounts of time, delivering, trying to make money through the pandemic. I noticed symptoms after driving 5+ hours daily for a week. I also already have bad inner ear pathology. I have tinnitus and fluctuating hearing loss and aural fullness. Never got a Menieres diagnosis because I have thankfully never had a long bout of the spinning vertigo. How often and intense are the symptoms? Just letting you know that with time MDDS goes away with almost everyone", "Persistent BPPV? Hi guys,\n\nI had my first BPPV episode on the 15th  August, was pretty violent spinning and I felt rough for 10 days until I saw a PT. I have had 4 PT sessions and done the Epley manuever each time. I am still having a little bit of vertigo on the left side and a tiny bit of nystagmus. My question is is this normal? Or is it not gone yet?\n\nAny recommendations to finally beat thing thing?\n\nI did have residual dizziness for a while but feeling pretty normal most of the day except from some neck and traps tension. Sounds like you still have some small crystals or you would not have the vertigo and nystagmus when you do the dix hallpike.  I often do the epley 2 times a day after an episode until I do not have that feeling anymore.  Sometimes it takes more than a handful of epleys. I thought this was probably the case. I might try to go the Epley at home.\n\nThanks for your reply! I am in your same boat. My PT is now doing semont maneuver on me as well as epley. Semont is a little more \u201charsh\u201d because you are essentially throwing yourself to one side and another at a greater speed in hopes that the velocity helps in moving the crystals out. My PT said that if I still have nystagmus/vertigo on left dix hallpike next week, we will use a vibration tool. \n\nMaybe ask your PT about these? Do the epley at home and also try the foster half somersault. Cannot hurt you. Have you tried the half somersault manuever? I will ask about the vibration tool then. It is so weird as now I feel pretty normal in the daytime, but when I lie down to go to sleep, I get a little dizzy but if I turn to my left, the spinning starts again, definitely not as bad only lasting like 5-10 seconds but I would love to get rid of it completely. Will you let me know if the vibration tool helps xx", "Hormonal/Viral/Herpes Cause for BPPV? I have been experiencing BPPV for about 7 years now with no luck in treatment -- seen a ENT and Physical Therapist and cannot seem to treat with Epley or VNG testing.\n\nI am thinking it may be a viral or hormonal issue -- has anyone experienced this?\n\nI have always suspected this because: \n- Most of my episodes happen around my period.\n- I used to get cold sores before my period and when I first started getting BPPV I was felt scratching behind my eye. Perhaps the herpes was spreading to both locations?\n- I was recently pregnant (unfortunately just miscarried) and had much more frequent episodes. Perhaps the increase in hormones was a factor?\n\nAppreciate your help! I am so glad I found this sub -- it is been the best thing to help me feel like I am not alone :)", "My BPPV/PPPD Storytime (PLEASE READ) It all started back in Summer 2018, when I started having some ear clicking sounds. These sounds where present from time to time and for a few minutes/hours I guess. I really did not give a lot of attention to them, as they did not really cause me any other problems besides the occasional clicking. Moving on to 2019-2020, I think from time to time I had some vertigo/dizziness episodes, not really like the room was spinning, but felt pretty dizzy and lightheaded, but not at a point that I could not do anything. As long as I can remember, these dizziness episodes mostly occurred when I was in the car or bus. In September 2020, I woke up one morning and I was feeling a little lightheaded/dizzy (this feeling was and is focused on my left temple). This lightheaded feeling on left temple kept being there, until today (and it got a bit worse within time, then I got better, then worse, then better, then worse, like it is not really that stable). Today, I have 24/7 pressure-lightheadedness-dizziness coming from my left temple. Another thing is that, when I hold my chin with my hand and turn my head left, I feel some extreme crunching sounds inside my ear and temple, like crystals, and this happens everytime I do this. Sometimes, when I change position suddenly, I might be feeling the room spin as well, so I try to do some epley maneuvers (the one being in the bed with your head 45o right, then 45o left and then 45o left and looking down) but idk they really help. My main question is if anyone else in this community might have same or similar symptoms (mostly the 24/7 temples dizziness-pressure) and if you do, did you find any specific treatment? Hi! I first had a severe episode of BPPV in May 2020 whilst waking up from turning over in bed. At first I was not sure what it was and felt normal for a few months after. Then in September I started feeling awful with similar symptoms to the ones you mention. In December I was finally able to see a specialist and we did a number of epleys and I have since been doing the Brandt-daroff exercises everyday and now feel 80% myself with only little tension/ pressure in my head. But, I know it is till slightly active so will see a specialist again after I have finished my degree next week (probably to do the epleys). I am responding as I have just started getting very regular ear clicking, almost always when I am walking, and sometimes really bad crunching when I eat, also in the left ear (the same as the cause of the BPPV). I make sure to sleep with three pillows every night with minimal turning. Maybe try the BD exercises for the non clicking related symptoms and definitely see a specialist. I am hoping they will be able to help with understanding the cause of the ear clicking and what needs to be done about it!", "Still dizzy In August 2017 I had a root canal done and I was fine until a couple days after. I typically walked the boardwalk and I remember sitting down and got really dizzy. But never in my sleep. It depends on my head positioning when I was sitting up. I went to PT and they said I did not have vertigo. It made me not want to go out and be social. About a year ago I had a dizzy dream and when I sat up and I was very dizzy. It was so bad that it was forcing me to lay back down. I went to my first PT session and it was determined I had bppv. We did the epley maneuver a few times and it was gone. The following year I have gone to PT for vertigo, my last session was March 2020 and  I have noticed I cannot sleep on my left or right sides as I get super dizzy. I still do the epley maneuver and there is no dizzyness, why is this still reoccurring? It can be reoccurring unfortunately. I had bppv a month ago so I get the agony of it. Residual dizziness is a common thing after BPPV is corrected.  I had active BPPV for over 2 months and saw a dizzy/vestibular therapist weekly that performed the Epley. She also often retested all 6 inner ear canals to make sure the loose crystals did not move elsewhere, and to make sure our treatment was on course. I had a stubborn case and it took over 20 Epley to clear the crystal.  It took me months before I could comfortably lay on the 'bad/effected' side.  The residual dizziness was horrible for me.  I had my therapist repeatedly retest me and it confirmed that the vertigo was gone, but I still had lingering dizziness (different than the vertigo caused during active BPPV - that 20ish seconds of intense vertigo with your eyes twitching).  There are exercises that can be done to help the lingering residual dizziness. \n\nI am guessing that you are experiencing the residual dizziness, since you are not getting that violent 20ish seconds of vertigo that happens while doing the Dix Hallpike (first step of the Epley) or during the Epley.\n\nSadly, BPPV can return.  I have had 4 episodes in the past 3 years.  It is been almost a year since my last stubborn episode and I still have some slight residual dizziness.  And I continue to do exercises to correct it.  I am a VERY active person....so you would think my body would have adapted by now....But it is a slow process. No one knows why it happens or how to prevent it. \n\nMy PT has been in the game doing this for 15+ years and she is told me that it occurs randomly for everyone. Some people are lucky to get it once and she will never see them again. Others like me may get it, recover, then 6 weeks later get it again but then it could be years until it magically appears again (at east I hope so\ud83e\udd1e)\n\nMy story is very similar to u/Colmanson1 where I have lingering residual dizziness (I am starting to call them phantom dizzy spells as I can be laying in bed perfectly still and the room is visually moving ever so slightly - I hate it)\n\nThe only thing that I believe we can all agree on with BPPV is that once you have it, it is something you are more susceptible to having again ... \ud83d\ude15 /u/slash5k1 I am actually thankful for you and your stories - since our BPPV journey is so very similar. It is nice to hear you have had the same stuff going on.  I mean - I am sad you are dealing with it - but nice to know I am not alone!  And look - we both are still alive and kicking and moving on!!!!  I am two days away from the onset of my last BPPV episode one year ago.  Residual dizziness still kicks in every so often.  But finally, the anxiety is starting to fade away. But dang, it is been a long tough journey this time.  And I am still learning so much about this horrible BPPV.  (I am sure I will be reaching out for support when it hits again and my world falls apart!) Same sentiment over here \ud83d\ude0c\n\nYou will have to make a celebration post in 2 days time! \ud83c\udf89 The anxiety was absolutely horrible! I could not be as socially active like I was. I am slowly getting back there but every once in a while it is like nope too much. I am glad its only residual dizziness as I do not think I could handle that one time last year again. Thanks for responding! \u2764 Its strange how it just occurs like that or from what. I hate it when you are just laying in bed and you get a little dizzy. Its scary. I also hate it how you could be sitting and a sway of dizziness for a split second happens. I just had a phantom dizzy spell for a couple seconds and I have not had that feeling in months. I do feel like sometimes it triggers when I have not drank enough water. Thanks for responding to this! \u2764", "Recurrence? Hello everyone,\n\nI am feeling very discouraged today. :(\n\nFour years ago I had some head trauma that brought on BPPV for me. I tried the Epley maneuver on the second day, but it did not work. A few months later, I learned to coexist with my vertigo as it became more manageable, but in the end I gave the Epley another shot and it was instant relief. I was so happy!\n\nNow, fast forward to last night... I have had a horrendous two weeks -- cancer scare, waiting for results, a very important exam. I have been stressed out of my mind. And then last night as I rolled around in bed, vertigo got triggered and it woke me up. I have been spiralling ever since, like in the middle of constant panic attack. I had been kind of afraid of it recurring, but the fact that it is actually happened now is causing me immense anxiety. \n\nAnd the weirdest thing is... it almost feels different from last time. It does not get triggered as easily -- it happened a couple of times when rolling onto my left side, but not always, and a few times when I sat up from a horizontal position. I can mostly move my head around when standing up, but I have had some lightheadedness all day. I tried the Epley maneuver a few times, and it did not trigger the vertigo at all! \n\nI am at a complete loss now... does this sound like a recurrence?! I am hoping it will eventually go away, but after my last experience persisted for months, I sincerely doubt it. But thank you in advance for any advice you can give me. I think once you have a vertigo spell - it never goes away and can reoccur at anytime \\.   :( I guess you might be right :(\n\nEven looking back before my head trauma, I actually had a really bad vertigo bout at 16... I tend to forget that happened as it was 11 years ago.\n\nBut thanks for your answer, and hang in there! We will get through the bad bits I am sure \ud83d\udcaa BPPV is one of those things that can randomly happen and if you have an episode you are more susceptible to having more episodes in the future. \n\nWhat I have learnt is that anything health related that cannot be explained brings on great anxiety which is not helped by the fact BPPV is positional so people find them selfs trying to trigger it and when the vertigo and eye movement starts it sets in panic as you try to understand what on earth is going on!\n\nEveryone handles BPPV differently and finding a resolution is different for everyone. I have had episodes that lasted 24 hours with no treatment and then other times where I have had months of treatment (my last episode back in sept/oct took forever!)\n\nMy advice if you are sure it is BPPV is to see a PT that specialises in balance disorders and they can help you recover. I see! Yeah, I completely agree. I guess what I was looking for was some hope that it can sometimes resolve on its own. My last episode was very straightforward in terms of Epley done right, problem over! And the fact that the Epley is not working this time (not even triggering much vertigo at all!) is making me worry quite a lot, as I am not sure what to do now.\n\nI know I should go to a professional that could help me, and I will probably do it eventually, but I am just so afraid of it being triggered in public and being very dizzy and nauseous far from home. It sucks. Your not alone in feeling this way. Unfortunately you need to push through that anxious feeling and resolve it ASAP instead of removing your self from life... that will only make your anxiety worse. \n\nKeeps us updated \ud83d\udc4d You are absolutely right. Thank you so much for your kind words. And happy cake day! How are you doing, by the way? Are you feeling better from your last bout?", "Pretty sure this is BPPV, and it sucks. This is part a documentary of my symptoms for myself, part me sharing my experience for others with suspected BPPV, and part a request for suggestions, tips, and advice. \n\nOn Friday, Nov 6th, 2020 I woke up and attempted to sit up in bed. Immediately it felt like the room was spinning and I fell back onto the bed rather forcefully, almost like I was shoved. I took a moment to gather myself and very slowly sat up, and then carefully stood up. After cautiously walking for a few minutes, I felt nearly back to normal. I was fine the rest of the day and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nThat night I woke up at 1am when I heard my son on the baby monitor. The room was spinning and I felt nauseated. Luckily he was still asleep, and I made my way to the toilet by supporting myself on the wall. I was able to walk back to bed normally, and I settled back to sleep and woke at 5:30am because of the room spinning. I tossed and turned and fell back asleep when it subsided. I woke at 7am when I heard my son on the monitor. I sat up, momentarily forgetting to be cautious, and was again \"thrown\" back onto the bed. I felt awful. Room spinning, upset stomach, and I was not sure I was going to be able to make it up the stairs to get my son from his crib. But I again sat up and then stood up as slowly as possible, and again the intense dizziness abated pretty quickly. Throughout the day I did feel fatigued and a bit off balance. At one point that afternoon I had to sit and rest because I was starting to feel dizzy again. And I began to feel worse in the evening. \n\nI realized that I could not lay on my back or my right side without the room spinning. Looking up and standing up too fast caused the dizziness as well. I have continued to feel woozy, mild headache/pressure, and generally tired for days.  I can function, but I have no desire to do anything and am cautious to avoid causing more spinning/dizziness. \n\nOn Tuesday I felt almost back to normal, and hesitantly tried laying on my back and right side when I got into bed that night. No room spinning, so I assumed whatever caused it had resolved. Unfortunately I woke in the middle of the night on my right side and felt as though the bed was tipping and I was about to fall out. I returned to my left side and Wednesday I was back to the same general blah feeling. \n\nToday is Thursday, nearly a week since this began and I am already tired of feeling like this. I have looked up vertigo and  BPPV really fits, but is it usually temporary? I want to try the maneuvers but I am honestly afraid of making it worse. I am a stay at home mom and it has been rough enough with me feeling lousy, but if I was not able to walk without the room spinning or something like that it would be detrimental to caring for my son. \n\nAt this point, do I need to see a doctor? A specialist? Or should I wait it out and only sleep on my left side or even sitting up? I have no idea how difficult it would be to get an appointment, and I do not want to take my son out unless absolutely necessary (especially to a doctor's office) as he is too young to wear a mask. \n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far! i had bppv back in march 2020. once i saw an ent (ear nose and throat) dr my symptoms were resolved. the ent performed a test to figure out which side was affected then did the epley maneuver on me (twice) to resolve my issue. the longer you wait to see an ent the longer it may take to resolve.\n\npeople will say you can do the epley on yourself. i tried and just couldnt do it right. the ent knows how to perform it properly.\n\ngo see an ent dr.\n\np.s im an avid cyclist averaging 100-120 miles a month. the entire month of march i had to avoid riding until my symptoms were resolved. geez, march was horrible.  1) is it vertigo or lightheadedness? With BPPV, the room spins and your eyes will beat (we call this nystagmus). \n2) if it is vertigo and your eyes are beating, stay in that position and after 30 seconds (can be less can be more) the vertigo should slow down and stop beating. \n3) if you do the above, and the room spins, eyes beat, it stops after holding a position then it is BPPV. \n4) do not wait BPPV out, book a PT or ENT that is specialises in balance and have them test you and do the appropriate body manoeuvre to move the crystal in your ear that is moved. \n5) WARNING - to resolve BPPV, the PT / ENT will have to bring on the vertigo which can be somewhat distressing but the manoeuvre(s) will last 2 minutes tops.\n6) it may resolve instantly or you may have to go back a few days later for another round. \n7) you may be left with residual dizzyness, lightheadedness, not rocking feeling which means you will need to do balance exercises at home to help get your balance system back in sync. \n\nBest of luck, you do not have to live with vertigo if it is BPPV, just get it treated!\n\nLet us know how you go. Thanks! I may try it myself, at least until I can see an ent. Glad to hear yours was resolved! Thanks for the info. I am not sure about the eye beating part, but the room definitely spins. It is the weirdest and somewhat scary sensation! I am going to check on ent's in the area. The eye beating / movement is part of the symptom of BPPV and is used to determine which canal the crystal has moved in to. The movement can be subtle (when i have had it, its been rather severe) where the PT or ENT can use special goggles to record the movement of your eyes as they tip you around to also determine which canal.\n\nIf you do not have that eye movement and the vertigo (room spinning) does not stop when you are held in the position that triggers it, its most likely not BPPV but could be a viral infection.\n\nThat is when you need to think about ear pressure, gland inflammation behind your hears, ringing in your ears, all that stuff which you need to explain to your GP / ENT.\n\nWish you a speedy recovery and hope its just a viral infection... Update in case anyone else has a similar experience. I woke up on Friday morning, exactly a week after my first episode, and felt fine. Not only was there no room spinning, I actually felt back to normal. No woozy feeling, no headache, no general blah feeling. Same on Saturday, and again today. I am optimistically assuming that I am over whatever was causing my vertigo, but cannot say for sure if it was BPPV or maybe a mild ear infection without ear pain or fever. If it had persisted, I would have made an appointment with a doctor. I appreciate the advice from this group! Thank you!", "Do any of you get episodes of vertigo multiple times a day? My gf (f18) has lots of issues with vertigo/nausea, she gets about 30 minute spells every morning after waking up and they recure with triggers like eating, alcohol consumption, or physical exertion.  If she wakes up in the middle of the night she will get spells, so it is not just a morning thing, though she does seem to struggle most at night.  She also seems to have pretty poor balance.  \n\nShe says that the nausea is much more intense than the vertigo, but has issues with both, and has lost about 15-20 lbs in the last six months or so due to how this has impacted her appetite.  She is had these issues for at least 4 years.  She is very scared of the doctor but we are talking a lot and preparing to go this fall.  It is difficult because we are students and we both have neglectful family so we are on our own lol.  However I am trying to come up with some possible things it could be to reassure her it is not going to be something horrible and untreatable.  \n\nDo these symptoms sound consistent with BPPV?  Any suggestions for things to try in the meantime before we get to doctor?  I feel like she could have BPPV and maybe also a digestive issue or something because it does not explain why she feels nauseous after eating, which is not a typical trigger.  Or maybe some weird hormone issue?  Some of her symptoms seem to perfectly fit BPPV while others indicate another issue, possibly in addition.  What you all think? Yes. I have recurrent vertigo and when an episode begins it will come and go dependent on the position of my head. I usually get my first sign of an episode when I turn over in the middle of the night and the room spins. My triggers are drinking, being dehydrated or prolonged head movements looking down. Example going rock hunting on the beach can be a challenge since I am looking down for hours. \n\nFor me the solution is called an Epley maneuver. You can find an explanation on YouTube. It helps return dislodged crystals in your ear to their correct place. It may take a few repeats to find some relief. \n\nAs far as the nausea I found relief in peppermint oil pills or sucking on peppermint altoids. I also found relief with the herbal Dramamine which is basically just a ginger supplement. If she likes root beer she could try that too :) Why is she waiting until this Fall to go to the doctor? It sounds like it could be BPPV but it is also wrecking her life. Do not wait, go now, get help so she can live her life normally. She is scared and not ready we are working up to it, and home circumstances are preventing it.  If it were my choice we would go now but she is not ready and it is her life PT here, I specialize in vestibular therapy (dizziness and vertigo)\n\nThere are a lot of possibilities. The easiest thing to rule in or out is BPPV by using an Epley maneuver that someone has already suggested. It is either going to make her dizzy in the first position or not. Either way, it is a fairly safe and easy way to either rule it out (no symptoms throughout the maneuver) or it will reproduce her symptoms ( which is a positive finding, for which you are already doing the treatment). Beyond that the nausea can be managed with peppermint or ginger (again also suggested by someone else) or the motion sickness bracelets that do in-fact work for many people. However, nausea produced by eating seems dietary\u2026 now I am not a dietician or anything but you could try ruling out the most likely causes of food related illness like gluten and dairy. And by taking them out (food more than a month\u2026) she may start to notice changes. It had to work out of her system so simply taking those things out for a few days will not do the trick. And she needs to commit to the process, no sneaking things because that does really add up and ruin results. \n\nOther options are vestibular migraine ( which does not always have a headache and can be triggered by food or motion), M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease (also has flare ups, food triggers, and motion triggers but does come with hearing loss) or PPPV which is a cause of dizziness with motion triggers, more chronic, and no known dietary triggers..\n\nGood luck I saw a PT for my debilitating BPPV and he was amazing!  So knowledge and sympathetic. He performed the Epley twice and sent me home with information to perform it by myself. I am a pharmacist and when I got BPPV (yoga when I had a virus) my first thought was an ENT until a friend told me to see a PT. So happy that I did!", "BPPV or Vestibular Migraine? Help:/ (36 yr old female 149 lbs 5\u20198\u201d healthy)\n\nBack in August- woke up to my world spinning. Lasted less that 15 secs. My PA gave me meclizine and said I had fluid in my ear. On my own went to the ENT the next week- he said no fluid and told me I had veritgo. He did the test but left me on the table for 5 mins- did the Dix Hallpake and said he saw a \u201cslight nystagmus\u201d in right eye- I honestly still do not believe him bc during that test he proceeded to do the epley and left me there while he checked other patients- then on my own went to vestibular specialist- PT- I also had a PT cousin look at me- none of them saw a nystagmus- even w the goggles- nothing. Also both said the ent def did not do the epley correct.\n\nI am now 3.5 months in- and most days feel like garbage. I notice slight improvement every 2-3 weeks with always a set back in between. I only spun that first time in August and then almost once more 5 weeks later which I stopped - did the Brandt-daroff- made it worse but after a few hours was ok. \n\nMy main reason for finally seeking others opinions is I am still having residual symptoms that change everyday- and I cannot find people on here with exactly what I am going through. Since the beginning I have had visual disturbances - blurred vision but that improved about 1.5 months in but I still have visual aura stuff is the best way I can describe it. Head pressure- at the top or side of my head- pressure around my eyes/cheeks. Head aches, ear pressure or ear pain sporadically- ringing only a few times but noticed it today which is rare. Wooziness or lightheaded - comes in waves or stays. The best part (sarcastic voice) is all these symptoms change from day to day or even within the day.\n\nI also have forward head posture I am now working on w the chiropractor- stretches - adjustments. This is something I should have worked on ten years ago. He said I am not unfixable but it is just going to take time. Maybe this could be the cause? Again no idea?\n\nThrough all this- I had an MRI, EKG, echocardiogram, X-ray on neck. (I have a prolapsed cable/heart murmur so was just routine heart check up). Everything came back fine. So I have seen ENT- PT- neurologist- PCP- chiropractor - cardiologist.\n\nSo what the actual F is happening. Do you guys think this is true BPPV or something else. I have only had one migraine in my life when I was 18-19 yrs old and never again. Please help. For the first 2 months I cried everyday. This is not life threatening but it changes your life. I see and feel for every single one of you. The drs just write this off as \u201coh you just have vertigo no big deal.\u201d Mmmm excuse me? I have lost faith in all drs at this point. And I absolutely hate that they do not talk enough about the anxiety that comes with this. It is like nothing I experienced before. The first two weeks I lost ten lbs- had 20-30 min panic attacks, heart palpitations, whole body tremors....this has been by far the worst thing I have ever experienced in my life health wise. So sorry for the long post but this has definitely been a journey for me. Overall my anxiety is better- CBD helps. Xanax in the early stages. I take ibuprofen almost everyday. Even taking Vitamin D and magnesium. The PT told me to take allergy meds\ud83d\ude44 which I also have done on and off for weeks at a time. Just do not know what else to do or where to go at this point. Not a doctor.\n\nThis sounds pretty complicated. The hallmarks of BPPV are vertigo and nystagmus, as you know. I still get mild BPPV without any detectable nystagmus, just a feeling of tension around the eye on the affected side.\n\nBasically if any position change makes it worse, it could be BPPV. If the Brandt Daroff caused you to experience more vertigo, it could be BPPV. BPPV can occur in any of the three canals in your inner ear, and although the Epley is the most commonly performed maneuver it may not always bring relief. I have had anterior canal BPPV (room spins forward and down) and had to YouTube a different maneuver for it.\n\nIt is possible to experience BPPV without nystagmus or full room spinning - just a feeling of \"being on a boat\", or \"floating\" or like you just stepped off an airplane and the ground is not solid.\n\nIt can be really miserable! I am sorry you have been experiencing this. Anxiety is real, crying is normal. Hope you get some relief soon! Thanks, I guess I am looking for people who definitely have/had BPPV - but experienced the residual symptoms for awhile- including the visual auras. It is so defeating that doctors seem like no help. My next steps were to try cranialsacro therapy and go to a natural path. Not sure what else to do at this point. I have had residual symptoms for sure - vague dizziness without room spinning, nausea, and not visual disturbances persay but gaze instability (where eyes do not track properly when head moves). I am also NAD, but your story a very similar to mine. Interestingly, even the timeline is similar.\n\nI am 30M and healthy.\n\nI woke on a day around 3.5 months ago with two vertigo attacks. I was really really scared and thought that I was dying. After that, no vertigo, but I had this floating sensation of being on a boat (all the time) and the head pressure. Went to PD the day after. She said there are some fluids in my left ear, and prescribed Amoxicillin (to get rid of the fluid) and meclizine (to help with vertigo). I took the pills for a week, and since I was not getting any better, I saw an ENT doc. He said that this is BPPV, and I need to wait until it goes away. Also referred me to a PT. The PT did Dix Hallpike on me and since I had no nystagmus, he said nope, this is not BPPV. Then I went to another ENT, but I was getting better at that time. The new ENT said yeah it is probably BPPV, and you are likely still having residual symptoms. He said to wait for a few more weeks. I was in week 5 at that time, and I thought yeah I am getting better. In week 8, BOOM, the sudden crazy dizziness hit me again, and stress level went through the roof. Called the ENT, and he referred me to a VNG test. Took the test in week 12, and it turned out that the nerves (that transmit balance-related signals to the brain) in my right inner ear are weaker than the ones in the left. The ENT said either PT or just your self can help this. There is no specific cure or surgery to this. Just wait until it gets better.\n\nAlso very similar to you, I have no dizziness (and no symptoms) for a few days or even weeks, and then again suddenly it hits me. And when it does, my anxiety kicks in, and I get into the scary closed loop of the increase in anxiety and the increase in dizziness. I just told all this story to tell you that I hear you. I am in the same boat, and I completely understand what you are saying. It is been about 4 months now, and still, this dizziness is not completely gone.\n\nSome things I learned in this journey:\n\n1. once your dizziness kicks in, try to stay calm. I know that this is the hardest thing to do, but it gives you relief and makes the lightheadedness go away sooner. One thing that a specialist that was doing the VNG test told me was to try to think about other things when this horrible dizziness kicks in. For instance, even if you cannot think about anything else, just count numbers backward from 100 to 0, or something like that to divert your brain from dizziness.\n2. I have been taking one Dramamine (dimenhydrinate 50 mg) pill every night before sleep in the past 1.5 months. I think it is been working. I do not take it during the day because it makes me real drowsy one hour after taking it, so I do not want to feel sleepy throughout the day. 4 nights ago, I finished my pills, and decided to not order (and not take) them anymore to see what happens. But yesterday, I woke up with really bad dizziness (after 1 month of almost no dizziness at all). So I decided to re-buy the pills and use them. I am not sure if they work on you similarly, but maybe worth it to give them a try.\n3. I talked with my PCP, and she ordered a whole set of blood tests for me. They basically covered almost everything that can relate to dizziness. Everything was fine except my Vit D was super low. I do not know if this dizziness is related to Vit D deficiency or not, but I started taking Vit D mega dozes (50000 UI) weekly starting last Wednesday. Hopefully, it at least boosts my energy, if not solving the dizziness.\n\nI hope both of us (and anybody else dealing with dizziness) get better soon. I know how horrible it is, and I do not even wish it for my worst enemies. Yes. I have only really had two \u201cattacks\u201d (where the room is really spinning) in Dec and February the rest of the year was residuals. But also had neck tension, migraines (back neck/head) tinnitus. It only really subsided fully in sept and last week it came back. I was Vitamin d and iron deficient so I was not consistent with supplements until recently, which is why I think I have been doing better. And I upped my vitamin d in the spring to 5000iu/day but cut back in the summer. So now I am back up to 5000iu/day. Which is what I hope you are taking. \nI saw someone write that they get vertigo with drop in barometric pressure and that is what happened last week when I got light spins. Inflammation, pressure, vitamin d deficiency all factors I think. It will get better. Your story and symptoms are EXACTLY the same a mine! It is ruined my life for the last 2-3 months. \n\nI have had MRIs, ECG, tilt table tests, blood checks and all the BPPV manoeuvres but nothing helped. Doctor has referred me to a neurology specialist in the next 2 months so hopefully get some answers. I will be sure to let you know of any outcome that might be able to help your situation. \n\nI am wondering if it can be some long term COVID after effect (I am not aware I had covid) that can be effecting people as I know others with similar symptoms too. \n\nAll the best So crazy...I know several people that experienced vertigo this year as well. I always wonder how much stress and anxiety contribute. This year obviously does not help. It makes me feel better to know that I am not alone in this even though it feels so isolating at times. I really hope we get better soon. I am definitely better than I was back in august and sept but still not 100%. Some days I feel like almost 75-80% BUT the fact that I have not felt normal in 3.5 months is absolutely insane to me. Let us def keep each other posted seeing we have v similar stories! Hopefully it will just go away soon and never come back!\ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude2d thanks for all the info!!! I am going to have to continue finding the right place to go to really figure out what is happening. I was diagnosed with bppv on Friday. Will update if I hear or have lasting troubles like you. Had eply done today and I feel much better. \n\nI am so sorry that your going through this. I also have major leg troubles that came out of nowhere that no one can diagnose that has completely changed my life since July. It is tough but sister my heart goes out to you tonight-m So sorry you are going through this.  Much of your story is similar to mine. And I am learning that BPPV effects people differently.  The main symptoms are the same, but I think the residual stuff really varies.  The anxiety is UNREAL. And it provokes different stuff in everyone. My last (4th episode) BPPV episode lasted actively for over 2 months.  I saw a vestibular therapist weekly. She often retested me to see if the crystal had moved to another canal, or if it turned into vestibular migraine, or something else.  It was a stubborn case. I seriously did not want to live any longer with this - as I was SO miserable. Yet - I continued to live life as normally as I could. I continued with hobbies (running, snowmobiling, dog agility, horseback riding), I continued to work.  Each day I fought through the sickness and anxiety.\n\nThe crystal was finally cleared and I still felt HORRIBLE for months. I made my therapist recheck me often.  It was all residual dizziness. Plus, I had developed gaze instability. So, the visual thing. Yeah. Yuck.  Tring to focus on things, and they would move.  I would shut my eyes, and a wave of mild dizziness would happen. I would also have a second of feeling like I was swaying/falling.  But my therapist told me I just needed to challenge all these residual dizziness stuff - to retrain my system (for lack of a more technical description).  My body had become so accustomed to being 'off balance' I had to retrain it to be balanced again.\n\nIt is now been 8 months since the crystal was 'cleared.'  The residual dizziness is still there. I have had a few weeks where I almost felt normal. Then suddenly, I will have a bout of dizziness. Not the severe vertigo with nystagmus....but this residual woozy, milder dizziness. And that spikes the anxiety. And anxiety leads to other crappy stuff.  The fear of it returning is overwhelming.  I also saw many specialists and checked out fine.  But I was super frustrated at my regular doc - who brushed it off.  And the ER doc brushed it off.  I have had tinnitus for years.  I also occasionally get migraines and sinus headaches.  But I am not plagued by either.  They are just occasional.\n\nI am a healthy, active 50y F. I am a go-getter.  Lover of life. I have many hobbies and a great job that I love.  But this BPPV has crushed me. And people just do not get it. They do not get how life altering it is.  Especially since it is benign. They think it is no big deal.  I wish you could find a vestibular/dizzy therapist that can help guide you.  Mine was a god send.  She is had BPPV and anxiety/panic attacks. She gets it. She talked me off the ledge so many times.  She gave me the latest up to date studies and exercises.  I also lost 10 pounds, and I really did not have 10 pounds to lose. I could not eat.\n\nThere are many on this sub that have great info.  They have been diagnosed and made it through therapy. Everyone is story is a bit different - but yet all very similar. Hopefully reading some of the stories will offer you guidance and help your anxiety a bit. Just knowing there are others that can totally relate. Hang in there and keep us posted on your progress. Thank you so much. I feel and have felt everything you have said. The anxiety is crippling and there moments I cannot imagine living life continuously this way. I am wondering what my next steps should be- there is a dizzy clinic in my state. I have gone to a vestibular balance center for PT. She had me also work on my neck- forward posture. The exercises I am still doing- I challenge myself all the time and my system is just not resetting. My progress was SO slow. I would only notice slight improvements weekly - not daily. And of course, that spiked my anxiety as well....that I would never get better.  I have found that keeping busy helps. And not dwelling on it. Keeping that anxiety at bay is key. I would try the dizzy clinic if you can.  Had my vestibular therapist not been as amazing as she was, I know I would be seeking help elsewhere.  And if the BPPV does return, I would likely try a dizzy clinic this next time as well. Just to see if they have different/better info. They may find something new or different. Or offer different advice that works better.  I think that if you saw a dizzy clinic, it may help ease your mind a bit and help with the anxiety. Likely (hopefully) they will just reassure you that this is all residual that you are feeling.  Perhaps give you other coping methods as well (and then you can share with us!!!). I think another thing that is tough for me - is when I have to back off with an activity, or if I feel super sick -  my husband (or friends) are like, you are STILL dealing with this? Jeez - what is with you.  And then I try to hide it.  As it is embarrassing that almost a year later - I am still struggling with it. I wonder that too. Last January I had a dry cough for a month- then February it turned to a wet mucus cough for a month. A few days in there felt really crummy. June donated blood and antibody test but no antibodies- but I wonder if they stay in your system that long? Since then I was tested for covid 2x so as far as I know I have not had it unless Jan and feb was covid?! I tried calling the dizzy clinic today but I guess the dr left and opened his own place. So I contacted for an apt. We will see what happens. It is so defeating and I do feel people think it is not as awful as it is. Only people who have gone through this can truly know the hell it is. I am so thankful that my bf understands- his father suffered from BPPV before they even knew what it was- had awful depression -really went through it so my bf definitely gets it....but will truly never know exactly the hell it causes. Thankfully my anxiety has been better but now I am just sad and frustrated most days. I honestly feel this will never go away at times. It is so hard to be hopeful and this awful crazy year does not help much. You are fortunate that your BF is supportive! My husband 'mostly' is. But when mine was really bad and it just lasted forever - he shouted at me at one point, when I could not get off the couch to make supper, as I was nauseous and dizzy. I told him it was just 'hard.'  And I apologized. He said, 'Everything is HARD for you.'  OMG - I burst into tears. As if I wanted to be sick?  As if I was not trying my hardest to get better? I was crushed. Most people would have sat at home the entire time. I continued to work, drive, run, ride, and keep up with all household and outdoor chores. I have never struggled to 'live' each day more than I was. I could not sleep, could not eat. Yet - I kept going. He did apologize. He was just frustrated. I get it.  I do hope you get into the dizzy clinic! They may have new insight for you! I am so sorry you went through that. I would have ended up in the looney bin if he did not support me the way he did - especially w the anxiety. I could definitely see him getting frustrated and feeling all the anxiety I was feeling. It is so hard for people who have never gone through this to truly know what it is like. I find myself struggling a lot this week. The past two weeks were good but this one all I do is cry. It is definitely a roller coaster and the residual symptoms you feel really impact it. It is just hard to know when this will end, I feel like there is no end in sight at times. I agree - 100%.  And it is weird - my first 3 episodes, before I sought better help than the initial ER visit and my regular doctor....I did not have the struggles I do this time. I did not know much about BPPV and was just given meds and told to wait it out. I thought it would never come back. No anxiety. No worries. No residual (as far as I can remember). I did not do therapy either. But this last episode, OMG - it is wrecking me! I sometimes find if I get overly exhausted, it is harder to fight the residual. It is like my body is tired and I cannot fight the gaze instability. And then my will to be strong and fight against it is just tired and all the symptoms ramp up.  So, with this past week being worse for me (could somehow be weather related as well), I have worked hard to get more sleep and get rid of the things stressing me. It is getting a bit better (knock on wood!) I just wrote a post about my experience with BPPV.  For me the dizziness/vertigo seems to be caused by TMJ.  I am working on correcting my bite right now.  Have you ever heard of trigger points?  If you have them in certain areas of your neck and jaw it can cause vertigo.  Since you have forward head posture (I do too) I am pretty sure you have trigger points.  I got a great book on Amazon about which symptoms are caused by which trigger points.  Best news is you can 100% treat them yourself.  Do some googling and press on some trigger points to see if they hurt and if you get referred pain to other areas in your body.  For me after I work on my jaw trigger points, my ears open up and I feel almost normal for a bit.  When the icky feelings come back I work on my trigger points again to feel better.  When I first discovered this I only got relief for short periods of time and my trigger points were so tender, now I sometimes can go a day or two before needing to work on them again.  Also google SCM muscle, it is a muscle in your neck that is probably super tight from your forward head posture.  \n\nI hope this does help you some, I know it was a game changer for me.  It did not cure my BPPV (laying down and turning my head dizziness) but it helped me so much with feeling better when I am functioning during the day. Could you tell me the the name of the book? Thanks for the info. The dizziness has not been awful for me. The head pressure and visual disturbances are the most annoying. Can absolutely relate to you and you have provided great advice. I have been living with this on and off for 6 years and I would say I am never 100%, I fluctuate between 60-80% with odd dizziness sensations throughout the day. Sometimes it gets too bad that I know it will not get better until I \u201csleep it off\u201d and even then what triggers me off can last for days with head pressure, ear pain, eye pain, etc. \n\nWhat I have found helps has been\n- good sleep - going to bed \u201cearly\u201d and having a good night rest sets me up for a 80% day. \n - no booze - gave that up 5 years ago. \n - no coffee - gave that up with the booze\n - reduced sugars\n - reduced salt\n - increased exercise.\n - balance / gaze exercises; and\n - learning to be a back sleeper - I feel my neck was also causing me problems from being a belly and side sleeper. Since upgrading the pillow and sleeping on my back, my neck has been better and the floaty feeling has been less. \n\nBest of luck! \ud83d\udc4d Totally understand the family / friends not being understanding. It is one of those things that if people cannot see, they cannot understand. \ud83d\ude15 I am the same, if I have late nights or get little sleep, I find my body the next day will struggle with dizziness, it is almost like I do not have enough energy... The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook. I got it on Amazon. It is a great book. I found it helpful for a lot of other issues too.", "A bppv relapse after 1 month So 5 months ago I passed out, had a 10 second seizure and hit my head on concrete floor. So this left me with bppv for 4 months. I got prescribed meclizine, but my schedule did not allow me to sleep 20 hrs/day and be depressed so I went off the meds. I kind of just dealt with the newly diagnosed bppv, it is triggered when I look down, turn right, or walk fast/take the bus. It went away after 4 months. \n\nI was free for 1 month, and I turned my head right when waking up today and found myself getting dizzy again. I am basically back to stage 1 now. What happened? Why is there a relapse? \n\nHere is my info: 19F, 115 lbs, 5\u20195\u201d, healthy (I think), nothing else is wrong with me. I typically have low blood/almost low blood pressure though. sorry to hear about your bppv and about your seizure, passing out, and hitting your head. that is horrible. did you see a ear nose throat (ent) dr or a vestibular specialist during the first time you got it?\n\ni recommend you see one this time. they know the maneuvers necessary to cure you and in a timely manner. i had it and once it was diagnosed properly by my ent dr my symptoms subsided within about 2 to 3 weeks.\n\nhang in there. I had brain scans&amp;ecg done&amp;related bloodwork and they said I was fine. But it completely disappeared for a solid month so I thought I was good XD. I should check in with an ent, thanks. Good to hear you are doing well now :) how did yours happen? Unfortunately BPPV can return. I have had it 4 times in the past 2 1/2 years. And even after it is 'cured' you may suffer from residual dizziness.  As mentioned - there are tests and maneuvers to help correct BPPV. Please try to find someone that specializes in dizziness or vestibular conditions. The Meclizine is just to help you cope. It is not going to fix BPPV (if that is truly what is going on).\n\nIf you search some of my other posts, I have detailed info on the Dix Hallpike (or google it), which tests for BPPV, or the Epley maneuver, which can help get the crystal back in place in your inner ear.  A specialist (I found my vestibular therapist in the physical therapy department) can do many different tests to rule out or diagnose other conditions.  These tests are usually beyond what a regular doc can do.\n\nJust like, you, I am healthy as a horse and physical active.  I do NOT have a history of head trauma like you do though. I think this warrants having you checked by a specialist - whether it is an ENT or neurologist. BPPV can be very random, with no rhyme or reason as to why it hits certain people.  But it does frequently reoccur in some people, unfortunately.\n\nBPPV is horrible. It makes you feel like absolute crap.  And doing the Epley to try to cure it also sucks.  I had to do it 20 times before my crystal was back in place.  And it made me super sick each time. But I am finally on the road to recovery.  Best of luck to you! sorry to reply so slow...\n\ni have no idea how my bppv came on. my ent did not know either. it came on a couple hours after i finished a hard 30 miles of cycling. although i asked my ent if cycling/exercise brings it on and she said not necessarily. i suspect its possible. i think i read somewhere that drs really do not know for sure what triggers bppv.\n\nhope youre doing better.", "What maneuvers work no matter which type of bppv you have? I know there is 2 main types of bppv, the posterior and the less common lateral. Are there exercises that work on both?\n\nThe last time i had an episode i was asked to do the epley which did not help and possibly made things worse. When i saw a specialist they told me i had lateral bppv and recommended the Semont and the bbq roll which fixed it.\n\nNow i have it again and I would like to self treat but do not want to do the wrong maneuver and make things worse. What can i try? No such move unfortunately...  \n\nThe best gauge is to do the dix-hallpike on each side and see what triggers nystagmus. The eye movement determines the canal which determines the manoeuvre to help move the crystal. \n\nBare in mind you can over do the test and the eye beating can become fatigued making it hard to determine which canal. \n\nI have had BPPV a number of times over the past 6 years and I must say, I am not game to self teat so I always see my PT. \n\nBest of luck \ud83e\udd1e", "BPPV after-effect could include Visually Induced Dizziness.

I have been struggling with this for so long! I do not have Visually induced dizziness, but when I have BPPV (and the residuals after) if I watch something on tv that flashes (like a strobe) boy does it send me into anxiety. I feel like I could start having a seizure or something. Makes me nervous. I developed what is called 'gaze instability' during my BPPV episode - which your link describes much of!

Thank you for posting this!", "Is this subreddit my condition? I have been feeling extremely dizzy and lightheaded everytime I lay down in my bed and while getting up. The room just starts spinning; feels like I am getting pulled in one direction. This happens everytime, and only when I lay down. Eventually, it will stop spinning after awhile, but it just baffles me that it happens every time. I can go on my day, run, drink, eat or do work, but when I lay down, the feeling and sensation is back. It is been two weeks now. did you try the manuevers to get the crystals oriented in your ear\n\nI had it on one side where I lay down \n\nthe other side when I layed down I did not have that effect That could be it. I have had different effects over the years, sometimes when looking up only, sometimes nearly any movement,  sometimes just nausea.  You should try the Epply Maneuver and maybe meclizine, the main ingredient  in dramamine  2. Do you think it is possible for pills to make this go away completely? It is just the weirdest thing ever. Like I do not have to get hammered to get all dizzy when going to bed. You might be on to something. I get really dizzy sometimes when tossing and turning in bed. Especially when I turn to the right side. At best the meclizine will dampen it so you can better tolerate the waves by a bit.  I describe my bppv as being like having the spins after a night of drinking, but only in short bursts and only when I do a triggering action. do you get nauseous sometimes to? that is when I had it the worst\n\nI do not think there is a cure unfortunately medication wise Perfect description, that is exactly what I have. My triggers are laying down on my bed and when getting up from said bed. How long you had this condition? Do you still have it? What are your triggers?

Are just going to give me some medication to suppress it and that would be it for the rest of my life? Well, I waited for about a day to see if it would abate but did not go to the doctors.  If yours is chronic then i would go see the doctor maybe they will give a medication and try to have you do some movements to move the crystals in your ear that is causing you the issue.\n\nOr, it could be some other issue completely unrelated.  I hope they help because it is horrible to have, I do not know if mine was a drunk feeling, mine was just constantly spinning in circle very dizzying it was messed up.\n\nI have not had it since that spell, not sure what triggered it if I did I would definately have went to the doctor. you have probably meant \n\n***DEFINITELY***  \n\n-not *definately* \n\n --------------------------------------- \n\n\n^^^Beep *^^boop. ^^^I ^^^am ^^a* ^^bot ^^whose ^^^mission ^^is ^^to ^^^correct ^^your ^^^grammar. ^^This ^^^action ^^was ^^^performed ^^automatically. ^^Contact ^^^me ^^^if ^^I ^^^made ^^^A ^^mistake ^^or ^^^just ^^downvote   ^^^^^^please ^^^^^do not I have had it for about 15 years.

My most recent bout was two months long, and was mostly nausea, that is where the meclizine really helped. \n\nI have known others with the condition, for some it is only happened once, for most it returns occasionally.\n\n  I would really recommend looking into the Epply Maneuver. Be sure to experiment with seeing if turning your head left or right when laying down makes a difference, if so the side that makes the bigger impact is the problem side, and that is what you should lead with in the Epply.  If no difference, pick a side and do it a few times, then the other side the next day if needed.  Be aware that the Epply will be causing the symptoms heavily so it is best to block out some time to rest after, but relief may be on the other side. \n\nGood luck to you! If you have BPPV or even just an inflammation in the inner ear, it will go away eventually. The only meds you can take for this is to take care of the symptoms, not the condition \u2014 you cannot really cure it with a pill. You can also try some of the repositioning maneuvers and see if they work for you. And maybe go see a doctor to get a more accurate diagnosis.\n\nI came down with it a week and a half ago due to head injury, and even though it is still triggered when I crane my head really far back, it is improved a lot and will eventually go away completely (or at least I hope so!).

I was wondering if anyone experiences lightheartedness or dizzy like symptoms after they have successfully executed the maneuvers to pass thr crystals.  I find myself experiencing.  Anyone else? Yes, it is pretty common to feel residual dizziness for a few days to weeks after. It should go away :) Thanks for the feedback  :) Very common. The inner ear is kind of learning balance again. When the spins stop, it is common to feel off kilter for days to weeks. Go easy. Yes. After Epley the vertigo stopped but I had a residual dizzy/lag feeling for a few weeks. It gradually went away. This is exactly what I am experiencing now. Epley maneuver got rid of the spinning but I have felt off balance for the past few days since. Good to know that this is normal. Got BPPV Mon night Went to the Dr twice for Epley maneuvers 3 times on Tues / Epley Mauever 2 times Wed.  It is Saturday and I am still dizzy and lightheaded.  I also feel exhausted by the dizziness and unmotivated to do much.  \n\nAnyone else feel exhausted from the lightheadedness/dizziness AFTER BPPV?  Any advice as to how to carry on as normal? I had the Epley maneuver done on Thursday and it helped but did not completely get rid of the vertigo. But now I feel a little off balance all the time and kind of cruddy. I am going back in tomorrow, hoping they can help because this is pretty miserable. Ya I am still feeling it.  I want to the mall over the weekend and I felt lightheaded a few times.  I heard and many have commented it takes a few weeks for your brain to readjust.  I am just being patient Let me know what they advise I do not remember feeling like this the last time I had it but it is been a few years and that was a less severe episode. This sucks, I tried to do my normal volunteer time at the food shelf today and I ended up leaving early because I felt so shitty. I will! This latest episode of mind was bad as well for me.  I have dealt with it for thr past few years too.  Just hit me out of nowhere this time and it was bad.  I dont remember having too much light headedness but it is concerning.  Figured if it is not better in a week or two then I will get checked out again. Okay, so the crystals apparently moved from the canal they started out in to a different canal. She did a different maneuver, I got vertigo when she tested to see if the crystals were in that canal but I did not have vertigo when she did it again to treat it so hopefully they moved to wherever they need to go just from her testing for it. The maneuver is really easy, if you want to try it. Start sitting up on the edge of the bed, keeping your head perfectly straight lie down to the left (to treat the right side), hold for a minute or two, turn your head so you are looking down at the bed and hold for a minute or two. Then sit up. It is similar to the Brandt Daroff maneuver, except you keep your head straight instead of looking up. \n\nI asked about feeling really shitty (nausea, motion sickness, heart palpitations) and whether it could cause anxiety attacks and she said absolutely. The crystals being in the other canal causes the motion sickness feeling as opposed to actual spinning and because the crystals are confusing the brain as to whether you are moving or which way your moving it can also cause all kinds of emotional upheaval.\n\nI know, long answer but maybe it will help someone else and at least now I feel better at least knowing why I have been feeling so shitty. Very cool and thank you so much for looking and letting me know.  Much appreciated!  \n\nHope you get well and we both get through this. You are welcome, I wish you well too. My doctor gave me instructions on doing the maneuver myself and told me to do it three times a day until I had not had vertigo for 24 hours. Doing it repeatedly like that made a big difference to me. I am glad that worked for you!", "I always figured this happened to everyone! Usually if I just tilt my head up, even if I am lying down, I get intense vertigo. This has happened my whole life. It only lasts a couple seconds and never results in nausea or anything debilitating, so I figured it was a quirk of the human body that everyone experiences.\n\nA little while ago -- now 32 years old -- I mentioned it to my wife and she had no idea what I was talking about. It made me think of \"ear rumbling,\" another thing I figured happened to everyone but apparently does not. \n\nSo after some Googling, it sounds like this might be mild BPPV! Does that sound accurate?\n\nThanks! Yes very accurate I have the same issue! Go see a ears nose and throat doctor and start physical therapy Looking up and bending over/down are my triggers. I was told it is a more rare trigger but definitely go get it checked out, and have someone help you correctbit Same here! Except that in rare circumstances, a bad tilt of my head can cause me dizziness for up to 3 months. And the ear rumbling can sometimes cascade to a needle-like sensation that lasts for a few seconds.   \n\n\nFor the ear rumbling, my ENT suggests that I take off coffee from my diet. But coffee is my happy drink, hehe. So I limit it to just one cup a day.", "BVVP symptoms - does anyone has experiences to share about this?  Rooms spinning or you feel like you are spinning. What is your question? You sound like you have BPPV. Your morning problem that dissipates throughout the day happened to me, too.\n\nBPPV is about crystals floating around in the wrong tube(s). If you do not get them maneuvered out of those tubes, your problems will persist. Depending on which of the six tubes the crystals are in, there are different maneuvers.\n\nCheck the two stickied posts at the top of this sub for more info.\n\nGood luck, OP!", "A question about BPPV My mom has vertigo. And she feels dizziness and vomits whenever she takes a walk. Sometimes she sneezes and coughs at the same time. What is the solution for this? Might be a dumb question since you are here, but has she seen a doctor and had it diagnosed as BPPV? Or are you guessing based on these symptoms? How long has it lasted? BPPV \u201cafter effects\u201d (recovery) can last a while... but the actual spinning vertigo that causes a person to be immobile usually lasts up to a week +/-, from my understanding- and if it is longer maybe she should see someone urgently... there would be other reasons why true vertigo would persist like that and she needs to be evaluated if it is not passing at all or getting worse.\n\nThere are meds she can take that might help a little; the doctor could prescribe or she could also try OTC- I am not a healthcare professional, so I will leave it to your pharmacist to tell you what those are...\n\nShe can also try exercises for BPPV that a doctor can do and walk you through to continue at home... some people have great success in just a few sessions of the Epley, but it has to be done correctly, especially if she has any neck or back issues. There are also videos of how to do it on YouTube, but be careful there and make sure what you are viewing is from a certified organization/professional.\n\nBest of luck... I hope she has one of those miraculous \u201c... and then one day I woke up and it was gone!\u201d recoveries that some people have. Thank you. She was diagnosed as vertigo and she is been like that for 3-4 years. She uses some eye drops. Hi - vertigo is not a diagnosis. It is a symptom. Would highly recommend seeing another doctor and being referred to a specalist. If she is been like this for 4 years and you guys tried stuff like epley maneuver etc etc...then there is surgery she can get that will help her. Vertigo is not hard to fix. Please help your mother. Unfortunately there is no easy solution.  Was your mom specifically diagnosed with BPPV? If not - as mentioned, vertigo is a symptom. There are many forms of vertigo. Find a doctor or therapist that specializes in dizziness. They can do a TON of tests to find out specifically what is causing the vertigo.  And from that point, there she can get treatment specific to her type of vertigo.  From what you described, it does not sound like BPPV. Many general doctors just jump straight to BPPV and tell you to wait it out and may give meds to help the symptoms. They do not even do any testing.  There are also variants of BPPV, which require different treatment.  Best wishes in helping your mom.  Dizziness is NOT fun to deal with.", "Do I have BPPV? I was swimming in the pool this morning. When I got out, I noticed water stuck in my ear. It happens quite frequently, so normally I would tilt my head to the side and jump on one foot. It would usually clear the water almost instantly but today it did not and I continued to jump and jerk my head to the side. After a couple minutes of trying and taking breaks nothing seemed to work so I just left it. It is now night, and as soon as I lay down I get intense dizziness, even when lying in some positions I start to feel nauseous, this has been going on for the past 3 hours now and only happens when lying down. I have done some research and stumbled across this subreddit. So do I have BPPV?, this dizziness has happened to me in the past as well but very minor. It could very well be BPPV. You say the dizziness happens when \"lying in some positions\" Does it happen when you are lying still? Or when you are lying and turning your head. Seems like a small difference but it is not. Yeah it happens when my head is still. While in some positions the dizziness seems to be minor, while others (head tilted back more) it gets to the point where I feel like i am about to throw up. So, what your saying is that you are lying still and the room is just spinning and spinning without stopping? I am not really sure that this is BPPV or not. I recommend you balance center in your city and have it checked out. I had a similar thing happen with water over 20 years ago (hit in the ear by a wave, took half the day to clear). The next day my entire field of vision shifted upside for 20 seconds. For about 6 months after that I had recurrent issues. Was diagnosed with labyrinthitis, and it eventually cleared. If I had gone to the doctor when it first happened they may have given me something to help clear my ears.\n \nYou may be dealing with some kind of similar disturbance. It could turn into an ear infection. You may want to consult a doctor because this is the kind of thing that antihistamines can help. My FIL got it really bad once and ended up with such bad vertigo he was constantly puking and could not tell which end was up until they got him help.", "delayed effect of dix hallpike maneuver? I am 18/m and have suffered from strong dizzy spells for years even though they occurred only a few times and passed within 1-3 hours I have checked up with some doctors.\n\nTwo times they performed the dix hallpike maneuver with the brezel googles that is supposed to trigger the dizziness but it always failed , however both times the dizziness episodes were happening YET only after I was already back home! (1-2 hours) Both times the dizziness was very strong so I had to lay down and eventually fall asleep and both times I woke up the next morning and the dizziness was still there and it eventually wore off in the afternoon \n\nHas anyone had / heard this kind of effect before? The maneuver is obv supposed to trigger the dizzy spells right away yet for me they seem to be triggered delayed?\n\nI will check back with my doctor but this might take some time so I thank you for helping me! I could not find anything similar online Are you keeping your head level after the maneuver? \n\nFrom my experience you are not supposed to raise your head too far up or too far down for about 72 hours and also sleep in a kind of sitting up position. If the dizziness is caused by crystals in your ear then they could be slipping back and causing the dizziness.  When you say dizziness are you referring to vertigo or just feeling light headed? hm do not really think I changed my head position since the vertigo started when I arrived home and was not lying down or anything \n\nyeah it was vertigo spinning to the left side and when I focused on an object and not moved my head the spinning was very minor but as soon as I turned my head a bit it started to spin like crazy again It sounds to me like that crystal is falling back into the canal again. I would definitely try to get in to see your doctor again soon. When the vertigo starts again do you try to repeat the maneuver or you just lie down? When you lie down does the spinning stop or get worse? no I did not try to repeat the maneuver and yeah I just lie down and it does not really stop spinning but it is very minimal when I do not move my head and try to fix my eyes on a certain object I cannot give you professional advice. I can just give you my opinion. The next time you get in to see the doctor I would ask them what maneuver would be good for you to do at home when you get these symptoms. Have you had a vng test to show where your crystal is located? I wonder if they are even doing the correct maneuver on you.", "Does meclizine/antivert cause blurry vision for anyone else? For some background, I am a 25 year old female. I had a hemorrhagic stroke back in January...two weeks later, I experienced my first round of BPPV. I went to the ER &amp; was given IV fluids and antivert. My symptoms were resolved and I went on my way. \n\nStarting Sunday, I was having really bad vertigo again. This time to the point of nausea and vomiting. Due to my history, my neuro told me to proceed to the ER. They did the Epley maneuver and I received an IV, meclizine, and zofran for the nausea/vomiting. I was still having issues after being there for 5-6 hours, but there was nothing else they could do so I was discharged. I am on day 3 of taking meclizine and the vertigo seems to have resolved for the most part, but today I have extremely blurry vision. This is the first time I have experienced this as a side effect, but I read that it can happen. \n\nHas anyone else experienced blurry vision as a side effect of meclizine?  If so, when did it resolve?  Thanks! What dose of Meclizine are you taking and how often? I have not used Meclizine much except to help sleep a few times, as it did not really help the vertigo. I am a wimp with medicine and usually take a half dose of everything. But I did notice once, in desperation, I took more than I typically would, and I felt really zoned out with a different type of dizziness that persisted for a while.  I did not like how it made me feel, so stopped taking it.  I only took the Zofran before I did the Epley maneuver to keep me from puking. 25mg. On the first day of the vertigo, I took 2 doses after the first did not help. In the ER, they gave me 25 mg &amp; advised me to take more when I got home. Then today, I took another 25 mg. \n\nThis is my second round of BPPV &amp; it is much worse than the first time. The first round did not last more then a day. Hmmm - that should not be 'too' much.  Perhaps you are just one of the few that are having the blurriness as a side effect.  Or - another factor that causes other crazy symptoms would be anxiety.  I noticed when my anxiety was off the charts, I would feel so much worse.  It is like it amplified everything. But I never had the blurry vision.  Have you called the doc and asked about it? With your history, it could be a cluster of things.  Hopefully it is just your vestibular system trying to sort it is balance out and nothing serious. My discharge documents said that meclizine can cause blurry vision &amp; the ER nurse that called to check on me today said it is possible as well. I suppose I will stop taking it and wait to see how I feel tomorrow. Even if I am feeling less dizziness, should I still try Epley again today?  I am afraid to knock it loose again and mess it up. Yeah - back off on the Meclizine and see how you feel tomorrow.  When my therapist did the Epley on me, she always did it twice.  The second time was to check to see if the first time worked. Unfortunately for me, we had to do it 20 times over the span of a few months in order for it to work.  It would not hurt to try it again.  You will know the second you lay back with your head turned 40 degrees and tipped back - if the crystal is still not where it needs to be. You will get the severe 30ish seconds of vertigo with the nystagmus (eye twitching).  If that happens, then continue with the rest of the Epley maneuvers.  If you get no severe vertigo when you initially lay back, you will know the crystal is cleared and you are dealing with residual dizziness (if it is not any other non-BPPV condition). At that point you can sit back up.  If you get no vertigo and still want to continue with the Epley, it should not hurt.  My therapist tested me that way many times at the end, when I still insisted I had BPPV. She had to prove to me it was cleared, because I still felt pretty yucky.\n\nMaybe once the medication is out of your system, you will feel a lot better. I will keep my fingers crossed for you! The drugs you are referring to inhibit vestibular input. In turn, this can affect how quickly your eyes coordinate with your head movements (the VOR reflex) - so taking these drugs could make your feel laggy and (I assume) have somewhat blurry vision. \n\nHowever, I believe this would only happen when moving. \n\nPS. NAD &amp; never experienced this myself. That makes sense. I ended up calling the pharmacy yesterday because it was pretty bad &amp; was advised that it is a less common side effect of the meds, but it does happen. I did not take any meclizine today &amp; my vision is better. Just still having some residual dizziness", "Breastfeeding as a trigger? Hey all. Wondering if anyone has had BPPV while breastfeeding. I have had a somewhat rough postpartum period and my perineal stitches and subsequent granulation tissue have caused pain in sitting positions. As a result I have been using the sidelying position about 8-12 times a day, meaning that I am lying down a lot. I think this might have been the trigger for my bppv as I would never had it before. \n\nAny advice from moms that may have done this on how to feed baby without aggravating perineal tissue or the innermost ear? \n\nThanks!", "please help does this sound like bppv? i am scared to death right now, i do not know what is going on. basically, around a month ago, i would have random, short bursts of intense lightheadedness occasionally if i was standing for too long or if i moved my head. these short bursts are like 1 to 2 seconds on average. really short. some days they would be more frequent than others. they seemed completely random- not happening at any specific time or after any specific action, like getting out of bed. last night, they happened a lot. they would happen when i even slightly adjusted my position while sitting at my desk. i thought it might just be because i was tired but when i woke up today they did not stop. today, it feels almost constant because of how much the bursts are happening. i am really worried and i do not know what to do. i do not want anything serious to be going on because lightheadedness can be a lot of things. does this sound familiar? i had bppv backin march 2020. sounds like it could be bppv for you. if it is dont worry, bppv is not supposed to be a serious ailment. its certainly not fun but youll be ok.\n\nget to an ent (ear nose and throat) dr. theyll know how to diagnose and resolve your symptoms. i did and alls good. Not sure if it is BPPV, you would need to see someone to really diagnose it with head movements and eye reactions.\n\nSometimes it is hard to describe these things. I have had a lot of dizziness, lightheadedness and almost body jolts (feels like my entire body gets electrocuted quickly, following by confused sense of where I am for a few moments). Also, certain head movements and sometimes even eye movements (horizontal only, it seems, to the left side) trigger dizziness or lightheadedness or a sense of disorientation. Sometimes it is just the neon light (esp. intense one in stores) that can make me almost pass out, or at least make me super lightheaded. \n\nIs there anything specific you can find in common with these situations, and is there anything else like pain, position, stress?\n\nEither way, you should go see a doctor about this to make sure it is nothing serious. Lightheaded ness can be a lot of things. Usually BPPV is when the room is spinning. So you should go to the dr\u2019s to rule out other things. I work at Lowe\u2019s and my BPPV started like a month after they installed these super bright LEDs on the ceiling. They wreck me so hard. I experience 90% of my vertigo at work. I think the lights play a huge role for some reason. My doctor does not consider that as much as I do though Neon lights wreck me too, but for me they activate PPPD, not really BPPV.\n\nMaybe consider PT for vestibular therapy. You can really do it yourself as well, there are a few good guides others posted here:\n\n(\n\n( (more (\n\n( (includes a guide to habituation exercises)\n\n( Can you maybe use blue-light blocking or regular sun glasses while at work?

Will update with results.! see a ear nose and throat (ent) dr. when i had bppv my ent resolved my bppv after properly doing the epley on me. its important that someone does the epley properly to eliminate symptoms.  Did you have any residual dizziness the first time? What about this time? From my experience you should keep doing the epley until you are sure bppv symptoms are completely gone. Yes and I only performed the Epley once the first time around.  I still have some dizziness the second time but it is not too severe. i had vertigo about 2 months ago..still dealing with residual dizziness...it is very slowly getting better....but what do you think is causing your reoccurring vertigo attacks? I am not sure what is causing it.  I am fortunate that the worst part is normally the first day.

On and off with my BBPV... wondering if anyone gets headaches as well during an attack? I know it is BBPV as the symptoms of dizziness and everything spinning happens when I lye down and move head to left, then the world spins and stops after holding that position for a few seconds. After doing the manoeuvres, it has gone away, but I still feel like crap... also get headaches after I get these attacks? Anyone else? Yep - I get tension headaches and the nausea sticks around for a while... not fun. I had my first bppv episode a year ago in the middle of the night when I rolled to my left side. Room was spinning at 100mph lasting for about 5 seconds. I have had 3 or 4 episodes since, none as bad as my first one. But after an episode I have the same after-effects for a week. After effects of slight nausea, slight headache, foggy brain, lethargy, little bit of pressure in my head (different sensation than headache), dizzy especially when I look down or bend over. \nI usually do the epely maneuver at least 1 time but I am still not totally convinced of its effectiveness. Wow we are the same! Same thing with me.... left side does that for me It is terrible. I have not figured out what triggers it yet I had supposed BPPV for the first time this august. My head aches were awful. Would go to bed w a warm cloth on my head. I am 3.5 months in now and still have residual head aches- pressure- ear pressure- wooziness, and visual disturbances- like seeing subtle lights/spots in my field of vision.

Hi guys, \nI have had a really wacky experience with diagnosis of BPPV. Just wanted to know if anyone has experienced anything similar. I have had the Epley manoeuvre done three times by two different doctors: \n* Failed first time with an emergency doctor in a hospital\n\n* passed second time at an ENT specialist (I felt like I was flipping upside down, it was wild) I was then instructed not to move my head to the right for 24 hours. That did not last long, because I had driven myself to the appointment and I had no choice but to drive back. Unless I wanted to pay parking fines through the nose. \n\n* failed the third and final time with the same specialist. \n\nWhen I failed the the third time, the specialist declared that I did not have BPPV and fobbed me off on a neurologist. Bloods and MRI had returned normal. \n\nMy symptoms seem to tally with BPPV. I am dizzy a lot; every two-three days. It seems to be vaguely movement triggered, but it is not hard and fast. It also seems to be noise-triggered; I work in a noisy environment. \n\nI am sorry for rambling, I am just sad and confused because I had been given hope with a diagnosis and a possible treatment and had it retracted so abruptly. \n\nCan I get your stories?

Or are your eyes twitching while you are not dizzy. Noise triggered is an important symptom that indicates perilymph fistula. Is your vertigo also triggered by sudden changes in intracranial pressure such as heavy lifting or leaning way over?\n\nHave you been on an airplane lately?\n\nThe trauma causing perilymph fistula can also come from heavy lifting. \n\nThat your vertigo comes and goes (pass/fail on dix hall pike) could also indicate this. \n\nBring this up with your ENT. Sorry, should have been clearer; yes, I mean the nystagmus. I understand that if the eyes do not twitch, then the Epley move will not work. Have to admit that I do not do too much heavy lifting, but I often experience a floating sensation after doing exercise. I can bend over so my chest touches my thighs okay, although I will experience a little spinning sometimes.\n\nI googled perilymph fistula and I have not had any serious head injuries lately; closest I came was coming off the bike end of last year. \n\nMy ENT has fobbed me off, so I suppose I will tell the neurologist he is referred me to in 2022.

Curious if there is a pattern among people. Mine occurs when I recline back or when I try to lay flat. It seems to be triggered by certain head positions. It is been 3 months and 10 days and it still happens daily. Nothing major and nothing I cannot deal with. Not even a big deal if it never goes away honestly. It also happens more laying on my bed more than anywhere! I can be fully reclined on a recliner and not feel any residual symptoms. I personally think my body relates a bed to Epley and dizziness so it sends false signals saying I should panic (which I have learned not to). Also looking down for too long (like face down if I am on my stomach) can make me feel odd. And one more for fun sometimes at my desk job if I am staring at a screen for too long it happens but never during a movie or TV. I wonder if it is more visual than positional? It is a slight amount of dizzy so it is really just a slight annoyance at this point. Kind Of feels like I just got off a boat. I can also lay flat when I first wake up without feeling anything so while my body and brain are still half asleep I do not notice it at all. Curious some other thoughts! This post turned much longer than I initially planned. Oops. Head positions. Can trigger a whole new episode of BPPV. Namely bad posture at the computer or playing video games slouched way back. \n\nMy mom always used to get me about my posture, but man. I did not realize it would be this serious. Lol &gt; I personally think my body relates a bed to Epley and dizziness so it sends false signals saying I should panic (which I have learned not to).\n\nI am glad I am not the only one who thinks this is a thing. I only get residual dizziness when I am sleeping and wake up abruptly. No real vertigo, but minor dizziness like you. The worst part, honestly, is that it triggers panic every time and I end up feeling worse from the anxiety than from the actual dizziness. Any tips for dealing with this? Keep forcing yourself into that position. I set a stopwatch on my phone and try to lay there for 5 mins and just try my best to ignore the \u201csense\u201d of BPPV coming on even though I know it is not. Just let your body feel the motions and know that it is all in your head. I also have determined if I am looking at my phone or laying back watching tv the feeling subsided quickly. It is when I lay back in complete silence where it never stops. Just remember that as far as health goes this is a pretty minor inconvenience and do not let negativity get to you! :) 3 months has been annoying but it is totally fine! At first I would walk on uneven surfaces and feel dizzy so a win is a win. I was even so convinced I still had crystals in my head I laid upside down for about 5 mins waiting and nothing happened \ud83d\ude02 what a fool I will try that, thanks! You are right, I find it is the worst when there are no other visual/audio distractions. I like the idea of using a stopwatch to track progress. I am glad it is not just me who has that when they lay back! Keep me posted on progress! How long have you had the residual? I cannot describe it better than like hopping off a boat or feeling like I am ABOUT to trigger BPPV but it never happens.  It happens when I am looking up and closing my eyes to wash my hair in the shower. we are same It is been 3 months since my vertigo started to trigger again and until now I still have it , when I look left, right, up, and down my world shakes a little, and it happens every time I use my phone for more than 30 minutes. and i dont know when it will go away huhu Mine is not that bad thankfully. Maybe try another Epley to see if it is not corrected? Just a thought! But it makes me more dizzy when i do it, or do i have to endure it?? so that it will go away? \u3160\u3160 Do you have the horrendous spinning when you can barely walk with your eyes going crazy?

I have an ENT appointment tomorrow for fluid in my ear that is been there for 18 months. Yesterday, I had a horrible attack of what I am guessing is BPPV. Found you guys today and did the Epley on myself, which made things even worse. Now, instead of just laying down and things spinning if I turn on my left side, it is constant, and I finally threw up five times. \n\nI feel a little better since I threw up. \n\nSomeone please tell me this is one of those \u201cit got worse but it is about to get better\u201d type things. I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. I had my episode for the first time yesterday, and learned about bppv for the first time yesterday. So I am far off from being an expert. But speaking from my experience, when the pt did epley maneuver. They looked at my eyes while I was showing symptoms swiftly after the movement. Symptoms lasted only few seconds. The whole world was spinning but only for few seconds, definitely less than 30sec. They counted for 30 sec and then repositioned my head. So I do not know if you would experience dizziness for minutes long with bppv. Throwing up did not help me from my dizziness either. I threw up twice but I felt just as dizzy everytime I lay down or turn to my side. So I just sat straight did not move my head. Pt said mine was bppv and epley maneuver worked well for me. \nIf you are performing the epley maneuver I hope you are getting a help from someone and hopefully they are doing it right. It makes a lot of difference. My doctor performed it on me and that did not do anything for me. My PT clearly was more experienced and gave me proper guidance while he was performing it and that made it a whole lot better. I hope you find help and solution sooner. &gt; I have an ENT appointment tomorrow for fluid in my ear that is been there for 18 months.

Now, instead of just laying down and things spinning if I turn on my left side, it is constant, and I finally threw up five times. \n\nExperienced nearly identical conditions (7 months for me; self-epley making it WAY worse). I imagine your sleep schedule's pretty messed up too since you wake up in the middle of the night with the room spinning.\n\nGood news! Absolutely treatable. \n\nYou need to find specialists with the right equipment. Regular physical therapists might not have the experience and technology to figure out exactly what you need. \n\nDr. Mango of Newport Beach fixed me after one session (literally). What did it for me was a procedure where they strap you in a NASA -like zero-g chair and maneuver you in a way that is mapped to your ear canal to place the stones back to their original positions. Basically, it is like a giant picking you up and twisting and turning you in mid air to get the stone back to its place. When the stone finally resettled I felt the STRONGEST wave of vertigo ever, but then I knew the stone was back in the right place. Within 2 weeks, I was better than ever - 100% cured!\n\nIf you cannot see Dr. Mango, def seek a specialist with the right equipment. I chose the doctor that I am seeing before the vertigo simply because his office was state of the Art with all equipment on hand (mapping, an MRI machine, etc.) \n\nI am terrified I am goin to throw up on these people today. Is that silly? I had hypermesis with both of my pregnancies, so I am no stranger to vomiting, but I hate making a mess or upsetting others. \n\nMy husband is taking me because it is about 90 minutes away. I am also nervous about that drive and getting sick. It is definitely worse since the self Epley. That is what I get hahaha. It took me 20 Epley maneuvers over the course of 2 months to get my crystal back where it belonged. And the Epley was horrible each time. I would always do a series of 2, then wait 4 to 7 days before doing it again. It provoked symptoms horribly and made me very sick the rest of the day. I was working with a therapist. Did you determine which side was effected before you  did the Epley?  The Half Sommersault (Foster maneuver) can be helpful, and does not provoke symptoms as bad.  During the Epley - I felt symptoms upon laying back (which is also the Dix Hallpike that they use to determine which side is effected), and then upon sitting up.\n\nYou may very well have something else going on if you have fluid in your ears. Constant dizziness is not usually associated with BPPV. Although besides having the 30ish seconds of severe vertigo upon position changes, there can be a lingering milder residual dizziness.\n\nI will keep my fingers crossed that your appointment goes well.  Please let us know of the outcome! Thank you so much. I was 100% on the verge of puking, and it is literally all same old to the staff.\n\nPuke away if you need to. Just give them a heads up. Its fine Just left the ENT. Have to go back for a CT scan and allergy testing, and then an appointment with a vertigo specialist on Monday. \n\nThey stuck a camera up my nose. They said my eustachean tube on that side is really, really narrow, but that there is currently no fluid behind the ear drum. However, they said that can cause the super full feeling. \n\nI honestly burst into tears when they said the vertigo specialist could not see me until Monday. I am hoping it gets a little better before then. Finally saw the vertigo specialist today. She said that two ear canals are involved. She did the Epley today and will do another on Friday. I have to sleep at a 45 degree angle and pretty much stay put for two days. \n\nTV recommendations welcome! \n\nBut in all seriousness, I appreciate the kind responses that were made to the OP. \u2764\ufe0f", "Vertigo and panic disorder. Hi, I have had random vertigo for 7 years now. It happened randomly one night and you guys know the drill; life changing, with depression and anxiety to follow. I previously had panic attacks before bppv, but it was the vertigo that pushed me over the edge and I started taking medication. The dizziness and weird balance issues went away over time but now I am not sure if maybe it was just the anxiety  medication that made it go away. I got an occasion spell here and there during the years, but lately its come back and I feel like anxiety is off the roof again. Now I am not sure if maybe my body is building a tolerance and I need to up my anxiety (SSRI) medication or if it is just a seasonal thing flaring the vertigo. \n\nNow my question is, if anyone with previous psychiatric disorders gets vertigo? I am thinking maybe there could be a relationship between the two. Your story sounds a lot like mine. I have had severe anxiety for years, and one day about 5 years ago I woke up and the room was spinning. I have had bouts since, not as frequently as the first time I had vertigo. I notice that my vertigo is worse when my anxiety is worse. I am not on any medication, but i am going to be seeing a doctor this week to discuss that route because my anxiety has completely taken over. But i have often wondered as well if there was a link between psychiatric disorders and vertigo. I have seen a lot of people on the anxiety sub reddit discuss vertigo issues as well. I have a panic disorder that was completely exacerbated by the vertigo. I would take 2 ativans before treatment (maneuvers) to get through it. I have not had an episode in a year but honestly the anxiety has lasted. I think about my head positions / scan how dizzy I am all the time.  The biggest things for me are getting enough sleep , not drinking, no caffeine and meditation.", "Nystagmus gone, still feels horrible I have had bppv for 5 months now. I met up with my doctor yesterday and he confimed once again that it is bppv and told me that any other vestibular desease is out of the picture. He did the epley (i think) on me and said that he could not detect any visible nystagmus anymore like he could before. Why do i still feel horrible? It does not \u00abfeel\u00bb better but nystagmus is gone so should\u2019nt i feel somewhat better? I felt absolutely horrible after my BPPV was cleared (I had BPPV for over two months where I was working with a therapist to correct). In fact, I kept making her test me, because I still felt horrible. But it was in a different way. I no longer had the severe 20ish seconds of violent vertigo that would happen in certain positions of doing the Epley or Dix Hallpike. The nystagmus was gone. But I felt a mild dizziness with nausea all the time. I would get waves of a milder dizziness if I moved or looked certain directions.  Many have residual dizziness. There are a few lucky people that feel better instantly. We (my therapist and I) believe that because I had active BPPV for so long, that my body adapted somewhat and it just took over a year for me to feel better.  There is a definite different between the vertigo that BPPV gives you - and the yuckiness of the residual type dizziness. Neither are fun. But, if you do the Dix Hallpike and you do not get that 20ish seconds of vertigo with nystagmus (and all other ear canals are tested), know that you likely just have residual stuff going on.  Try not to get frustrated or anxious about it - as that feeds into the dizziness as well and makes it worse. It is truly taken almost a year for me to feel better. The first few months after correcting BPPV were still pretty yucky.\n\nBest wishes to you. I hope you are feeling better soon! I agree with previous comment.  I had bppv last July and it took 3 months to feel normal again.  I had an episode of bppv again this January and am still working with a therapist to get through the ongoing dizziness feeling.  I like to watch videos from Joey remenyi on YT and I have found the Fysical balance centers to be helpful. Wise words from u/colmanson1 - my last episode was around September / October last year and 6 months later I am starting to feel \u201cbetter\u201d. \n\nPT work helps a lot! /u/slash5k1 I have been missing you!!!!!  Glad to see you pop back in! Hope all is well! That is not totally normal. The longer you have it or if you are prone to motion sickness you can develop a motion sensitivity that responds well to conditioning. There are different ways to test it specifically, try seeing a PT that specializes in dizziness. Its been around a long time with different names, they are now calling it PPPD( persistent postural perceptual dizziness.) Is is chronic? I have heard of it but never really looked in to it. Im kind of a hypochondriac and do not want to scare myself you know. Yeah im also feeling \u201cbetter\u201d. Interesting that you would say that cuz that is exactly how i would describe it. \u201cBetter\u201d. Exactly! I do not have the violent attacks anymore but i still feel horrible, but not as bad as i used to, i suppose. Im trying my best to keep calm and i have realised that someone to relate to is the absolute best medicine for anxiousness. Thank you, i will do my best, im glad you feel better. It can be a new onset of dizziness, but usually comes on after a more serious or strong vertigo attack has resolved. Almost like dizzy ptsd. It can also be a chronic condition if left untreated. Oh god, uhm okay. How do i know if i have it? For now i will cross my fingers that it is just residual dizziness. How is PPPD treated? Reconditioning mostly. Doing the things that make you symptomatic until they do not. Basically not limiting yourself. I am sure if you are active it will self correct eventually. Yeah - I have had a handful of episodes of BPPV and balance issues for over 6 years. If I am not 100% by now... I doubt I ever will... \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nBest of luck! \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Hi!! Doing well. Still doing balance exercises (albeit not nearly as frequently as I should be)\n\nHappy to see your still posting and helping others in here. \ud83d\ude42\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nIt really grinds me that we have posted such invaluable information and the mod is nowhere to be seen!! I am doing well!!!! I think I am in the same boat as you. For the most part much better - but the stuff that is lingering will never go away. So I am just learning to adjust and live with it. I DO still notice that in huge clumps of time, I am gradually getting better. Like a month or two will pass and I find tiny things have improved.\n\nI also find that I am miles ahead with my balance exercises compared to people I am surrounded by. No one can do any of them without getting sick/dizzy. And they do not have BPPV!", "Managing BPPV and a toddler Hi there, friends. I was enjoying a 3+ month stretch vertigo free when symptoms returned 2 weeks ago. I went to my PT and he helped me through a successful (I think?!) Epley, however the sensation has already returned. \n\nTypically after the Epley I try not to move my head too drastically for about 24 hours. The problem is that when I am home alone with my 2 year old, I am constantly on the floor, leaning down to put him in his crib, crouching next to the tub during bath time, and so on. \n\nI had the floaty, lightheaded sensation following the Epley which I have found to be pretty typical. But is it possible that even though the vertigo was gone, the maneuver two weeks ago was not actually successful? Or is all the movement necessary to keep up with a toddler just a recipe for recurring BPPV issues?\n\nAny advice or tales of similar experience would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading! I often repeat the epley a few night before bed after and sleep with a couple pillows under my head Just wanted to say I am in the same situation. Oof, I feel for you, friend. Oh good tip, thanks! I am in the same situation too. I am currently seeing a PT that only does vestibular stuff and is highly skilled. She said the whole \u201ckeeping your head upright for 48 hours etc\u201d thing is dated advice and studies have shown that it does not make a difference in outcome or reoccurrence. \n\nNot sure how accurate that is, but thought I would share it. \n\nAfter she does my maneuvers I just have to keep my head upright for 3 hours and not sleep on bad side for one night.\n\nEdited to add: here is a study that goes over it \n\n This is really helpful, both your feedback and the study. Thanks for sharing! I hope your vertigo stays away for a good long time. Following my episode and successful resolving it I had residual dizziness for a few weeks.  I was helped greatly by seeing a vestibular therapist about once a week for a couple months.  The gave me a lot of gaze stabilization and habituation exercises as homework.  It helped quite a bit.  Have you seen one?  Go asap if not. Oh interesting, no I have not seen one. My PT specializes in vestibular therapy and he has given me some eye exercises. I have to admit that I have been delinquent. I will make more of an effort to do them daily! Thank you. I currently have bilateral bppv but am FINALLY with a physical therapist that knows what they are doing/can handle more complicated cases. \n\nI am a sahm with a 2 year old and it is so hard to not bend down etc half my day is spent on the floor!\n\nMaybe you can go back to the PT and have them do a quick dix hallpike on you to determine if it is bppv being back vs residual dizziness? It really is impossible! And thanks for the suggestion. I called my PT and made an appointment asap. He is very good about investigating the cause before jumping into the solution. PT who specializes is same thing.  Yeah do daily.  Over do!   They help you normalize faster. I was in this situation in February with 11 month old. It was depressing trying to assemble Fisher-Price plastic toys. Repeating information from my vestibular therapist, after successful repositioning crystals you do not need to sleep in a special way or limit activities. Perform the Dix-Hall to test if you have loose crystals. When you perform the Dix Hall at home do you get vertigo? If you have a negative Dix-Hall I would move on to ( I want to briefly share my experience with BPPV. I had a crystal in my left posterior canal that was moved to the horizontal canal. After resetting the left, my PT tested my right. After laying in the first position of the Dix Hall for over 1 min, a crystal started moving creating vertigo. It was incredibly shocking because my previous doctors did not tell me this. This PT could see minimal nystagmus and performed this maneuver. I suspect this was a crystal that had been there before my original episode and was stuck in a position. Whoa! That is surprising! I am glad your PT stuck with it. Maybe I do have something going on in my left (my right is usually the problem) so I will have my PT check it out for a little longer. \n\nAnd yes, I do get a positive test when performing the Dix Hall at home. I have noticed though that I am getting a little dizziness with vertical head movement as well as side to side. I will definitely report back what I find during my appointment. \n\nThanks for the tips and for sharing your experience. Stick with the PT, be patient, it will get fixed with one of the movements. I was mentally deep in the darkness. I stay in this forum because I know how stressful it can be. After a successful maneuver (or so I think). I feel terrible for a first couple of weeks, I cannot even stand up especially when I move my head too quick, up and down. I have to sit down otherwise I want to vomit. Then it gets better but the lingering feeling is still there, like i am shaking on a boat for 3 months then one day it is kind of gone That is incredibly kind. It is reassuring to hear from someone who has control over it. I am sorry to hear about your struggles mentally/emotionally. This coupled with PPD &amp; PPA has been a real clusterf*** at times for me personally. Finding this PT has been a real source of comfort. Yikes! What a long process! I am going to ask my PT about expected recovery time from the Epley based on my current severity. /u/Sukanyaaa Thank you for mentioning that the 'keeping your head upright....' is outdated. I was working with a very skilled vestibular therapist almost 2 years ago that told me the same thing.  She was always continuing her education regarding dizzy conditions and was very up to date on all the new studies.  She told me to just go about all my normal activities and it would help me get better quicker. I was/am very active with physical hobbies (running, biking, horseback riding, snowmobiling, etc.) and I just kept doing all ov it!  She told me to NOT worry about my head position. Sadly - it took doing over 20 Epley over the course of two months for my BPPV to be treated. It was a long haul! With almost a year of horrible residual dizziness (mostly that was caused by me trying to keep my head still, causing 'gaze instability.')  It is nice to hear others that are working with reputable therapists share their recent 'correct' info! Best wishes to you! Update: I saw my PT this morning and aside from some sluggishness in a right-side head thrust, I had no positive tests. I still have the sensation of floaty lightheadedness that I associate with BPPV, but my PT suspects something else is going on, possibly residual effects from vestibular neuritis (which I was not aware of, if it was present). \n\nLeft the PT feeling reassured that the room is not going to start spinning, at least not violently, but frustrated because I still do not know what is going on. Hopefully a visit to a new GP and possibly to the ENT will sort things out. In the same situation like you.. vertigo came back last night as I was moving my head from left to right..mild but enough to make me cry today in frustration..really thought i could go for years without this thing after raising my vit d levels n taking all precautions, but nope..it still came back!\nMy kids are 7 and 1 years old and i absolutely hate the cycles of spinning-fix it with epley-work on the residual dizziness until its almost gone-bppv again!!! Every 2 to 3 months is honestly way too frequent!! How is it that medicine has not yet found a way to keep those little crystals where they belong and never move again!!? This is going to have me dizzy in some way whether spinning or non spinning if it doesnt give me a break longer than 3 months!! I think it is the residual dizziness that comes after bppv..try to not focus on it too much n do some VRT exercises..it will get better. Ugh that is SO frustrating! I am sorry to hear that this is happening to you again. It is pretty ridiculous that the only medical \u201csolution\u201d they have come up with is to just slow down the unaffected side, making us feel like nauseous lumps moving in slow motion. Hope you feel better soon. \ud83d\udc9b Thank you! How r u feeling now? Thanks for asking! I am doing pretty well, no episodes since the last Epley. I have been avoiding drastic head movements for fear of triggering an episode, though sometimes I feel as though one is just a slight turn or head jerk away.", "Should I notice involuntary eye movements if I have BPPV? I suspect I have BPPV, have a doc appointment later this week but reading up on it before going in. \n\nMy main question: I have not noticed any  eye movements. Would I, if I had BPPV?\n\nWhat I do have: about 2 months ago, I noticed that when I got out of bed, I felt dizzy at times. It was enough that I looked into it, and at the time I would been taking a pain pill for tendonitis that listed one of the symptoms as dizziness. I went off the pill, things got better, have not thought about it since.\n\nFast forward to a couple weeks ago. I had a bad cough, and the doc prescribed a cough pill. The day I started taking it, the nighttime dizziness started again. I stopped the pills, but it is been over a week and I am still getting dizzy at night. \n\nFor the first time today, I have experienced it during the daytime - bending over to get clothes out of the drying and also bending over to take a drink from a water fountain. \n\nI cannot tell if I have the eye movements at all, should I have? Pretty much when it happens, I am dizzy and trying to steady myself, not thinking about my eyes! You could still have BPPV. Your doctor will test you for eye movements. In my experience, more mild bouts might not have noticeable nystagmus in my daily activities. Your doctor will likely do the Dix-Halpike (spelling?) maneuver to officially test you. This is not an activity that you would be normally doing, and it can take a trained eye to really notice the movements. Google Dix Hallpike. That is one of the gold standard tests to test for the most common form of BPPV.  You will test the right and left.  When you lay back, if you experience a crazy intense 20ish seconds of vertigo, this is when your eyes will twitch.  This intense violent vertigo is caused by a crystal (otolith) moving in your inner ear canal. And as you body tries to adapt, it causes the vertigo and nystagmus.  It only lasts 20ish seconds, while the crystal settles. And yes, you will at that point notice your eyes twitching. I cannot even see during it. Dizziness is a whole different ballgame. And while having BPPV - you may also have a lot of random dizziness and such.  The Dix Hallpike is testing the horizontal ear canals. There are 4 other canals (3 total on each side) to test - and those have different style tests/treatments. The eye movement is not something you would notice, but someone watching your eyes during a vertigo episode might. It is called nystagmus, you can see videos of it on YouTube. Sometimes my husband has been able to see it when I have BPPV, sometimes it is too subtle. Dizzy specialists have you wear something like a VR head piece that allow them to see an enlarged picture of your eyes while they are testing you so it is easier for them to see.", "Is this normal after bppv? I do not think I have acute bppv anymore, since I do not experience spinning vertigo when moving my head. But I still feel generally unstable and like I have vertigo inside my brain.\n\nBut I do notice vertigo when I move my eyes even when holding head still. I am unable to look to the side without it being extremely comfortable and getting severe spinning vertigo. The same happens if I close my eyes and the first seconds after opening my eyes the room is spinning, then it calms down (also when holding head still)\nIs this normal after bppv? Or is it still bppv? Something else? (The eye thing)", "Persistent vertigo for about a month Around 10 years ago, I got a type of meningitis in both ears and both ear drums perforated. I lost all hearing for around 3 months, and had very violent vertigo. Any light, or turning my head would make me instantly vomit and then pass out. I recovered but my ears have had persistent pressure/pain since. \n\n\nStarting about a month ago I woke up one morning and could not make it to the bathroom because of vertigo. The 1st week was super bad. Looking in any direction just moving my eyes, not even my head would make the room spin. Its not as bad now. However somedays I only get it when I sit down, or stand up, and always when I roll over (both directions) in bed. But somedays (like today) I get like rolling vertigo. For no reason at all I just get dizzy as hell. And it feels like a wave. I call them rolling wave days. Just randomly I will feel this wave of dizziness which can be mild to extreme, that lasts less than a minute. But will usually last a day or two. \n\nI went to the Dr, and they gave me meclizine. It has no effect. I am hoping you guys can help me understand how to live with this. So far its having a pretty big impact on my life and does not seem to be going away. So sorry you are dealing with this.\n\nMy suggestion would be to go back and insist on some diagnostics, including them checking which canal is impacted, and seeing if Epley's or one of other maneuvers can help it. Are you familiar with these or have you used them before? ( would give you a basic idea what is involved.\n\nBPPV/dizziness seem to be often dismissed by medical professionals with some pills or 'it is just anxiety'.\n\nIf  it were me, I would be going back to my family physician and insist on doing further tests, because 1 month of that is NOT reasonable. Insist on seeing an ENT and neurologist (if possible neurotologist). This could also be vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis, which can take weeks and weeks to clear up, sometimes 8-10. \n\nI would also find a local physical therapist who is (really, not just claiming to be) experienced with BPPV diagnostics and treatment, as that can be of immediate help. Where do you live, are there any good dizziness clinics nearby?\n\nBest of luck, and keep us posted. I sincerely hope you are getting better and that the entire issue clears up soon. I live in Salt Lake City Ut. I dont know about dizziness centers. I will look into it. My Dr did suggest the Epley \"exercises\" as he called them. They dont seem to do anything at all. The Dr made it seem like this is just something I have to live with. I am starting to think going back to the Dr is probably a good idea. The severity is still about the same as before. However now when I get the \"waves\" of dizziness my vision gets really distorted, and does not return to normal for quite a while. This morning my left eye just felt like it was focusing the wrong thing for about 3-4 hours. That or I was really dizzy the entire time.\n\nI am curious though, with BPPV. Would BPPV make me dizzy for no reason at all. Without any movement from me at all? From my understanding it is triggered when I turn or change position in some way. Going back and asking for some tests is probably the best idea.\n\nCheck out PPPD, it is not BPPV but something that \"just\" happens sometimes to people, apparently, and it has to do with vision. Plenty of confusing information on internet about this. I personally refuse to accept this as a normal, even after 10 months, so I will keep trying and working on things until something helps fix it. Brains are amazing and neuroplasticity is a real thing. I am keeping an open mind, including that this might be (partially) anxiety-related.\n\nFrom my personal experience and from the accounts by other people, it is really common for medical professionals, including ENTs, to be not too informed about this condition and to just shrug it off as 'get used to it'. My neurologist told me they do not know why and how PPPD happens, and it is possible most medical professionals lose interest when they encounter something they do not know how to deal with or think they cannot fix.  We tend to see them as these elevated know it alls, but they are just human, and can be disappointing. If you hit this wall, just keep pushing and you will find a proper diagnosis and treatment/PT. That is at least my own attitude. Thanks for all the information. I truly appreciate it. And yes it is triggered by light sensitivity, and worse if for example driving at night. But also triggered by movement.", "Is this vertigo? Any self-help tips? Symptoms: \nI always feel like I am in constant swaying these last 5-7 days. At first I thought it was just lack of sleep but now I am more concerned. It is like not my entire body feels like it is moving. It Just feels like my head is in a... rocking chair and it seems to get more pronounced when night falls and I get tired. Also there is ringing in my ears constantly as well that of which can be drowned out easily though by external noises.. \n\nOther info: When I wake up, I do not feel the rocking as much until I actually decide to get up (I think I have gotten more lucid dreams since I got it which is a weird side bar) and I notice the spinning less if I actually move around. Some noises sometimes seem to make it worse a bit.. and I am at a loss of what it is. I feel the effectscmost when I try to do my work and focus on my computer screen.\n\nThis never happened to me before until well, a few days ago. I think it is directly related to me starting my 2nd junior semester in college and the actions I took to handle the workload of 7 courses. Namely, I sat at my computer for 12hrs+ for 6 days in a row while wearing  headphones which mightve been too tight on a wack schedule. But I do not think this was caused by lack of sleep because I have slept 8-10hours the last 5 days and it kicks in very shortly as soon as I wake up and start \"thinking.\" I suspect it has to do with the headphones and my prolonged use of them.\n\nI would go to the doctor but one of my parents doesnt trust doctors and will tell me to drink more water. Medication has been lectured to me as posion my whole life so if I am in for a long ass lecture in my face for 2hours/day if I even get a whiff. So... yea I am turning to the wisdom of the crowds for help (reddit). do you all think this is a form or vertigo or is it something else? Will it go away on it is own? Do you have any advice on how to deal with it? \n\nThank you all for any insight. I really appreciate it ;_; Hi could be something like Labyrinthitis which is an inner ear infection. I have had bppv and Labyrinthitis. When I had bppv the epley manoeuvre worked for me. When I had Labyrinthitis I was proscribed Cinnarizine which you could get over the counter at a pharmacy. What you describe could be a number of things and I am only speaking from personal experience. Last time I had bppv I had to let it settle for a couple of days before doing the epley manoeuvre 3 or 4 times a day. When I had Labyrinthitis the Cinnarizine worked pretty quickly but I decided that I would only take them for a week then stop. For the next few months I would have episodes of sitting on my chair at work and feeling like it was moving. Same when driving I would be stopped at traffic lights with the parking break on and I would feel like the car was rolling backwards which was really freeky. Same thing reversing the car I would reverse, stop the car, apply the parking break but it would feel like the car was still moving backwards. I have randomly had that for a year but each time it for a shorter period and the episodes are further apart. If in any doubt I would see a doctor. I have now got tinnitus in one ear from the infection that caused the Labyrinthitis and have about 20% hearing loss in that ear. Lots of videos about the epley manoeuvre and how to recognise bppv and how to do the manoeuvre. My eyes would roll like mad when I hit the right position so I was able to tell which side to work on. If you are uncomfortable going to a doctor Google Labyrinthitis and see if that matches your symptoms and see if you can get some Cinnarizine and try taking a low dose for a couple of days. I need Cinnarizine if I am on a boat or semi sub oil rig as I get sea sick so I will take the minimum dose. Look up bppv on Google and check out the symptoms. I can recommend this video it helped me work out that I had bppv and which side to work on\n\n\n\nGood luck, I hope you are feeling better soon. Hi thank u so much for ur reply! I was actually just peeping at Labyrinthitis on google. Mine seems like nonstop. Have u had unbalanced spells for multiple days in a row without pause?. It does not affect my actual balance though, just my sense of balance, nor does it make me nauseous or actually dizzy. I just feel like I am moving in my chair like u mentioned. But it doesnt stop. It might indeed by labyrinthitis as it says online it can be caused by a cold or flu and I do feel my throat becoming a bit conjested The initial Labyrinthitis ear infection took about 10 days to settle down. As it was new year the doctors were on holiday so I was not able to see or speak to anyone. I finally saw one and got the cinnarizine. Which seemed to kick in after about 12 hours then I was not still mildly dizzy for about another week. I went back to work too soon should have taken at least 14 days to recover. It would then settle down for a few days then flair up for a day or half a day. I am not a doctor but your symptoms sound like you have a mild flu/cold which can trigger Labyrinthitis. I was terribly sick for about 2 days at the peak and could not move without being sick but the feeling like my chair wa moving lasted 3 or 4 weeks and would come back again for short periods of time. I hope that you get better soon. I love listening to music so I wanted to see my doctor as I was worried about hearing damage but it was too late in the end. Please do not take any chances with your health. I hope that are feeling better soon. Update: It seems like i feel the affects less when I lie on my sides, but I feel it most when I lie on my stomach. What could this mean? I must admit that I was like this with the Labyrinthitis. I tried lots of positions to get some relief. And I was able to get more relief on my stomach but it did not feel totally comfortable so I would only lie until things settled down before trying to find another more comfortable position. Icic. I am trying to diagnosis which ear has potential hearing loss. The sensation is always tilting or heavy to the right. Does this mean it is the right ear?. Edit: honestly I should go see a doctor but my parents I dont think will let me.. Hi, I was lucky that we have 2 year hearing checks at work. I had one 3 months before the Labyrinthitis and had a copy of the data so the hospital was able to use the new data from the hospital hearing test to calculate the charges in 3 months. I also got a brain scan to make sure that the sudden hearing loss was not down to tumours etc. Worth getting checked out. Again if you are unable to see a medical professional there are hearing test apps you can download. Obviously not as good as a proper test but if you do it and the graph shows an obvious difference between your left and right ears it strengths you case to see a doctor.", "Half Somersault Maneuver? Hello, first-time poster in this sub. I was previously diagnosed with Meniere's Disease, but lately I have been having BPPV symptoms. When I lay flat on my back or tilt my head up at the ceiling I feel dizzy (not outright vertigo, but feels like it could turn into it at any second). My right ear has always given me trouble, but this time I do not have Meniere's symptoms, just positional-related dizziness.\n\nAnyway, has anyone tried the half-somersault maneuver by Carol Foster? I saw a YouTube video and it seems more effective than the Epley. Trying to figure out what to try to knock this out. Thanks. Only one way to find out. I have had success with 5x daily Brandt-Daroff as well. it is worked well for me, sometimes it can be hit or miss but when i had an episode, i would do it three times a day. i do it on my bed in case i fall over, this maneuver helped me many times, good luck I think it has worked 2-3 times for me.", "Brief BPPV symptoms, but only when asleep I had my first round of BPPV about 6 years ago, in my left ear.  A few weeks later, and after several traumatic Epley maneuvers it seemed to go away.  Fast forward a few years and I started getting these quick, brief spins right after I had fallen asleep.  It felt like a \"quarter turn\" of a BPPV episode, but was very intense.  It woke me out of a dead sleep every time, and it always felt like it happened right after I had fallen asleep.  I did the hallpike and supine roll tests so many times, and none ever came up positive.  I eventually just learned how to fall back asleep fairly quickly and \"fought through it.\"  More recently, I have started waking up late in the night with more slow, but more persistent spins if I am laying on either side.  It does not seem to happen if I am laying on my back.  But when it does happen, it is always many hours after I have been in that position.  I have done more hallpike and supine roll tests, as well as looking up or down quickly (what would trigger my original BPPV condition) and it never happens when I am awake.  This latest variant lasts maybe 5-10 seconds after it wakes me up.  My doctor does not seem to know how to treat it since it cannot be reproduced when I am awake.  Any ideas what could be causing this?  It is really starting to have an impact on my quality of sleep. Any updates? I have also had these brief episodes on waking up, even when sleeping on my back. But when I get out of bed, I am fine. Unfortunately, I do not have an update.  This seems to come in waves for me (several weeks of bad, followed by several weeks of good).  I am in one of the \"good\" (less significant incidents) waves right now, so I have not been pursuing an answer very aggressively.  My doctor does not seem to have any ideas at all.  Part of me wonders if I have just become hyper-sensitive to dizziness and the slightest head movement when my neck muscles relax on my pillow triggers that response from me. I have never heard someone call it a \"quarter turn\" but I know exactly what you mean. I would usually get it at night as I am trying to go to sleep or occasionally during the day. Unfortunately I have got no answers for you, just two theories. \n\n1) there is a tiny bit of debris but not enough to fully trigger bppv, so my brain is getting \"slightly off\"  signals\n\n2) my brain is on high alert for unsteadiness and is freaking itself out anytime something I am touching moves unexpectedly or something moves in my vision unexpectedly\n\nMy only solution has been to try to provoke the dizziness (quickly looking up or looking to the side). If I cannot make it happen then I tell myself it is in my head. If it does happen... then I cry and do the epley \ud83d\ude06 \n\nHope you are feeling better I totally agree with your assessment.  I strongly believe that #2 applies to me.  I think I am hyper sensitive and hyper aware to all movement that may mean I am experiencing vertigo or loss of balance...  to the point where it even effects me when I am asleep.  As a result, I believe that when my neck muscles relax as I fall asleep, my head moves the slightest amount and my brain overreacts, thinking I am beginning to experience vertigo.  \n\nOver the past month or so, I have made a conscious effort to relax my neck muscles as I am falling asleep.  This has helped me quite a bit, and I find that I very rarely experience the \"quarter turn\" that was happening before.  \n\nI also do the \"provoking\" thing to prove to myself that I either am or am not experiencing vertigo.\n\nThis is such a crazy condition!  I have been dealing with it for about 6 years now, and it has had a huge impact on my life.\n\nThank you for your response!", "Is recurring BPPV rare? 35/f.\n\nHi all. New here and diagnosed with BPPV today by a head and neck specialist. Long story short, I have experienced BPPV five times in the last five years. The first three episodes resolved within a day or two, the fourth lasted a couple days, and this fifth one has been a doozy. I am on day 22 with residual vertigo (it now only happens when I get in or out of bed on my right side/turn to my right side in bed). \n\nI asked the specialist why I have gotten in multiple times, and he said it was just one of those \"rare\" things that unfortunately happens. He was actually quite surprised I had it that many times. Am I alone in experiencing it this much? \n\nAnyway, I was told to try the Epley maneuver, which I expected, but have been avoiding because it makes the vertigo worse/makes me nauseous. I was prescribed zofran though, so I plan on taking that before I attempt the maneuver. He said if the vertigo does not subside in two weeks, I can go in for physical therapy. Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* Do not quote me on the exact numbers but it is something like 30% of people get reoccurrence within 6 months and 50% get reoccurrence within 5 years. So definitely not as rare as he says. The Epley maneuver is a really great fix if what you have got is BPPV or stuck crystals for another reason. \n\nYeah. You get super nauseous. But to me that 30 minutes of extreme dizziness and aftermath is completely worth it. I have had 4 recurrences within the last year that unfortunately have each had a couple months of residual dizziness.  There does not seem to be anything to do to control it.  My vit d levels are high, around 60, which is the only thing to pull from the research.  The positive is just learning how to deal with it each time and to not get upset or anxious when it does happen. I had the first one about a year ago. I woke up, right side of the bed, looked right and up to grab my phone and bam, felt like I was in a roller coaster. It lasted for maybe 5 seconds but residual stayed in a couple of weeks.\n\nAbout 4 weeks ago I had another one (same way as the first one, looked right and up). I was also having a severe sinus infection. I snapped out of it in a second, but had the residual. The following day it happened again. Snapped out quickly as well. I have been feeling dizzy ever since. Specially when I am hungry during the day and when I lay down in bed at night.\n\nI have not been to a doctor yet, but will consider if it does not go away in the next few days. I have BPPV and have vertigo episodes multiple times per month. I can actually trigger it on command by looking straight up above me while standing. This is my 9th month this year with it. Not in a row 5 months with, 3 months reprieve, 4 months on going. See vestibular therapist weekly. Never had it before this year. Get vaccinated? If yes how long before you got your first episode?", "Follow up Hi there, after two excruciating days, the hospital finally figured out that the anti nausea drugs they were giving me was interfering with my Lexapro. I no longer have world spins, however I have a migraine and dizzyness. Is this normal, how long is it meant to last and what can I do to lessen it?", "Terrible residual dizziness I had BPPV two weeks ago. I did not see the doctor, but I did the Epley by myself. The vertigo was gone in few days. However, few days later, i start feeling dizzy (non-vertigo). It has been lasting for 1.5 weeks. I will graduate from university in the end of this year and I will start working from January. I do not want to have this thing when I start working. It will affect my performance.\n\nI just feel this residual dizzy is much worse than the BPPV it self. At least, I do not feel vertigo if I do not move my head in BPPV. But I keep feeling dizzy all the day right now.\n\nIs there anything I can do? Should I exercise like running? Does it help to improve? Or should I just stay on the bed? I am taking teva betahistine prescribed by doctor, but it does not seem like to work. Should probably see an ENT and a vestibular therapist. My therapist does recommend exercise such as running if it provokes symptoms. I had a residual dizziness that slowly went away after a few weeks. I saw a pt and did vestibular exercises but I just continued my regular activities and tried to get a little bit more sleep and my inner ear and brain slowly synced back up. I also had a gaze instability thing going on... I still randomly get it for whatever reason but it is not like when I had bppv. Could just be stress and being tired. I am not sure they are open or not. My city is lock down due to COVID-19. I see. I am also doing vestibular exercises. Hope it can be better soon. The exercises will help but not an instant fix. Keep them up! Could take days, weeks or in my case months for the residual to pass. I had horrible residual dizziness for 8 months. Initially it was HORRIBLE and I kept asking my therapist to retest me.  Little by little (VERY slowly) it got better. I kept running through my BPPV and it was one of the only times that I felt much better.  I had been given vestibular exercises to help my body readjust to the crystals being moved back where they belong. Also gaze instability exercises. As mentioned - these exercises are not an instant fix - but do help speed up the process.  My therapist recommended being as active as you can tolerate. Laying around does not help your body mend. Some of my vestibular exercises were eye movement, head movements done while standing, then walking.  I progressed it one step farther and did them while running!!!!  Which totally impressed my therapist, but I was desperate to get better! Did you take any medicine? Nope. No medicine I am aware of that can help with BPPV or the residual dizziness. ... it is a mechanical issue with your vestibular system.", "Is this vertigo ? Recently (within the past 4 days) around night time (every day) i suddenly start to feel very very dizzy and light headed. The description i can give us like i feel that i just got off of a spinning ride, my legs and knees feel like jello and the room is turning. I have also been getting more frequent headaches (but i think that is my wisdom teeth too). I also get super nauseous and it is even effecting my driving where i feel super dizzy and have panic attacks while driving. I am going to see my doctor soon but the feeling has been so terrible. Just wondering if anyone can confirm if this sounds like vertigo as that is the only thing that aligns with the symptoms? Sounds like it, but not sure about BPPV. Does it happen when you turn your head in a specific direction - for example, only when turning onto the right? sometimes it does happen when i move a certain way, like especially driving and i have to be turning my head. But usually it is been happening around 6 of the clock for some reason. It feels like it starts off dull then escalated more thru the night Yeah -it does sound like Vertigo/BPPV. You definitely should go see a specialist - ENT \\ doctor.  If they cannot find anything wrong - go see a physical therapist that speicalizes in balance issues.\n\nHow bad are the headaches?  If they are extremely bad - a trip to the ER would be suggested.", "Diagnosed with BPPV a few months ago. I first got BPPV in March of this year. When I look back I can see indications of it long before such as suddenly feeling like I am falling for a second, and my balance has been poor for a few years.\n\nI have had a phobia of being dizzy since I was 12. I am 47 now. This is hell to me. I have even been suicidal at times because my brain is saying you have got this forever now. \n\nAnyway a month or two after getting BPPV, it seemed to get better, then my job changed and I got stressed and boom it was back with a vengeance. I guess this is something I have to put up with now as a crappy part of aging. \n\nI have since been battling it with brandt daroff exercises and more recently with Semont.\n\nThe affected ear is my right ear. I can become intensely dizzy from quickly lying down to the right and looking up at 45 degrees. The Semont seems to get it better for a few hours. \n\nMy question is why do I feel like I am falling when looking down or leaning forward? This is a very disconcerting feeling. I do not understand why it makes me feel this way when looking down. \n\nSince I am phobic of being dizzy it is a nightmare to get myself to bring on this intense vertigo, there is no way I would do the half summersault maneuver or have someone so the Epley on me.\n\nHaving this on and off for 6 months seems to me to be a long time. Will this ever get better? \n\nI have been looking at why it happens, some studies at its low Vitamin D but more recent research says Vitamin D supplementation gives increased risk of falls and suppresses immunity.\n\nI am a bit lost as to what to do. I keep doing the Semont maneuvers and I have stopped drinking. I exercise a bit every day and I eat a lot better. Not sure what else I can do. Re: why BPPV happens, I asked my Osteopath about this recently and she assured me it is *only* the displaced otoconia. I have had some feels about how sleep/caffeine affects my vertigo, and maybe those things do have an impact on inner ear conditions but apparently it is those darned otoconia you need to focus on primarily to help BPPV, which, unfortunately, means you may need to find the right maneuvre for your vertigo if the ones you are doing are not really working out.  \n\n\nI do not know what having a phobia is like so I cannot really advise on what to do here. Truthfully, as horrible as BPPV is, it is pretty amazing we can remedy it with non-invasive/ simple head movements. HOWEVER, it took me about a year to figure out which head maneuvre worked for me since the Epley and somersault etc did not work at all, and I had to go through about three physiotherapists and an ENT before I found an osteopath who knew what to do in my specific case. I am sure it takes people a long time without the right physiotherapist/doctor aiding them.  It is really unfortunate to live with this shit. Keep at it.  Thanks for your reply. However it does not actually answer why BPPV happens. The displaced otoconia are a function of the disease and cause the symptoms but what causes them to get displaced in the first place? It happens due to head trauma, but it is also associated with aging. My research so far indicates it is related to Vitamin D status and calcium metabolism. BPPV according to research has a higher incidence in people with osteoporosis. \n\nSo what I am getting at here, is this is a disease process and biology is hugely complex but we have some clues here what is happening to cause this disorder. It is well known that BPPV has a high reoccurring pattern. This means that if you do not seek to fix the underlying dysfunction then it will just reoccur because it is part of a disease process.\n\n\n\n\n\n I get it but seemingly at random, no pattern to, no specific food, no specific season, any mood/stress level etc. it can occur at any time. It is been at least one year since I had an episode. It took 40 years for me to learn it had a name: BPPV. \n\nBy the way vertigo is a spinning sensation but dizziness is when you feel faint or light-headed. People often use them to describe the same thing but both are different.\n\nMy dad experienced it one summer never having had it in his entire life but at age 73 we assumed it was a stroke. My mother gets it too but my sister does not. I am more and more convinced it is genetic and my sister lucked out not getting the gene. Or at the very least certain people are susceptible when exposed to something. Our home had a fairly moldy basement and no HVAC my sister left home in her early 20s I lived at home for a long time. I think mold exposure may also be part of the problem not 100% but part of a mix of things that trigger it.\n\nOne thing I have found over the years and I have said this in other comments about BPPV is I can diminish its effects a bit. I hold my nose and blow slightly as if trying to clear my ears of water after swimming. For me that reduces the severity of the vertigo by about 25% maybe 50% at the very best.\n\nGinger also helps I am not into natural therapies but ginger has been proven using double-blind studies to reduce the effects of vertigo. I do not understand this \"there is no way I would do the half summersault maneuver or have someone so the Epley on me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got BPPV the ENT did the Epley and sent me home with a sheet of instructions. I repeated the Epley 3 times at home. By the end of the day all of my symptoms were gone. Why do not you want to do the Epley? According to what I have read \"The Semont maneuver may work to stop symptoms of BPPV. But the evidence is not as good as it is for the Epley procedure.\" What is the problem with the Epley? I have had 1-2 episodes a year since my first time.  Every time I have done the epley (or similar) and it stops.  It is difficult to discern effectiveness after the maneuver, and I typically do it multiple times with breaks in between.  It is never lasted more than a half day for me as a result.  Videos on YouTube that show what is happening in the inner ear help me a lot too.\n\nI have noticed dehydration and sleeping on the affected side may enable it happening, that is anecdotal though.\n\nNot a doctor, but I hope that helps. Yeah I am all for treating the root cause, but I am not sure of any prevention strategies yet... there are lots of studies linking vertigo to a myriad of things, you can go in a million different directions trying to prevent it.  Vitamin D seems harmless to try. Magnesium seems to be the cure for everything.\n\nBut when it comes down to it, if you are dizzy, there is a maneuveral cure available to us and that seems like a gift to me! Maybe you should be working on your phobia first, then proceed to looking into the proper maneuvres for your ear tubes. The studies indicate that repositioning techniques fix the problem short term only for it to return sometime in the future. In effect they do not prevent reoccurrence. Therefore it is a disease state and there is a cause. Maybe science does not fully understand the cause yet. \n\nYou are correct a phobia should be tackled. I have managed to force myself to do the maneuvers. I have found closing one eye and concentrating on a YouTube video helps reduce the severity of the feelings.  Yeah, closing your eyes helps... enlist a savvy physio or osteo to help you too if you want. \n\nI had vertigo when I had my MRI, and having my head locked in a cage upright while dizzy was a little disconcerting but I closed my eyes and got through it!  Feeling like I am falling for second omg. I did not know what that was but now I have the dizziness always. ", "Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) Symptoms ", "Is it BPPV or something else? Seems cant find anyone with similar experience So around 9 months ago I had this strange sensation. I was looking straight and my surroundings seemed to move up and down and then stop. Like a rocking sensation. It was present for some time and i am left with lingering effects. I get this strange dizzy/ of balance feeling when I bend over, especially when i do that for couple of times (for example cleaning floor, etc), i also feel that my right side is affected - i feel off balance when my right leg is elevated from surface, when i sit cross legged for example. Also elevators and long car rides make me dizzy after i get off. \nI have seen a lot of people who get this spinning sensation but mine was more like up and down. Anyone can relate?\nThanks.. Dealt with this for along time now . Dm me if you want to chat about it I would get into a neurologist and maybe a PCP.  Have them check your blood pressure out. Even your blood sugar. When I first wake up my blood pressure drops and I do not regulate temperature well and I get tingling sensations in my limbs but I am not diabetic. If I move fast (going from laying down to standing or just walking fast or bending or being in an elevator or sitting down or driving) I have had the up and down sensation of things moving. I have had the spinning sensation. I have had things distort. I have lost Time, I have spaced out, I have disassociated from my body; all of it being attributed to vertigo and blood pressure and my hearing loss and previous seizure history and my current mental illness of PTSD/ADD as we as chronic pain from arthritis throughout my neck/shoulders/arms. However I have been tested and I am not having seizures but I am having migraines but not the kind with aura and not the cluster kind and potentially seizures triggered by mental disorders and BPPV by genetics. I am actually getting sent to a lab this Wednesday to test out my BPPV vertigo. You can keep in touch with me if you would like more information about how it goes. I have been to neuro, got mri, all clear. Tons of blood tests, clear as well. I am guessing everything was kicked off by some kind vestibular disorder and because of that my anxiety went through the roof causing tons of other shit, pretty similar to yours to be honest Most definitely sounds similar. Anxiety and mental disorders supposedly can really mess with our vertigo. I am looking forward to getting answers from my tests. Another thing to look into is oxygen levels in the brain. My whole system is not getting a good amount of oxygen through the nose (since breaking my nose led to migraines and worsened all of my issues and actually deviated my septum and closed off one of my sinuses) and I have noticed if I cannot get good breaths in through my nose and out my mouth, it actually worsens my vertigo . My ENT said something about this and is the one sending me to this lab. My psychologist said it can affect Anxiety if you do not get good air flow either, so definitely check to make sure you are getting good oxygen levels as well. It is always good to look at everything in yourself cause you never know what can cause problems. I will keep everyone posted about my study later. Did the dissociation dissapear? Im struggling really bad with that at the moment. Nope. It is here for good and only getting worse. I am actually having to get a service animal to help because I am spacing out and running into people and traffic in public. And I keep hurting my already disabled arms by running them into things.", "First step of the Epley Maneuver? If I have done the first step of the Epley Maneuver, but no spinning is getting triggered then does that mean I do not have BPPV?\n\nBecause lately I keep feeling dizziness like some slow moving sensation when I do things like sit too quickly, turn in bed, lean my head against the wall, come out of the shower etc. The Epley manuever may or may not trigger the spinning sensation... so you would not be able to self diagnose using that technique. You will want to make an appointment with your doctor and go for some testing. In the meantime, you can continue using the Epley in case you do have BPPV, and it could possibly help with symptoms! Good luck It could be that the crystal is in the horizontal canal, in that case epley will not help. Your best bet is to see a doctor. I have been to a PT specialist before who diagnosed me with right ear BPPV and she helped me with the Epley Maneuver (this was back in the fall) and things were pretty good back in February to March when the residual dizziness improved, but suddenly I started feeling spinning two weeks ago and since then it feels like I am rocking on a boat or tilting at random times throughout the day when turning or especially slouching in a chair (there is no more spinning) so I do not know if my BPPV came back or what is happening. \n\nWhat are signs of crystals being in the horizontal canal? More of a seasick feeling, or feeling like I was moving when I was sitting still was part of it for me. I started out with a crystal in the canal that Epley treats, and then it switched to the horizontal canal. This link explains it a bit. You can also have someone check your eye movements while doing the gufoni movement in the link because the way your eyes move depends on what canal is affected. The log roll movement did not help me, just made me really dizzy and sick, the gufoni movement is what my PT ended up using. Google horizontal canal BPPV eye movements if you have someone around who can help check that. \n My BPPV was diagnosed a couple years ago, and comes and goes as it pleases. Lately I have been tracking it to see if it is related to anything else. I HATE it, hate hate hate it! On the other hand, I am getting better at bouncing off walls on my way to the bathroom at 3am (often when it strikes- the first time I landed in my closet sideways!) When my crystal was finally cleared - I had no spinning with the first step of the Epley (which is also the Dix Hallpike maneuver that tests for the most common form of BPPV). But I did have over two months of residual dizziness.  It is different from the positional BPPV that you would get the severe intense 30 seconds of spinning with the nystagmus (eye twitching).  There are 6 different canals that could be affected. I am only familiar with the posterior canal, as that is what I had. If it is in the horizontal canal, symptoms could be different, as mentioned previously.  'Passesopenwindows' had good info regarding horizontal canal. And a therapist that can check those different canals with different movements and watching your eyes would be super helpful.\n\nMy therapist told me, as we treated my left side BPPV with the Epley 20 times, that once the crystal is back where it belongs, I will not have the intense brief vertigo with nystagmus.  But I sure had a lot of yucky residual dizziness, much as you described. I would often check myself with the Dix Hallpike (first step of Epley) to see if the intense vertigo was back - and it continued to be negative.", "It is barrack! With a new wrinkle... About 2 years ago I started having extreme dizziness when turning my head to the right in bed and when I stood up too quickly. Was coping by just moving more carefully until I had a few episodes of temporary blindness. Scared me enough to go to Dr, was sent to neuro and had several tests. Neuro diagnosed me with two types of vertigo including BPPV.  Also found a vitamin D deficiency, was treated with high dose and now take maintenance D. The vertigo resolved until about 3 months ago.\n\nVertigo back like before, plus a weird sensation that happens if I lean slightly to either right or left side...it feels like my lower legs are not connected to my body.

(Possible help for someone suffering from vertigo) For the past six years, I started getting vertigo spells that lasted for 2-4 days every 3-6 months. I had a Spinning sensation all day long. I usually noticed mine would happen when I was working strenuously on a computer (IT Guy/Graphic Designer) but not always. I have been to the doctors, and they scanned my head, looked at X-rays, and were like, huh, here is some meclizine have a good day! \n\nFinally, being sick of going to doctor after doctor for help and getting nothing but meclizine, which for me did nothing but make me pass out until the vertigo spell passed. I researched and found that One possible cure for Vertigo is \"Ginkgo Biloba\" I started taking 240mg of it for two years now, and I have no longer had a spell since then (usually had 2-3 attacks a year or more). \n\nSo, if you are like me and are tired of getting the runaround or no real help, I would say try some Ginkgo because it has genuinely changed my life! \n\nDo your research; ask your doctor if it is safe for you to take. I am no medical expert, but I can say Ginkgo is the only thing I have changed. \n\nAlso, Look into cutting out your Caffeine intake if you drink a lot of sodas/coffee; I only drink water and one v8 energy in the morning.

Since then though, I have felt more dizziness that has also gotten worse the past couple of days. I feel more dizzy when I get out of the shower or when I rest my back against a chair or sometimes randomly when turning.

Do I need a different maneuver? \n\nAlso can doing the Epley when no crystals have been dislodged cause BPPV to come back or to happen in another ear? I can imagine it is not the answer you want to hear but only a specialist can give you a definite answer. People on reddit can obv only speculate.\n\n\nYou cannot actually dislodge crystals with an Epley - however, if they are already dislodges you can cause them to float around, thus making you dizzier. \n\nSorry for this answer", "I have had BPPV for almost two years now and now I am not sure what to do. Like the title has, I first started getting symptoms for BPPV about two years ago (Janurary/February 2018). It took until around Fall 2018 for me to get properly diagnosed. I go through periods where I feel like I am on a boat/plane or in an elevator. I do not usually get the spinning unless I am lying in a certain position. I was in physical therapy for a few months and it helped a lot but I stopped when I decided I could do these exercises at home by myself plus the cost was too much for me. I have now reached a point where I cannot take it anymore. I do not know what to do. I felt the rocking motion all day today so I decided to do the Epley Maneuver. I ended up doing it three times to make sure I did it properly and I still do not feel any relief (if anything, I feel like it made it worse). It also does not help that I have anxiety so I am sure that does not help. \n\nTLDR; Had vertigo for two years, tried physical therapy and it did not cure it, did Epley Maneuver today now I feel worse, do not know what to do.  \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for me? I do not, as I am sorta in the same boat (pun not intended). Mine comes and goes, is only sometimes helped by the Epley Maneuver, and is always the hard spinning type, lasting 1-3 days before vanishing on its own.\n\nI just wanted to offer a {{{hug}}} because this freaking sucks and I hate it, too. I would suggest seeing the physical therapist again, or a different one. You might need a different maneuver. BPPV can be in a few different canals and doing the epley maneuver wrong can potentially cause horizontal BPPV which requires a different treatment. \nIt would be good just to get checked out, have the maneuvers done to treat that side of it, and be up front about the treatment plan. Like wanting to do it at home as much as possible for balance exercises for example. If your symptoms are present without movement it is not BPPV but there are lots of other reasons your dizziness may still be coming from your inner ear. \nYou would benefit from another assessment by a vestibular physio - particularly looking at motion sensitivity and hypofunction (low function) of your inner ear. Your anxiety can ramp up your symptoms to. I agree with everyone else that you should probably seek help from a professional. In the meantime, you _might_ find some temporary relief from your symptoms by trying meclizine, sold as Dramamine 2 or non-drowsy. I have had some success with it in the past. If it works for you, it is sold in bulk on Amazon for much cheaper than the brand name.\n\nGood luck to you, I hope you end up on solid ground soon! I have also had vertigo for about 2 years and it is had a significant impact on my life so I feel your frustration. \n\nMy diagnosis was for Vestibular Neuritis, not BPPV.  Vestibular Neuritis is likely caused by viral or bacterial infection.  The infection attacks the nerve that connects the inner ear balance system and the brain, leaving behind permanent damage to that nerve.  Over time your brain will work to compensate for the degraded signal, but getting back to 100% may not be in the cards.  My dr said \u201cmost people mostly get better within 2 years\u201d.  \n\nYou might want to get another diagnosis and see if it is Vestibular Neuritis which feels more likely to me given the failure of the Epily maneuver to improve your situation and the length of your symptoms.  \n\nHowever, bottom line is the treatment options for persistent vertigo - regardless of the diagnosis - are limited and in my experience ineffective. :(.  \n\nVery much hope you improve over time! Praying you die slow cuzzo", "Who to see Hi everyone! \n\nSo I have had random spurts of what I believe it vertigo since mid June. I will be standing in my apartment and feel like everything is moving. I have never fallen over but I notice myself grabbing onto something just to be sure. It usually goes away after a couple minutes. Could I see my GP for this? When I initially went in she said there was some fluid in my ear but did not go much further than that and recommended I use flonase. Or do I wait about a month to see an ENT? two suggestions:\n\n1) see an ent (ear nose and throat) dr. i had bppv and my ent cleared it. wait, you have to wait a month? anyway to find another ent?\n\n2) i have many posts here in the subreddit about how to deal with it. search for my posts. If it is fluid in ear an ENT. If it is BPPV an ENT or PT who has experience with vertigo patients or a dizzy/balance center if you have one in your area. Dude we have the same way of getting it, when i get vertigo i have to grab on to something regardless even if I am sitting down ! lmao its insane its like a reflex Went to my GP and he was able to do some head movement exercises and them prescribed physio for vestibular work", "Eply Maneuver done Monday and Today Hello! 27F\n\nSO I had the Eply maneuver done Monday and had drastic improvement but I still had dizziness so I had it done today. The therapist still wants to see me one more time next week. Is this common for it to not go away on the first time?      \n\nAlso if you have BPPV I am SOO sorry this SHIT SUCKS! Seeing a physical therapist really has helped me- I could not even move out of bed to make lunch before this I was so sick. Definitely normal to have it afterwards. Some people do not- they get it done and are fine. Other it can take months for the residual symptoms to go away. I am on 3.5 months and it is hell. But this place is a great place to find support! Okay thanks. Just really wanting it to go away so I can continue therapy for my legs (I have sudden leg weakness) . But all good I guess. Soooooo sorry you are still having it. Holy shit I seriously understand your pain I could not move from the bed without wanting to toss my cookies. I am so sorry \ud83d\ude22 I still have dizziness but it is more manageable and I can walk and stuff. \n\nPlease hang in there my friend. Thanks, you too\u2665\ufe0f Yes I have gone multiple days in a row to PT for the maneuver. She also suggested sleeping upright those nights after the maneuver. It is difficult and not very restful, but it seems to help the crystals not settle back into the danger zone. Yep - you are not alone. \n\nSome people report instant success. \n\nI took weeks before the severe vertigo stoped, then a few more weeks of mild... until it settled with residual lightheadedness. \n\nHaving lived with this on and off for 6 years, you kind of just learn to live with it and the anxiety slowly slips away. \n\nBest of luck!  Thank you for your response. I think it is finally like almost all the way gone because I can lay on my right side now. Crazy though Oh no no one ever told me that. I totally slept on my left side last night It took me over two months of working with a therapist weekly for mine to be resolved. Two epley per visit. Eventually I was doing it myself mid week, along with the half somersault. 20 some epley to fix mine. If you take the time to read through the sub.... You will find it common not to be cured immediately. For those that do have instant relief.... They are super fortunate! I had two months of horrible active BPPV and over 6 months of residual dizziness. Initially... It was almost worse than the BPPV.", "Personal Trainer for client with BPPV Hello all, \n\nI am a personal trainer with a new client who has BPPV. I have started familiarizing myself with BPPV and my clients individual needs. He is 72, 250lbs and primarily wanting help building better balance. I have plenty of movements and exercises that can strengthen the core and improve balance but I thought I would ask the community for personal experiences and successes to better empathize with my client. \nThank you! You mean he currently has BPPV? Yikes. I personally could not do any kind of workouts when I had it, some days just walking around was rough. If you are interested you can look up vestibular rehabilitation for more information but I believe that is supposed to be used after a person is no longer actively having BPPV. Can you clarify if he has BPPV or is susceptible to it? Thank you. Tomorrow is my first day with him so I will know more. He has been diagnosed with BPPV but it is not active I believe he has it. I will know more tomorrow This is also interesting for me. I had BPPV two years ago, and I thought it was pretty much resolved. But yesterday I visited a Pilates trainer for the first time. The trainer made me lie on a kind of hard rubber cylinder and made me do leg lifts. Similar to the video below at 7:10\n\n(\n\n I could do lifts with one leg. But when I lifted the other leg, I kept falling off of the cylinder. It was so strange. It seems I have some kind of balance issue on one side of my body.  I do not notice any issues in my normal life. But when I raise this one leg, I feel like I have the balancing ability of a severely drunk person. You now me wonder if this is somehow related to my BPPV? Or was I always like this? Let me know if you notice anything similar in your client. I can only imagine he will be apprehensive about looking up/down and lying fully flat. The episode so scar you in terms of doing these \u2018normal\u2019 things so maybe ask him if he is comfortable with this. \n\nDepending on whether he is still in the lingering dizziness phase (not active BPPV, but right after an episode), he might have slight balance issue so maybe do not make him stay on a leg etc etc In case it might help, with this client or the next, I just posted my experience and possible solution:  ( BPPV sufferer and former CPT. \n\nFind out what specific positions trigger it and avoid them. Always let him get into position before having any sort of load. Do as much seated or lying work as you can. Always spot or have safety measures (bars on a rack or use cable or leverage machines). I would not do any over head with dumbells - stick to machines for over head and machines or a barbell that you can spot for pressing when prone. I would avoid box steps or anything where he could get dizzy and fall from a height. In my limited experience, it has only affected my physical comfort, not my physical abilities.  If the same applies to your client, then just work with him like any other 72yo 250lb.\n\nJust do what I assume you usually do and some movement is \\_too\\_ difficult or uncomfortable, then scale it back or skip.  My physical therapist uses the rule that you can work through discomfort or pain up to 3 out of 10 intensity, but not through 4 out of 10.\n\nI guess another possibility is that the client is primed to blame balance issues on BPPV when it is just lack of practice &amp; conditioning.\n\nSorry if this is not helpful. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. We have been working together twice a week and it is going great. I will update fully tomorrow", "Has anyone tried doing the Epley maneuver regularly to pre\uff0dempt attacks? Last attack was 6 months ago, but I am beginning to feel mild dizziness in certain positions. Should I do an Epley now or wait till the vertigo hits?\n\nAlso does regularly doing the Epley help with keeping the otoliths where they should be? During my last episode I had to visit the PT to help with the maneuver because it just was not working it is way out at home. I asked her about doing it proactively, and she said that it could have the opposite effect and to only do it when having symptoms/as needed. I was told as well by my vestibular therapist that being proactive by doing any sort of maneuver is not worth it. When the crystal is ready to break loose and fall out.....its going to do it and there is nothing we can do to stop it.  I have days and weeks where my residual dizziness gets worse. Not sure why this happens.  This week is one of those weeks.  And naturally it triggers anxiety, wondering if I will get a full blown episode again. So, I am doing all I can to continue to remain active and challenge the dizziness by repeating the movement that triggered it over and over (that was part of my therapy) - to help my system adapt to the head movement and make the dizziness go away. I can also honestly say I still have not slept on the effected side since last December when my last episode hit (cured in February and still have residual dizziness).  That is the only thing I can think of to try to avoid it!!!!  Ha, ha - and it is probably not even a legit thing. We are you instructed to not sleep on the affected side , even after it was corrected? No - I was not instructed to sleep on my bad side.  In fact, my therapist (who had just come back from a week long dizzy seminar with world experts with the latest studies), told me to get back to doing all my activities ASAP and that included sleeping FLAT and laying on the bad side. Even immediately after the crystal was moved back into place, she told me I had no restrictions. Most say to keep upright for a day, sleep propped up, do not move your head too much. She said that is 'old news - old studies - there is no proof that helps.'  So, I have put the 'not sleeping on my bad side' restriction on myself - in hopes to do anything I can to prevent BPPV from happening again.  It is my own fear. But I am as active as ever and my head rolls/tips all directions with my sports and hobbies!", "How do you know when you pass a crystal? I have heard that symptoms can linger for a little while after passing? Is this true?  You can get an off feeling (sort of like a hangover) if the crystal is back to where it belongs though for most people does not last more than a few days. If the crystal is home you should not get the room spinning dizziness anymore. Thank you, on day two of not spinning when I invert my head but still have a headache and occasionally off balance. Was not sure if I successfully reset the crystal. Sounds like the hangover - usually it gets better each day until it resolves. If it persists then you can always get an assessment by a vestibular therapist.", "anyoneg et BPPV symptoms from bending forward from the waist .. . dont have to bend all the way down . .", "Feeling a little off So I had vertigo about five months ago and had the epley done 5 times and while the vertigo went away, every time I was brought down to the initial position, the room would spin. Still after the movement, it was like I did not have vertigo.\n\nAnyway, yesterday I got up from laying down pretty quickly and felt a little off since then. The room is not spinning I just feel off \n\nIt could be anxiety which is tied to my vertigo. Whenever I have gotten vertigo I get extremely anxious. Now, I think I am worried I have vertigo and and anxiety might be making it worse or causing this feeling off being off.\n\nThat being said, should I see an ENT to get the epley done just in case? Can any harm come having it done even without traditional symptoms? If you lay back in the Epley in the initial position and get the intense vertigo - the crystal is still misplaced and you are not fixed.  That is the test (Dix Hallpike) that is performed to determine if you have BPPV or not.  It took 20 Epley maneuvers over the course of two months for my crystal to get to the correct spot.  My therapist only recommended doing the Epley twice a day (waited about 15 minutes in between - and essentially the second time was to test to see if the first time worked).  Then I would wait a few days and do the Epley at home.  Then back to the therapist a few days later.  So, even though you may feel slightly better after your Epley, it may not have been effective. Your body is starting to adapt to being unbalanced.\n\nNo harm will be done to do the Epley, even if you do not have BPPV.  If I start to feel yucky (which I have been dealing with residual dizziness now for 4 months), I will often lay myself back just to prove that the BPPV is still gone.  The first step is a dead give away as to whether or not the BPPV is still there.  The Epley is not effective in preventing BPPV - but it will not do any harm to do it.  And if you lay back and have no symptoms, your BPPV has subsided (or possibly the crystal moved to another canal - and a specialist can do other tests to determine this).\n\nI think it will help ease your anxiety to go see the ENT.  And you are right - the anxiety feeds the dizziness.  Although the anxiety will not really effect the crystal in your ear - it will make the residual dizziness, and mild dizziness worse.\n\nOr, if you have had the Epley done enough that you feel comfortable doing it on your own, try it at home.  There is also another maneuver that is easy to do, and does not provoke the symptoms as bad. It is the Half Somersault.\n\nBest wishes to you! Keep us posted as to what you decide and what the outcome is. Thank you for your reply. Five months ago when I had the epley done 5 plus times I was seeing the ENT every week and getting frustrated cause it just was not going away. But when the symptoms went away and with the coronavirus picking up I cancelled my follow up appointments.\n\nIm afraid to do the epley myself at home. I just do not want to mess up.\n\nBut you are right , I would feel a lot better if I saw a doctor and saw I made an appointment with the ENT for tomorrow. Thank you again If you got  up quickly and \"feel off\" it is probably due to Orthostatic Hypotension. This happens when you stand up and not enough blood gets to the head. Sometimes, it can be so strong you can feel like you are going to pass out. Has nothing to do with BPPV. But it can feel really strange, so it might have created a \"flash back\" effect, reminding you of your BPPV. I actually know that feeling well. I usually lay in bed and watch TV and will jolt up when I am done or want to grab a snack etc, and I can say this is not that feeling.", "Dizziness - Again. A few years back I took a flight. During said flight my ears did not pop because I had in-ear headphones. This led to months of dizziness. Eventually, I healed myself using of the epley maneuvers. The result was instant. Like a literal switch. Went from dizzy to 100% back to normal.\n\nI took a trip this weekend and drove. During the trip my ears usually pop. This time they did not. Only felt pressure. And now, you probably guessed it, I am suffering from dizziness again. \n\nReading on the screen, head movements, etc. Minor loss of balance. Nothing too crazy (not like last time) but still very uncomfortable. \n\nThe maneuvers are not working this time. Anyone know if air pressure (or just altitude pressure??) in the ear not popping can cause this and what i can do to resolve it? \n\nLast time I went to the doctor for the problem and got no help (thus why i healed myself).  I am actually really glad I found this. My first spell with vertigo happened a few years ago after I got off an airplane. Then I was diagnosed with BPPV a few months ago and was stuck in bed for a week and a half cause it was in both ears and I could not stand up. I had to literally crawl on my back to the bathroom at some points. I got physical therapy help and they helped me fix it. I am only 23...\n\nYesterday I just got a huge spell on vertigo and red not really going away. I feel dizzy and it is not terrible but really uncomfortable. I have had vertigo off and on since my BPPV episode but not like this. Did you find a remedy? I am almost afraid to do the epley maneuver just in case it is worse. \n\nI have always wondered if the air pressure really affects me, cause I always feel like crap during or after a storm.\nHopefully you see this:( \n\nThis maneuver has been a life saver when I have attacks. Is it really that good. I attempted to do it when I had my terrible bppv case but I could not muster up to it cause it was sooooo bad... I think I will give it a shot. I almost want to wait a few days to see if it goes away but I do not feel like it will :/ I really do not know the answer to that, sorry :( It will eventually go away, but the maneuvers hopefully put things right a little more quickly. I almost feel a little better already so I will wait. But I think I know what I will have to do if it is not going to get any better than this. Thanks for the info! I had the same issues after flying on a plane. :/ \n\nI am not sure what my problem is. It is getting better. Mainly by taking antihistamines (Benadryl). \n\nThe maneuvers do not seem to help. My inability to focus my eyes when I am having the dizziness leads me to believe that I have Labyrinthitis. I do feel pressure behind/below my ears. \n\nWish I had an absolute solution for I would gladly let you know what it is. But as of now, I do not know. And I am still suffering with this issue. \n\n", "My sense of dizziness has changed it is more unsettling and I feel like I am floating when I turn my head in the right direction also when I shake my legs when sitting down it happens too :(  I would definitely check with a doctor after head trauma and symptoms like that. BPPV can occur after blows to the head (as they can loosen crystals). A doctor can give you a general checkup and might refer you to a vestibular physiotherapist for specialized treatment.\n\nIf you would like more information, feel free to read the ( but definitely check with your doctor if you are still concerned.", "Benedryl helped....is that good? Hey guys,\n\nSo I started getting what I suspect is BPPV a week ago. It mostly is mild and seems to be triggered when leaning forward or to the side. I just feel slightly off balance. I have also felt a general brain fog or slight dizziness in general but I think some of that has to do with my anxiety which my BPPV is making worse.\n\nAnyway, this morning I took some Benadryl and so far it seems to be helping and im not drowsy yet. Is this a good thing that the Benedryl is working? Im so worried this isnt going to go away! I have an appt with my ENT on Tues so hopefully he can help me come up with some solutions.\n\nThanks I am in same boat.  When I went to ent other day I told him my gp gave me a prescription for anti motion sickness.  He told me not to take it.  As that would help for constant vertigo or dizziness.   What I was having was just small snip-its of dizziness on the way up after leaning back. The anxiety and stress of whole thing is half the battle I am leaning as well Yeah I actually think that its not doing anything for my dizzy sensations but that it helped cut some of the anxiety associated with it. Hopefully this passes soon. I feel lucky that mine is not crippling but damn if it is not annoying!", "This video helped my BPPV I have recently been diagnosed with BPPV, and during the course of my desperate search for relief, I came across this video showing an exercise that is supposed to stop the vertigo. \n\nI did it last night (and I did get dizzy at first), twice, about 15 minutes apart - and I have been vertigo-free since. Did not need my antivert or valium today, and I actually feel normal again. I am still cautiously optimistic, as it is only been a little more than 24hrs, but a whole day without vertigo felt amazing! \n\nI hope this helps someone else who is suffering.\n\n\n\n I did this first couple of nights when my BPPV came back along with the epley exercises and it helped set me straight real quick. Definitely recommend. I am right side affected. What a rush it was.  I use this same one! It works the best for me out of any maneuver.  I am 48hrs vertigo free. It is amazing! Could someone who is tried more than one method tell me if this one is as disturbing as the others? On my first go at Epley &amp; Semont manoeuvres I was so frighteningly light-headed &amp; disoriented (my problem has been more loss of balance than spinning) that I could not stick more than 5 seconds of either.  I suppose I can bring myself to deal with the awfulness if I am sure I will not faint, but I would like to know is this technique a bit less awful than the others.  Cheers. It made me a little dizzy, especially when I tilted my head back, but it was not bad. But everyone is different. I understand your fear. Thanks. Did you feel any improvement after the fist time you tried it, or only after the second time?", "If my eyes dart to the right when I try to focus on something Is it safe to say my right ear is affected ? In my case, I was told that my left-side nystagmus was caused by VN impacting my right vestibulocochlear nerve. You should be probably checked by ENT. I am not a doctor but mine told me with my left eye nystagmus that it was a left side problem and so we treated it that way. \n\nBest to ask a doctor and have them examine you to find out for sure. There are actually some good videos online of the different types of eye movement while testing for BPPV.  Different directions/rotations for each ear canal that is effected.  Google it and you might find it helpful. But the nystagmus happens while doing the Dix Halpike, or during that brief violent 20ish seconds of vertigo when the crystal shifts in the ear canal.", "Hopeful Post! Hey I have not been active on this group for awhile because I have not had a BPPV episode since over year and a half ago. I know this does not seem like a lot but I remember I kept getting a new episode every three-6 months for awhile and it was so scary and my anxiety was sky rocketing and then one day I guess it did not come back. I am sure it will come back at some point but I thought this might send some positive vibes too those dealing with this and feeling like it will never get better. I have had over 5 episodes and I am 22 year old now and it started when I was 19 :) anyways sending good vibes too all of you! Hope this isint jinxing me \ud83d\ude02 but anyways almost 2 years no episodes so good vibes too all of you! Needed this so much! Thanks \ud83d\ude03\nI think it is also important for people with recurrent bppv to check for vitamin D levels, blood pressure and to remain well hydrated at all times..as these are all risk factors for bppv Hurrah!!!! I am going on 'almost' 2 years without an episode as well!!!  Prior to that, I had had 4 episodes, all within a few years.  This last time it was the worse and super stubborn and I was left with residual dizziness for close to a year. So right now, I am super thankful to be feeling really good!  Fingers crossed that we continue to be BPPV free! good to hear.  I have managed to figure out what keeps the BPPV away which is sleeping on my left side and not tilting my head back and to the right.

I do not intend to shame your mistakes. If you think the errors which I found are incorrect, please contact me through DMs or contact my owner EliteDaMyth!) Seriously. It sometimes takes a while to find someone specialized in dizziness that can help. I saw some experts.... But they did not offer much help. It was in the PT department, a vestibular specialist that truly was able to treat me. She really knew &amp; understood many forms of dizziness. You should not need to keep suffering. Hang in there &amp; try to find someone that CAN help you. It will make a huge difference! I cant get help here.....Am I blacklisted? Or is it cause of covid? 15 places turned me down in 6 months. I barely keep own food, sleeping is hell. They keep saying its in my head or cancelling seeing me cause of the virus. This is driving me to nervous breakdown. what can i doo.....Gofunme for money and get help abroad? why wont they listen to me.... Have any of your doctor visits actually tested you for bppv? And while doctors can do eat more thorough testing with special equipment.... There is a simple test you can do at home to test fur the most common form of BPPV. Then you can try &amp; treat it yourself. The Dix Hallpike (Google it). It is just simply laying back with your head extended past your shoulders. You do it on the right side, then the left side. If it is bppv, you will get a 20ish seconds of severe vertigo with nystagmus (eye twitching). The side you get the symptoms is the side you treat. There is the Epley maneuver (the Dix Hallpike is the first step of the Epley). There is also the half somersault.\n\nThere are different forms of vertigo and 6 different ear canals that can be effected. And a specialist can do different tests to check for different vertigo. But at least this would be a start.\n\nAlso....anxiety can feed this in a huge way. You should not have to continue to be miserable. I am frustrated for you that you cannot find someone to help. You could be dealing with residual dizziness as well.... And just having reassurance &amp; vestibular (balance) exercises can help you a ton. If you have time to read through the forum, you will find some folks that have offered some great advice. Perhaps some of it would help you a bit and give you some ideas. ENT? Neurologist?

Some more extreme cases than others. It usually happens when the wave of vertigo peaks. I have seen the same but this is now that the vertigo has lessened.  I will continue to research. I have seen some eye exercises that this may be applicable to. I had really bad eye stigmatism\u2019s when i had bppv, went away completely around the same time the bppv did though.

Trying to navigate walking in the sludge and the snow was quite distorted, but everything else was a lot better. \n\nI will keep at it and hope it keeps up. I do not think I have bppv but for almost a month now I have had a stiff neck with a sort of non spinning dizziness. My eyes have definitely been affected. I feel  you when you say kind of weak and twitchy, same here. I feel like I have difficulty concentrating at times or sort of the eye strain feeling when you have like a tension headache or migraine What kind of stiff neck? If it is giving you issues to look down, you need to see dr asap.\n\nMy eye strain is exactly what you are describing. I read that laying off caffeine can help. Having read that, I had some coffee the other day and did notice that my eyes got much worse. For the past 2 days I have had little to no caffeine and I believe it is helping.  Today was better than any day in the pat 2 months. No do not have a looking down issue, the main stiffness  is at the base of the skull. If it affects range of motion, it is my side to side range and upper diagonal. I went to the chiropractor twice and that has helped a bit. I am wondering if I could have post covid or something. Although, idk if I had covid so... Does your vertigo kind of feel like a vibration in your head ever? Almost electrical. And it just comes in and out very frequently for a while? I have felt a similar non spinning dizziness along with a really tense neck and my eyes are constantly tired. I also had BPPV before so this is triggering something but it does not feel like BPPV. Do you think constantly staring at screens all day is causing the tension? Could be. Make sure your ergonomically correct, good posture, etc..  Also get blue light glasses to help w/ the eye tiredness. Not at all.. that sounds like nerves maybe? That is part of it for sure, but I think something else may be at play", "LF opinion on condition (post BPPV diagnosis) I had BPPV the second of December last year. Vertigo symptoms are gone but I get dizziness/lightheadedness during two head positions:\n\n1. head tilted to the back (back of head parallel to X/horizontal axis\n2. head tilted to the right of shoulder (right side of head parallel to X/horizontal axis\n\nI have had tinnitus for years on both ears but it is been louder on my left ear since the vertigo episodes. During head positions 1 and 2, something is happening on my left ear. I can hear and feel something going on. My guess is it is my eardrum moving but I am not sure. It is similar to when you yawn.\n\nI have been able to move normally since. My doctor even told me to hold off on going to the physio/PT since it is been so long since the vertigo. My hearing has not worsened and I never experience any pain in both ears. \n\nAny ideas or suggestions on what is going on? Thanks. Hi OP! Were you able to check the ( We are working on sticking it to the top of the subreddit for everyone is convenience, but, for now, I keep linking newcomers to it as it keeps getting pushed further down the home page. Hello. Your saying pretty much same thing what is going on for me as well. My dizzyness is calming down but will feel off when moving my head is certain ways as well. I am 26 I had ear ringing and both years for over 10 years now. But I have also notice it getting louder after my bppv that happen 10 years ago and that weird yawning thing you get in your ears I also have that happing in my right ear only. It is like a roaring windy sound that comes and goes. But I hope someone knows the answer to your question. Thanks for sharing. When did you first have BPPV? I would say about 5 months ago but I did not have vertigo with that time just balance problems but the one I got 10 days ago it hit my like a brick. My recovery seems to be really slow. You likely are experiencing residual dizziness.  A year after my last episode, I still have a few head positions that give me waves of dizziness.  Not the intense brief vertigo - but a woozy dizziness.  I also have had tinnitus for years. I have a new pitch/tone that is added to that after my last episode.  My ears also crackled and gurgled for quite some time when I would move my head in certain ways. Saw an ENT for this, and he found nothing wrong.\n\nI was seeing a vestibular specialist during my active BPPV and during recovery. This was very helpful, as she closely monitored my symptoms and would often retest to see if BPPV had returned (and possibly returned to a different inner ear canal, that would be slightly different symptoms). She also reassured me that some people experience residual symptoms for quite some time.  You can do vestibular exercises.....but sadly, the residual stuff some times just takes quite a while to subside.  I would notice subtle changes weekly (not daily). And then have setbacks for no known reason.\n\nMy last episode was in December (over a year ago).  BPPV was active for over two months. I was in therapy doing the Epley and getting vestibular exercises to do as well.  Residual dizziness was horrible for a few months after.  And now - a bit over a year from the initial onset - I am FINALLY feeling almost back to normal.  There are still positions I cannot put my head in without getting mild dizziness.  And my ears still occasionally do funky crackly, whooshing, popping, gurgling things.", "Been diagnosed with BPV then Labyrenthitis then Vestibular Nuritis ... This whole thing started for me about 9 years ago. I have always had weird dizzy spells and felt off balance on top of being photosensitive, but my family doctor told me that it was nothing. About 9 years ago, in the middle of the evening I got so dizzy I lay down and held on to the bed for dear life. A friend was kind enough to drive me the 300 meters to the hospital and I felt like I was not going to make it. When I got to the ER, the triage nurse refused to see me and told me to take a number. So, I let the vertigo take over and fell on her. Got a bed within seconds.\n\nFast forward over a year of tests. The head specialist in Montreal told me that it was a nerve in my left ear that is damaged. He said that I will keep getting vertigo on and off, each bout should be a little lighter than the last. Serc can help with the symptoms, but the only thing that I can really do is force myself. I played racketball through the last few bad bouts, which has been tough because sometimes I fall and sometimes I see the ball go through my racket.\n\nThese last few weeks, my vertigo has been getting bad again. I chalked it up to stress and mayber allergies. I have sleep apnea, and had my septum fixed 3 years ago. Most of the time, vertigo does not feel like vertigo anymore. I get dizzy, but more often I find it hard to look directly at certain things, kind of like it is hard to look at the sun. Also, dealing with a low-grade migraine (hurting, nausea, can still function). Started a new job Monday and they have these awful neon lights everywhere. Well, vertigo feels worse daily, serc is barely helping anymore.\n\nI have had my hearing tested already for Minieres 9 years ago, and it was fine. I have asked my gp to do another test. This last month, I hear fine, but it takes me a few seconds to understand what people are saying. The gf has pointed it out numerous times.\n\nHas anyone else had neons trigger your vertigo?\n\nThanks for listening to my story. Just needed to write something down. I need this job to pay for my rent, and hopefully wedding in a year. And sometimes I worry that I will not have the strength to make it through this.", "Posterior or horizontal BPPV? OKAY. So, I got pushed to the ground a few days ago and hit my head really hard on the ground. I got very dizzy immediately after and felt sort of like my ears had popped. My jaw was very sore for a day. Anyway, the people at the hospital ruled out a concussion and sent me on my way, but I have had the worst vertigo of my life ever since.\n\nI am pretty sure I have BPPV because the vertigo comes on when I move my head fast or lie back in bed, and it is especially bad on the left side. I am waiting for a GP appointment, but I feel so frustrated that I have done some reading on my own (damn you, Google), and learned about the different kinds of BPPV and all the repositioning techniques. I was desperate enough to try out the Epley maneuver at home yesterday. Not sure if I did it wrong or what, but not only was it the worst experience of my life, I felt absolutely drained afterwards -- it did not fix anything. To make matters worse, now I am absolutely terrified of going to the doctor and having them trigger the vertigo.\n\nIs this normal? I read that if you have horizontal BPPV the Epley maneuver might make things worse, but is there another way to know what kind of BPPV you have other than the way your eyes twitch? (Mine did, but I cannot for the life of me remember what way.) Also, too many requests, but I need someone to tell me that this can eventually resolve on its own, and preferably not in, like, seven months. PLEAAASE???? :(\n\n(PS. Not sure if this makes any difference, but I am a relatively healthy 23 year old woman.)", "Can curing BPPV cause other vestibular issues? I had my BPPV fixed with the Epley Maneuver back in December after having it for 1.5 years straight. I had residual dizziness that got better in February, but suddenly in March I felt spinning again one day and did the Epley but nothing happened and for two weeks now, I have residual dizziness again (unless it is vertigo). \n\nI feel things like:\n- Floating or tilting or swaying when slouched in a chair \n- Wooziness turning in bed \n- Slight dizziness turning my head while sitting or standing \n- Worse dizziness after showering \n- Slow movement sitting too quickly \n- Slight dizziness when raising my voice too loud \n- A bouncing/bobbing head at certain angles\n- Sinking feeling sometimes\n- Neck stiffness\n\nCan curing BPPV cause other issues like vestibular neuritis, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, or MdDs? BPPV reoccurrence is high. It is possible you have a different variant of BPPV that the maneuver you learned is not going to effect.\n\nFor example, I have crystals in my lateral canals, and do maneuvers like the ones described on this site:\n\n\n How did the vertigo feel for you with BPPV in your lateral canals? Like what would trigger it? And is it consistent or are some days better than others?\n\nI talked to my PT specialist but she cannot tell if I have it since I cannot see her face to face right now. My biggest trigger was turning over in bed, and while I had it, elevators made me feel really sick too. \n\n\n\nMy ENT PT was able to diagnose it because I decided to film my eyes while turning over in bed because I wanted to see my nystagmus. The way my eyes were involuntarily moving told her what my problem was. \n\n\nI have not had BPPV as severe as when I first got it about 10 years ago (I was a teenager), but I feel I only have to do maneuvers maybe 4-5 times a year. I should do more vestibular exercises though, because my balance and vestibular system is weak.\n\n\nAlso tilting my head to the left or right makes me feel dizzy, so I wonder if I have some cervical triggers. When you turned over in bed, was the room spinning? Because the room does not spin for me. It feels similar to the dizziness I first had after doing the Epley (residual dizziness) and I have it on both sides (I used to have right ear BPPV). \n\nAlso your eyes do the side to side shift movement right? Referring to the video you recorded No, having BPPV does not \u2018cause\u2019 other vestibular issues. However, there seems to be a statistical correlation between developing BPPV and having M\u00e9ni\u00e8res, for example (those ppl are more at risk). \n\nI believe BPPV recurrence rate is smth like 25% in the first 5 years - so could definitely be another bout of BPPV, especially if you did not address the route problem. Sounds like you are having residual dizziness or another BPPV episode.\n\nFor me, residual dizziness lasted for weeks and I still get weird feelings some days.", "Yoga &amp; BPPV? I used to do yoga regularly about a year or so ago, for whatever reason it never tipped off my BPPV too terribly. But, recently I got into practicing &amp; anytime I lay flat on my back my vertigo is HORRIBLE. Tonight it happened &amp; I ended up having to sit up &amp; hang onto my dog (thank goodness for her lol). It also ruins being able to actually enjoy when I do yoga. Does anyone have any suggestions? This does not happen when I lay back in my bed, just flat on the floor.  What is the difference between your bed and the floor? If it happens one place, it should happen the other. I am assuming it could potentially be the pillow, so more than likely the position that my head is in. When I actually sleep I do not really use a pillow but I am a side or stomach sleeper.  You are sure is BPPV? It could be vertigo induced by your cervical spine? I am not 100% positive, but was diagnosed (obviously could be a misdiagnoses) l. It happens anytime I try to look straight up, I completely lose my balance &amp; am unable to see straight &amp; lying down completely flat. Those are probably the two biggest triggers.  After reading up on it though, it does not seem like that is not a possibility. When I went to PT for vertigo/what they thought was BPPV associated I was told I had pretty much zero neck strength &amp; in general have almost always had a lot of muscle ache in that area (when I was younger I had a couple head injuries that very well could have messed with my neck as I never went to PT after any incidents).  I am no doctor or have no formal knowledge over this issues, so take everything with a grain of salt. I just had nasty vertigo episodes for around a year that came and gone without any clear culprit,  just sudden movement of the head. Now i am much better so in a way it went by itself. I still get a few times a year spinning image but it goes in less than one minute. Some docs said it is bppv others menier others cold related or cervical. So all were possible :) for me cervical made the most sense of them all. ", "Question about my experiences so far Last Tuesday morning I had my first BPPV episode. The first few times I did the Epley after seeing my ENT that morning I would get nystagmus when turning my head to the left so I figured that was my affected ear (it is also the side I was on when the episode started). \n\nI have done the Epley maneuver a number of times since then since I still feel pretty unsteady at times and certain head movements make me feel sick so I am unsure if it is resolved or not, although overall I do feel better than I did last week. But I have noticed I do not get nystagmus when doing the first move anymore to either side, but I get it and the vertigo feeling really bad when I do the second to last step before sitting up where you turn onto your side to face the floor with my chin tucked in. I feel like, while facing down, my eyes drift up and snap down over and over for about 20 seconds or so, regardless of what side I am laying on, left or right.\n\nAnyone have any advice or experience with something like this? Did your ENT put those goggles on you so he can see your eyes on a TV screen No they just did the diagnosis test where I laid back and looked to the left and felt intense veritgo then. \n\nI forgot to mention actually, his first diagnosis was that I have vestibular neuritis due to how motion sick/dizzy I was after the episode when I came in to see them that morning. I took the medicines he prescribed to be safe but I am not convinced that is what it is since I have always had some weird inner ear things, turning certain ways in bed makes me a bit dizzy, all that, for well over the last decade and I never really thought anything about it.\n\nI am unconvinced because this episode started when I was on my left side, I got the waves of dizziness, then I turned further left (facing the floor almost) to see my phone and that is when it hit me. Super intense vertigo, eyes could not focus, staggering all over, turned pale and got all sweaty and felt like throwing up. I had same exact problem. They last Epley move made my eyes jump. B-12 Tri-Blend, B-Complex, vitamin C, magnesium\u2026 drink recommended water amount every day\u2026. EXERCISE!!!! \n\nSounds like vestibular neuritis I have it too", "Bppv again? At the end of last year I was experiencing dizziness constantly. I went to my primary, who said it was allergies and congestion in my ears and prescribed me allergy pills. It helped but did not go away, I was referred to an ent, who said it was bppv and referred me to a physical therapy and balance center. After a couple sessions of various maneuvers my dizziness and vertigo still were not going away. They scheduled me for a test. Which revealed that it was bppv but in the anterior canal of my ear (which apparently is rare) my next few sessions revolves around head hangs to move it back. And exercises for me to do by myself to help with my balance. It took awhile but I finally found relief about February/March. However, I noticed today that I just feel really off. I thought nothing of it until I showered and I looked down to put my hair into a turban to dry. I got super dizzy like how I was before. I decided to do my head hangs and exercises. To help like before, but I could not do them because it only made me feel more unbelievably dizzy and like I had vertigo. Once I sat back up after a few seconds I was fine. But I do not know what to do, if it persists. The only relief and remedy I know makes it worst. I had the same experience. My advice is to go to a vestibular specialist, not just a physiotherapist. \nEpley was not helping me (as it does not for people with bppv in the anterior/horizontal canal). You will need a different maneuver like the gufoni or bbq roll (do not try it yourself, you can spread the ear debris around). \n\nI finally corrected the spinning sensation, but it is been months and I still have a residual off balance feeling. I too tried to put my hair up in a towel and fell over. My vestibular therapist said to take it easy and not aggravate it like that for a while. \n\nIf you are still full-on spinning, you will still need to do the maneuvers to remove the debris. I will definitely look into it. Thank you so much. If looking up or down sets it off you possibly have a crystal in the most common canal now and a different maneuver would be needed to fix it. I would contact your balance center again, not sure how yours is but at the one I use if I have another episode within 6 months or so I can go back to them directly without needing a referral or initial \u201cyep it is bppv \u201c appointment.", "Is this cervical vertigo? Neck issues causing \"standing on a boat\" feeling Hello. I have been experiencing what I call \"standing on a boat\" feeling for a few weeks now. It is not full on spinning, but it is like I am constantly unsteady on my feet. If I close my eyes I feel there is a chance I could fall over.\n\nI have a theory it is related to my neck. During this quarantine (I have been quarantined for over 5 weeks now), I have spent a LOT of time in my bed, laying on my back looking at a laptop with my neck slightly arched. Or laying on my side, bending my neck to see the screen. It has pretty much morphed into a pinched nerve in my neck which I am trying to get under control with traction and neck exercises. My apartment is extremely small so there really are not many other places to hang out but my bed.\n\nThe dizziness, however, is still around. Is it possible to have neck-related vertigo? It gets better when I am active (running, walking, etc) and gets worse when I am inactive (sitting, laying in bed, doing dishes, etc). Unfortunately, this quarantine is not super great for my physical health. I was hoping to find answers online as I do not want to risk COVID by going to see a doctor for something I can fix myself right now.\n\nIs this Cervical Vertigo? Will it get better with exercises and time? My neck muscles are probably weakened, I would not be surprised.\n\nThank you! Could be, I had this and was fortunate enough to get assessed just before lockdown. I was given some stretches and strength exercises (very gentle) to do and it seems to have helped. No more boat feeling. \n\n( Thank you! I will check it out Yes - but then again, it would depend what type of cervicogenic dizziness it is. \n\nThis is educational - \n\nAlso this -  It could be. After a car accident I injured my neck and shoulder. The injury caused chronic inflammation and nerve damage which eventually caused my bppv. (I am not sure but I do not have any other reason for why my bppv started besides injury).\n\nAfter treating the bppv, I started trigger point massages and stretches it is helped the neck and shoulder a lot. I can only hope that continuing to help that area it will keep the bppv at bay. Have you figured out a solution to this? I experience a rocking woozy boat feeling too that is much worse when sitting slouched in a chair, especially if the back rest of the chair is curved. Also sitting on a toilet and sometimes when lifting my arms and rotating my shoulders. \n\nThe back of my neck bone also protrudes more than usual lately. It is been over a week for me Dude, are you me!?\n\nI am experiencing the exact same thing.\n\nThe difference is I was doing some sit ups and I kept my neck stiff, I think I strained it or something.\n\nLike you, I also get 100% better when moving around or doing exercises.\n\nI also have to focus harder to concentrate on stuff, but it is a very subjective thing.\n\nIt is getting better every day, but very slowly.\n\nI am not going to get this checked also due to COVID\n\nHow are you doing ? Hey did you get better? Hey, dude, thanks for asking!  \n\n\nWell, not 100% better, but significantly better yes!  \n\n\nThere are days when I mostly do not feel what I described in my post, but comes lunchtime or dinner time, then I feel like that again. But I can concentrate, etc., it is just that there is this weird floating feeling, like my head is out of place.  \n\n\nRight now I am trying to link this to a lack of something. I drank more water than normal yesterday and I noticed I felt a lot better.  \n\n\nI need to get my sleep routine in check too, I have been waking up a lot at night and that is something that never happens to me.  \n\n\nAll in all, it \"looks\" like a thing that will go away on its own, I will just have to endure. Hm. I think I have got the same thing, a sort of \u201con a boat\u201d feeling that came kind of out of nowhere.\n\nAt the beginning it was hard to concentrate but after 2 days I was working again no problem. I saw a doc and my chiropractor and both agree it is cervicogenic vertigo and that I have muscle tension in my neck near c1/c2. Docs gave me anti inflammatories, chiro gave me stretches.\n\nI think that really bad posture is what caused it in my case. So I have been trying to fix that and do the stretches.\n\nOne thing, the chiro had me touch the fleshy part under the base of my skull at the back, and upon doing so I had a sensation like it got worse, momentarily. There was not any pain but it seemed like it provoked more dizzyness. This seemed to make some sense to the chiro. Hmmm, interesting!\n\nIt does seem like the same thing I have... \n\nIN FACT... the days that I put a towel around my neck and kind of \"immobilized\" it, I felt 100% better. No joke. So, yeah, totally posture related.\n\nI tend to slouch a lot all the time, so I am paying attention to this.\n\nI am going to put the towel back again, to see if it speeds up the process. I was using it, I was getting better, then I stopped using it and then it got a lil bit worse.\n\nI just wish I could go to the doctor to get this checked, but I live in Brazil and Covid-19 is wild here, so I am not taking any chances...\n\nI hate to be the one to roleplay \"Dr.Google\", but it does not seem like I have much choice.\n\nIn any case, thank you SO MUCH /u/scottansan for reaching out, because this brings relief to me. Your case sounds a lot like mine, so now I will pay even more attention to my posture and neck mobilization. Great, would be good to keep in touch. PM me if you like. \n\nWhat Is the towel thing, exactly? Sure! Healing or not, I will PM you. \nFeel free to do the same.\n\nIf we can do it here, I think it would even be better, I mean, I found this post searching Google about what I was feeling.\n\nMaybe it will help some lurkers reading it also.\n\nAbout the towel, it is like an improvised neck brace. Check this out. Interesting, i might try that as I think my neck needs a break from supporting my head...\n\nKind of a shower thought, these sensations make a strange kind of sense, because if you imagine you were in a boat going gently back and forth, your head would be rocking a little bit and these muscles would be keeping it straight. So, I guess the idea is the brain uses that as feedback to know what the position of the head is in relation to the body. OMG !!!\n\nI have the same exact thing, it seems that this Quarantine thing did not went well on some people.\n\nI did not want to go to hospital with the current situation with COVID 19 but after one month exactly 2 weeks ago I went to the hospital and made blood test and and got my ear checked and everything seems normal , the doctor says this could be a Psychological thing and he might give me something to make me calm down.\n\nFor me I think my dizziness is related to my stiff neck because it started at the same time \n\n\nI just want to tell you that you are not alone , and when I find something working for me I will let you know. And please update us about your condition \n\nSorry for my bad English Hey same thing here except mine started back in January on the 26th around January 18thish I start getting neck pain then a week after that i began getting the dizziness/lightheaded feeling went to the ER they said it was anxiety still trying to figure out what it is but Covid had different plans. I had a brain CT and so far 3 ECGs and 2 blood tests all normal. I think its got to be my neck but also I am open to the idea that it might be psychogenic dizziness since I am pretty sure I have some form of health anxiety undiagnosed. Hi,\n\nYour case is exactly like mine , did you got any better? Please update about your condition as your symptoms exactly like mine , please update Improved slightly, some days it is 95% imperceptible, others it is clearly there. Doctors just offered muscle relaxants. Chiropractor is quite sure she knows what it is and wishes she could get in there and make an adjustment but lockdown etc. Seems to be an issue at c1/c2. Thanks a lot for your reply,  this damn lock down is so annoying,  in my country its 24 hours lockdown for the upcoming 5 days . Chiropractors refused to have anybody for the past 3 months as this COVID 19 is spreading like hell in my country . my neck is so stiff even with doing excercises from Youtube,Would you please share the exercises you are doing right now?? None really! Maybe /u/throwaway14481720 has some update? Hi Scott, just read your messages!\n\nLike you guys said and as I had mentioned previously , I am not going to any doctors due to covid-19 and in my house an elderly person live so, I will postpone appointments until other symptoms appear.\n\n\nAs I said, I had this ongoing dizziness, a weird feeling of extra corporealness and mental lag at the first weeks, but it has now subsided. It is a huge relief.\n\nWhat remains is a very very very small dizziness that happens if I move my head too fast. Yesterday I was playing with the cats and I kept crouching several times to catch the toys. That made me a tiny wee bit nauseous .\n\nRegardless, now I am mostly sure it is a muscular thing like the other user reports above me. This week I decided to not do any kind of exercise and my symptoms improved greatly. So, muscular maybe? Thanks for tagging me bro and im glad that you are feeling better now.\n\nWould you please share what have you been doing exactly that made you feel better.\n\nMuch appreciated if you go into details so me and other people can benfit from you , Dizziness is too damn scary. &gt; Dizziness is too damn scary. \n\nIt is :/ . If anything, in my case I thought I would live with this hell forever, and now I can clearly see there is improvement everyday, but it is in very small increments.  \n\n\n&gt; Would you please share what have you been doing exactly that made you feel better. \n\nWell, since it is not something objective in the sense that I cannot put my hands on it or tell where/why it is coming from, what I have been doing is just keeping my body and mind at 100%, doing stuff like:\n\n* Making sure I sleep 8 hours per day and go to sleep and wake up at the same time, every day;\n* Drink enough water;\n* Eat well;\n* Avoid alcohol, cigarretes, sugar, the usual;\n\nHighly unlikely these things are curing me, but they are helping my anxiety levels lower, as I have noted that the more anxious I am, the more I pay attention to this condition and get nervous, and that does not help at all.  \n\n\nI was exercising before but, as I said, I noticed it was screwing me up, specially squats and ab work.  \n\n\nActually, I do not know if I posted here previously, but I am PRETTY SURE this whole dizizziness thing started for me when I was doing 100 sit-ups with wrong form, forcing my neck a lot. I started feeling a \"cold sweat\" around my head and I kept pushing through. And here I am now.  \n\n\nMy neck does not hurt, but I feel it is weird and very stiff. The more I give time for it to relax and heal, the more I feel better.  \n\n\nGo up some posts on this thread and you will see a towel technique I did on my neck to immobilize it. I do not know if it will work for you, but for me it provided a huge relief. I noticed the more I restrain my neck movements, the more the dizziness goes away.  \n\n\nWell, hope that helps! I am rooting for your recovery Thank you so much , your respond gave me hope and some relief,  I feel the exact same thing when I do not get enough sleep ,not eating well , headche  and bad mood all increase  dizziness . Surprisingly though when I drive and focus on the road the dizziness goes away I do not know why, maybe bc my neck is straight or something also when I shave my beard.\n\nI will try the towel and keep monitoring my neck position during the whole day , when I find something working for me I will let you know for sure.\n\nThanx again and I hope you feel better and better. Hm, if it happens when you move your head are you sure it is not benign paroxysmal vertigo? With origin in the ear canal. If so, youd be in luck because it is easy to diagnose and treat. Hey, Scott.\n\nHmm, I do not know really. There are days which I am more affected by head movement, and days that I am not.\n\nIf it is BPPV, I heard it goes away on its own, but it might take a long while Hello! \n\nI have been quarantined as well and now work from home. Before quarantine I was active but my activities have lessened and I tend to work on my computer for long hours or play video games while laying down with my neck elevated. I now have been feeling dizziness symptoms from the upper neck area going into my head, It feels like spasms. Have you found any relief? This has been happening for about 4 days now and I have been worried. Best thing I can tell you is to get up and get moving. It worked for me. Whenever I lay down and arch my neck playing a game or messing around on my phone, it gets worse. I got a standing desk, I go outside and run a short ways twice a day between meetings, and I try not to lay down until I am ready to sleep. I feel much better now. You would be surprised how much time you spend sitting/laying around. But if you knew it would not be surprising how your balance got messed up. Yay quarantine! I have the same problem. When I did stretches for my neck. I felt some relief but for some reason it also made me feel even more lightheaded? I tried taking \nIbruproven but this what feels like a fogginess over my brain has not gone away. I been doing stretches everyday but it has not improved. Perhaps the constant stretches I been doing to my neck has made it worse? Someone please help what should I do? try sleeping only on your back with a tempurpedic neck pillow. that helped me the most. also, stay active and stay standing. it is all about posture. omg cannot believe i find this.. i also have boat felling and if stand up and close my eyes feel i going to fall or something..but some days are better than others, i am also allot anxious and this quarantine is not helping at all.. I have been like this for 6 months and my chriopractor is sure it is my neck. Im so nervous and anxious. It is such a scary and uncomfortable feeling. Are you better!?If yes, what helped ? I have had this for 13 months now. It sucks haha.  Mine also comes with a left ear that feels \"full\", but def is not full. So it is like: left side of neck + left ear = imbalance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only thing that has SUBSTANTIALLY helped is this specific type of chiropractor called an \"upper cervical chiropractor\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou all should try one and lmk if it helps. I have the same thing. Started after end of quarantine. I mostly feel it, when behind a computer. It is exactly as the feeling of being on a boat. Also mornings and evenings sometime. Balance in general is ok. I do not fall or  anything. Also can stand on one leg,... Just a strange feeling which makes you very anxious. \n\nAlso pinch necked, and mostly neck pain and a little headache. It started mostly with this. Sometimes also sinus like pain/pressure in face. \n\nAnd sometimes pressure feeling when standing up from bad posture position. For me also better, when I support my head. With the hand or something. You feeling better? I have not been able to decide what is wrong with me but I am starting to think neck muscles from being tense with stress, poor neck posture on my phone all day, weak middle back so my traps are compensating for posture, etc. I have been using heat and stretches daily and the pain is definitely getting better but this already happened for 2 weeks, 1.5 weeks totally better, and now 2 weeks again and still going. How are you doing now? Been dealing with all of this for like 5 or 6 weeks. All started after I was sick and laying around all day and staring down at my phone for hours on end. Hi,\n\nNot so much improvement , The more pain on my neck more dizziness present . At least im now  certain that my neck is causing my symptoms, x ray shows everything normal trying to get CT scan but this damn COVD19 is not helping to do it. Most hospitals in my area refuse to do CT scanning and MRI due to the pendmic.I went to a chiropractor and he said that I have a very stiff neck and upper back that causing all of my symptoms after 4 sessions with him I did not improve , Now im with another chiropractor and he is saying the same thing plus that i might have arthritis on my upper spine, I will start the treatment next week on Sunday .\n\nWhat worked for me so far is moving around and doing stuff , when I spent too much time on my phone or PC I get worse.\n\nI took some anti-vertigo drugs and it did nothing to me. Sounds like we are having a very similar if not the same problem. Does your muscle pain come on right at the base of your skull? Those muscles there are the sub occipital muscles and I feel like mine got tweaked from hours of sitting looking at my phone in my lap and now I have to sit at a computer at work. It gives me slight disequilibrium at random times but is definitely worse when the muscles are more \"fatigued\" \"tight\" whatever you want to call it. Heat was helping for me but I stopped using heat and sat on my phone one slow day at work and it got just as bad as ever. Getting up and moving helps as you said, it is super frustrating to not know if I need to stretch the muscles, exercise the muscles, rest the muscles, or what. Pretty much my only symptoms are disequilibrium, neck pain at the base of the skull, and sometimes some slight forehead numbness. Never horrible numbness but it is there in the surface. Like when your face gets cold.\n\nI will keep you updated if anything helps me. It is just nice to know you are not alone! disequilibrium yup this is exactly what I have.\n\nWhat is not panicking me is that I have been like this since March and the neck pain presence with the disequilibrium so it is neck related and it is muscles issue that can be treated with excersices and stretches but might take some time .Also I never felt down or something and currently I go to work everyday and im fine with that.\n\nOne other thing to mention is that the pain is at the right side of my neck down to the trapezius muscle and behind my neck under the skull like yours when I press on certain areas.\n\nStay positive and put in mind that this is a minor thing that can be easily treated with some excersices and keeping a good posture all the time.\n\nI wish you a speedy recovery and thanks for reaching out. You too man. I will be off work indefinitely soon to move across the country to a place where I will have way more opportunity to get out and hike/exercise so I will let you know if the lack of being at a computer or on my phone helps. Like someone else here said months ago, its almost like my head needs a break from holding one damn position all day Regarding your question for stretching or relaxing the muscle I just remembered that my Second dizziness attack came after the second session with the chiropractor before that I was like 60% better , and I was not doing any excersices that time. Yesterday I did  stretching for the sub occipital muscle from Youtube and after that I felt extremely dizzy for like a 30 minutes I was so scared , I think this is exactly what causing my dizziness .\nfrom now on I will be focusing on the trapezius muscle only no more streches to the neck and will see what happens as the the trapezius muscle is the main source of the problem with the poor posture once it is fixed other muscles should follow as chiropractors say.\n\nSome time I think of taking some muscle relaxants but I hate medicines so much. I would just try your best to not lean your head forward as much as you can. I have been seriously limiting phone use for 3 days now and my muscles are feeling much better in my neck as well as some of the dizziness. I am not physical therapist, but I have also been actively focusing on if I am lifting my shoulders keeping my traps tight or not. I started doing rowing exercises with bands as well to strengthen my back to take some load off my traps from holding posture. Will report back if things keep getting better. \n\nThanks for updating! How did it go? I seem to have developed the same issue from lack of physical exercise and starting hard on guitar... How is it going there? Seem to have developed the same from starting hard on guitar... I have the same sh*t from 8 months now. This diziness start at the same time with yours.

Hey,\nI think mine is related to anxiety ..I have been dizzy for 2 years now I have tried so many stuff Chiropractors, herbs, physical therapy, Medicines and vitamins but they did not work ..The last visit to my doctor he said if you have dizziness for long time and did not faint or fall it is most likely related to anxiety.\n\nI have read through the internet some articles stating that anxiety can effect your muscles especially neck muscles (which I have)that could effect jaw ,ear ,eyes ,headche , memory issues and of course dizziness.", "ANYONE GET SEVERE HORIZONTAL NYSTAGMUS ATTACKS? Hey guys, I have a question to anyone that can help. I was diagnosed with BPPV Last year but I am still not convinced. Could be labrynthitus or M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s, I am not sure.\n\nMy question is this: does anyone experience Severe Horizontal Nystagmus? My attacks have gone from severe vertigo and off balance etc to just severe Nystagmus. \n\nIf anyone here can help or provide some information. I am awaiting my VNG test. I also have profound hearing loss in one ear and astigmatism.\n\nI do not think I want to live with this anymore and I am contemplating suicide as an actual option. I am so sorry you are dealing with this. Personally I did not deal with random nystagmus attacks that were not associated with vertigo.\n\nHave you seen a physical therapist, have you ever been cleared of BPPV? As I understand it, BPPV tends to be a temporary disorder (though it can of course re-occur). Are you saying it is just constantly problematic for you?\n\nI know this is probably not helpful to you, but I have recently shared a post, compiled with things I learned from my ENT and physical therapist regarding BPPV. It is ( in case it might help you.\n\nThe most valuable thing I learned from my ENT, is that with BPPV, attacks can be brought on by excessive intakes of sodium, as well as caffeine and nicotine. These can bloat the ear canals, according to my ENT, which can cause the calcium crystals (otoconia) to come lose and travel through the canals and cause the vestibular disturbances that we know as bppv. Personally I have eliminated these entirely from my diet (i cut all caffeine, and maintain the same sodium level day to day) and have not dealt with this since. I am not sure if this is in any way relevant to you, but want to share it just in case it might be. I know for example, the night following my largest BPPV attack, I ate a whole bunch of crap high-sodium food like a frozen pizza. I have literally no idea if this could be going on with you, and I am sure there is other things that probably cause BPPV, i am not a doctor so I just do not know. But just in case, i am sharing this info to you, as no one told me before i met my ENT and i had no clue before that.\n\nI wish I had better things to tell you. But I really want to just give you my hope and support. Keep pursuing things, and if you are not satisfied with your specialist, see another one. I was really lucky that I found an ENT who not only specialists in dizziness, but has dealt with BPPV many times in his life. He had so much knowledge. Does your ENT have experience with dizziness issues specifically? I think a good ENT can make all the difference. SImilarly, there are some physical therapists who are trained specifically with balance disorders and have a lot of experience with BPPV. Then there are some who really do not know much about it and have only the most basic training.\n\nI understand the contemplation of suicide. BUt i want to say that things god better for me. Keep trying my friend. And do not accept things until you get good answers from your doctor. I know it sucks right now, but i believe it is going to get better for you. and when it gets better you will be so happy you stuck it out. your life is worth it. Two PT has cleared me of BPPV. Only reason I am here is because it is the largest sub of individuals looking for answers.. Seen 1 ENT and she was useless. Saw a neurologist and without any testing apart from one Epley attempt- he said it is probably BPPV. And this was after the PT had cleared me of it and says it is something else. \n\nI am working with a new vestibular physio who has put me in the waiting list to have my VNG OR VEMP (balance test) testing done. On another wait list to see a different ENT too. \n\nI have profound deafness in one ear-yet a PT said I am having hyper function in the right ear- ( this as you can imagine has had a profound psychological effect on me) like I do not know which ear is the problem now. I fear going deaf in both ears. \n\nI have been getting severe nystagmus where when I close my eyes I can feel it beating from side to side. Was told it beats away from the bad ear-or beats toward the good ear. It is beating toward my deaf ear that I cannot hear out of and is constant tinnitus. \n\nHad MRI of brain and its clear of cochlear tumour etc . \n\n\nI also had an sudden attack that seemed to go thru my left deaf ear and the vertigo was so sudden and so severe, everything went blank and I  I fell to the bed and would have fallen had I been standing -so I am not sure if that was Bppv attack either. Not sure if everything went black or I just closed my eyes from the severity. \n\n\nHave not worked in 6 months. Lost my gf in January Cos I was not seeing her enough. I rarely leave the house now. \nI am the kind of guy who can always solve a problem-but I cannot solve this one and its made me obsessed.\n\nEdit: thanks for replying anyways Check out some of Joey remenyi YouTube videos.  She is wonderful and even has a great book called rock steady that can help support you through this.  I have heard of people with nystagmus like yours and I believe they use habitation exercises like optimistic and optodrum to help.  You can find samples of those on YouTube as well, although I am not sure how to instruct you to use them.  It is scary, but you need to be gentle to yourself and patient.  Your brain is trying to correct itself and it is going to take some time.  You will get through this and go on to a normal life. I am so sorry for what you are going through. Please hold out hope for seeing the new specialists. when this first started happenign to me, no one knew what was going on. I saw many providers who, though i am sure they were great in their own specialization areas, just did nothing for me. A good ENT and a good physio who specialists in vestibular stuff can work wonders.\n\nWhat did the ENT say about your ear? Are you saying this started when the BPPV started? Have you seen an audiologist?\n\nKeep searching, the answers are there. It is just a matter of finding them. I went through a similar search with respiratory issues. I ended up so randomly finding the answer, it was nothing what I would expected and it changed my life. i had so little hope before i found answers. keep searching.\n\n&gt;I have been getting severe nystagmus where when I close my eyes I can feel it beating from side to side. Was told it beats away from the bad ear-or beats toward the good ear. It is beating toward my deaf ear that I cannot hear out of and is constant tinnitus. \n\nAre you in the USA by the way? What state are you in? I think a good ENT is going to be paramount for you. Have you managed to get on short term disability? It sounds like you should qualify.\n\nP.S. If your gf left you because you were not seeing her enough despite all this going on, I hate to say it but it sounds like you dodged a bullet. Hi u/StopStalkingMeBitch1,\n\nI just found a report about this post in my mod queue. Are you doing OK? Feel free to message me privately if need be. We are here to support you!\n\nLet me know.", "Hi there I am new! I was diagnosed with bppv only a few days ago but I have had it for about 10 years on and off. I will appreciate it a lot of you take the time to read this and respond!\n\nSo I get attacks from time to time. Luckily they do not last too long and with some head movements of YouTube I fix it and until next time. Is absolutely sucks, lost times of I am alone I have to pee in a basin next to me cause I cannot get out of bed I hate it. However I recently found out that stress can make it sooo much worse since the rise of pressure in the head can trigger it. And that is just great since I have panic attacks quite often and they trigger it pretty badly. \nA question I have it this- apart from the \u201cnormal\u201d vertigo attack I also get very mild ones sometimes. It feels as if I am swaying it tilting to one side but it just lasts a second and I do not think it is always triggered by movement. And it goes on for a while. It is so mild but enough to cause me to get annoyed and anxious cause of it hence actually giving myself vertigo. So is it possible to get mild vertigo? Bppv can cause a lot of residual dizziness.  So yes.  Do you have a good ENT?   Also vestibular therapy is a must for multiple attacks.  It helps quite a bit in habituating your brain.   The key is to keep moving. Yes I went to both an ent and a neurologist and they said it is nothing to worry about but I did not not have vertigo during the examination so they cannot really say much. Scheduled an mri for next month just to make sure everything is okay. Mine had almost gone away but then I went through a stressful even and they started again :/ but thank you so much for your comment Physical therapy has helped me a lot.  Can you do that? I can but I am not sure how it works since I do not have it all the time. I get it like once or twice a month maybe... so do I do it only when I have the attack? No.  A good vestibular therapist will give you homework.  I do about 10-15 minutes a day.  I go about once a month and they test my progress and then add more stuff to do.  The theory, according to my therapist, is that it trains your brain to accept the dizziness as normal and you will not be dizzy (or something like that).  She also says it reduces severity and duration of future episodes.  I love it.  It gives me a sense of confidence that I am helping myself as opposed to just sitting around waiting for it to go away. I finished mopping the floor, and like clockwork I am now mildly dizzy as I type this. I am used to it since I got my first attack 3 years ago. I do not let my BPPV get in the way of my life. So now I am resting on a chair, keeping my head straight and waiting for it to subside. It usually takes just 5-10 minutes, then I am on to the next task.\n\nSame, YouTube videos on various Epley manuevers help a lot. Also keeping a healthy lifestyle :) I agree! My ENT gave me the same homework. VRT in the mornings, and reminding myself that I can train my brain to get used to the dizziness. :) Thank you for the advice! I will try that!", "What kind of vertigo is this?

I woke up one morning and turned my head to the left and everything started spinning. It scared me to death cause I did not know what was happening and I had to run to the washroom to throw up, tumbling along the way.\n\nMy parents took me to the ER and sounds like it is common based on other threads but the doctors do not really know what to do with it. They just told me to go home and rest, and it took about a week for it to go away. At that time, I did not know anything about it - whether it was head movement related or ear related, or even which side it was.\n\nAbout a year later, it happened again. This time I noticed I can lie down on my left side but not on my right side. Tried to do a manuever I found - did not work and was just throwing up so I stopped. Took about 4 days for it to go away.\n\nTwo months ago, I had my third episode - always in the same way (moving my head after I wake up). Again, I waited it out. Now I can definitely better manage it. I cannot look up too high (like when you are trying to get the last drop of water in a cup), looking down is alright, cannot lie on my right side and I need more pillows to prop my head higher. \n\nOne week later, I got it again. This was a first back-to-back episode for me so I decided to go see a specialist. I went to see a physiotherapist that specialized in BPPV. She used an eye camera to monitor my eye movements and they were moving horizontally, so she decided the BBQ Roll was best for me. \n\nHere is the part that I do not find in a lot of threads. How the heck do you guys do these manuevers? The anxiety it gives me in anticipating the dizziness to come, the nausea, the feeling of vomitting and really vomitting... I honestly cannot handle it. It is not anything I would describe as painful but just feeling like absolute sh*t. Everyone is threads just casually go over how the manuevers helped them but I am struggling to even doing it. The specialist wanted me to do it a second time and I said I literally cannot and we stopped. My brother had to pick me up because I was feeling God awful and since then, I still have it (2 months now).\n\nIt gets better, like I am able to very slowly lie down on my right side, but then I do the wrong movement and it comes back. Right now it is a bit better, but I have this constant physical feeling in my head that I cannot describe where at any moment, if I make a certain head move, the vertigo will come back. I can do most day-to-day to tasks but I have better and worse days and it is not going away. Today, I am feeling extra dizzy.\n\nDo I really have to do the manuever this time to make it fully go away? How was it for you? How do you manage to do the manuevers?\n\nThanks everyone.\n\nTLDR; Got BPPV about once a year lasting &lt;1 week but this fourth time it has not gone away for 2 months now. Cannot do the manuevers because of fear. Hey! I feel the same way about the maneuvers. When I had a month-long bout in April, it was during the height of Covid lockdown, so I tried to self treat at home with the Epley. It would make me feel absolutely horrible. I started doing it right before bed so I could just try to sleep off the awfulness. Eventually I saw a therapist a couple times and it went away. \n\nI got a second case that was milder and cleared up with one home Epley that did not make me sick.\n\nSo basically, my thoughts are- you may have a bad case. Could be a clump of crystals (this is what my therapist thought I had) that is reallllyy awful when aggravated, and more stubborn to go back. \n\nWas your therapist open to you going back? I would highly recommend doing the maneuvers with them as much as possible, since they can usually tell by your eyes if it is working or not. That way you are not just making yourself repeatedly miserable for no reason. If you want to do them at home- I would suggest just doing them as many times as you can handle before going to bed, so you at least do not have to move around or try to focus on anything. \n\nBest of luck to you! I hope it clears up soon! I have repeated over &amp; over in my posts how anxious doing the Epley made me &amp; often remind people that it has to provoke the symptoms in order to get the crystal moved around the ear canal. With my last (fourth) episode I sought a good therapist. I had active bppv for over two months &amp; this included doing the Epley over 20 times. It was always twice during my weekly appointment &amp; then twice midway through the week on my own. The anxiety it created before doing it was unreal. The sickness it caused was horrible. My therapist was a godsend in easing my anxiety. Also... Zofran before the Epley (anti - nausea) and towards the end I even had to take an Ativan to ease the anxiety before. It is not fun. After doing the Epley.... I usually was worthless the rest of the day.\n\nIt is been almost a year since bppv hit this last time. The residual dizziness was horrible &amp; lasted for months. I still have anxiety about it coming back. I am hoping this time since I know for a fact it resolved &amp; that I know so much more about it.... That it will stay away for a bit longer. Honestly, having a good therapist that actually has had bppv &amp; anxiety.... Has helped so much. And finding this sub to share stories &amp; know you are not alone is helpful. Thank you for your reply!\n\nOof, lumps sound awful! I am glad the manuevers worked out for you.\n\nYes, she told me to come back but it was so bad I did not go back and I told her honestly I do not think I can do it. And now that I know which specific manuever I have to do, worst comes to worst, I settled for doing it at home. I am feeling much better today, so I have almost settled for just waiting it out :( Thank you so much for your reply.\n\nYes, it does sound more and more like it is something I need to face and I am sure having the right therapist who can really support me with the anxiety will make a difference. I had seen this therapist while I was visiting my brother in a different province so I will have to continue my search for a new one.\n\nHope it never comes back for you! Thank you so much for your reply!\n\nOof, lumps sound awful!\n\nI am glad the manuevers worked out for you. My therapist recommended me to come back but at the time I was honest with her and said I probably will not because I honestly cannot do these manuevers. She was understanding. I think I have almost settled for waiting it out, because it works, even if it lasts a bit longer and there is a chance it comes back. Like for example, I feel much better today than yesterday. \n\nIf it does come back, I know eventually I will have to face the manuevers. I hope it never comes back for you too!", "First PT visit tomorrow. Tips? Hey you all, been dealing with persistent nausea, dizziness and fatigue for about 4 months now. I am not 100% sure it is bppv but my mom thinks it is pretty likely since she and my grandfather both had it as well. I finally got an appointment with a physical therapist tomorrow to hopefully get help. Any tips for things I should look out for, or ask the physical therapist about? How should I expect to feel after? I know for some people physical therapy can be a nearly-instant cure. Fingers crossed for that 'instant' cure! I hope it goes well for you. If you are seeing a qualified dizzy specialist, expect them to do many different tests to determine first if it is a form of BPPV. There are 6 different ear canals that can be effected.  There are also other dizzy conditions it could be. Likely they will put goggles on you to help watch your eye movement.  If you have nystagmus, the direction your eyes twitch help them determine which ear canal is the problem. You will likely be given some exercises to do as well, to help your body cope. I typically felt horrible every time I left, as doing the testing and for ME - it was the Epley that needed to be done to relocate the crystals - provokes the severe vertigo.  But if you have a different form of dizziness, your experience may be very different.\n\nI hope you get some answers and are feeling better soon! Write down as much as you can about what triggers your issues. For me it is when I turn to the right and when I move my head down. Up and to the left are fine.\n\nBring a notebook so you can make notes on what exercises they recommend, etc.", "Vertigo attacks the day after I drink coffee or cigarette. Doctor said BBPV but For some reason I get vertigo attacks the day after I drink coffee or smoke cigarettes. I had coffee yesterday and a cigarette the night before at a bar and today I get 3 vertigo attacks. \n\nI saw a doctor before but he said it was BPPV but he tested it by moving my head and moving down and I did not have any change in vertigo. I cut out caffeine and cigarettes for a year and did not have any attacks but now I do. Is this common with BPPV or there something else I should go see my doctor again. Sorry to hear that. Sounds like you may just have a sensitivity to Caffeine and nicotine. \n\nIf It were me, I would just avoid them both since they do not agree with my body. Could be vestibular migraines triggered by caffeine / cigarettes- you sometimes do not even need the headache to be classed as this (they can be silent) Do you get any nausea, light or sound sensitivity with the attacks??

He told me that I should get an MRI to rule out anything  and he wanted to do a VNG. I had the VNG done last week and my ENT called me and told me that the results were normal. He said I should still get an MRI done though and that is scaring me. What could the MRI tell me? \n\nI was not worried originally because I have not been dizzy the past few weeks but after he told me get the MRI I kind of started worrying that the cause of my dizziness a few months ago could be worse. \n\nDo you guys know what an MRI could tell me? Anything that we could say would just worry you more. There are quite a few neurological problems that could cause dizziness but more often then not it is something less servere. Is your dizziness positional? When I had bppv my vng was normal as well but then a year later it after a second one it revealed 31% weakness and then I was diagnosed with Meniere's. Do you get vertigo? Or just dizzy? MRI is standard to rule out tumors or even SCD or a fistula Tbh I have not been getting it much the past few weeks. But I think it is positional cause if I do get it it is usually when I lay down on my back sometimes. Also it is just dizzy. Not like complete vertigo Hmm. There are some people who just get dizzy but most get full on vertigo. That MRI might reveal more. I am not a doctor but I would think if it was something very worrisome that you would be having more symptoms than just being dizzy. Yeah since it is nothing else and I have not been dizzy in weeks I am hoping it is nothing bad. MRI just scares me cause the first thing that comes to my mind with an MRI is a brain tumor or something super bad like that. \n\nThanks for your help\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd Omg okay my situation is very similar to this with going to the doctors in order and being diagnosed with BPPV, but my ent thought it was something else since it is more like vertigo and it lingers on for weeks, I got an eng and an mri done and I should get my results back next week! Basically my ent said that the eng rules out anything from your ears that causes dizziness or the mri ruling out anything from your brain that causes dizziness! Relax, very unlikely anything. The MRI experience can be stressing though. No problem. Keep your head up. Let us know how it goes.", "How to distinguish residual dizziness from vertigo? I have done the epley maneuver twice now and have residual dizziness where it feels like I am on a boat when I walk or make turns or move my head (comes and goes), but how do I know the epley was actually successful? \n\nI feel slight dizziness when I tilt my head to look down or tilt it up or when I get up from bed or lie down but how can I tell if it is residual dizziness that will go away eventually or if I still have vertigo because the epley was unsuccessful? Only way to know is to go to a specialist - they ll perform a videonystagmography with special googles. Residual dizziness is common even with successful reposition procedures so no way to tell without the VNG Is the dizziness a lot milder than it was when the BPPV bout started? If so I would suggest it is just residual. I have had two bad bouts of BPPV and in both cases I experienced residual dizziness following the Epley. How long did your residual dizziness last? It is better than right after I did the Epley.\n\nBut I am also not sure if my BPPV is gone because sometimes when I tilt my head up or down, or when I am sleeping and turn my head, I can feel a bit of dizziness (but not spinning)", "Is being slightly dizzy when doing anything the new normal?

Ever since, I get slightly dizzy when doing anything.\n\nI have to choose which task I want to complete and be prepared to lay down for about 15-30min after.\n\nDoctor gave me meclizine which seems to help but makes me drowsy.\n\nIs this the new normal or does recovery take longer than two weeks? It can take longer than 2 weeks.  Also the med you are taking will slow down your recovery because it is a vestibular suppressant.  You want your brain to get adjusted to your new normal so be kind to yourself and do not push too hard.  I have had episodes that have resulted in 3 months of general dizziness after.  Check out Joey remenyi on YouTube for some great advice.  You will feel better, just be gentle to yourself! That is good. As long as it gets better! I have only taken the meds once so far, so that is good to know. I will try to stay away from it.\n\nI will look them up! Thank you.\ud83d\ude0a  I had some residual dizziness for a few weeks to a month after it went away. Had one dizzy episode that lasted for a minute or so and was gone. A year later nothing hello I am also experiencing similar symptoms as you and I was wondering what are your dizziness like? I feel a little dizzy when I change my posture but it is not that several, I feel pressure on my head and my body is unsteady. Also, are you still doing eply manuver atm? I feel dizzy when I move my head to quickly and mainly in the mornings. If I do too much activity (cleaning dishes/house, light workout,etc.) I have to lay down the help the dizziness and am usually tired after I recover. It is not severe but I get tired after the dizzy spell goes away.\n\nI do not have any pressure in the head and I feel a little unsteady but not like I am about to topple over. Not doing any maneuvers.", "How long are the After effects of bppv? I am 28 and got bppv (I think) first time a week ago last Thursday where I was felt dizzy unbalanced and and could not focus on any work or anything. Went to urgent care Saturday and got mexlazine which did not help much so only took it for a day. Went to enr on Monday after still felling loopy when I move my head and feeling unbalanced  and they did the dicks test but could not detect bppv and said maybe it went away or the mexlazine is masking it. They said it will go away on its own and you cannot do much. I did not feel anything from the dicks test and try to do it at home and sometimes I feel a little something but not like first day. \n\nIts Thursday now (a week from first day) and I still feel a little unbalanced and a little off and when I move my head left and right feel a little off some hours more than others. Tried to Epley maneuver a few times yesterday  but did not feel anything or head spinning specially the side of the ear it was happening from so not sure if it went away?\n\nIs what I am feeling after effects  of bppv? how long do they last for? and are these after effects normal? It looks like the Dix test is the same as the first position of Epley, right? I am surprised they told you not much can be done. You can test to see if it moved to the horizontal canal, as shown here. \n\nI am currently dealing with what I think is after effects myself, I have not had any actual vertigo in more than a week but I feel off balance and a bit motion sick sometimes. From what I have read it is not uncommon and usually lasts about 10-20 days. Ya dicks tests is the same as the thr first move for epley. And i do not feel it in my other ear when I do the Epley so it does not seem to have moved.\n\nI feel the off balance my self but head dosnt spin like during vertigo but my head does feel when you are tipsy or drunk or high as it feels like when I move my head anywhere it has a delay and is just off.  It gets worse some times and days than others. \n\nThanks for the info on 10 to 20 days. It is been a week but waiting for it to be gone completely The other test I linked is for if it moved to a different canal (happened to me), but if you are not getting the spinning at all anymore it sounds like you are having residual, which is what I think I have too at this point. I just want to feel normal again! Hope we both get better soon! I mean I do get spinning but it is minimal? I see several tests on there which one is it to test? And does the test resolve it as well? The test they had me do at the Dizzy Clinic was to lie back flat and turn my head all the way towards the bad ear side. It took a bit of time for the spinning to start with me but it is different for everyone. If there is not any spinning doing that then it probably not in the horizontal canal and you would stick with doing the Epley or Dix. If you DO get spinning with that then you can try to resolve it with one of the maneuvers in the link, the Barbecue roll did not help me so they had me do the...cannot think of the name offhand, it starts with a G. Basically sitting at the end of my bed, lay down on my left side (crystal was in my RIGHT canal), support head so it is aligned straight with your body, hold for 2 minutes, do not start counting the time until after the spinning stops. Then turn your head down about 90 degrees so you are looking towards the floor, if you get the spinning hold for 2 minutes. Then sit up while keeping your head turned. \n\nThis will only work if the crystal problem is in the horizontal canal, Epley works for the posterior canal. Honestly if you are still having vertigo your best bet might be to try to find a doctor(ENT) or physical therapist who has experience with BPPV, there are quite a few variables. Thanks! I willl try this out! Yaa I went to an ent this week and it was not helpful maybe I can try another. Have you tried Ginkgo Biloba capsules on amazon? I am hearing from people online it helps with it ? I just ordered and got some today so going to try and see. I have not tried those, let me know if they help! I know this is not going to make you feel any better, but I am 26 and had something similar to BPPV incident nearly 5 months ago at this point. I still do not feel like a normal human and I am beginning to think I never will be the same.\n\nAfter about 15 different types of doctors the closest thing I could get to a diagnosis was Vestibular Neuritis, which basically cannot be treated. Somehow all this incident completely changed my chemical balances and stuff and now I am an anxious mess all the time. I have never had anxiety in my life and previously was very confident and confrontational. Now I get sick leaving for work in the morning.\n\nI do not know if this is a permanent thing or not, but if your situation is anything like mine just be prepared for a potentially rough ride. Had this too. Mine started in august 2016 and still to this day I feel the effects of it and suffer. Not a fun thing to have at all. Did you do the Epley technique ?? Oh gosh ME TOO!\n\nI feel like I have been more sick ever since. I am 27 and got my first episode last September. Took 2 months to feel normal again but I still occasionally do not feel right and have this overwhelming fear of it happening again bc that was an AWFUL experience. So now, I feel like the stress from not only all the stuff that triggered the bppv but the stress FROM the bppv I swear my immune system is all messed up. I have caught every dang thing that is going around. \ud83d\ude16\ud83d\ude12 This fucking terrifies me. I am so sorry. No, because I still do not know if it was BPPV per se. I had an incident in 2015 that was almost definitely BPPV because i had horrible nystagmus that led to me vomiting for almost 12 hours straight. I spent 2 days in the ER. However after I left the hospital I was symptom free after only a week and 100% back to normal, playing sports and partying/drinking like I normally did (I was in college).   \n\n\nMy recent incident was less intense when it occurred by orders of magnitude (dizziness but no nystagmus or vomiting) but the long-tail effects have crippled me and are still prevalent 5 months later. It is honestly so fucking devastating to me. I was a very active athlete and now I get winded going up the stairs, I am worried I will never be able to sprint or play sports again and I end up crying every time I think about it.\n\nI have been super lucky in that I do not think my immune system was affected because after this happened I started being much more conscious about washing my hands and taking vitamins to fight off infections. I am yet to get any type of cold since this happened 5 months ago, but I still feel like anxious garbage 24/7. Oh man hope you get better! I still feel headaches and feeling tipsy after a week. It has lowered but Hoping it stops soon. I had a vertigo 2019.11.16. then had headaches for 3 weeks. had my second at 2019.12.21. 1 week headache, and since I have a strange feeling, its like you are dizzy, but not really. Some call it lightheadness. Talked to a person who had similar, she said it took like 6 months for her to feel 100% ok again. SO I am waiting. Epley did nothing for me, but I tried it like 2 months after the vertigo. Sometimes i find my anxiety can make me feel vertigo like symptoms and dizzy which is almost like a cycle where i will be anxious about getting dizzy then start feeling dizzy and then get more anxious and then more dizzy. Not sure if this helps at all but I know that happens to me", "Top level athletes have BPPV! I am dealing with BPPV and was wondering if there were any athletes that have it because I was wondering if I will be able to exercise like I used to.  Turns out there is quite a few!  Look up Lebron James, Pau Gasol, Jason Day....among many others\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust wanted to throw it out there because it made me feel better to know that this is not entirely debilitating.  And frankly even without BPPV I could never be Lebron James lol...so it is not the BPPV that will hold me back. I was able to continue running/training during my 2 months of active BPPV.  I found I felt the best when I was running - and wished I could run for hours upon hours. When I was not running, I was SO sick. I learned to keep my head super still - which in turn caused gaze instability and while being active is a good thing, it made my recovery longer (supposedly).\n\nBest wishes to you!!!! did your residuals ever have an effect on your vision? I am wondering how you can run because I am dealing with residual dizziness and I feel my vision is out of focus most of the time. Definitely. The gaze instability was a different form of dizziness. Unlike BPPV, I would get a woozy dizziness (like on a boat) when I was still. Or if I shut my eyes. So when I can as running.... for some reason, I felt the best. I was doing all of the vestibular exercises while running. And the gaze stability exercises while running as well. (The exercises that COULD be done while running) It was such a long drawn out journey. I was thankful to have my therapist there to help guide me. Do not do anything like this if it feels unsafe. Everyone is symptoms are slightly different. I just felt better while moving.... As long as I kept my head straight &amp; upright! thank you for the really helpful inputs and advice on this....this really has been one of the most debilitating and max anxiety times I have been through in my life. I feel like I should have gotten over the residuals sooner bc I only had BPPV for 4 days but I am just about at the month and a half point having these residuals...and I feel like I have been stuck on 70% the whole time. It is really frustrating. Do not let the anxiety get the best of you! I know how horrible it is. I was at my wits end. I was so sick. It took two months to correct the BPPV. But a different dizziness took over for months after. I was miserable. You feel there is not a light at the end of the tunnel. I would not see improvements daily.... But weekly I would notice a tiny bit of change. It is a slow process for some. I still think of it daily..... Wondering when it will strike again. It is been almost a year and a half. But for the most part I feel really good. I am healthy &amp; not on any meds. The anxiety has subsided. It sucks though that there is not a quick fix. And there is not magic medicine to help make it through an episode. Hang in there! thank you so much! and yes, exactly how I feel right now like there is not a light at the end of the tunnel bc it is been such a slow process.......I wish you continued health....these times make you realize how much of a blessing it is to have days when you are completely healthy with the world to explore in front of you. \ud83d\udc4d I continued to exercise after my initial bad bout of bppv.  I changed my exercise and did not do situps, side planks, etc.  I did a lot of bodyweight exercises that I could do with my head upright at first.  A couple weeks out I started back into my weightlifting regimen, although I had a hard time laying down on the bench and getting back up.  Often had a bucket in my weight room just in case lol.  I think you need to stay active and do exercise that makes you focus to keep feeling somewhat normal.  It is a long road.  My bppv was jan 19th and I am still going to pt and ot for residual dizziness.  It is getting better week by week.  Dont be hard on yourself....give your body and brain time.", "Few months of Slight Dizziness/Vertigo - BPPV Confirmed Hey all - new lurker to new poster. I got my first hit of dizziness at the beginning of December 2020. I have had some form of dizziness/vertigo persist since then. At first I was diagnosed with Rhinitis. Have had an MRI so MS is ruled out. Saw an ENT and he said I had BPPV. Went to a Vestibular Therapist and she found slight nystagmus. About 6 times in 1.5 minutes.   \n\n\nThe thing is, my symptoms were so slight into leading up to the Vestibular Therapy (Vesther) that the treatment I am currently getting has made me feel so much worse than before. My dizziness was more consistent in December/January and really was improving until I saw the therapist. \n\nBefore: Very slight and quick boat-rocking feeling, almost all the time at my computer. Have rock climbed, ran, biked, swim, drive, all during this time and felt fine. Always felt better while excising. Near the end of April, I maybe felt a tinge of boat-rocking 2-3 times a day, again for only 2 seconds and while at a computer.\n\nNystagmus confirmed April 28th at Vesther - got Epley #1 - I felt nauseous for a about week afterwards. Mostly in the morning  and the afternoons felt better. Slight nausea, never threw up or had to lie down, just felt icky. After 1 week it started to improve. And after 2 weeks I am pretty sure I felt great! \n\nMay 13th - Go back to Vesther feeling pretty good. They do dix/pike and I still have nystagmus. Dos Epley #2 - Gives me exercises to do this time (unlike before). Now ever since, I have slight nausea, but persistent and consistent vertigo and poor awareness for my body. It was incredibly bad yesterday while at a computer. Like every 5th time moved my eyes I would \"jolt\". It was better today but not great. I am not a week past my appointment but I am certainly feeling very shitty and very angry. I feel like I just need to wait out the 1-2 weeks and re-assess but I am short on patience. I am pretty angry in general as I really regret going back to the VestTher on May 13th and wish I just kept going without the second visit. Now I am not rock climbing, and doing my exercises which make me get vertigo. I have not had it this since February at least.\n\nI am worried my anger is also perpetuating my feelings of anxiety. I am worried this will never go away. I wish I could go back to May 11th and cancel my appointment. Anyone have any insight into their treatment progression? Does this sound similar? Or super bizarre? Have you tried my \"cure\".....I did it birdwatching. Walk around for 30 minutes and every 3 minutes look straight up for 30 seconds while standing...move on and repeat 30 times. Everyone is journey is slightly different.  I had active BPPV for so long, that it almost seemed my body was adjusting to it (unless I oved in a position where the crystal moved in my ear canal).  I was running, training, snowmobiling, horseback riding.  Doing the Epley made me super sick and I felt horrible the rest of the day.  I did over 20 Epley's in the course of 2 months. I would meet with my therapist once a week (two Epley at the appointment). And then towards the end I would do the Epley myself mid week. I was also doing the Half Somersault at home (it provokes symptoms WAY less than the Epley, but is not proven to be quite as effective). When I finally tested negative for BPPV, I still felt super yucky. But it was more of a boat swaying dizziness/nausea. One thought was that my body at that point was trying to recalibrate itself to being 'normal' again. It took a good year before I felt fairly good. \n\nOne thing I remember reading on this sub a few times, is that the Epley could move the crystal to a different ear canal. There are different maneuvers to try to correct that. It is great that you are working with a Vestibular therapist.  My vestibular therapist always did the Epley twice while in the office.  The second time was just to test (Dix Hallpike) to see if the first time worked.  For weeks, it remained persistent. And as time went on, my anxiety kicked in and that really seemed to add fuel to the fire.\n\nUnlike you - I totally trusted my therapist.  She was constantly going to seminars to learn the newest info on BPPV. She reassured me over and over. And although I had a stubborn case, she was always testing all 6 ear canals again, and doing tests for different dizzy things.\n\nLong story short - if you are still testing positive for BPPV, you need to get that cleared up before you can move on.  Has your therapist tested all 6 canals in case the crystal moved to another canal (is she treating the correct canal?)?  And even AFTER BPPV is cleared, you may have a horrible residual dizziness.  Also - search PPPD - which pretty much sums up  my residual dizziness.  And lastly, do not let the anxiety get the best of you. I swear - it makes things ten times worse. Try to be patient. For some, BPPV clears up right away. For some, it takes weeks/months. And even after its cleared, it leaves you feeling horrible. Yeahhhh, interesting. I mean my Therapist said more Epleys is not necessarily better....Mine has not tested the other ear canals after the first visit no. But if the Epley did not successfully move the crystal back up around the inner ear canal, it needs to be done until that happens.  That is the science behind it. Lots of good info on the sub if you have the time to wade through all the info.  Also - you will find so much contradicting info.  I saw quite a few specialists that really could not help me. Did not really know much about BPPV. I was super thankful to find the therapist that I did.  It is also noted that often the body will reabsorb the misplaced crystal. So, you could just wait it out. My first few episodes resolved themselves quite quickly. That was when I knew little to nothing about BPPV.  I was told to go home and give it time.  \n\nBest wishes to you! I hope you are feeling better soon! Yeah thanks! I have been reading through. I mean I get what you mean about the Epley! Not sure what is up with my therapist then. I have made a Zoom appointment with another Vestibular Therapist to discuss. I will see how that goes too. To be honest I might just let things go as they do for the summer if I go back to feeling fine. Then deal with this in the winter when I do not want to be overly active. Thanks! Please keep us posted! There is so much to learn... And others can likely find hope &amp; inspiration from what you share.", "Ugh, it is back! I had a bout of BPPV back in April, which lasted about a month. This sub was best friend during that time! Unfortunately, I just rolled over in bed and was hit with vertigo again. I have tested rolling over 3 times now- it is definitely back. I am so devastated. 4 months later and I have it again. I am going to make an appt with the therapist I saw, hopefully within the next few days. Has anyone else had it back to back like this? It is very disheartening to think this is going to be my life from now on. Yes, this happened to me. Since BPPV is so unlikely to reoccur this frequent, it possibly means that your previous vertigo encounter was not fully treated. \n\nAfter multiple treatments, thinking I was fixed, I remember rolling over in bed and having the room start spinning. I was so pissed. I did not even care about the vertigo at that moment. Frustrated from months of vertigo I swore and vented in the dark. \n\nBPPV eventually becomes like a boogey man that can pop up with any head movement and ruin your day, week or month. It is truly the worst. Oh gosh - so sorry! After my first episode, it was about a year before it hit again. At that point, I really did not know much about it. Thought it was gone and would never come back.  Did not do anything special to 'fix' it either. But then within a year's time, it hit 3 more times. I know after the 3rd time (this is when I started seeing specialists), it was for sure gone, as I saw an ENT and he did the Dix Hallpike. But then a month later - BAM, it hit again while rolling over in bed. This last (4th) episode was HORRIBLE and took forever to fix. That is when I finally found my vestibular therapist.  That was back in February.\n\nI agree - that the fear and anxiety of it coming back is horrible. I hate night time and darkness, since that is when it always happens. Every single day, I wonder if it is going to hit again.  I have done everything in my power to try to keep it away this time.  And am still dealing with residual crap.  My therapist has tried real hard to tell me not to fear it. That NOW, I know what it is, and how to treat it. I can always get in to see her ASAP (I am on a priority list). She said it likely WILL continue to come back. But I just need to treat it right away. That still does not help ease the fear and anxiety.\n\nGood luck to you. I hope you kick it to the curb quickly. Let us know how things are going. Ok, this makes me feel a bit better thanks. I do wonder if I was not \u201cfully\u201d fixed as I would have moments where I would wonder if it was coming back- but figured I was just paranoid and traumatized after the first round, since I was mostly fine. Thanks again for your input- man does BPPV suck. Thanks for this! Yours is a story I remember from last time. I agree with you about the daily paranoia of it coming back. Any sudden movements and I would brace myself for spinning. Sucks it became a reality! It is true though that knowing what it is helps I think... I know which movements to avoid now, where before I did not so I was constantly spinning and nauseated. My therapists\u2019 first opening is a week from now, so hopefully I can make it through a week without totally losing it. Thanks again for your thoughts! It always seems to hit me summer months more often.", "Sleeping Hi there,\n\nI am curious if anyone else has altered their sleeping habits since getting BPPV.\nI can no longer sleep on my sides since I adjusted to sleeping on my back. (It was the only way I could sleep during my bppv episode that lasted about a couple months -including residual dizziness after and I have neck issues so I needed to start sleeping better~I was also a tummy sleeper before as well)\n\nDoes everyone go back to their normal sleeping habits like sleeping on the bad ear, etc after? My brain wants to say avoid sleeping on your sides to avoid it coming back but logically I know that there is no known way to prevent reoccurrence. Lol\n\nEdit: sorry for the errors, I am on mobile. I was just thinking about this. It is been almost a year since my last bout (happened in December and was 'fixed' in February - with over 6 months of residual dizziness).  My vestibular therapist told me to return to normal sleeping positions as soon as possible.  I continued sleeping upright and on my good side for quite some time. I was fortunate to find relief on my good side.  Little by little, I found I would slip down to an 'almost flat' position by morning.  Just about two months ago, I started rolling onto my 'bad' side, but only for a few minutes. I now find I can actually sleep on my bad side. I still am not completely flat though. Still propped up a bit.\n\nI totally have fear and anxiety that it will come back, as this last episode was so bad.  If someone could prove that never again sleeping on my bad side would prevent it - I would never sleep that way again. But sadly, there is no such study. But it is good to know that I actually can roll onto my bad side and not have that mild wave of dizziness.  So I totally get your anxiety about not rolling over!\n\nOn a side note - for this past week - something has triggered some of the residual dizziness again.  As I close my eyes, I get a wave of dizziness (mild dizziness - not the severe vertigo).  And as I roll over in bed, I get a wave of that same mild dizziness. Could it be anxiety - knowing that I am coming up on my anniversary date of when it last hit? I do not know.  But it sucks.\n\nI am happy to see you back on this sub again to offer help and suggestions! Missed you! Wow I have the same situation. First got it in dec, then again in feb then 6 months of residuals and the last two months were great until a few days ago when I woke up with the spins. I sleep on the couch when I get the spins bc it forces me to stay in one position. I have upped my vitamin d to 5000iu/day so hopefully it subsides (it is). Oh no! Sorry to hear you are in the same boat. I am thankful that at this point, it is not full on BPPV (I tested myself - to keep from freaking out more!). But I cannot help to wonder if it means it is GOING to happen?  Or what caused it....as nothing much in my life has changed.  Still active, still eating/drinking the same (healthy), no meds. I am tempted to blame it on the weather with the snow/cold that just moved in, after having some 60ish degree days.  Glad to hear the Vitamin D is helping you! Well people say when the barometric pressure drops, they get the spins. Ours dropped last week here in Oregon. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I usually get the sinus pressure with barometric pressure drops.  Perhaps it is shifted to dizziness now! Good Point.  And likely could be the reason! I have missed you! \n\nAnd yeah, I can lay on my bad side (both sides as well) and be fine.  Even take naps on my bad side For an hour or so and be okay. I think it is just sleeping on my sides for long periods of time makes me scared bc my episode happend when I woke up one day. I have been doing quite well lately. I also get this weird dizziness sometimes when I close my eyes but I think it is anxiety. I tend to get mild anxiety before bed sometimes especially if I have got things on my mind. I believe it is just me getting drowsy or mb neck tension before bed. It is been getting colder here so that could be causing it to.\n\nI am so glad you are doing well! Will that bed time anxiety ever go away?!?!?  Seriously - every night, the fear that it will happen again. Ugh. And I think at night, I over think things as well. I can dwell on something in the middle of the night and not sleep, but then the next day, it is no big deal.  And I wonder why I was up all night worrying about it. I hate that the days are shorter too - and lack of daylight. Darkness is no fun. Ugh! I hope so. For me it slowly is. I think I am just starting to accept that I cannot control the \u201cif\u201d I get it again. If I do, then I do. I will treat it and carry on. I realllly hope it does not come back tho. Fingers crossed. Inflammation is my guess Words from my therapist, 'You cannot worry about it. You do not go around every day wondering if you are going to get cancer. It may or may not happen again. And if it DOES, you NOW know how to resolve it and you will not wait around.'  So - I try to remember that.  Your thought process is on the right track! I will remember those words as well!!!! Love that. I have been going on a year without reoccurrence so I am hopeful that it will not come around again at all - or at least not for a long time. I got a shiatsu neck massager that is been working really well for my neck tension. Amazon! Ooooo! I have been looking at those for awhile. I was wondering how well they work. I got one of those precision massage gun things. Works good. The massager that compresses your feet and calves....those just look amazing. I might as well buy the whole dang chair at this point lol Whatever helps! #selfcare \ud83e\udd70 It seems like the dizziness can come and go. I had some residual feelings a few days last week. I resorted to some of the exercises my therapist provided and it did help some. I am super cautious now about sleeping on the side that triggered BPPV and try to lay on my back facing slightly opposite side that triggers. I am able to sleep on my side but have to keep my head at a decent angle. \n\nI have tried more to trigger the dizziness so I can go through the exercises for remediation but it is been a mixed bag thus far. You said you had 6 months of residual? I am 3.5 months in now. What are your residual symptoms?\n\nMine are visual disturbances - head pressure or headaches, sometimes ear pressure or pain (goes away quick). Facial pressure too. Lightheaded - disconnected feeling at times. None are consistently everyday- they always change day to day or week to week. Will have a good week or two then a shity one. I am in a shitty one. Every 2-3 weeks I notice a slight improvement. It is awful... I think the bed time anxiety will go away- mind over matter as dumb as it sounds. This past month I have finally been able to sleep better except now I am working on my neck posture w chiropractor and I am sore and waking up bc of it. I guess it is good to not know which side is definitely the bad side bc the ENT said he saw a \u201cslight\u201d nystagmus (BS if you ask me) and the two PT\u2019s I saw- saw none. One thought it was my right the other my left. But I definitely think it just takes time and trying to not think about it. Anxiety makes it worse of course, have you tried CBD for bed time? I have not tried CBD - but that is something I think I will look into! I am somewhat similar to you. I had this ear fullness, popping, crackling, gurling - in which the ENT said there was nothing wrong with my ears, they checked out fine. And all other experts said it was not related.  The gaze instability - which gives me seconds of trying to refocus, which causes a mild dizziness. It is not the severe dizziness anymore triggered from movement - but rather an 'on the boat' type feeling. It seems when my eyes would go from a soft gaze to focused (or the other way around) it triggers the woozy dizziness.  Often when my eyes are shut (mostly laying down), somehow brief waves of dizziness pass through as well. Mine also change weekly. Sometimes daily.  Nothing is consistent. Still tipping my head certain directions causes the mild dizziness. I try to 'challenge' it, by doing the movement over and over 15 times - but often I am not in a situation where I can do that (driving.....in a meeting, etc.)", "19 F dizzy sensation, feeling hopeless As a bit of background, I have quite severe emetophobia which is the fear of vomiting. I get terrified and have panic attacks and cry when I feel really sick. \n\nWhen I was about 17 I started getting episodes of dizziness. My mum and granny both have vertigo (I am not sure what type) so they think I might have it too but they say I am too young. They think it is my blood sugar, blood pressure, spending too much time on the phone, not eating enough etc so make me do all that instead of going to a doctor. I do all of that but I still get the episodes of dizziness. \n\nIt does not happen very often, I think once every 4 months or more. I am on the birth control pill cerelle but I do remember having dizziness before being on the pill so I do not think it could be that. \n\nMy symptoms; \n\u2022I feel like I am on a boat CONSTANTLY, it seems to get worse as the day goes on \n\u2022I feel nauseous which is extremely distressing to my emetophobia \n\u2022sometimes I have tinnitus but only lasts about a second and is not always synonymous with the dizziness \n\u2022I will have a moment of a spinning sensation then go back to feeling like I am on a boat \n\nI feel so hopeless and I am currently having a panic attack as I write this. The sick feeling is horrible sometimes I take motion sickness tablets from a pharmacy and they help for a bit but not for long. I am having trouble sleeping because of the dizzy feeling. I want to see a doctor about it but I am so scared of the tests they do cause I am terrified something will make me throw up. I have tried the epley manoeuvre at home but it does not work idk if I am doing it wrong but it never helps. I take vitamin D everyday hoping it helps but it never does. My mum thinks it could be coming from anxiety cause almost everytime I have a dizzy period it is been when my stress levels are quite high \n\nI need advice I do not know what to do I feel so distressed. I am sorry to hear about your experience. I would strongly recommend seeking out a professional who deals with vertigo. They could be audiologists or ENTs. I found mine by googling vertigo specialist and the name of my city.\n\nAs for blood pressure, blood sugar and other speculations, you would need tests for all these. For example, I just ruled out iron and B12 deficiency as vertigo causes by doing a blood test.\n\nFinally, you should get counselling help for your phobia. I also have a severe phobia (a different kind) and saw a specialist who helped me to an extent. Unfortunately, I am not in therapy now but I hope to start again soon because I do not want it to affect my life. As you pointed out, it takes a toll especially if you are getting triggered.\n\nUnfortunately, in my country, all these appointments are not covered by basic insurance. Luckily, I have extended benefits to cover some costs. I hope you can find access, too.\n\nAlso, I am surprised by your parents. Is driving that important right now? Also, would not it be safer to address the vertigo problem first. \n\nAnyways, I really hope you get the care and answers from health professionals! Sometimes, it takes a while to find a doctor you can trust to do everything they can to help you. Some tests made me dizzy and others did not do anything at all. It was not any worse then what I already felt when moving around throughout the day. Of course, this is just my experience but  I hope it helps.\n\nYou should explain to the vertigo  doctor you have a phobia beforehand so they know how to support you. Do you also have a family doctor? They can be helpful in connecting you with others and doing blood work. Im also 19 f and i have been struggling with feeling wobbly and \u00aboff\u00bb for a long time. Im really glad to know im not the only one struggling with this. How do you feel mentally? Im feeling okay at the minute, it seems to be if I am anxious or stressed the vertigo will come on more. Is this the same for you?", "How long for ear infection induced vertigo to go away? It is literally driving me crazy I got an ear infection a couple of weeks ago and it was left untreated because I thought it was going away on it is own until around 5 days ago where they said the dizziness/nausea I am experiencing is from a bad ear infection and apparently it was really red in there so that is awesome. \n\nWell I thought the dizziness/vertigo was gone but I get vertigo sometimes if I kind of relax my head muscles if that makes sense and I also get major vertigo right when I wake up sometimes like I did this morning. It is not nearly as bad anymore but I was scared of falling over or something. \n\nHow long is this vertigo supposed to last from an ear infection? It is causing me to have heightened anxiety, stress, depression, irritability, tiredness, etc. It really depends, I have bppv and it is never really gone away. For an ear infection it may be different. The ear infection may have caused a crystal in your ear to be displaced causing the vertigo so you may have to try the epley maneuver to get it back in place (lots of videos on YouTube to show you how to do it) I find it usually works but it is honestly always been there.  I feel the same way when it happens, I feel like I am going to fall over and it makes my anxiety go through the roof because I think there is something wrong with me. Go to your doctor if it gets worse! Hope that helps If it is distressing you, it is definitely something to go see an ENT specialist about. Schedule an appointment with your local ENT! I tried to do stuff myself by watching videos and it fucked me up real bad. Would not recommend it.", "BPPV and menstrual cycle? Anyone here feel like they get spinning sensations close to when their period is expected to come? \n\nI have already been to a specialist PT back in December and did the Epley with her 3 times, which got rid of the vertigo. My residual dizziness was almost completely gone, but recently I feel more dizzy and just woke up to spinning this morning. Now I am a bit dizzy all day. \n\nThis happened two months ago too, but the spinning only lasted for about a day. \n\nAnyone relate?  Hmmm.... my last episode did coincide with my ovulation. I should track that better. But ovulation usually predates the period, so that does not help.\n\nMight be worth noting that I had my uterus removed because my periods were crazy heavy and leaving me life-threateningly anemic. But I still have ovaries. \n\nTrack your BPPV symptoms in a diary to look for trends. I am going to as well. Do you feel the spinning symptom from BPPV every day or do you just have random episodes where it will happen suddenly but go away for a while?\n\nGlad you still have your ovaries! Me, too! I have random bouts of BPPV that last from hours to 3-4 days and then vanish, and be gone for weeks. Sometimes the Epley procedure helps, sometimes not. Do they come back out of the blue after weeks of having no symptoms or do you notice these random episodes around your expected period? Oh my goodness I feel SEEN. \nYes! This started happening over a year ago and I just recently connected the dots of, \u201cOh, this really only flares up near my expected period.\u201d \nI have searched and searched for a deeper, hormonal explanation to no avail. \nAll I know is, I know my period\u2019s coming by how off-balance I start to feel. haha yeah same here! i have searched the web and asked my OB-GYN but still never got any explanation. \n\ndo you feel spinning too or just dizziness? because I feel dizziness often a week or so before my period, but a couple days before it comes, i sometimes feel slight spinning too in bed Hmm, now that I think about it. The couple times I got kind of off-balance/ dizzy feeling was around that time of the month. Only lasted a day or so. Interesting. do you feel more dizziness or is there also spinning?\n\ni usually just feel more dizziness except there was slight spinning once a couple months back but for two nights now, i am having spinning on the right side which was my problem before i went to the PT so i cannot tell if it is my period or if my crystals got dislodged again in my sleep It is more of a dizzy feeling. Comes and goes like when I bend over to dry my hair after the shower and get up to fast. Or just a overall light headed feeling for a day.\n\nI have not had spinning vertigo since the bppv episode for about 4 weeks. (Knock on wood lol) now, it would not have lasted that long if I had just went to pt and treated it but I did not know what was wrong and hoped it would go away on its own. Ugh. After I treated it, the vertigo never happened again but I did get this \u201cshock\u201d almost about to get the spins feeling suddenly when I would lay down for a couple weeks after pt. I also had a constant residual dizzy/ off balance feeling for about a month after the vertigo stopped. \n\nI think that if you are getting the spins again, either the crystals were not resolved the first time or they came out again or moved into another canal. Since my first episode, I have avoided sleeping on my sides all together and just sleep on my back a little elevated. Sucks to get used to but it seemed to allow everything to settle back down. It is been almost 6 months of sleeping that way and all is well over here. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83c\udffc I think it may be one of those things that we just have to experience without documented medical evidence! It is real for us! \n\nI definitely get spinning too and ringing in the ears. The dizziness comes about a week before it is due but all of them kind of peak on my actual period days. The only good thing is, now I kind of know what to expect so I am more prepared. It may also be worth noting that this happened while I had a Mirena iud and still happens now even though I am not using any method of birth control. \nI miscarried in January and that was the only time it did not happen! Wow! Now that you mention it...I am coming up on my red week and started feeling more dizzy the last couple of days. Mostly in the evening and l got up last night at 2am and did the Brandt-Daroff maneuvers and it helped. But I have not been dizzy for a month. I will start tracking too. Well I had not noticed before that is why I am going to start tracking it. It is back today, as of about 3am, so either you jinxed me (jk) or I should be about to ovulate, so we will see. Yes! So as per my post history, I have been dealing with some form of vertigo for about four years now. (32/F). I am on the BPPV sub because that is what I was first diagnosed with, but after years of ENTs/Physio/Clinics etc it is become apparent I do not have BPPV, but rather I have reduced functionality in one of my ears and I am likely having vestibular migraines.\n\nI just saw an ENT recently and asked about the hormone connection specifically, and they said that hormones are 100% a component for some people's dizziness, though they offered no other advice on this matter (I assume because they do not get into that aspect).\n\nI am now taking a bunch of **hormone-supporting** supplements (B Complex, ( Vitamin D, Probiotic, Magnesium Citrate) and I have not had any dizziness since, though I am one month in, so we will see how this goes. As women we need to keep an eye on our ferritin, so get some blood work done IMO. Just wanted to add to this as today I have a little more vertigo than normal. And looking back at each time I have had bad days, it is always around the end of the month/first of the next month, which after I start my period. Interesting for sure!", "BPPV or not likely? I am due to see an ENT next week who specialises in vertigo. \n\nFor the last 4 weeks I have been feeling really off balance. Feels a bit like my I am walking down the aisle of an aeroplane in flight. I have been having horrid tension headaches too everyday and bouts of nausea. I do suffer from GERD and stopped all medication recently due to side effects I was getting from it so there may be a connection there with my off balance feelings. If I try to walk for more than 5 minutes I feel woozy and almost faint like. I wake up every morning and before I even get out of bed i feel as though I have turned really quickly in bed and my brain has not caught up with my body. \n\nDoes this sound like symptoms from bppv? I have not had the typical room spinning sensations, more of an off balance sensation/ cannot stand for long periods.  Also is headaches typical with bppv? \n\nMy gp ruled out migraine as this would not typically cause all day dizziness for weeks and weeks. \n\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Hi sweetie! I am sorry you are experiencing this. I know it is really stressful and draining! Your symptoms sound much like mine. My PT does not feel it is BPPV for me, and that it is a weakened vestibular system due to ??? (She thinks I may have had vestibular neuritis at some point which may have triggered it.) You may also want to have some bloodwork to test your B12, iron, and vitamin D, because sometimes deficiencies in those can cause these feelings. Things will get better! Feel free to PM if you want to talk about it more. Xo Bppv normally associated with vertigo That is been my feeling for the last two and a half weeks had to go to emergency the other day because I had a massive panic attack. Doctor saw my ear said it was full and is affecting my balance. But over ear wax?? I do suffer from ear wax yearly but I just had my right one cleaned and it is still full. He could not even see the membrane. I too was diagnosed by GP for positional vertigo. It came about after I was placing drops in my ear to soften wax and then the dizziness started from then. I feel like I am constantly bouncing when walking or a pulling sensation. We are both in the same boat it seems \u2026lol My BPPV came on suddenly and was very intense - worst vertigo I have ever experienced.  Your ENT should be able to get to the bottom of it pretty quickly although mine was not 100% sure it was BPPV.  But I had been taking Antivert and it possibly masked some symptoms.\n\nAfter I was off the Antivert, my physical therapist was able to see right away that it was classic BPPV.  Good luck!", "how do I cope I was 16 when I was diagnosed with severe BPPV. I had a major attack (2018 ish) that brought me to the hospital and it went away after two weeks. I had minor (compared to the big one) attacks over the years but just got another huge one this week driving home from another state. Nothing works on me. No medications, no maneuvers, nothing. I just have to sit here and wait for it to go away. I am 19 and I am living in fear all the time. I am scared to do anything and I cannot go places people I know go to because of this. I do not want to live like this anymore. It is caused so much emotional stress. To make matters worse I email professors (im in college) about my condition and they do not make it any easier on me. If I have an attack, I get a 0 on whatever I missed. I do not know what to. I cannot keep living like this.", "Any tips for getting up in the mornings? Hi everyone!\n\nSo I have constant vertigo, and when I am tired it is at its worst. The spinning looks like I am on the waltzes ride without the fun, my eyes feel extremely heavy and pain behind them, and I usually wake with a headache.\n\nAll these symptoms last a couple of hours from first waking before I can physically get out of bed...\n\nI do have a good bed routine already in the hope of reducing my symptoms but it does not. It is coming up to three years of me having this constant vertigo. \n\nIs anyone else in a similar position or have anymore advice and have found ways of reducing the symptoms faster than a couple of hours?\n\nThis is really affecting me. Thank you very much for any advice :) I am so sorry. Have you been officially diagnosed with BPPV so that you can have the maneuvers done on you? Those do help when done by a professional. Also have you had your Vitamin D and other levels checked for deficiencies? Seems like there is many reasons for BPPV. I have it minimally and I cannot imagine what you are going through. I hope you can get some help with it. \ud83d\ude1f They did diagnose me  BPPV yes. They gave me the maneuvers and other exercises to do to try and help which I did for a year which had no impact and they have now discharged me as it seems the exercises will not help. \n\nHowever last week I was diagnosed with scoliosis. I will be seeing a specialist to talk to them about it and I am now wondering if maybe I do not have BPPV (Although I do have a lot of the symptoms for BPPV ) but maybe it was bought on by the scoliosis. (These is all questions I will be asking the specialist) \n\nDo you find there is any way of helping your dizziness at all when it is at its worse? \n\n\nYes I have had all my bloods checked which has came back fine thankfully :)\n\nThank you so much, and I really hope yours gets better fully soon. For me it seems like any inflammation brings it on. And there is plenty of reason for inflammation. Allergies, weather change, mold exposure. I do what I can to limit inflammation. The maneuvers work too, esp when done by someone.", "Can this be caused by anxiety and stress? So for context I have a phobia called emetophobia which is the intense fear of vomit and sickness and everything to do with it. I have this quite severely and everyday things you may think are nothing cause me quite a lot of stress. Ie. Crowded areas, eating certain food, public transport, being away from home etc etc. It is something that affects my everyday life as everyday I am scared it will be the day I vomit. \n\nI have been having dizziness on and off for about 3 years now but it is not very often I get it. My mum just keeps saying I am not eating enough and that is why I get it but when I eat lots I still have it so I do not think it is from that. \n\nI am terrified to go to a doctor due to my anxiety disorder, I am scared of all the sickness that can be around me and I am scared any test they do on me will make me nauseous or throw up which is why I have been putting off going to the doctor for about a year now. \n\nI am on cerelle birth control but I have had dizziness before being on this so I am not sure if that is it. I have realised recently it seems to happen when I have very high stress.\n\nLast time it happened it was because my bf had a stomach bug and was throwing up and I was incredibly stressed I would catch it and throw up too, the dizziness lasted for 3 weeks even after I had calmed down and his sickness was over but the dizziness started then. \n\nMy family have recently gotten a puppy and while they are at work I take care of him, I do not get much sleep as the dog keeps me up barking and I have to get up early to go and look after him. I am also terrified of dogs throwing up and this majorly stresses me out. When I am alone with him in the house I just worry that he will randomly be sick and I will not be able to go near it to clean it up. \n\nsometimes I feel like I am on a boat swaying side to side and sometimes I will randomly have a spinning sensation at the back of my head. It does not seem to be affected by movements of my head or eyes and I have tried doing manoeuvres for vertigo and they have no affect whatsoever, I just have to wait until it subsides.\n\nI know I need to see a doctor but I am so terrified of the tests they may do. \n\nHas anyone else ever had this? Is it due to stress and anxiety? This is not BPPV because it is not positional. Vertigo can be caused by a multitude of things, including stress. I assure you that you are stress level will drop once you go to see a doctor. Knowledge is power, baby! You got this. Good luck! Thank you, I really need to find the courage to go. So worried about what tests they will do on me but maybe they can find a way to treat it so I need to brave it and go! The tests are easy peezy! (Some of them suck, but nothing invasive. Just \ud83e\udd74) Feel free to hit me up if you have questions.", "How exactly does Bppv \"get better on its own\"? Hi, so I have seen that in many cases BPVV can go away on its own after as little as an hour or up to weeks or months.\n\nBut I cannot really find any info on how it resolves. If it is due to calcium crystals getting into places they should not do they \n\n1.just eventually dissolve / break down to nothing, 2 just by chance make their way back to the right place by pure luck?\n3. Does the brain just compensate for it naturally over time? \n\nI have experienced vertigo before for short periods, but just very briefly and gone almost immediately. More recently had a case of it for about 6 days but it seems to be getting less prevalent (but still there if I really throw myself forward \nat the waist to go into the bottom of a backpack from a desk chair for example.\n\nAlso only really there now when initially going to bed (as soon as I lie down) and when getting up in the morning, and when rolling / moving head aeound once laying down in bed.\n\nI get no obvious sickness from it and have not been close to vomiting. Also I do not get stressed out by it just bear with it until it passes. It SEEMS to be getting better but not really sure how that can happen with a mechanical issue like this From what I have been told by doctors/specialists - it eventually dissolves.  And, it is possible, if you are super active, that it CAN resolve on it is own by your own activity, by relocating the crystal back into the 'good' area.  Example, gymnastics, swimming, etc (any activity that would rotate the head in similar movements of the Epley or Half Somersault).  The lack of info and studies on BPPV is disheartening. So much of it is guess work.  When I worked with my vestibular therapist, it was fascinating, as she was always attending conferences and continuing education classes on BPPV and dizzy conditions.  So I was privy to the most recent info.\n\nI have no idea how my first 3 episodes resolved. My last episode was horrible and lasted over two months. And during that time, I was seeing a vestibular therapist weekly, getting the Epley done correctly. I was also doing the Epley at home, along with the Half Somersault. Plus, I was super active. I had no 'ah-ha' moment to know where it actually corrected itself, as I remained super sick with residual dizziness (although the Dix Hallpike proved BPPV was corrected, as I no longer had the intense vertigo with nystagmus when I laid back). It likely could have even been snowmobiling that fixed me (going fast, hitting jumps, turning my head quickly). It is a mystery..... Someone with the crystals getting back where they should be I believe, When did your BPPV start? How much time did you get in between an event? I just completed 8 rounds of the epley and I am almost done with this round of vertigo. Dreading the next one I had 4 episodes within 2.5 years. The first three I do not remember much about. They came &amp; went within a week or so. The last episode hit in December 2020 &amp; was resolved in February 2021. Nasty residual dizziness lasted close to 8 months.  It is been a year &amp; a half and I am finally feeling almost normal again!\n\nI did the Epley over 20 times. Once a week with my therapist (she would perform it twice. The second time was to always to check to see if the first time worked) After a month, I would do the Epley mid week myself. I was also doing the half somersault. I had no clue it was resolved... As I went into one of the last appointments. She laid me back.... And no vertigo or nystagmus. I was shocked. So we did it again. Still negative. I hate not knowing the exact moment it was fixed! Thank you for the response. Just curious as my Physical therapist believes a reoccurrence is highly unlikely but I feel the opposite. We did the epley 3 times on Tuesday. I felt very off afterwards. The next morning I woke up feeling pretty good. Very minimal vertigo on my right side and looking down. Today we did it twice and on the second round, almost no vertigo happened, he said he saw maybe 2 \u201ceye beats\u201d so I was actually having my doubts that treatment would work. My physical therapist has a high success rate after 1 or 2 sessions and we are not quite there after 8 so it can be a little discouraging Well, hang in there. Because as I mentioned, it took over 20 Epley and over 2 months for mine to resolve the last time. It is a mystery. And that is what sucks. Everyone is a bit different. I had a super stubborn case. My therapist DID say, that perhaps this time, since the BPPV was truly corrected - it may not come back. But in the same breath, said it also is very likely, as many that get it, continue to have it over and over. Ugh.  So, the intense fear of it returning EVERY SINGLE DAY is so fresh in my head.  But the reassurance now of knowing exactly how to fix it, and to catch it right away, instead of waiting - helps ease my mind a bit.\n\nOne thing to remember, is there are a LOT of people out there that have only ever had one episode in their life. They moved on, and you do not see them posting online or talking about it. One and done. It is those that struggle to find adequate help, or have reoccurrences that you see posting and asking questions. So do not get discouraged. You may never have BPPV happen again after you get it resolved. You may have a stubborn case as well.  Stay positive and be thankful you have a good therapist to help you through it!\n\nPlease keep us posted on your recovery and treatment. We can all learn from others and stay hopeful! Hi there , I see you post a lot about BPPV my mom has had it for years and she takes serc. It is really the only medication they offer in Canada but I mean it does not exactly help but it may do something. I am okay with my mom taking them because they are pretty safe. Lately my mom is starting to get anxiety with her vertigo which triggers kind of a panic attack because her body does not understand the vertigo at times .... nevertheless she goes in phases she will be good for months and then 2-3 weeks not be well. I noticed in a post you mentioned your vitamin D levels ... does this have a part ? I recently made her do blood tests and all came well but she was low in Vitamin D. We live in Canada so long winter months. I have her on a supplement but I am looking to boost those numbers quickly. I did not know it may have an impact on vertigo ?! \nJust was looking for advice you seem very knowledgeable in vertigo and I just want to help my mom. Doctors here do not know much and I hate to see her like this.\nThank you in advance if you do answer \u2764\ufe0f Hello! You are awesome for all the help you are giving to your mom. And I totally understand the anxiety and panic attacks as well.  It hit me too - when I felt there was NO escape from the vertigo.  But managing the anxiety was key in helping me feel better.  Many have said that low vitamin D levels is something that can trigger the BPPV. And if you think about it - it is tiny calcium crystals breaking off in the inner ear that cause BPPV. So if you vitamin D levels are low - you may have more brittle bones/calcium in your body.  So taking Vitamin D certainly may help! It surely will not hurt.  For sure up the Vitamin D for your mom.  I live just below you in Minnesota - so I get those 'long winter months!'    My vitamin D levels were good.  And I think because I run outdoors all winter and snowmobile....I still get plenty of sunshine year round.\n\nIt may help your mom when she gets in those times she is not well to help keep her busy. Or help keep her mind off the vertigo.  I found keeping busy helps with the anxiety and panic attacks.\n\nAlso - I think many of us have experienced doctors not being helpful. If you can find a vestibular therapist (found in many physical therapy departments), that may be HUGE in helping your mom. I know mine helped even with the anxiety. She knew just the right things to say to reassure me and help ease my mind.  She also gave me a lot of exercises that seemed to help.  Just finding a 'professional' to help is so worth it. So check around in your local PT departments to see if there is someone that specializes in dizziness. Sometimes even chiropractors are knowledgeable in treating dizziness.\n\nAnd in the meanwhile, up the Vitamin D! Hello, firstly thank you so much for providing such a amazing response. The way you explained it really made sense, the whole aspect on the vitamin D. Her doctor even wants her to come in to get a supplement in a high dose because of how low it is. It makes more sense because she tends to have vertigo more in the winter months than summer so I am hopeful this might work or help her feel better.\nYup the anxiety is what makes her worse she is dealt with vertigo for years but recently she is gotten a bit panicky about it and I try and prevent a panic attack. It is difficult at times but I really want to help and thank you for the compliment just seeing her needing rest for a whole day breaks my heart! My mom does not get as much sunshine so I am really trying to change that I guess trying to prevent sun damage lead to too little sun! Ironically. And I agree will try and take her mind off stuff. I have to train myself to not worry either when she gets like that. After reading her blood results numerous times I finally can have a sense of relief it is just the vertigo that needs to be targeted. As per the panic attacks if I can maybe be find away to take her mind off stuff until this too shall pass. \nShe has a neurologist that knows how to do the head movements but at times when she goes she does not have vertigo so he cannot see the eye movements etc etc. Perhaps she should go more often. I will look for more of a physical therapist \nI thank you again you really helped. It even made me feel better. I talked to my mom about your response today and she found a lot of peace / knowledge on what you had to say.\nAll the best", "looking for a friend/support hey just looking for someone to talk to. hoping we can both provide mutual support. i am 23f and have had bppv since childhood. ik this sub is not very active but hoping someone might want to talk: reply or message me anytime !

You were diagnosed since then? yes since i was around 10 years old. when i first started experiencing severe vertigo. i never knew what it was honestly but i used to tell my parents i did not feel well and i would end up staying in bed all day with my head to once side in fear of triggering it if i moved around. it would usually subside after a while and i would carry on. a few years later i was actually diagnosed and taught how to do the epley, half somersault, and more. bppv has effected me for a long time and it is always come back weather it is a month later or a year later. wish it would go away for good! It will go away. One day you will not even notice it. It sucks that you have experienced this since you were a child. I have had a vestibular disorder since late 2017, and I was 20 back then. I have been in those dark places and it is not fun, I like to link up with people like we are doing now because I know I am not alone in the struggle. Others understand me.

I can sure talk to someone who understands the unpleasant symptoms. I am 26 and I have had it since I was 18. It is currently active and it sucks. I am a super active person so every time I have it I feel like I am a prisoner. I cannot do anything. It honestly affects me mentally as well... hey :( yeah it creates a LOT of stress and anxiety in my life unfortunately. I would love to chat, I am currently experiencing BPPV and its fairly new and honestly a bit scary for me. I feel very alone and distant from my friends amid all this. They are all very supportive but it is hard when they have no idea what im experiencing.", "BPPV Interfering With Fitness I am very into fitness and I love to do all types of workouts. I am finding that because of my BPPV, I cannot do a lot of the activities that I want to, like yoga (because of the inverting of my head and tilting), running or jumping (feels like my head is bobbing in water), or anything else that involves rotating my neck. I hate it! Does anyone else feel super lazy when BPPV hits? Yes when I had my first episode I did not get off the couch and I slept for days!! It was so depressing! I went to a physical therapist and they did some stuff with my head and after a week I was back to normal but had a small flare up Saturday but I think it is better now! IT SUCKS!!! I get it probably twice a year but it goes away after the Epley maneuver. This time it will not go away. My doctor is referring me to a vestibular therapist but I have not looked up what that is yet. I just want to work out! I get it probably twice a year but it goes away after the Epley maneuver. This time it will not go away. My doctor is referring me to a vestibular therapist but I have not looked up what that is yet. I just want to work out! I am so sorry. I have had two episodes about two and a half years apart. My most recent episode was ten months ago and I am still afraid to move my head certain ways. Flipping over in bed scares me, especially since in both cases it hit in the morning when I was turning over in bed. I guess I do not have any advice but wanted to write and say I understand and feel badly for you. I wish they could figure out a permanent fix for this. I feel bad for everyone with this too. It sucks cause we never know when it will hit us. The episodes seem so random. Sorry you are suffering too I just went to urgent care tonight for a bout of vertigo, it started while I was doing yoga. This is the second time I have had it happen during working out (granted the other time was about 5 years ago) but it definitely has me leery of doing yoga again. I just started doing yoga again - minus down dog cause that is what really gets me. I am nervous about doing inversions and those have always been my favorite. Good luck! I really like yoga but am feeling pretty leery about it after today. Thanks! I hope you feel better too. Bppv sucks Oddly enough - I was still able to run during my episodes of vertigo! That was basically the one time I felt I was 'free' of it.  My vestibular therapist and neurologist could't believe I could run.  But, one thing to keep in mind - I learned to keep my head very still, and in this end, this caused me more problems.  Due to my lack of head moving activity and the fact that my vertigo lasted over 3 months, it caused a vestibular instability &amp; gaze instability.  I started to get dizzy just while being still or while trying to watch TV.  So I had two different kinds of dizziness going on. It took 20 Epley maneuvers over an 8 week period to get the crystal back in place, and now am dealing with residual dizziness.  The vestibular exercises have helped a ton, but my body is having a hard time acclimating back to being balanced again. And part of the therapy was to learn to not be afraid of the normal dizziness and challenge it by doing repeated head/eye movements.  Mind you - I was still very cautious to not put myself in a position to provoke the BAD vertigo.\n\nTotal disclaimer here - I started therapy with a dizziness specialist about 4 weeks after my initial vertigo attack.  And spent 8 weeks in therapy working on all of this.  I do not know how any of this stuff I learned at treatment would/will work right after an initial vertigo attack.  The PT assured me if I treat it right away, I will not get as horribly sick and dizzy by letting it linger.  Although, we never know if the Epley maneuver will work the first time.....or like it was with me, 20 times (again, I was told had I not waited so long to get help, it would not have taken that long.  I   \n\nAnyhow, by now (3 months after you posted this), I hope you are doing better and back at doing all the activities you enjoy!", "Can anyone help me So I have not suffered from my bppv in several months, but it seems to have come back in a new form. Randomly, my head will feel like it is inflating or deflating and gets lighter or heavier feeling. It is an incredibly uncomfortable feeling. One time it happened while I was laying down, and it felt like time sped up and blood was rushing through my head. Sorry I dont have much information describing it, it is hard to explain. I dont even know if its bppv or something different because I have not found my symptoms anywhere online. BPPV is positional by nature and usually does not include symptoms other than dizziness/nystagmus (and the residual symptoms of those- like nausea), so if you are feeling weird symptoms in different positions, pressure changes, noises, etc... it is probably not BPPV. Could be vestibulitis, Meniere\u2019s, neuritis... best to get to an ENT or vestibular therapist and get checked out! It usually comes up when I sleep on my side, its also accompanied by slight dizziness. Also, It only happened last night when I happened to have a bad headache as well. If it persists I will get it checked out. See a doctor - I have been on this forum since October and I am yet to read anything like what you are describing. \ud83d\udc4d I do not have headaches with BPPV. It DOES occur only when I sleep on my right side, and nausea follows the episodes. I can replicate the symptoms (vertigo, then nausea) by moving my head to a specific position. Agree with the previous commenter to get it checked out. Obviously, people can have different experiences, but this sounds different than BPPV. Hope you get some answers and feel better soon! I feel fine now, I hope it is some weird one time thing. I have had vestibular problems since I was a little kid and it sucks. If it happens again I will get it checked out. I wish you the best. I know how terrible it is to feel that way. This is not likely to be your specific issue but I have had that feeling from POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) before. POTS results in poor blood flow to your brain when you stand up followed by much better blood flow when you lie down, so the 'head rush' feeling happens when you change position - starting lying down or starting standing up. It is temporary - 1-2 minutes maximum if I have my symptoms under control. BUT it does not depend on lying on a specific side.", "Various symptoms and issues with balance, MdDS? Hey!  I am a male, 25, with a history of poor back / neck posture. Posting here since there are not really any other subs with a relevant user base.\n\n1. Neck pain started last summer, it is like there is intense pressure inside the neck\n2. After several appointments with the doctor and a physiologist I started doing neck strength exercises a few weeks ago\n3. Roughly a week ago I started having extreme balance issues, feels like neck and back of the head are spinning up/down/left/right\n4. No nausea or eye problems, no spinning room sensation\n5. Severe headache around temples and jaw muscles that goes away momentarily following a self massage\n6. Minor ear issues such as tickling sensation and occasional whistling sounds\n7. If I stop moving, the balance cycling increases in intensity\n8. All the symptoms clear in a moving car and for a few hours following sleep.\n9. Self testing with Epley's maneuver etc. other BPPV 'remedies' are unsuccessful\n10. I have not been on a voyage or anything whilst I understand these symptoms match MdDS.\n\nRight now and for the past few days, it is either intense neck pain OR the balance spinning. Posting here in case anyone could even wildly guess what is wrong with my balance system. Got an appointment with the doctor in a few days but always tried to be able to describe possibilities myself. Could this still be MdDS or is it possible for neck-related balance issues to be temporarily cured in a moving vehicle?\n\n  \nOh yeah and I went to ER the day after these symptoms started and after all the possible blood and monitoring tests they said there is nothing alarmingly-wrong so it is either related to inner ear balance mechanism, the brain or the spine. I am sorry you are not feeling well.\n\nHm. For me, my neck has been super stiff and in pain since my BPPV started. But I think it is from being tense for so long trying to not put my head in any vertigo triggering positions. Since treating the vertigo/BPPV my neck pain and tension has gradually subsided.\n\nCould you be having TMJ? Sometimes that can cause neck issues as well. Sorry I could not be more help. I hope you find answers and relief at your next doctors visit. I thought I had MdDs as well. It affects mostly middle aged women who have done some sort of travel recently (boat, plane, etc). So if you do not match any of those criteria it is pretty rare (but still possible) that you have it.\n\nThe symptoms got better for me as well in elevators, busses, and cars. I got VNG tested and they found no trace of bppv, however they noticed a faint downbeating nystagamus  which could be a sign of a central balance disorder. I also had the same symptoms of heavy head, and also suffer from TMJ and tight jaw/neck muscles from an injury few years back. This problem has gotten better over time, and it started directly after treating BPPV in the right ear.\n\nI still have to see a neurologist and I will let you know if I get a diagnosis since our condition seems related. Thanks for the reply! I have gone through neurologist (including CT scan &amp; MRI), ENT (including BPPV &amp; hearing tests) and cardiologist but all tests were negative and completely normal. In fact they all said it is very likely a muscle reorganization process related to neck strengthening exercises I started after neck pain, which causes an unknown central balance disorder as you said. Any updates since Nope, same symptoms ongoing. I do not know how people get rid of MDDS", "After effects? Does anyone else here feel weird for a few days even after the feelings of vertigo/spinning have passed? I just feel kind of off and strange. \n\nIt is not helping that my anxiety keeps getting bad as a result of feeling strange. \n\nI guess I just wanted to talk to some other people that deal with this so that I do not feel so alone.", "Is this BPPV? A week ago I went on a strenuous bike ride. My bike is new and likely not set to my height correctly so I came home with a lot of pain and tension in my neck and eventually a tension headache. \n\nSince Sunday ive been experiencing lightheadedness and dizziness. It seems to get worse through the day - I wake up every morning feeling great. But once my day gets going the fog / dizziness starts. On Wednesday I had another tension headache or light migraine. \n\nThe dizziness is not extreme - I say it is like being on a light water bed, gentle gentle swaying. The lightheadedness can sometimes be distracting and cause anxiety (and thus even more lightheadedness). \n\nI do notice sometimes it is made worse when my neck is bent forward and I am looking down (eg I am cooking). But truthfully have not noticed that a specific movement causes the dizziness or makes it worse. However, when I lie down it relieves a bit. I have a lot of tension in my back / shoulders. \n\nMy blood pressure is normal, no fever, no other symptoms. \n\nCould this be vertigo? I am seeing a doctor Tuesday but curious if this sounds familiar to any of you. Doesnt sound like BPPV to me. But to be sure, you should be diagnosed by a specialist. it could possibly be bppv.\n\ni had bppv back in late feb '20 (feb 22 to be exact) and all of march and like you my dizziness started that evening after a pretty hard bike ride. to make a very long story short it was not until i finally went to see an ent (ear nose and throat dr) that my symptoms were resolved. the ent performed a test/procedure that confirmed my bppv then performed the epley maneuver on me twice to resolve my dizziness. i was finally cured and could ride again after over a month of not riding. balance is kind of important with riding a bike. :)\n\nnote: attempting to perform the epley on your own is possible but i was not able to do it myself. i was doing it wrong i guess. plus you need to be sure you actually have bppv before attempting the epley.\n\ni highly recommend seeing an ent dr to help diagnose your dizziness. my ent dr was awesome. Could possibly be some pressure tension nerves in your neck that could cause that type of feeling. I have been experiencing the exact same sensation. But I also agree getting evaluated by an ent will be helpful to see where your vertigo is coming What is it been like for you? How would you describe the dizziness sensation compared to the lightheadedness Look into cervicogenic dizziness. It is related to neck tension and sometimes a neck/back massage can help. Also the half somersault maneuver could help, If it is bppv. You just need to determine which side is the problem. Also reducing sodium and increasing vitamin d (like 3x the recommended amount) might help. These are all suggestions that I found throughout this sub that seem to have helped me. I hope you find relief. The way I define it, BPPV comes with vertigo (room spinning sensation with potential nausea).  During my worst BPPV/vertigo attack, I was incapable of even sitting, while with milder ones I could walk up the stairs and to the bed on my own, but neither ever felt like I had no control over my body (other than orientation) or that I was weak/about to faint.\n\nDizziness means I feel unsteady OR my environment seems to be unsteady (this is what I believe can be caused by both BPPV or something else).  Same as vertigo, while I do not have a good sense of balance with this, I do not have other body sensations like I am about to drop down or faint.\n\nLightheadedness is a feeling like I am about to faint - my vision gets narrowed, I have tingly body sensations, sense of weakness etc.\n\nAll three have their gradations from mild to severe, but to me are quite distinct.", "Working out for post bppv residual dizziness. Hi guys,\nI have heard that working out really helps with dizziness and vertigo, and exercising should be recommended for those having vestibular issues. Has anyone noticed improvement in the residual dizziness with exercising and i dont mean just VRT i mean working out like weight lifting or running or walking an so on. I still have some residual dizziness after my last bppv that is gotten much better with VRT and time but wondering if exercising has shown for you some good noticeable results in even reducing recurrence of bppv. Thanks! Thank you for posting in r/BPPV!\n\nJust a reminder that you may find the answer to your question in the ( or through the (\n\nIf you are posting a tip and not a question, be sure to use the green \"Tip\" flair.\n\nWe are happy to share our knowledge and experiences with you as well as offer support as necessary. Welcome again to r/BPPV!\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please (/message/compose/?to=/r/BPPV) if you have any questions or concerns.* I have always continued to weight lift through my episodes and use my exercise bike every morning.  I feel like it definitely helps me mentally to focus on my workout instead of thinking about how I feel dizzy.  Some days it is hard since bending over to pick up weights and especially laying down on the bench and getting back up can cause some anxiety, but I think it helps to go through different body positions.  With the vestibular exercise it is usually just moving eyes and head, so I personally think staying active helps. running helped me a lot! I spent a month in bed when I first got it, and literally had to learn walking again. had a lot of balance issue plus the residual dizziness from the bppv! Running in straight line helped in my recovery, at least I think so!  \n I am still recovering 8 months later, but I am much better now .. Do it but be careful if you run in public. take it easy and be safe I continued to be active during my BPPV. The last time BPPV lasted for over two months &amp; I was running &amp; snowmobiling during &amp; after (along with a few other hobbies). I think continuing to be active after helped my residual dizziness as well. The exercises my vestibular therapist gave me... I would do them while running! Many of them started while I was sitting or standing... Then we would move up to me doing them while walking. My therapist was shocked when I told her I would do them while running too! \ud83d\ude02 I was desperate to get better! As seasons changed I was then biking &amp; riding horse. I think it all helps your system adapt. And for ME.... It helped keep my mind busy so I did not constantly worry about it coming back. Helped the anxiety a ton to keep busy. So happy I came across your comment.. I as well was so bad when I first got this.. bed ridden for two weeks and then I had to learn how to walk again.. i must ask.. when you first ran for the first time how did you feel? The first time I ran was about 6 months in.. it was something so difficult to explain.. It felt like the road was wavy and my eyes where bouncing around up and down as I ran.. Did you have a similar experience? Your comment really gives me motivation to try running.. slow and short distance obviously. And work myself up... I wonder if this would help! I am a little over a year with these symptoms now! you start by walking first for a month or so, until dizziness becomes weaker when you move your head in any direction, then you start running lightly in straight line! remember running in this condition is very dangerous! so take very very easy! I still get dizziness 8 months later, when I move my head really fast  \n\n\n!when I first tried to walk on my own, I was like a drunk-walking lol and people looked at me weirdly : )but baby steps! now, I can run freely till I get tired without any problems .. mostly! Thank you so much for getting back to me!! Yes me as well! Everyone is looking at me funny :') I walk around the block about 3-4 times a day when I am well.. I am going to start attempting running to see if it will get rid of some dizziness!! When I first started I could not even go around the block once. I have come a very long way as well! Glad to hear you can run !! I hope you can get rid of all of your symptoms! Im only running around the house now lol..but feeling fine and want to start running by the beach It was horrible at first for me too! But our balance system heals with time \ud83d\ude0a Worrying about it coming back is annoying for sure so im sure exercising will help with that and in turn reduce recurrence which is stress related You should do it!  I usually feel better outside and that sounds great!", "Would BPPV be causing these symptoms and anxiety? In October of 2020 I got dental work done and immediately 3 days later started having symptoms of Brain Fog, Lightheadedness, Faint feeling (out of no where I will just feel like I can fall down) and just generally I feel very off, out of it and spacey. My vision is blurry as well. Along with these symptoms I have developed pretty bad anxiety as no doctor knows what is going on and I have been dealing for 7 months now. I have heavy head pressure in the top back of my head which maybe developed from the anxiety or constantly feeling out of it (brain overworking and not functioning properly maybe caused it). I have been to a few doctors who noticed my eyes were twitching (like astigmatism) as well but others did not say they noticed this. I have these symptoms 24/7 and they have me constantly on edge unable to really drive or exercise or do much of anything without fear of fainting or just getting very lightheaded. Is is possible that this is BPPV and has anyone deal with a similar situation? If so, how was it resolved and how long did it take to start feeling better. I am 7 Months into this and have not been given much of anything to work with from doctors and I have seen many specialists and gotten many scans but I am beginning to think that it is BPPV in my ear causing the visual and spacey feelings which are then causing my constant state of anxiety which is then causing the tension/heavy head feeling in the back of my head. Any feedback or direction is much appreciated, thanks I have the exact same symptoms. 24/7.  Is soon on my 6th month now. Been diagnosed with bppv by two different doctors. Im in close contact with a physical therapist, and regular therapist for the anxiety and dissociation. Im Seeing some slight improvement in symptoms, but still very much present. I have also been in contact with a lot of people who struggle with the same symptoms, so you are definitely not the only one. Did they do the maneuvers do fix the lost crystal. You are symptoms are exact same? Do you have the head pressure too To a T. Exactly the same. Sometimes it feels like head pressure, other times it feels more like a fog or heaviness. \nYeah, my doctor did the epley on me a few times, but my PT does another thing where he shakes my head rapidly to trigger an attack and he does this in a particular motion, multiple times. I have not been given any other manouvers. How long did it take to go away or is it still unresolved? Still unresolved. Slight improvement as times goes by. Im apparently responding to treatment and my PT tells me that im close to a full recovery soon, but probably not as soon as i would hope. How long have you got treatment My first BPPV happened 5 days after a root canal procedure. It was last July. Since then, I have had 3-4 more bppv episodes. Last one was December Been to tens of doctors and tests. Visited a vestibular therapist on January She fixed my bppv by doing epley. Also gave me some exercises to do. After that I got better. I have not had vertigo since Jan and have not had any major dizziness since then. But I sleep on a high pillow, and I never ever lay on my right (bad) side anymore (since Jan). Thought this might help you. 3 months maybe suggest you see an ear nose and throat (ent) dr or vestibular specialist if you havent already. they will know if it bppv. How long did you have residual dizziness after bppv?  Will it be possible to give us some details on what those vestibular exercises were? I had the residuals for 5-6 months. Even now that I have had 2-3 months without residuals, I experience the lightheadedness sometimes, but it is for a few minute or so, not like before that I had dizziness (feeling of being on a boat) 24/7. \n\nThe exercises that PT gave me were so particular. I guess you can find them on youtube. Their goal is mostly to retrain the brain. Some of those were:\n1. Sit on the edge of the bed. Then get up and sit down for like 10 times in a row while looking at some far object. \n2. Do number 1 but this time rotate your head while sitting and getting up, like you are chasing something in a far distance with you eyes. \n3. Get a ball in your hands, and move your hands clockwise and anti clockwise. Try to look at the ball all the time. \n4. Get on a treadmill with a very slow speed (walking speed). While walking on it, try to move your head to right and left (like you are staring at something that moves in a horizontal line) \n5. Do number 4 but this time moving your head up and down. And some other similar exercises.\n\nThese exercises help your brain trust the balance signals coming from your inner ear. I am NAD, but based on my understanding, the balance signals that your brain gets are coming from your inner ears, your eyes, and your legs. Execs 1 and 2 strengthen signals that come from your legs. Execs 4 and 5 makes the brain to listen to your inner ear signals, because the signals going from your legs and eyes are not trustworthy at that moment (because your legs are telling your brain that you are walking while you are not really, and signals that your eyes send are confusing because you are moving your head constantly).\n\nMost of these exercises are definitely on YouTube. I hope my experience could help you. But hang in there.  I completely understand how bad it is, and I hope someday they find an instant cure for this nightmare. Thank you so much for these notes. These are some great pointers that I will def incorporate. I had bppv for only 4 days total. Got rid of it myself doing the epley maneuver a few tines...but been having residuals for the past month and a half. I feel like I have been stuck on 60 to 70 percent the entire time with very little improvement....thanks again! Sure. I hope the exercises help you too. And yes it is awful. I have been better in the past 2-3 months. but I have an international 13-hour flight in two weeks, and I am super scared and worried that the vertigo or dizziness happen during the flight. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude22 I have a 14 hour flight in 2 weeks. I have been pushing my flight further and further back the past month bc of the residuals. If I do actually fly in 2 weeks I will update you on how I feel afterwards. Ah. Is your flight before mine? Mine is Friday May 14th. Ah I must have read your reply wrong..I thought you said 2 months. Mine is on the 15th of may...hopefully. Ah, cool. So I will let you know how I feel after the flight. \ud83d\ude01 \ud83d\ude05 yeah. Thank you I would appreciate that. Have a safe flight! Do you drink caffeine or alcohol? My dizziness from BPPV would not improve until I cut caffeine completely and cut way back on alcohol. I do not drink any coffee or alcohol....did you go back to your normal routine while having residual dizziness or did you get a lot of bedrest? I had to go back to work as my employer did not believe it was a real thing. So I ended up working with the dizziness for 2-3 weeks... zoned out on meclizine and taking zofran. All in all it took me about 6-8 weeks for the dizziness to subside. This was last fall. That being said... my balance still is not 100%. Hoping it improves over time. wow that sounds horrible...especially bc you are telling me your balance is not 100% yet.....how long did you have bppv for?", "Do you really need a doctor? I had lots of dizzy spells when I was a kid (10\u201317 years old). Then they abruptly stopped for 20 years. I think they were due to a car accident when I was 10 where I had a skull fracture.\n\nThis morning I turned over in bed and got the familiar dizziness. My question is, do you really need a doctor to tell you how to diagnose and fix this? Everything I am reading suggests BPPV, and I looked up articles on how to tell which ear is affected and how to do the Epley maneuver. (It has not helped yet.) But it seems going to the doctor would cost weeks of time and hundreds of dollars just to gain some very simple information that is probably available for free somewhere. Thoughts? Sometimes it takes a while. Is it constant or positional? It was fine moving around in the shower. Seems to only trigger when I tilt my head up and down, or lie down (but it stabilizes after I do those things if I stay still). Yeah, it sounds like BPPV. There are several different variations of movements that you can try. The last time I had it, I was trying all of them and finally got relief. Since it took me so long to fix, I had some residual dizziness that faded over a couple of weeks. Youtube is a good resource. Hope you get it figured out, vertigo sucks. If you have determined which ear is effected by doing the Dix Hallpike (first step of the Epley), go ahead and do the Epley.  It took me 20 Epley to clear the crystal (over a 2 month time span).  My therapist would do the Epley twice in the office. The second time was basically to test to see if the symptoms were gone. Then I would not do it again for a week. If you caught it right away, you may not have a stubborn case like mine.  You may want to do the Epley a few times one day, rest the next day, then try it again a few days later.  It seems each therapist gives different instructions regarding how often to do the Epley.  \n\nI did not go to the doctor/therapist for my first 3 episodes. They went away on their own and I knew little about BPPV. This last episode was a doozy and I sought treatment/help.  If it happened again, I would likely treat at home.\n\nThere is also a maneuver called the Half Somersault (Foster) that could be helpful as well.\n\nIf you have something more going on than basic BPPV - that is where a therapist would come in handy. They put goggles on and watch the nystagmus (twitching) of your eyes - the Nystagmus helps indicate which inner ear canal is effected.  They also do different tests to check all 6 inner ear canals.  Which results in different maneuvers to clear the crystal.\n\nIf you are confident that it is BPPV and are not over the top scared/sick - I would feel very ok with you trying to treat it at home.  There have been comments from others on this sub that have read through many responses and treated at home and it is helped/worked.  Reasons for suggesting seeing a specialist is if they also have some bizarre symptoms, or are afraid to try to treat themselves at home. I think you are confident enough to give it a whirl.\n\nBest wishes to you! I hope you get on top of it and get it cleared up! Were your month long symptoms a violent spinning or a \"on a boat\" feeling? Thanks everyone who replied! I did the Epley about 4 times. It did not immediately resolve anything, but as I have been up and around during the course of the day, I feel 99% better now. Who knows if it will come back when I go to bed tonight. I do not really want to try to \"sleep\" inclined, because there would not be much sleeping. Well for the two months I had active BPPV, I would get the 30ish seconds of violent vertigo with eye twitching if I positioned my head wrong (some of the positions in the Epley... Tipping my head back, down to the side). I avoided those positions that I knew triggered it, except for when I did the Epley. Just daily moving around triggered waves of milder dizziness that made me nauseous. Perhaps like being on a boat. That residual dizziness remained for months after the bppv was corrected, as my body tried to adapt to being balanced again. I got BPPV from a car wreck and couple other TBIs -- I got diagnosed and was basically told there was no medicine or anything that would help--just the epley manuevre and others (but they do not seem to do anything for me). I did not feel 100% better until a day or two after the maneuver, which is considered normal Your body needs time to adjust everything. Also, you do not need to sleep inclined, just on the opposite side of your affected ear", "Traveling/camping with BPPV Hey everyone - just found this sub and looking for advice. Sorry in advance for the long back-story...\n\nBeen dealing with what I suspected was BPPV for at least 5 years now, but was stubborn/scared and did not seek treatment. \n\nI am 35 now, but have a history of ear infections as a child, hearing loss in the same ear (left) - and in my senior year of High School had a bout of vertigo that lasted two months, which was later diagnosed by a neurologist as having been caused by overuse of an antibiotic (the family doctor prescribed me Doxycycline to clear up my acne, which I took several times a day for months). When I stopped the antibiotic, the vertigo cleared up and I was fine for a long time after. Not sure if any of this is related. \n\nIn the last five years or more - if my head tilts back too far in bed, I will immediately get intense world spinning vertigo where I cannot focus my eyes for roughly 15-30 seconds before it calms down and stops. Same thing would happen when getting my hair washed for a haircut. Ended up just propping my head up when I sleep, and would warn the hair stylist to ensure my head held upright when washing. When I did get an attack when tilting my head back, it would be insane for 30 seconds, but would clear up and would not linger. \n\nFinally saw an ENT this week who diagnosed BPPV and gave me the Epley Maneuver. I was pretty terrified. Seems my right ear is the issue, but the actual vertigo the Epley Maneuver triggered only lasted around 5-10 seconds and was rather mild. Left side was nothing, and back up to sitting position was nothing. It was not that bad. \n\nThat night, I slept propped up at a 45 degree angle and avoided sleeping on my side. The next night, I tried my left side (non-affected side), but could not escape the mental anxiety and slept horribly. Basically all this week I have felt 'off' and uneasy. It almost feels like residual dizziness as other have mentioned, which has never happened to me previously. \n\nTomorrow, I am leaving on a two week road-trip with my girlfriend (Airbnb's and camping). A few times in the past, I have had what felt like a 'falling' sensation take place when trying to sleep in a tent. It might have had something to do with sleeping on a slight incline, since it is tough to get a perfectly level surface when camping. It sounds crazy, but it felt like I was slipping off the edge of the earth. \n\nIronically, last summer we went camping for one night and although I was scared, I had no issue sleeping and did not get the 'falling' sensation. \n\nJust wanted to see if anyone else has experienced issues when traveling, and more specifically sleeping on the ground in a tent. For now, my plan is to take two pillows and prop my head up, and drink lots of water. I am also considering taking Meclizine with just in case. \n\nAny advice? Its normal to feel anxious about things from time to time, but I have good news for you: The worst thing that you have is some vertigo. For the most part, if you understand your triggers, it is not dangerous and mostly completely annoying. For me it manifests as nausea and nystagmus, without actually feeling \"dizzy\" or losing my balance. Just motion sickness and my eyes constantly searching for the horizon.\n\nBut what I have learned after having it on and off for almost a year: Do not hesitate to do an Epley maneuver at home. There are videos in the FAQ of this sub that walk through how to do it. I limit them to 1x each day. \n\nI always make sure two pillows are available in case I wake up motion sick like I often do. Another trigger for me is poor posture. In fact bad posture is my number one trigger.\n\nAgain, do not wait to do an Epley maneuver to reset your ears when symptoms show up. It takes less than 5 minutes and it is very effective. Thanks for the advice! Yeah, I have been telling myself that I know my main trigger (head all the way back) - but the uneasy feeling all week has thrown me off. \n\nAlso, the paperwork the ENT sent me home with said to keep my head upright and avoid triggering it for one week. After a week, then I can test and perform the Epley at home. Not sure if this is common after the maneuver?\n\nI think I am just going to stay positive and avoid any head movements that might trigger it for the next two weeks while I am gone. I am also interested in seeing a Vestibular Therapist for ongoing therapy/help. From what I have been told from 2 different vestibular therapists is that the longer you had bppv and did not treat it the longer the residual dizziness can last.  I would do what you plan to be on the safe side, but when you get home I would see a pt or VT to help you get through this.  Your brain learned to adjust to those loose crystals for 2 years so you will now feel off as your brain now needs to adjust again.  I like Joey remenyi youtube videos.  She has great advice on this.", "Is it really just residual dizziness ? I tried the epley myself about 10 days ago after finding out I would get positional dizziness on my right side. Ever since, I have been experiencing a floaty/wobbly feeling, as if my balance has been completely recalibrated. And it was quite debilitating at first, but now that I have gotten used to it, I am able to do a bit more.\n\n I have seen 2 ENTs, both said that I was completely fine, and one of them saying that it might be anxiety induced. I have also seen a vestibular PT (after I did the maneuvers myself) which ran all tests, and all came back negative. The only answer I got at the moment is the possibility of residual dizziness, however the PT told me that it would only last up to a 5-6 days. It is been 10 days now and I have not seen any significant progress. And both ENTs dismissed the idea of it being residual dizziness from BPPV... Has anyone else been in this situation? I am getting quite worried about this. \n\nTL;DR: Tried epley 10 days ago. All vestibular PT tests negative. None of the medical professionals I have seen have given me an answer, and many dismiss that it is residual dizziness.", "Strange symptoms, BPPV and Vestibular migraines. So I have re occurring BPPV and Vestibular migraine. It becomes very difficult to tell if symptoms are coming from BPPV and if I need to focus on consistent VRT or Migraine and I need to take my rescue med and rest. Also BPPV episodes can trigger my VM making things more complicated. \n\nI preform the Dix Hallpike maneuver to confirm BPPV, then typically follow through with the Epley maneuver. After I know it is BPPV and not VM I focus on VRT but I get some really odd symptoms.\n\u2022 My tongue tingling \n\u2022The back of my head tingling uncomfortably \n\u2022My head feeling like it is buzzing/shaking rapidly \n\u2022 Brain fog/trouble finding words\n\nThese only happen after BPPV. Does anyone else experience these symptoms? I treat it with wearing an ice hat, light vrt, and rest. Also wearing a soft neck brace really helps after Epley. Helps keep my chin from dipping. \n\nThese symptoms make working absolute hell. I work retail at night and finding ways to not move my head a lot or look down at all is challenging, especially when stocking shelves or ringing at the register. I wish BPPV was taken more seriously by doctors, I wish it had a cure. I agree. I wish this was taken more seriously. Manny people have never heard of it. And when you explain it to them they do not understand. I almost feel drunk and hungover at the same time. And I say. Imagine feeling that for this long. I think that I am having vestibular migraines as well. Very bad pressure in my head. Eye pain. Eye strain. Headaches. It feels like someone has taken a piece of wood and bashed me across the forehead with it. You are not alone I feel your pain. I have had this for 4 months now. First started with vertigo for two weeks. Vertigo got better but now only feeling heavy from back of head, strained eye movements, migraines. It is not too bad in the morning but gets bad as day progresses. Am doing therapy for this month and hopefully it helps. In addition, always have clogged ears as well", "20 years of vertigo Lately, the one thing that kicks my vertigo into high gear is the change of barometric pressure. Spring and autumn are the worst times for me. I wish there was a way to make it go away. Have you been diagnosed with BPPV?", "Successful canalith repositioning. Still having headaches, light tinnitus, hearing sensitivity, minor imbalance, etc. Anyone else have similar symptoms after positional vertigo has been resolved? After weeks of Epley, BBQ roll, liberatory manuever, on March 10 my neurologist noticed no nystagmus performing the Dix-Hallpike test on both ears. I have been having on and off headaches since February 22, sometimes light, sometimes a little stronger. I have been performing VOR exercises since March 12th home to help get my balance back. I am wondering if anyone else has symptoms like this after BPPV was resolved? I am thankful the BPPV vertigo has stopped. I am just hoping these other symptoms start to fade. yep. One week out. Yep - seems pretty standard and good to see you are taking all the right steps.\n\nTakes me months anywhere from 3-6 before I feel some level of normality. \n\nExercises are key! I have dealt with all that - the residual yuckiness lasting about 8 months. Still have some stuff going on, but I am learning to just live with it.  If you search through the sub - you will find MANY deal with some sort of residual stuff (it varies from person to person).  In fact, after my BPPV was resolved (it took over 2 months and I was seeing a vestibular therapist weekly), I felt almost worse - and kept making my therapist test all 6 inner ear canals and do other tests, as I thought I was doomed with something horrible.  I also found that recovery was SLOW.  Like, in a weeks time, I would notice a slight improvement (not daily).  I was doing VOR exercises as well and remained VERY active with running and other hobbies. Best wishes to you! Hope your MRI comes out spotless! Just to follow up in case someone else sees this. My symptoms with BPPV are basically gone. One month to fix crystals (could have been faster if I went to a vestibular therapist immediately, I could not get an appointment quicker.) 1 month of gaze stabilization and balance exercises. So happy to hear this!", "BPPV still cured weeks later! So I had BPPV for 6 months everything I laid down and changed sides I would get it pretty intensely. I did a form of the maneuver that was given to me in the paperwork from the doctor a couple times and it did nothing so I gave up honestly and just thought it would go away on its own. I thought I was stuck with BPPV. I came across a video on YouTube and wanted to give it another shot to cure it and this worked!!! I only did it twice in the same day and has not came back since and it has been weeks. I highly recommend these exact movements.\n\n\n\n The Epley maneuver helped me, too!\n\nIf you want more information on BPPV, click/tap ( That is horrible.... No one needs to live with BPPV and I am glad you were able to fix your vertigo by following the Epley manoeuvre. \n\nIf the video talked about Nystagmus it would get a 10/10 from me\n\nThe eye beating is VERY important when testing each side as it tells the therapist which canal is affected. It is also used as another symptom to confirm a BPPV diagnosis. \n\nFor others who find this post I would highly recommend that you see a specalist and not try this at home as your first step as you can make things worse. \n\nRepositioning needs to be followed through from start to finish just like the video showed but as the vertigo is brought on by the repositioning it can become rather distressing and you may just pull your self out to stop the vertigo. This is a bad idea as by stopping you could potentially move some crystals in to another canal making recovery much harder.\n\nBy seeing a specalist they will help you push through the moves and you are more then likely going to perform the manoeuvre properly.\n\nBTW - some people report instant resolution, others report multiple sessions ie weeks or even months of sessions before they start to feel better. Sometimes these pesky crystals will not budge!! \n\nIf you do fix your BPPV but feel residual dizziness, your therapist can also help you with balance exercises which a lot of us have found help. A fantastic post with LOTS of good information posted in the comments.

So, today is Tuesday. Last Wednesday night was when I had my first BPPV attack and Thursday was the peak as i felt very nauseous due to the vertigo. I have done some head exercises including the epley and apparently one of those worked because the next day (Friday) i did not feel nauseous. However, ever since Friday, I still feel slightly dizzy when I turn my head. Any tips? Give it some time.  Some people say they feel nauseous for several days.  I usually have about 2 days of feeling off. I try to sleep on my unaffected side. Just keep epley-ing! Like multiple times per day. When I had my first episode I had it for 6 months and I still could not shake the dizziness after for a few months as well. My ent told me that residual dizziness usually happens within 30 days after a standard episode and correction, but can happen for months, and last months, after depending on the length and severity of your bppv. However you can just get random episodes of dizziness at anytime from just having bppv. \n\nMy therapist also said that within the next 5 years not only is it more likely to happen again but also it is common to experience residual dizziness. I had active BPPV for over 2 months and my residual dizziness lasted close to 8 months.  If they crystal is cleared (tested by the first step of the Epley - also called the Dix Hallpike), then doing the Epley over and over likely will not help you any more, as that maneuver is to move the dislodged crystal to it is correct spot.  If the crystal was successfully relocated - you are likely just left with residual dizziness. The best thing is to get back to normal activities as soon as possible.  My info comes from working for a few months with a vestibular therapist that did a lot of testing and gave me a lot of exercises to do to help my system get back to normal.  For many, within a week, they feel better. For others (like me), it took MONTHS. I still get dizzy (mildly) when I turn my head certain directions - and it is been over a year. I am so sorry you have been going through that for over a year. I cannot imagine. I greatly appreciate the advice thanks Same here. My residual dizziness lasts for a few months, but I noticed it is gotten shorter now because I know that I have to continue moving despite my dizziness. Yes, I still work, walk outside, even lift weights if I feel less dizzy than normal.\n\nStaying in bed and waiting for the dizziness to go away is a mistake I made during my first attack. It just prolonged my symptoms to 3 months. Now, my my most recent BPPV gave me residual dizziness for just a few hours. I made my residual dizziness worse too - by keeping still.  I was still active, but kept my  head so perfectly still....and it caused 'gaze instability' So, along with positional vertigo, I would get waves of dizziness just while being still (closing my eyes, watching TV, etc).  So yes, being active is the best you can do! And as my therapist told me - 'challenge the dizziness (this is AFTER BPPV is corrected).  If you turn your head one way and it causes that mild dizziness - perform that maneuver 15 times - 3 times a day. That helps your body get back in sync (not technical terms - but in my own words!) I had an attack of it about 2 weeks back and the residual thing hung around for about 10 days for me", "Involuntary rapid eye movements and bppv will not go away (22F) I first experienced bppv 6 months ago and it never goes away for more than a week. At the moment it is a good few days a week. I also have involuntary rapid eye movements when I experience it and have no control over my vision at all. \n\nFrom reading posts it would seem that it should have stopped by now given the frequency of other people\u2019s. \n\nDoes anyone have it this frequently and experience the eye movements? It is massively impacting my life now. I do the Epley manoeuvre and that triggers my eyes and sometimes helps but other times it does not and I am extremely nauseous.\n\nDoes this impact anyone\u2019s ability to drive? I am concerned about that. Yes, if it the eye stigmitisms are like what i had combined with bppv this causes severe imbalance and loss of equilibrium which could make it very dangerous to drive. I would recommend drinking lots of water and buying apple juice, about one to two cups of apple juice a day can help clean your body of impurities and help you kidneys out. (My bppv was due to kidney toxicity, just something to think about yourself). As far as the eye stigmatism, mine went away about the same time my balance returned. Which took about a week. Keep the faith and be strong, it will go away eventually. Have you seen a doctor about it? I have episodes for a solid two months unless I treat them (that is, I get the vertigo every time I do a movement for 2 months, not constant vertigo for that long). Doing the Epley myself has not given me the same relief as a doctor doing it. Maybe I time it wrong or do not move my head right. If you have not seen a specialist yet it might be worth giving a try. Also, are you sure you are treating the correct canal? If you have not seen a dr, please do so.\n\nAlso, the Epley maneuver should not be done repeatedly or you can cause yourself more harm (which is why you need to see a dr!)", "Ailments that mimic BPPV: Vertical Heterophoria, Vestibular neuritis I know that this is a sub specific to BPPV.. but I feel like ENTs tend to hand out blanket diagnosis' of \"BPPV\" when there seem to be many other possible causes of dizziness &amp; vertigo out there, in case you all are looking for answers out there like I am, or are looking to ask your ENT about other options.\n\n**Vertical Heterophoria**  \nSource:\n\n(\n\n&gt;Vertical Heterophoria (VH) is a condition where the two eyes have difficulty keeping in vertical alignment.\n\nSome potential symptoms...\n\n* additional **pain symptoms** such as face ache, eye pain or pain with eye movement (symptoms similar to sinus problems, migraines, TMJ problems); neck ache and upper back pain due to a head tilt (symptoms similar to spinal misalignment problems);\n* additional **vestibular symptoms** such as motion sickness, nausea, poor depth perception, unsteadiness while walking or drifting to one side while walking (\u201cI have always been clumsy\u201d), lack of coordination (symptoms are similar to those seen in patients with MS, sequela of a stroke, an inner ear disorder or Meniere\u2019s Disease);\n* **reading symptoms** such as difficulty with concentration (symptoms are similar to those experienced with ADHD), difficulty with reading and comprehension, skipping lines while reading, losing one\u2019s place while reading, words running together while reading (symptoms similar to those seen with a learning disability);&gt; **vision symptoms** such as blurred vision, double or overlapping vision, shadowed vision (symptoms similar to those seen in patients with MS); light sensitivity, difficulty with glare or reflection;\n\nAnd then there is **Vestibular Neuritis.**  \nSource: (\n\n&gt; Vestibular neuritis is a disorder that affects the nerve of the inner ear called the vestibulocochlear nerve.\n\nSymptoms include:\n\n* Sudden, severe vertigo (spinning/swaying sensation)\n* Dizziness\n* Balance difficulties\n* Nausea, vomiting\n* Concentration difficulties\n\nThis one usually clears up quickly, HOWEVER,\n\n&gt;Some patients can experience balance and dizziness problems that can last for several months.\n\n  \nI hope this helps anyone who is on a quest to figure out their own dizziness! Vestibular Neuritis seems to describe my situation. I have gone through multiple eply and other physical therapies to no lasting effects.  I have improved slowly for 4 months but have plateaued.  \n\nAre there any treatments?  Pretty miserable to live like this.  :( I really, really appreciate this post. While it is obviously important to receive new Info with a discerning mind, I am also always grateful to be learning more... thanks!! I do not know! I think at least with that one it settles, or you can take steroids to get things back on track but vestibular therapy seems to be the way to go.\n\n\ud83d\udc97 you can do exersizes to train your vertigo perception again. basically you should expose yourself to activities that will make you dizzy. I have the same and have now relapsed which brings my suffering to a miserable 8 months total of which I had 1.5 months almost no symptoms at all. Really weird stuff. I just completed a visit to the ENT and was indeed diagnosed with Vestibular Nuritus.  A few interesting (if depressing) bits of info:\n\n* It is caused by a virus that attacks the nerve that transmits signals from the balance system in the ear to the brain. \n* Damage to the nerve is typically caused in the first 24 hours and is permanent.  If anyone has violent vertigo symptoms get to the Dr in the first 24 hours and it can be treated with steroids.  After 24 hours steroids not helpful \n* Recovery can take up to 2 years \n* 75% of patients fully recover.  \n* Only treatment is to do activities that make you dizzy.  Take walks, pick up things from the ground, etc. \n\nFor those with symptoms like mine, I feel for you.  Good luck and do not give up hope.  ye I have been also reading a lot about it from medical studies. it is only suspected it is viral, they do not really know and tries to help with antivirals were less successful than with cortisone. the rest seems about right and another positive thing is that relapses are very rare like 2-3% within next 5 years.  Yeah I asked about anti-virals and they said it has not been shown to have a positive impact.  I should have asked about anti-inflammatories.  I think the virus (if indeed it is viral) causes inflammation of the nerve which contributes to the damage.  My sense though is that the damage is done in the first 24 hours and there is not much to be done after that regarding direct treatment.  ", "Can you prevent BPPV? I (33F, overall no health concerns aside from this) started getting BPPV when I was around 19. Over the past 10-15-ish years I had very very few instances of BPPV and suddenly this year got it 3 times in around 6-7 months. Now I am constantly anxious it will come back at any moment. It is not brought on by anything specific (as far as I can tell),  rather I would wake up one day feeling bad and by mid-day, would be unable to change the position of my head without severe dizziness, nausea, etc. You guys know the rest :\\ \n\nEpley maneuvers help sometimes, but never 100%, and when I have it, I am just laid out on the sofa for 3 days. Now that I have gotten it so many times in such a short time frame, I cannot stop worrying about when it will come back. \n\nI would love any advice as to any preventative measures you guys have had success with, and of course if I can offer any more information on my particular situation that would help, please let me know! Some research says vitamin d deficiency can increase risk of crystals breaking off.  You could check that and supplement.  Unfortunately I am in same boat as you are.  I have had 2 episodes this year and my initial one had residual dizziness for 5 months.  Just had another episode Sunday night and I cannot pinpoint a reason.  My vitamin d level is on the high side around 70 on my blood work. I have no known triggers for BPPV either.  Had 3 shorter bouts within 2 years. Did not really know much about it and was not really treated.  The last episode lasted over 2 months and I went to multiple specialists and found a vestibular therapist to treat me and help me through it.  Horrible residual dizziness lasted almost a year.\n\nI am not on any medications, no medical conditions, healthy, Vitamin D levels are good, no past trauma, I do not drink, rarely have caffeine, do not overindulge in salty foods, and am very physically active and in good shape. The only negative thing is that I was under a lot of stress (that I felt I was handling quite well), when my first episode hit.\n\nThe worse thing is the anxiety that comes with this. I can totally relate to your anxiety about it coming back.  And the anxiety feeds the milder residual dizziness.  So I have worked very hard to keep busy and try to not think about it.  One thing I hold tight to - is that I now have a vestibular therapist that I can go to with the drop of a hat if it does come back for help.  I have been free of BPPV for a bit over a year and a half now.  Still have mild dizziness daily. Still think about it daily (especially when laying down in bed at night). It was a long road to recovery. But there IS a light at the end of the tunnel! I am also hoping that since this last episode where I got professional help and KNOW we got it cleared up, it may stay away a LOT longer.\n\nBest wishes to you! So frustrating. One time it came at a period of extreme stress. Another time was after a weekend of partying extremely hard lol. Those were both REALLY bad. I had a milder case out of nowhere as well. I hope it does not come back, and that if it does, it can be treated easily! Seeing stress as a potential trigger as well, though ultimately it just seems totally random. Ugh. Alcohol can affect BPPV. I do not drink much - maybe 1 drink on Friday evenings. I have been finding that feel terrible on Saturdays when I have a drink the night before. I read that alcohol can change the composition of the fluid in your ears. So I am taking a break from alcohol for now. I have upped my exercise, water, and in addition to my multivitamin I am taking a Vit D/C/Magnesium supplement. I also get outside during the day and use that as an excuse to take a couple short breaks from my computer. \n\nLooking back I think what brought mine on was a combination of stress and not moving around much (tied to a computer or textbooks almost every day of the week for anywhere from 7-10 hours a day), and forgetting to stay properly hydrated. Mine also hit in March- a time of the year when I have been inside most days for a couple of months due to cooler weather and therefore not getting as much sun (Vit D-?). Coincidentally for whatever reason I started sleeping in the side that is the problem for a month before the BPPV- no idea why, just did.\n\n I actually read an article, I think from Mass General, about BPPV being something doctor offices see in Boston more around Feb/Mar-ish when people have been inside and the hypothesis is that their Vit D levels drop and contribute to it. \n\nWhat I wish I knew when my episode hit was to NOT stay in bed. Easier said than done, especially when you need help walking to the bathroom and someone to stand outside the shower for you. But sedentary behavior apparently can delay healing and spatial awareness needed for getting around.\n\nGood luck; it stinks. Thanks for the response! \n\nI also noticed that the things I did when I had BPPV (lying down and not moving, watching tv) did not feel great. Once I realized that tv was making me feel less than stellar I tried to cut down, but moving was honestly a nightmare. How do you handle that? I do not have any advice on that really; I have just resigned that \u201dthis too shall pass\u201d. Really I just force myself to get the bare minimum done some days and then tell myself, \u201cGood Job today\u201d before I go to sleep, and figure maybe the next day will be better. \ud83d\ude02 Thinking more about how you mention it is related so much to your head movements\u2026 it could be a neck tension or posture problem- cervical vertigo\u2026 ???  A physical therapist could probably help determine. \n\nAlso, there is a type of vertigo that can come about from TMJ issues, which a dentist can make a splint or something for that helps people. Maybe consider outside of the box reasons if it is not getting better. Hmmm... I am not sure if I think that could be what I have. From what I understand, cervical vertigo is related more to injuries or degeneration/poor posture, none of which are relevant to me. I am relatively young, in very good physical shape, and have never suffered any significant injuries. When an episode comes on, everything is fine as long as I do not move my head and (presumably) shake those pesky ear crystals again, it is not caused by head movements (or anything I can reasonably discern). I am almost in the same boat as you. Same age and am relatively healthy in every other regard except... for bppv. I have developed a regimen using all the scientific articles I could find along with a heaping dose of desperation. Fwiw I started getting these episodes when I was in my early 20s and I think there was one year where it happened like 4 times plus months of residual dizziness and now... I get it about  once a year. But I am a case study of one so ymmv. \n\nI take vitamin d EVERY day and I NEVER sleep flat. For years I just made a pile of cushions and slept reclined but I would always slide down it so I recently bought an adjustable bed. Game changer. I also try to regularly exercise because I have read that is associated with less recurrence. I also never put my head upside down.\n\nI just started an episode yesterday so I have been doing the rounds on the internet (always hoping for a new cure or treatment) and that is how I came across your post. I am going to add two new things to my regimen: once weekly epley maneuver and calcium/magnesium supplements. I read a journal article where a one weekly epley reduced recurrence by a good amount. The calcium/ magnesium may be placebo but, as I am sure you know, you get kind of desperate regarding bppv. Best of luck and I really hope you feel better soon \ud83d\udc9c", "I am afraid to work out after having BPPV. I had my fourth bout of BPPV earlier this year, it lasted about 6 weeks. It was the second time an episode started while I was doing yoga. I have avoided yoga since it happened but now I am paranoid about doing any sort of work out, and it is really frustrating, the few times I have done anything I am super aware of how I am feeling, if I am moving my head a lot and so forth. Just wondering if anyone else has dealt with this? I have had two bouts of BPPV in my life and ironically, each time it was better when I was running. As soon as I stopped, the yucky subtle nausea/off balance feeling would come. I do yoga as well and I think that would pretty nauseating. Maybe try a standing practice for now.\n\nAlso, have you been doing the maneuvers to try and move the crystals? It is important to keep a vertical head for a few hours after you do them so the effort/work is not wasted\n\nbest of luck I am fully over the vertigo at this point, I am just realizing that I am super paranoid about doing something that brings on a new episode. It sucks because I feel better mentally and physically when I work out on a regular basis but my last bout with BPPV sucked so bad. It is pretty frustrating. I definitely have some sort of PTSD from my first episode. I have not found any issues working out. I do not do yoga though. Mostly cardio like running and weight training.\nThe only thing I fear doing is sleeping on my sides or completely flat. I just sleep on my back with two pillows. However, I have payed on my back and sides to do exercises like abs etc and had no issue. I am glad to see I am not the only one who refers to it as PTSD.  I have always been hesitant to apply the term but I had two major attacks that came on while I was a sleep (waking me up from a dead sleep by extreme spinning and nausea) and for literally years afterward I was afraid to go to sleep because there was never any warning of when I would get it, just that it came on in my sleep.  My fear coloured things like whether or not I went camping or on holiday, flew away for a work trip, or did anything away from my husband in case it came on and I needed help.  I have slept with a vomit bag next to my head since 2015 and never take a trip without a container of meclizine in my bag.  I do not see how PTSD does not fit the bill for this type of anxiety, to be honest. I am sorry you are going through that. I completely understand. It is calmed down for me, but the first few months I was also afraid to sleep or sleep away from my husband. The first (and only time) I got it, It woke me from my sleep when I rolled over. I was home alone and had to crawl my way to the bathroom. I could not turn my head without getting the vertigo. I would even get panic attacks every time the vertigo would hit me. I guess most of the fear was the unknown. Why this is happening, what is wrong, what caused it, how do I prevent it,etc. Once I got back to normal I just started doing my normal things and just accepted that it might happen again. I cannot live in the constant fear of it. At least now I know what it is and if it does happen again I know to go straight to my dizzy clinic and treat it. Also knowing that it does go away eventually makes Me feel better. When my residual dizziness lasted for months I was so worried that I had permanent issues. \nIf only I can get back to sleeping normal. I guess in time I will get there. I am just still not over the fear of waking up with it again. For some reason, I feel that if I sleep slightly elevated it will prevent the crystals from coming out. That is not proven to be true and the crystals can come out whenever apparently but I guess sleeping elevated just helps me cope with that fear. I really do think it is some kind of ptsd or some sort of mental trauma. It was a super scary and awful experience so it would make sense that it would cause lingering mental things. Maybe it is a PTSD thing, I have had issues with anxiety in the past. I know what you mean about sleeping, I do sleep on my side but every time I turn over I think about the vertigo. Yeah, give yourself another 6 weeks maybe. After an episode I usually avoid the gym for 3 months, until the dizziness disappears. While waiting, I do vestibular exercises for 10 minutes, at least once a day. And I do a lot of walking, office work, even chores that require me to look downward (even though it is nauseous for me) to retrain my brain to balance itself. i just recently recovered from my first bout with bppv (Mar '20). im back cycling as hard as i was before (did 33miles pretty hard yesterday) and i refuse to allow bppv to affect how i exercise and stay healthy. its understandable that youre concerned with yoga or whatever other exercising that could bring it on. i asked my ent dr about exercising and she said that exercising does not cause or bring on bppv.\n\nhave you seen and ent dr or a vestibular specialist? if not i highly recommend it. I always felt/feel better when running too! My therapist was amazed that I could even run. I would go knock out 10 to 15 miles....but when I would be done and just be still.....I felt yucky, woozy, dizzy. And we are thinking, because I was able to do so much while I had active BPPV, that is why the residual dizziness is taking so long to go away. I spent over 2 months being super active while I had BPPV. My body readjusted to having vertigo and moving. Now that it is gone - it is having trouble resetting back to normal. I cannot quite bring myself to sleep on my affected side yet either. I know I am supposed to, and supposed to lay flat. But the fear.....It is horrible! I go to sleep propped up as well. I do notice by morning that I am mostly laying flat, but I have also trained myself to NOT roll over onto my bad side. It is truly a mental thing. For sure PTSD! The fear is real. And truly, it is a form of PTSD. My first 3 episodes, although rather unpleasant, came and went with no after effects. This last time. OMG - it was absolutely horrible. And as dumb as it seems, it is always on my mind. I have such a bad fear of it coming back. I hate going to bed, as that is where it usually happens. I fear laying on my bad side. And every time I get a wave of residual dizziness, it almost triggers an anxiety attack, fearing it will come back. And the sucky thing is - this DOES return with a lot of people, so that does not help.\n\nOn the flip side - my therapist was super good in coaching me that you cannot worry about it all the time. It is like worrying if you will get cancer. You cannot predict it. You need to live life. At least those of us that have had it, now know what it is and how to get help and fix it - RIGHT AWAY! If I keep myself busy, I am so much better. I am very active and work hard to challenge the residual dizziness as much as I can. I am always turning my head, bending over, looking up, down, right, left. I am working SO hard to get my system back to normal.\n\nI can totally understand how you are paranoid to do yoga, as that is where it started with you. Similar to me sleeping in bed. Try to stay strong and be positive. It is hard. Our brain plays tricks and the anxiety and fear is real. It sucks that others cannot see that and often think we are making things up and being dumb. Modify your yoga slightly. Do what is comfortable. I think eventually you will end up doing one of the positions that you fear, without even realizing it - and THEN realize you actually did that move and it did not harm you!!!! It is going to take time but it will happen! Thanks for the encouragement! I completely understand what you are saying, it still feels weird when I turn my head a certain way, like to look for something under the couch or in a low cabinet. It immediately brings on a feeling of panic. It sucks. I know that I went back to not thinking about it after my previous episodes, hopefully that will happen this time too. I totally get it! Initially for me, when I would look up and down I would get a wave of dizziness. So I would walk around looking up and down and after about a week or so, it went away. But THEN - it was when I looked left or right! So I did the same thing.....looking left and right all the time when I would walk or run. And NOW....I get the wave of dizziness if I tilt my head towards my shoulder (ear to shoulder).  And every time, it brings on a wave of fear that it is coming back. It is just crazy how it got into my head this time and is giving me such PTSD.  And it seems like that is happening for you too.  Fingers crossed it completely passes soon for both of us! I went to a dizzy/balance center for treatment this last time, they said since it was brought on twice during yoga I should probably modify what I was doing and avoid any inversion positions. I was doing some low impact hiit yesterday and was very aware of my head movements, worrying about moving to quickly and jarring a crystal loose. I do not know, maybe I should stick to more stable things like free weights or stationary bike where I am not moving my head around as much. I did vestibular exercises for a short time and then stopped, I think I am going to start doing them again, thanks for the reminder. It might help me feel more confident in trying other exercises. Thanks! It is rather sucky to be so aware and afraid of doing things I do not usually think about. Hope yours passes soon too.", "Help, i do not know what is going on Hello!\nRecently i have been feeling off-balance when standing up and still. I am completely fine when i am walking or running, i even consider i have great balance, since when i am doing exercises on one leg, for example, i am stable. But when i am just standing still i stagger for seemingly no reason. I do not feel dizzy, do not feel like the room is spinning or anything. I have never actually fallen down, but the staggering is worrying me. And i always seem to stagger towards my right side\nAnyone have any clues as to what might be going on? NAD but this does not sound like it is BPPV related. How long has this been going on and is it consistent? Does it go away after a while (of standing still)? I will not speculate because I have no clue, but I would suggest you visit a doctor to get checked just in case. It is been happening for a month or 2.\nI think it is pretty consistent. Like i sit up and walk around then if i were to stop and stand still for a while i would eventually stagger for no reason, but then it would never happen again until i sit down for a while then stand up again.\nI will try to go to a doctor, but i do not know which... an ENT maybe? Or do i go to neurology? Long shot, are you on medication? Depressants? Maybe start with a GP - they can perform basic neurological tests for stability and balance and suggest what further checks, if any, you need. I am currently on Prozac. Only medication i am taking Alright, will do that Could be that mate.

Since then I have had spurts and sometimes days of feeling \"off\".\nI went to a GP who said they did not see any inflammation and recommended I go to an ENT. I I had my appt today and she suggested PT. I have looked up the Brandt - Daroff and Epley Maneuvers bcs I do not see a reason to go to a PT if they are just going to  show me these maneuvers. Are there any other exercises that help? I love yoga and try to practice regularly Lots and lots of other stuff PT will do.  Gaze excercises, balance stuff.  They told me it is all about getting your brain comfortable.  It has helped me a lot.  Go! Thank you. My bf is telling me to go too. How many sessions have you gone? 4 in two months.  Very helpful.

Thank you to all who said to take Dramamine that has helped with the daily dizziness. \n\nWill update if I have any answers \ud83e\udd8b Best of luck Thanks. I am here right now. Hopefully I can get off this boat. It is like I am on a cruise that I do not want to be on I have it. Doctor gave me some meds for it and I am seeing another physical therapist for it right where I go for my leg therapy Welcome to the club. As one who has suffered on and off for years, the vertigo will stop and you may need to do the rehab exercises to improve the residual dizzyness. \n\nWhat is wrong with your leg? Surly not related? I woke up on July 30 th and had heavy legs \ud83d\ude2b. No it is not related but I was really scared it was. I have had basically every test done for the legs and they cannot find anything so I am doing physical therapy for them. They are getting better but still heavy. \n\nOh no I hope this does not last- I am sorry. It sucks my eyes go bonkers when I lay on my right side\n\nI might have my legs be bad forever so I do not need anything else \ud83d\ude35 Ahh the beating eyes (nystagmus) is the tell tale sign it is BPPV. Epley Manoeuvre or log roll, should sort you out. The PT will tip you back to bring on the vertigo and watch your eyes to see which ear canal is effected. From there they will do the appropriate manoeuvre which will bring on more vertigo and then when it is done, you will ether feel fixed or have to go another round. For me it took a few trips and a few weeks later and I am happy to say the vertigo is gone. \n\nHang in there! Alright thanks! Yes the doctor already did the head thing and saw the eyes and said it was my right side! I am just so happy to have a diagnosis because with my legs I never got one and I did not want her to think I am a hypochondriac coming in with more issues. Ugh. I was like you got to be kidding me when I woke up and the wall was moving. I am Already on disability leave at work so why not pile on more issue on anyways\ud83d\ude02. did your dr do the epley maneuver on you to relieve your bppv/dizziness symptoms? if not, why not?\n\nthe epley is pretty successful at relieving most bppv symptoms.

Occasionally I will experience dizziness when I look up/down, lie down, feel off balanced for a bit. It is happened ever since my first full blown vertigo episode in 2019. It usually subsides in a few hours. Then I feel perfectly normal. Is this normal for you guys too?", "Feel more dizziness / nausea after Brandt Daroff exercises? Hi there! \n\nA bit of info about me; I started having vertigo about a year ago. I noticed it shortly after I took an edible for the first time as I thought my dizziness was residual from the edible. After a few more episodes, I saw a doctor who prescribed me Meclizine and did some bloodwork (everything seemed to be ok with that). After that point, I never really had an episode again. \n\nA year later, I move into a new apartment and a couple of days later, the vertigo comes back and progressively gets worse. I have been living in this new apartment now since July 15th, and have needed to take Meclizine on 3 separate occasions. I try not to take it unless I feel nausea that I cannot manage myself. Fed up with this feeling, I make an appointment with my doctor again, who refers me to a PT and a neurologist. I went to the PT who specializes in vestibular therapy, and she performed a set of tests which surprisingly did not make me feel dizzy at all -- all expect the one where she turned my head side to side really fast while i was sitting up. She determined that there are no issues with my crystals in my canals, but prescribed some homework. For homework, I have to do Brandt-Daroff exercises. She did not do the Epley maneuver on me because she determined that it was not necessary since there were no issues with the crystals. \n\nWhen we practiced them at PT, I felt fine afterwards. Now, a couple of days later, I have done them at home twice and I feel absolutely terrible. I feel bouts of nausea which normally I do not feel when I get vertigo, but now it feels constant. I have no appetite to eat and I have not done the exercises since. I am scheduled to see the neurologist on Friday so part of me wants to stop doing the exercises until I see him (in case something else is wrong).\n\nI am also due to see a dentist in a couple weeks because I have TMJ (I am also thinking this could be an issue as well that contributes to my vertigo).\n\nI guess I want to know, is this normal after PT, is it one of those \"it will be worse before it gets better\" type deals, or is this just my life now? Hello, I have been experiencing constant vertigo, dizziness and lightheadedness for the last (almost) six months. I tried taking meclizine for about two days in July but it made me feel like a zombie so I stopped. It definitely helped with the lightheadedness/dizziness but not the vertigo. I started doing physical therapy about three weeks ago and I am feeling the worst I have ever felt. I started getting new feelings of vertigo such as a tilting feeling and feeling that something is constantly pulling me backwards. What I felt before was a swaying boat feeling, but now it is just worse.", "been fine for 2 months now back again ", "Seeking Any Helpful Tips for Relief! Hello, all! I am a 28 year old female experiencing my first episode of vertigo and just feeling really miserable. Certain positions, like tilting my head to the right, leaning forward, and getting up from lying down seem trigger it, and the sensation of the room spinning lasts for anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute. Sometimes the sensation is so bad, I feel lightheaded and nauseous for an hour afterward.\n\nI went to see my doctor today, who basically just looked in my ears, told me to try removing some earwax, and sent me on my way with a prescription for meclizine (which I am a little confused about because I have OTC meclizine at home already and the prescription seems to be the same dosage). I have been taking OTC meclizine for a few days now with some relief, but it is still pretty bad and I am not sure what else I can do. \n\nLooking around this subreddit, I have seen others mentioning doing something called the Epley maneuver. If anyone has any other suggestions for relief, I would really love to know because it is interfering significantly with my work right now. Thank you SO much! If you can, I would highly recommend finding and seeing a Vestibular Therapist. Mine is a PT. They are usually much more knowledgeable about BPPV than most physicians, and it is worth seeing one vs trying to self treat, in my experience. \n\nIf you cannot or really do not want to see a therapist, look up videos about Dix-Hallpike which will confirm BPPV, and tell you which side it is on. Then watch videos of the Epley maneuver for that side and perform that. You may have to perform it multiple times, and it will most likely make you feel awful so you may want to do it before bed. \n\nKeep us updated! Google the Epley and do it. It will enable you to figure out which ear is affected and hopefully find relief. I have had three bouts of BPPV, all of which were resolved by the Epley. I agree with everything /u/tllallyrfrnds said. Find a vestibular therapist to work with. Mine was a PT as well.  If you want to attempt something at home, for sure do the Dix Hallpike to test yourself initially (this is the first step to the Epley - of laying back), to test each side to determine which side is effected. Then you can proceed with the Epley maneuver. This is NOT a pleasant thing to do - as it provokes the vertigo in the first and either last, or second to last position.  You need to wait it out, as the crystal rotates around the ear canal.  It is possible the crystal is in one of the other less likely canals, and that is where a trained specialist could help.\n\nAlso - you could try the Half Somersault (Foster) - as it is less invasive. It is not as well studied, and possibly not as effective as the Epley, but it does not provoke the vertigo as bad.  My last bout of BPPV took over 2 months to resolve - and involved over 20 Epley maneuvers. This was all mostly done with a therapist. Up your vitamin D. Recommended is 600iu/d and I was on 1200iu/d but now on 4000iu/d and I feel so much better. Try it.", "Any tips to stay recovered? My first bout with BPPV was an almost unreasonable length, starting sometime in July and ending early December. \n\nThe last three weeks or so, I have finally been able to turn over in bed without clutching at my sheets and it was a really nice time.\n\nThen, like a ruthless hand surfacing to drag me down again, I woke up this morning to the panic of the room spinning wildly. \n\nI am planning on getting more actual help this time instead of just waiting it out again, but does anybody here have experiences with recurring BPPV? And have any advice to share? Many thanks. For me... it is seeing the PT and doing balance exercises. I also sleep on my back only and do not roll over. ... see an ent (ear nose &amp; throat) dr. i did and my bppv was resolved.\n\nas far as keeping it away many drs dont really know how its brought on other than to know the crystal in your ear becomes dislodged so cant recommend anything. im just hoping it doesnt come back. I have had BPPV 4 times in the past 3 years. The first episode sent me to the ER and I was basically told to go home and wait it out. Then I had two more episodes within the next 2 years. The last episode was HORRIBLE and I saw many specialists. I saw an ENT, neurologist, different doctor, and vestibular therapist. It was the vestibular therapist that truly knew how to do some major testing and helped treat me. It took over 2 months to resolve the BPPV. And I continued having residual dizziness for over 6 months.  But I now know more about BPPV than I ever thought I would! Having a dizzy specialist to help work with you, guide you, and answer questions - is a godsend.\n\nThe anxiety about BPPV coming back is real.  It is been a year since my last episode (and it was BAD). I still think about it returning every day. Every time I roll over in bed, I think about it. The residual dizziness is finally manageable - but every time I move wrong and get a slight wave of dizziness, I panic.\n\nAs for what to do to keep it from happening again - sadly, no one knows. I think for some of us, if keeping it from ever returning means chopping a finger off, we would do it! Some recommendations are to watch your salt intake, up your Vitamin D levels, continue to sleep upright, stay away from caffeine, stay away from alcohol.  As I analyze my lifestyle, I do not find ANY triggers - or anything in common each time I got BPPV.  I am healthy, active and fit, healthy diet, do not drink or smoke, I am not on any medications, no past head trauma, I drink plenty of water, my salt levels are normal, vitamin D levels are normal. I DO continue to sleep as upright as I can though. I find by morning, I have slipped down to an almost flat position. My residual dizziness kept me from sleeping flatter for months - so it is a catch 22. Happy that I can finally lay flat, but afraid to.\n\nAdvice from my vestibular therapist is to not be afraid of it. I now know what it is and how to treat it. She compared it to cancer....you do not sit around every day worrying if you are going to get cancer. So, do not sit around worrying if you will get BPPV again. (hard to do!) Find exercises that help get your body back in sync. My therapist also told me to get back to normal exercises as soon as possible. Keep moving, keep challenging that dizziness.  I kept my head still for SO long as to not provoke vertigo, I caused a secondary dizziness called gaze instability. I was basically dizzy no matter what.\n\nFind a GOOD dizzy specialist to work with.  You will be so glad you did! And make SURE the BPPV is resolved by testing it the correct way. Sometimes it gets better and you think it is gone, but really, it is still there.  Or, the residual dizziness makes you think it is still there. It is a tricky thing!\n\nSorry for the super long response! My BPPV stems from my left ear. I avoid any movement to that side. I do not ever tip my head that way, including sleep. This has kept me from having a recurrence for over a year. Get your vitamin d levels checked. It is safe to say to take 5000iu/day but there are links to vitamin d deficiency and vertigo. Inflammation, viral infection, tmj. All have been tied to vertigo. \nBut a physical therapist that specializes in vestibular issues can help with maneuvers to get your crystals moving. thank you for this! \n\nand same goes for everyone else\u2019s response too Wow can I relate to this! After each of my first two episodes I eventually stopped thinking about BPPV until the next time happened. But I can honestly say now, since episode three, I think about it every single day and I wake up several times a night when I turn over so that I can do it with extreme care and avoid activating an attack. I like the advice your therapist gave you. I can at least say now that I have more confidence in my ability to handle it. Have you ever tried taking ginkgo biloba supplements to help with recovery? Nope - I have not tried that. It also makes me feel better to know others can relate and totally get it. The fear is real. BPPV sucks.", "My grandmother went to the ER with severe headache and confusion - they said it was BPPV? This Sunday we had a scare with my grandma that led us to take her to the ER. She said she had the worst headache of her life (she does not even usually get headaches) and was dizzy. She was acting confused and mixing up words (\"Can you go get my purse under the car in the kitchen?\"). She also said she needed to put her cell phone in her purse but then grabbed the landline phone instead. Obviously we were extremely concerned that she could be having a stroke.\n\nShe also started feeling nauseous on the way to the hospital, and once she was there for a few hours, was complaining of chest pain. She was admitted to the hospital overnight for lots of tests and they determined she did not have a stroke or heart attack. They gave her insulin because her blood sugar was really out of whack (she has been prediabetic for years). She was feeling good enough to be released yesterday (Monday).\n\nThey said her dizziness and nausea were caused by crystals in her ear. They are not sure about her chest pain and blood pressure but think it could have been caused by stress. I did some online research, and it looks like her vertigo, nausea, and confusion can be explained by BPPV, but what about the headache? I am having trouble finding much info on that. The websites I found said BPPV is not associated with headaches. My sister, a nurse practitioner, says it can cause headaches, but should not cause severe ones. My grandma is used to high levels of pain because of her sciatica and does not usually even mention feeling pain most of the time, so I would not think she was exaggerating.\n\nDo any of you get severe headaches from this condition? Also, I understand it can cause brain fog, but is it normal to become confused enough to use the wrong words? I am worried the doctors have missed something. If they gave her insulin and her blood sugar needed to be balanced, the blood sugar level could also have caused the headache. I am hypoglycemic and my mother is Type 1 diabetic\u2026 if I go low I get a headache, same with my Mom\u2014 she also gets silly, mixing up works and terms almost like she is a little tipsy, when her blood sugar is low. \n\nEdited to add- Not a medical professional but that is just my experience.\n\nAlso- my BPPV started with the headache, and my ENT did not seem concerned or think it was strange that this happened\u2026 it went on for a few days and no Advil or anything helped, then I had the horrible vertigo spell and it came and went for a while until I got treatment. Thanks for your response. I was wondering if the blood sugar issues caused her headache and confusion. That is part of my concern, because if she is gone from prediabetic to full blown diabetic, we need to be treating that too. She is never been given insulin before. She has a major sweet tooth and does not eat healthy, so I worry about her. I noticed a couple of months ago she seemed confused at a baby shower... There were a *lot* of sweets available, so I am wondering if her blood sugar was messed up then too. My family chalked it up to stress at the time. I guess we will just need to keep a close eye on her got a while too see if any symptoms pop up. Does she have an endocrinologist? That would be worth discussing. Just a thought. I am not sure. I will have to ask my mom sometime this week. I definitely want to express my concerns about her potentially needing to be on some kind of treatment plan for diabetes. I am glad that she seems to be doing so much better after her stay in the hospital, but I think the ear crystals seem like only a partial explanation of what happened on Sunday. By the way, we all have crystals in our middle ears. But when they get out of place they can cause vertigo, etc.   I hope your grandmother is better soon. I think the blood sugar is the main culprit here. The body is weird, it may have been that she had a bout of BPPV and got panicked which led to fluctuations in blood sugar which led to other symptoms. Or she could have had some fluctuations in her blood sugar which caused her to do an out of ordinary maneuver which caused the crystals to become dislodged.\n\nAlso could be a migraine, which you cannot really do a test for.\n\nRegardless, sounds like your grandma is going to be okay which is awesome! Actually, I talked to my mom last night and she said the reason my grandma's blood sugar was so messed up to the point where she needed insulin, is that she had been at the hospital so long, she was not able to take her regular medication. So she is still just prediabetic and just did not have access to her meds that would normally keep that in check, I guess. She rarely gets headaches, so I am still not totally sure where that came from. She said it was between her eyes like a sinus headache. Maybe she just had a bad bout of allergy symptoms. But yes I am very glad she seems to be ok now, we will just need to keep a close eye on her from now on. ", "How do you workout with bppv? Recently, Ive been working out everyday for 15-20 mins at home. I am not trying to lift weights or anything. I just want to get in shape. Most days I do blogilates. My only problem is that I cannot do any ab workouts like crunches without getting super dizzy. I have been suffering from bppv for the past 4 years on and off. Does anyone have the same problem? I feel like my bppv restricts me from doing certain things and it is really frustrating. I live in a small town and there is one ent that went to and did not even take me seriously. You have to avoid those workouts until you are better. I am about a month out from a moderate episode and I am just now willing to lie down on my back again.\n\nBut more importantly is the fact that the ENT is not taking you seriously (a sign that he has *no* idea how debilitating and demoralizing this is) and it does not sound like you are \"cured\" (in quotes because you are never really cured, but in fact the BPPV goes in remission) because you keep spinning. \n\nI would encourage you to find a Physical Therapist who understand balance issues and can help you properly diagnose with Dix-Hallpike and then do exercises like Epley, Semont, Foster, or Brandt-Daroff. The PTs are much better equipped than the ENT to get you back onto a normal footing.\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck.", "Diagnose? And improvement Has anyone gotten trully diagnosed? And if so by whom? Neurologist, ENT? \nI believe truly I have this, ophtalmologist ran tons of tests all is good, i had a non contrast MRI neurologist says all is perfect and no need for a conttast one... i do not know to which specialist to go to for this!\nAnd has anyone improved? And how \n\nThanks all I was initially diagnosed in the Emergency room with my first episode 2ish years ago.  No 'real' BPPV tests were done, just questions asked and general condition taken into consideration. I was given Meclazine (antivert) and Zofran (anti nausea) meds and sent on my way.  Upon my 3rd episode I wanted more answers. I saw an ENT who took forever to get into.  I was assured my hearing was fine (mostly focused on ears). Tinnitus had not changed from 20 years ago. But by now, the Vertigo had subsided. He performed Dix Hallpike and it was negative. I was told it was not Meneires Disease (which was a concern as my grandma had it).  Also saw an eye specialist for my annual exam.  All was fine there.\n\nUpon my 4th episode, my regular doc sent me to a neurologist and a vestibular therapist (physical therapist that specializes in dizziness).  The neurologist assured me I was very healthy.  It was the vestibular specialist that truly diagnosed me with a bunch of tests. She put goggles on that video taped my eyes while she put me through the Dix Hallpike test.  She did maneuvers that tested all 6 inner ear canals. I had classic nystagmus that showed during the test for the left posterior ear canal was positive.  She also tested me for other neurological ailments that cause dizziness (to rule them out).  I also had gaze instability that had formed from having the vertigo/dizziness for so long.  My anxiety was super high as well, as I was not getting better.  She even helped ease my anxiety. I was given multiple exercises to do, along with weekly Epley maneuvers with her (and was allowed to do them at home as well).\n\nDepending on their area of specialty - it depends on who can help you the most.  For ME - it was the vestibular therapist. None of the other specialists/docs really wanted to deal much with the dizziness.\n\nIf it truly is BPPV and you have a crystal dislodged in your inner ear - there are head movements to do to get that crystal back in place.  The most common is when it effects the posterior canal, and then the Epley manuever is helpful. Mind you - I had to perform this 20 times over the course of a few weeks for it to work. Some people it works right away.  The Dix Hallpike is the first step to the Epley and will tell you which ear/side is effected.  The half Somersault is another maneuver that can be done.  The Epley DOES reproduce the nasty vertigo symptoms when it is done - so be prepared for that.  Ride it out. The nasty vertigo should last around 30 seconds for the crystal to settle into the new location in the canal.  Even after a successful Epley - residual dizziness can linger for days, weeks to months.  You can google those maneuvers and see how they are done. \n\nMy last episode started in December and the crystal was finally re-positioned in February.  Two months later I am still working on getting my vestibular/balance system back to normal. So I deal with residual dizziness every day.  But it is slowly getting better. Thanks!! I have found a therapist here I hope this will help me! I have been having this for a year now, it is so annoying and makes me paraoid thinking something else is wrong eventho it has been ruled out. I hear ya! The anxiety of thinking it might be something more serious is overwhelming. I was grateful to rule out other more serious things. Not to minimize how absolutely horrible BPPV is - but it is not life threatening.  My therapist has had BPPV along with the anxiety it can bring, so she was VERY sympathetic (unlike the other docs who were more like, 'hmm, yep, you are dizzy. Not life threatening. Go home and be patient. It will go away eventually).  I could not even function at times, yet forced myself to continue with work and my hobbies. Keep us posted on what you find out!  Everyone is story somehow helps or relates to another.  Even if it is not BPPV, but some sort of gaze instabilization, or another vestibular disorder (vestibular migraines), a good therapist can get to the bottom of it and give you exercises to help. Look into PPPD as well. This is a condition I had no idea about until I stumbled upon it in this sub a few days ago. I am pretty certain that this is what I have after having an episode last September and still not feeling better. I have not been diagnosed though because I have been social isolating for weeks and I am not making any doctor appointments for the time being.

Can they distinguish vestibular vs. non-vestibular causes of imbalance? I have a mobility impairment, and I have a vestibular function test coming up. Never had one, but my ENT described that we will be doing a lot of stuff! Looking things up, some things clearly will not be a problem (ex., eye movement tests), but it seems like quite a few of the tests rely on balance -- standing on a platform that moves, and your movements and accommodation being tracked with sudden changes, for example. My mobility impairment affects my balance -- I am not able to accommodate as well with my left leg, which worsens my overally balance. \n\nI am wondering how they do vestibular testing like this for people with disabilities. Is the test accurate enough to know what is musculoskeletal and what is vestibular? Would love to hear from anyone who has undergone vestibular testing who also has a non-vestibular disability that affects balance!", "BPPV (supposedly) and now I have migraine and tinnitus. Had vertigo in Dec, the violent spinning type when I got out of bed (went away gradually) then Feb 1 again (after a sneezing attack the night before) and gradually subsided but my head has been slightly off since. I have mentioned before that I tried a professional Epley that was so violently spinning I could not continue. She did both sides and both were equally bad. So the violent spin has not been back but ive felt slightly off and slightly dizzy every day. Now I feel this inner pressure, back neck headache that turned into a migraine and tinnitus. I go to an ENT but could not get in until Mar 6! I feel like I should do something sooner? Residual dizziness is normal. I had it for about a month and some change after the vertigo stopped from the Epley. I had a headache and neck tension the whole time tho. I still have neck issues and pressure in my ears occasionally. I wonder if I injured my neck somehow and all the muscles being tense caused the bppv. Idk...but it took me a little over two months to feel normal but I still get some brief dizziness here and there. I would it worries you, I would def try to get into another specialist sooner. Especially if you have not checked for M\u00e9ni\u00e8res or VN yet. Ya it is definitely residual dizziness that is inconsistent (better some days, worse others) but now that I have the tinnitus and pressure (which is new) it is making me wonder about Menieres as well. But that was yesterday. It is really day by day. Happy to hear yours is subsided. A friend told me once she went to an ENT and they did the tests, it all came together. I wish I would made that appointment first! \ud83e\udd74\ud83d\ude02 My ent was no help haha but I think I just picked the wrong one to go to. They did test me for M\u00e9ni\u00e8res but said the test came back normal. I get a pressure and whooshing type of tinnitus. Comes and goes but does not stay. Im my experience, the dizziness does eventually get better. Just takes some time. \ud83d\udc95 sounds exactly like my problem. Vertigo at night, then headache and neck pain for weeks. Now I just feel lightheaded.", "Off balance and do not know the cause yet\u2026 Hi everyone. \n\nNot sure if this is the right place to post,but thought I would give it a shot. I had what I assume was an episode of vertigo back in February. The \u201ceffects\u201d of off balance basically remained with me. Went to PCP,ENT,Got my ears checked and an MRI all came out clean. Started physical therapy which helped a bit,but still that off balance was there. \n\nOne day in July I woke up and it was gone. Recently started creeping back up and it sucks. Got my eyes checked,just a few updates on my prescription. Went to neurologist yesterday and she said she did not see the need for another MRI,and that it seemed stress related\u2026or that the initial attack of vertigo left me with some effects. She also mentioned MDDS as a possibility. She told me try scopolamine patches and see if they work better for me than Meclizine. \n\n\n\nI am just exhausted from this. Has this or something similar happened to anyone else? Try checking the two stickied posts at the top of this sub for what BPPV is and how to treat it. As far as I understand, if you turn or tilt your head (e.g., when you get up in the morning) and the world spins, then you may have BPPV. If, after treatment, you experience residual nausea, dizziness, fogginess, etc., there are management options available.", "Finally figured it out\u2026 I think it is a pinched nerve. And there is some issue with circulation or a nerve in my neck/shoulder causing my BPPV. Which is not really bppv? I do not know. \n\nYou see I got a guitar. A heavy guitar. Les Paul. And I spent about 3 months playing it for hours every day before the dizziness and nystagmus started. Head/neck at an awkward angle to look at my fingers. \n\nThen I got hit with dizziness. The funny thing is the Epley maneuver was like a miracle cure. \n\nThen I would get dizziness swimming. Thought it was water in my ears.\n\nOr I would get dizzy after a workout. Thought it was sudden head movements. \n\nThere is no direct or easy to identify trigger, it seems to come on gradually and then stick around for a while. So I did not connect it to the following:\n\nBad posture while sitting at a computer for a long time OR! Use of my left upper trapezius muscle. \n\nSo deadlifts triggered dizziness, but I thought it was the valsalva maneuver and did a bunch of research on a perilymph fistula. \n\nBut then sitting and watching TV or working triggered dizziness so I thought it was computer vision syndrome. \n\nAnd after over a year of chasing my tail here is what happened. I settled on cervicogenic dizziness as the cause. So I fixed my posture. And that has helped, but not removed it completely. \n\nOne night I slung that heavy guitar over my shoulder and played for about 2 hours right before bed. Woke up the next morning with the worst dizziness I have had in months. And it hit me. It is the heavy guitar and possibly guitar strap placement. \n\nToday I put my guitar over my shoulder, it hit a spot right on my neck. Within a minute of having that guitar on my shoulder the nystagmus and nausea had returned. \n\nSeems like I have a pinched nerve or blood vessel somewhere. \n\nI still have some ear symptoms. Likely because I have been popping my ears obsessively for the last year. You see when I get dizzy I feel like I cannot feel my inner ear. Like it is clogged. My left nostril (effected side) gets clogged up. \n\nMaybe it is just that simple. Dizziness is improving with posture work, yoga, a less heavy guitar and less heavy weightlifting. \n\nI would encourage anyone struggling with recurrent bppv to address their posture.", "Seems Like Regardless of Head Position It Triggers An Episode From what I read so far about BPPV, it seems like certain head positions trigger episodes and once you move your head to a different position the sensations stop. But can it still be considered BPPV if the vertigo, dizziness is triggered by any head position? I have had instances where it happens when I am  lying on either of my sides and back. When I stand and walk around, whenever I turn my head I feel off balance, dizzy. I am starting to think it may be more my neck than anything. I am pretty much uncomfortable whether I be standing, sitting or lying down. Bppv can be triggered by any head motion sometimes.  Depends on the size and location of the loose crystals.", "Vertigo- I do not know which side. Hi. For the first time I was diagnosed with BPPV vertigo. I went yesterday to urgent care and the doctor gave me a document with instructions on how to perform the Epley Maneuver for both ears. However, I do not know which ear is the affected. I read online the advice to  turn my head to the right and lie back quickly. If after a minute I felt dizzy, then that was the affected side. I did that for both ears and did not feel dizzy in either of them. What would you recommend me? To do the maneuver for both ears? Thank you in advance for your help. I would also try the semont maneuver.  It is less well known, but it may help I would do the Epley on both sides. Just make sure you carefully follow the steps. For my first bout of BPPV I did not know which side it was so did both and it worked. Good luck. As others have stated, I would do both. \nHowever, I had better luck having a physical therapist help me with the Epley. I tried to do it myself at home and was unsuccessful. Went to a pt and they helped me the first try. \n\nGood luck and feel better soon! xx Thank you very much!! Thank you very much! I will make an appointment with my family doctor to see if she can send me with a therapist. This is the video I watch to help me through the steps:\n\n Thank you! I think it is so sad when doctors do not know or help a person just do a simple test like the Dix Hallpike to help the patient determine which side is effected. Granted, there are many variables, and 6 different ear canals to be tested. But for the most part, the posterior canal is the main one effected. And helping the patient lay back to see what side is effected would be so beneficial, instead of just sending them home telling them it is BPPV and giving them medication (this is what happened to me the first 3 episodes, until I was sent to a dizzy specialist).\n\nI agree with others, that it is not going to hurt to do the Epley on both sides. But on the other hand, I am going to say that perhaps you do not have BPPV, if you did not experience the severe vertigo/nystagmus on either side when you laid back. And it sounds like you performed the Dix Hallpike correctly.\n\nIf you are able, try to see a vestibular specialist, a dizzy specialist, or someone that is familiar with BPPV and dizziness.  Just to make sure it truly is BPPV and not something else.  There are different maneuvers other than the Epley for the crystal being dislodged in some of the other ear canals than the posterior one.\n\nPlease keep us posted on what you find out. Thank you very much! I have an appointment with my family doctor tomorrow. I will try to see if she can referred me with an specialist and update my situation here. This dizziness suck so I am still learning how to deal with it. Hi. So I have just had my appointment (on the phone) with my primary doctor. She said, \"you have  BPPV  and are probably doing the exercise wrong because for that exercise you need somebody to help you.\" At that moment I thought, \"well, she is going to send me with a therapist or somebody in that field.\" Then she said, \"ask your wife to help you.\" What the heck. That does not make sense at all. I told her if there was like a therapist that could help me. She said, \"No. There is no one. Go and watch youtube videos. It is a very easy maneuver.\" I told her, \"...but in those videos a therapist or specialist is helping the person.  I would like to be helped by one.\" She said, \"well, I could help you, but I am not seeing patients in person. Ask your wife for help or just let time pass and your brain will figure it out.\" Then, I told her that in the document given by the urgent care doctor says that I should avoid moving the head up or down for 5 days.  I  asked her if there were physical activities or movements I should not do in order to avoid making things worst. She said, \"on the contrary. You can do anything.\" Now I am confused. Should I move my head or not. Well....it was not what I was expecting. Oh! about which ear was the affected...she recommended to perform the maneuver in both ears. That is so frustrating. I am sorry! my first ENT I went to when I first started getting the BPPV gave me a handout of the Epley to do at home and did not help me. I ended up doing it wrong and made myself worse and violently ill. \n\nI ended up calling a physical therapist near me that is trained in Vestibular rehabilitation. I had to pay cash because I did not have a referral (im in the US). But it was not expensive at all and I only had to go twice. \n\nDefinitely avoid positions that trigger your vertigo after the repositioning exercises. Like sleeping on your bad ear etc for at least a week. That allows the otolith to get back to where it needs to be or absorbed so it will not cause any more issues. Here is a link that talks about it more: \n\nJust scroll down to the section about after treatment instructions.\n\nI hope you find a professional to help you with your exercises!!! It is definitely possible to do on your own but having someone show you how to do it properly the first time will be more beneficial. \n\nBest of luck and feel better!!!", "UK - do you still drive? Did you inform the DVLA? For those of you in the UK, do you still drive? Have you contacted the DVLA about your BPPV?\n\nI was recently told by the doctor not to drive due recurrent BPPV (this is my third attack this year). However I only get it very mildly, with 2-3 seconds of mild dizziness when moving from standing to lying and vice versa. I followed his advice and have stopped driving for the moment, however in ( that the doctor sent me it says you do not need to inform the DVLA if your dizziness is predictable and controllable, which I would say mine is since I know what causes it and it would not be triggered by any movements involved in driving. I just wondered what other people have done about driving whilst suffering from BPPV. There is no bus route to where I work and I am relying on lifts whilst I know I am not at all unsafe to drive and it is frustrating.\nThanks.", "Woke up to room spinning :( 27 F---- Weak/heavy legs.   Mediations: cyclobenzaprine and diclofenac\n\nHello! So as you can see I have other issues that I have been going to the doctors for but this morning I woke up and my room was literally spinning upwards. I got scared and have been in bed all day because of the dizziness that came along with it. Any suggestions for this time? I am  really hoping it goes away because I already have my leg issue and need to get XRAYS tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny advice is really appreciated- someone from chronic pain recommended I check out this forum but im really dizzy and rather just type it out than search. I am so sorry. This happened to me for the first time last monday and it is so scary. I do not know your story with chronic pain, but I also experience it (and im 25!) so I know how frustrating it is feeling like its just ANOTHER thing to deal with.\n\nRegarding your question, there are some you can do but they bring on the symptoms quite badly.After my episode last week, I went to a vestibular therapist almost immediately so she could help me with some of the exercises as I was scared to do them alone, and I am glad I did.  I was there again today and she told me she wants me to visit a neurologist. I have some neck problems stemming from an injury when I was 11, and she thinks there might be a correlation. Something to look into for sure, it might not be a \"new\" problem per se, but instead another symptom stemming from the same problem. Good luck &lt;3 I am really honestly hoping it was just a one day thing \ud83d\ude29\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e... it was so bad!!! \n\nThank you though for your response and I will look into it. Going to have to make appointment with my doctor if it continues\ufffc Hey! Had this happen a couple of months ago. I sat up in bed and the whole room seemed to be moving so rapidly just thinking about it makes me nauseous. If you can, take something for the nausea. I took Dramamine. Take it easy for the day, drink lots of water, no sudden movements with your head. If you do need to turn, do so slowly. \n\nHope this post was not too late. If it was a one day thing that is what I have done in the past. If it is recurrent or happens this badly again please see a doctor about it. They can prescribe something a little stronger for the nausea and further instructions. \n\nHope you feel better. Thank you! The post is not too late I have actually been doing better. I tested laying on my sides now and while it makes me a little dizzy it does not make the room spin. I am taking cyclobenzaprine so I wonder if that did it?? \n\nYes I will see a doctor!  I am already seeing doctors regularly for my sudden leg weakness so I see a physical therapist on Thursday anyways and I will schedule to see my primary ASAP if it happens again tomorrow! Yeah. I will add laying down slightly elevated with a bunch of pillows. Laying flat will make it feel a bit worse. It will slowly get better. \n\nGood to hear. Hope they figure it out and it is nothing too serious! Hopefully it does not happen again tomorrow. Hope I do not scare you, you might be getting a couple of smaller episodes. For me laying flat actually was the only way I could lay all day ? Hmmm but again I have no idea what is going on. It was terrible though! Like I am so sorry you have to deal with this. But then again I can hardly walk with my legs so our spoons are give and take .  Literally just got test results back from a couple of autoimmune diseases and they were all negative so I am happy about that! Thanks. I am 24 and since I have had this I have experienced a lot more motion sickness since it began when before I could do anything, it is just been learning a lot of what I can and cannot do. Plus I know when I have smaller episodes I can take something before the side effects of it take place. (From a pre med perspective I think it is weird and cool given how it works. From the patient side of it not so much. lol) \n\nGlad your tests come back negative for that. Good luck with the rest of your appointments! True ! I need to check on medications I can take that do not interfere with the medicine I am already on if it happens again tomorrow. \n\nThank you so much! I have been having weak legs for four months now and countless amount of scans and blood tests with no answers. I did not understand how strong I was until I encountered this beast. Best of luck to ya ! How are you doing now? I am doing better but the room will still spin if I lay on my side specifically my right side. I have not drove with it yet but I guess I can drive as long as I do not lean to the side? And by drive I mean to go see my doctor.\n\nI am also supposed to go get X-rays done but I might wait until next week I am not sure what the general consensus is on driving but the therapists told me that I absolutely cannot drive until it is no longer happening. My dad almost crashed his car once because he did a shoulder check and started spinning. Have you tried any of the exercises yourself?? Yeah I am not driving. My dad and I decided it is not a good idea. Thank you for sharing that story so I know I made the correct decision. I actually got an appt to see my doctor today at 430 so my boyfriend Is going to drive me there. \n\nExercises pertaining to vertigo?! No I have not I did not know there was any ! I am totally down if there is Also I am glad your dad is okay \ud83d\ude30. I get spinning also so no driving.", "It is back! Some of you may remember me posting around Christmas time of a severe case of BPPV that resulted in some PTSD.  It took me a good four weeks to be back to full strength and to regain all the weight I lost during the week or so I suffered from vertigo.\n\nI have been doing great for the past couple of months, but then it returned yesterday morning.  I did also have one very brief episode Monday night (as in 2-3 seconds brief), but it did not return.  Yesterday, I woke up with vertigo, then experienced more vertigo when I sat up.  I did the Epley on myself and had what I thought was a positive response.  I got into my physical therapist yesterday afternoon to make sure it was what I thought it was and that there was not something else going on.  At that point, I tested negative on the Dix-Halpike and\nPassed all the balance/dizziness tests.  We both assumed I had done the Epley correctly and cured myself and she sent me home saying to call if there were any other problems and that she would check on me next week.\n\nI slept on the recliner last night.  During the night, my right ear (bad ear) popped and I felt like I was falling.  I thought I was okay this morning, even worked out, but then when I went to lie down. It came back, worse than yesterday.\n\nI did the Epley on myself again.  I did two round and was not sure if it was doing anything (I had vertigo the first time I lay back but not the second).  I sat up and was not sure if anything had happened.  About a minute after I sat up, the worst wave of vertigo I have ever experienced happened.  I lasted close to a minute and I had to have my daughter call my mom to come help.  I vomited profusely for quite a while and am\nStill very nauseated.\n\nDoes this mean it is not BPPV if the Epley does not work and I had a negative test.  Should I be looking at something else.\n\nThe PT was pretty concerned that it came back so fast and said that if it happened again, she wanted me to see an ENt and maybe neurologist for more testing.\n\nMore information: I did my own research and found a link to low vitamin D, osteoporosis and BPPV.  I do have osteopenia and always have low vitamin D, so I have decided to increase my vitamin D supplement to see if that does anything.  I am 41 and struggled with an eating disorder when younger.  I thought maybe my bones are getting worse and then is an indicator of it.  On the other hand, if this is not BPPV, then I am back to the drawing board.\n\nI know this is super long, so I appreciate any thoughts. After a few weeks of trying the Epley, and no change, my PT decided to try a new maneuver. It worked wonders and has kept the BPPV at bay. \n\n\n\nThere are many different treatments, so maybe trying something different will help you. Good luck! Desktop link: \n***\n ^^/r/HelperBot_ ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove. ^^Counter: ^^250895 **Semont maneuver**\n\nThe Semont maneuver, like the Epley maneuver, aims to cure benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Repeated treatments may be required and doctors often teach their patients the techniques if they get recurrent episodes. These maneuvers are designed to reposition otoliths in the posterior Semicircular canals. There are different maneuvers for those in the lateral (horizontal) canals.\n\n***\n\n^( ^| ( ^| ( ^| ( ^| (   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28 I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. I know exactly what it is like. It is horrible. But from everything you describe it sounds like it is BPPV.\n\nI have found the challenge is positively identifying the offending ear and canal, and doing the correct exercise. I had a situation where I saw the PT, we did the exercises and things were getting better. I had a relapse and when I went back to the PT we found that the problem was now in a different canal.\n\nIs your PT really checked out on BPPV? \"The PT was pretty concerned that it came back so fast\" makes me think that she does not fully understand. The three PTs I have worked with over the years all said that it may take many days of Epley to get a particular episode under control.\n\nMy advice is to make an appointment with an ENT, find a different PT for second opinion, do the Epley (or Sermont if you are checked out on those), and **take it easy**. No lifting for a while, sleep propped up, move your head slowly and deliberately, and so on.\n\nWishing you the best. Thanks so much.  To clarify, when the PT was surprised that it came back, this is a new episode.  I had an episode at Christmas time, had about a week of vertigo and then another couple of weeks to fully recover.  I was fine from mid January until last week.\n\nI am planning on making some phone calls tomorrow.  I did the epley on myself again yesterday and am actually feeling pretty good today, but have not tried any provocative positions.  I am just trying to rest today but still move around a little bit, so my vestibular system can start to work again, get some input. Thanks for clarifying.  I guess I am still not surprised that you got hit again within three months. The longest I have gone without a episode is 18 months, while the shortest was a couple months. \n\nI am still recovering from a mild episode that hit a couple weeks ago. And in response to your other question about Vitamin D, I had not heard of a link. I am often low however, and I have been slacking on my daily supplements, so it is time to kick that back into gear! Yikes!  I am sorry you get it that much.  If you look at my other post, u/RehaDesign posted an article showing a link between the two and I found several other articles that stated the same findings.  I figure it is worth a try. Have you discussed Meniere's Disease with your doctor? Either way, it sounda like your anxiety might be worse than the vertigo. Am I right? I am a 49 year old mom of a young one and I understand how you feel. Also, have you at any time done Brandt- Daroff exercises? Hi there.  So I saw the PT today, and, apparently, I am not presenting as typical BPPV.  I have vertigo but no nystagmus in some positions, but then nystagmus will start spontaneously a while later.  Sometimes, I had vertigo with no nystagmus and sometimes with it.\n\nWe went through many rounds of the Epley maneuver, and I started getting worse (extremely long duration) vertigo in the beginning position.  We tried a few other treatments as well.  We did try the Brandt-Daronf (sp?).  Then, randomly, I was able to lie down and sit up again without vertigo.  The PT was looking more and more concerned throughout.  She recommended that I see an ENT because she is concerned that there is something more going on, particularly with the right-side headaches I get (the same side as the BPPV).  I guess Meniere\u2019s is something we might talk about with the ENT.\n\nI also saw my naturopath today, and we are doing full bloodwork to see if anything comes up, particularly interested to see vitamin D levels.\n\nYou are right about the anxiety.  I cried anytime the kids were not around all weekend.  I am a single mom and all three of my kids have significant disabilities, so if I get to the point of not being able to work, I do not know what we will do.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude22\n\nI am feeling more positive now though, now that I have at least started treatment and have a plan.  I feel a little more in control now in a very out of control situation. You have to do the Brandt-Daroff every day, five times a day. It is not like Eppley where you do it once and it knocks the crystals back. I know five times a day seems like a lot but I have been doing it for two weeks and it really helps. I too, like the poster above, do not think it is weird to have had a recurring episode. From everything I have read it is very common. I am unclear on how long these episodes last--you said the worst one you had last about a minute, is that right? When you say you had it \"for a week\" at Christmas, do you mean you had it every morning when you woke up for several seconds or that you had it for an entire week without relent or what? Have you made an ENT appointment? One last question: Do you by any chance suffer from TMJ disorder? Thanks for the reply.  To answer your questions, when I said I had it for a week at Christmas, I meant every morning when I woke up.  The headache I had with jt was constant though.  \n\nI did make an ENT appointment yesterday.  It is not until 6/3 though.\n\nI do have TMJ issues, also on the right side.  My migraines and vertigo are always right-sides as well.\n\nThe PT yesterday said some of my stuff was consistent with BPPV (torsional nystagmus), but some was not (delayed onset of nystagmus, super slow nystagmus, sometimes absent nystagmus even with vertigo).  My vertigo and nystagmus were also extremely inconsistent.  I would have it one time, not have it the next, then have it again the third time.\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I dont think thr nystagmus need be consistent or even always present with bppv. I have had those sleep-spins myself but not for a while and not for that long. Are you saying you were awake for 5-6 hours a night when that was happening? Becasue if you were I am not surprised it lasted so long. When you are not sleeping it is only worse. \n\nI have tmj problems on my right that developed suddenly two weeks before the bppv following some dental work on my back right teeth. Im convinced it is connected.i also had a bad URI followed by a sinus infection just before the Tmj started. \n\nAssuming you are in the US I would call around and find an ENT who can see you this week. I had to make a few calls before I found one but hes great and fit me in the next morning. It really helps with the anxiety, which also makes everything worse and you have three kids with disabilities so you cannot be dealing with that. Yes, I was awake.  I have such a hard time sleeping anyway, but this makes it worse.  I did get 5 consecutive hours last night, which is really good for me.  \n\nThat is interesting about the dental work and the TMJ.  I do think my migraines, TMJ, and vertigo are related since they are all on the same side.\n\nIf you work, how do you handle having to miss 1-2 weeks work every time you have a vertigo attack?I think that might be the part that makes me most stressed.\n\nI feel encouraged about what you said about BPPV and nystagmus because, really, BPPV would be the best diagnosis I could get.\n\nHave you found anything to prevent attacks?  The thought of having to deal with this for a couple of weeks every few months is just horrifying to me. I am a stay-at-home mom and I only have one child and I am married, so my load is much lighter than yours. I do not think I could bear it if I had a job outside the house and three special-needs children. I mean, you do what you got to do but I would be a complete wreck. I have only had one of what I think you mean by \"attack.\" \n\nAs I mentioned, I did experience on several occasions over the last 6 months or a year the sleep-spins, and upon reflection after the attack I realized that there were many times where I would be at my computer at the table and feel a sudden, split-second slide that would cause me to grab the table to stabilize myself. I always chalked the sleep-spins to being really exhausted and maybe too much wine and the thing at the table I figured was me forgetting to breathe or simply being anxious, because I have had problems with panic and anxiety for 33 years. \n\nI woke up utterly exhausted on the morning of March 22. My son had climbed into my bed and was lying on my right. (MY husband sleeps in another bedroom because I am such a light sleeper I cannot tolerate any sound or movement.) My son said something and I turned my head to the right to look at him and the vertigo hit. I was still lying down flat on my back and I closed my eyes and tried to wake up a little better. I was scared though, and pulled myself up to sitting. The room instantly whirled around and I felt like gravity was pulling me to the right. I was terrified and laid back down. I remembered that two nights previous I had had a terrible headache in my right temple and tmj area that was one of the worst headaches I have ever had. Then the next night, the night before the vertigo, I had another headache only it was not as bad and I took some advil immediately. So I thought they had to be connected--the headache and the vertigo--and I was probably dying of a stroke or something. I panicked and sat up again and it was even worse so I laid back down and told my son to go get his dad. My husband came in and after a minute or so I sat up again and there vertigo was gone. I felt really out of it and tired all day and was obsessively assessing my balance. I went to an argent care and the doctor was a complete boner. He did the dix-hallpike and I do not think he saw the nystagmus. I did not know what he was doing at that point in this whole odyssey so I did not ask. He more or less blew me off and suggested I get an MRI of my sinuses. \n\nThe next few mornings I was very careful to wake up slowly and always sit up with my head turned to the left and I tried to keep it as horizontal as I could until my body was upright. I had a couple of moments where I felt the spin but it quickly resolved. However, I still felt extremely fuzzy-headed and kind of stuffed up all day, or most of the day, for about 2-3 weeks, some days better than others. The Monday following the attack, I got into the ENT i mentioned. He thought it was 100% bppv and Eppley'd me, Dix-Hallpiked me, tested balance, all that. He agreed I have a jaw out of alignment but disagreed that the tmp had any connection to the bppv. He sees it every day, he said. He said the crystals somehow got out of where they are supposed to be and we just need to get them someplace else. They do not have to go back to where they came from, they just have to get out of the canal they are in because they are fucking me up. \n\nI had a road trip (600 miles) planned for two days later and the ENT told me he did not want me to have ANY episodes before that because I was driving. I basically willed myself to feel as normal as possible for the next two mornings because I was determined to go on the trip. I had AWFUL tmj the whole time: headaches, jaw pain, dental pain, temporal pain--it was the fucking worst. I had two awakenings while on my trip--one from a nap and one in the morning--where I felt the vertigo for a period of seconds. I had to put my head back down and stare at a fixed spot on the wall then sit up again slowly. When I got back home I had a follow-up with the ENT. He scolded me for not doing the Brandt-Daroff exercises. I still felt very foggy and tired at this time but not having much vertigo, just transient dizziness here and there. So I started doing the B-D and I really believe it has helped. I am addicted to doing it now. It feel really important to me to do it three times a day. I also have begun doing my own facial massage on certain areas of my jaw and head and taking magnesium. I too stumbled upon the notion that vitamin might help dissolve the crystals but have not bought any. I took a decongestant for about 4 days hoping that might somehow help. That is around the time I felt a marked improvement. I do not know if it was related. I expect the vertigo to return. I know it can take many forms. I have a friend who has gotten it twice in the last couple of months where it lasts for hours. She is never gone to the dr. My mother has Meniere's. It is awful. Sorry this is so long. I hope it helps. First, I want to thank you for taking so much time to answer my questions.  Second, I am so sorry you are having to go through this as well.  Vertigo really is the worst.  Before my first episode, I had a migraine on that side for about a week off and on before I had vertigo, so I definitely think there is a connection between things.  One thing to remember is that doctors can sometimes fall prey to only seeing things in their specialty, so he ENT is going to be pretty quick to label it BPPV and to write off symptoms (or other concerns), such as possible vestibular migraine/TMJ, etc.  I bet if you went to a dentist, you might get a different answer.  That is why I always do my own research and get multiple opinions.  Anyway, I truly hope you do not get it again and that you heal from it fully. I DID go to a dentist! They wanted me to buy a night guard after I already gave them a thousand bucks to jack up my jaw. Yikes!  That really stinks.", "Hobbies/activities for people with BPPV? Hey everyone, \nI am going to be working with someone who has vertigo as well as severe anxiety. Does anyone have tips for what kinds of activites I can suggest or should avoid? Thank you!  Probably do not want to go to an Amusement park :)  Probably not =p  I was thinking more in the line of adult colouring books. Would that aggravate the vertigo? Really looking for indoorsy, easy activities. How about something  like chess? They can play it in person or online ((  That might work! Would the computer screen not set her vertigo off?  Depends what is causing the vertigo. If it is BPPV, no the computer screen will have no impact on her vertigo. My BPPV was not so easy to trigger. It only happened when I was lying down and if I turned my head to the side quickly. If I were sitting or standing, my BPPV would not be triggered by anything.  So, your best bet is to ask the person you are working with what triggers their vertigo.", "Is this BPPV? Every time I do this maneuver for the last month, I get this nystagmus and dizzy- the whole room feels upside down,but symptoms do not get better. My Dr still thinks it is BPPV.  Yes! This is a great video showing the nystagmus, showing that you are positive for having BPPV. After you lay this way for a minute or so and the vertigo and nystagmus goes away, do you do the next few steps of the Epley maneuver to try to get the crystal to rotate back around the ear canal into it is proper spot? The BPPV will not go away until this happens. I had to do the Epley twice a day, then wait a few days, then do it again for over two months. It took 20 times for me to finally be able to lay back and not have the severe vertigo, proving that the BPPV was finally cleared. Did the doctor help you with the Epley and explain it to you? The Dr told me to do this \u2014and then put my hand under my head as I lay on my side for 45 seconds and slowly sit up. Is there more to it that is super important to completing it properly? Thank you!  \nDo you only get symptoms when you do this with head turned to right? That is the video I attached. If it is your left find the left video. \n\nIt is reasonably good video which shows all the steps to fix it- the only thing I would add is in the third position (while on left side) you should have your nose pointed more towards the floor. You need to make sure you wait atleast 30-60 seconds in each position. Usually only do it max 2-3 times in a row (if you repeat it a second time and you have no symptoms still follow up with the full manouveure and then you can just leave it at that for that session). If your symptoms resolve you do not need to keep doing it. Sometimes you can get a BPPV hangover where you feel a bit off and not quite right for a day or so after you fix it but this should go away. Good luck. Yes this! Everything /u/seranet said! What frustrates me is the amount of doctors that do not know enough about BPPV and do not bother to refer to a dizzy specialist. Doctors do not realize that it is OK to not know something &amp; refer you to someone else. Google Dix Hallpike. That is the first step to the Epley maneuver that determines if you have bppv. The Epley is the maneuver that will get the crystal back in place. Search this forum as well for other great advice! You should be trying to do the Epley maneuver, what you are doing there is the first position. The last time I had bppv Epley did not help, it only made me feel really sick and brought on panic attacks. I ended up doing this maneuver instead. \n\nIt is really helpful to find a doctor or PT who has experience with treating BPPV, there are several different maneuvers that can help but it depends on which canal the crystal is in. It took me a month for my BPPV to settle after a few Maneuvers. \nI ended up going to a physical therapist that has vestibular rehabilitation training.\nThey were able to do the Epley at first but they ended up showing me another one that helped. I would do the exercises, go home sleep in a recliner for a couple days and then check if the vertigo came back when I laid flat. It took about 3 pt sessions. The rest of the sessions were for vestibular rehabilitation exercises to help with the residual dizziness.\n\nIm sorry. I know it feels awful. Best of luck. xx", "Meclizine and Epley maneuver First of all, I am so glad I found this group. I have had BPPV for decades, with and without nystagmus, including an episode so bad that I had to go to the ER. It turned out that I had crystals lodged \n\nHere is my question: I currently have BPPV on my left side, and when I lie flat on my back. I have not done the Epley for about three years, but am familiar with it. However, just setting up the pillow earlier today made me puke in seconds. \n\nWill the Epley work as well if I take meclizine first? There seems to be disagreements regarding how meclizine actually works with BPPV. \n\nTIA! Meclizine will not change the results of the Epley.  It may help you tolerate the Epley better as it may lesson the dizziness and nausea. Often if you are going in to a doctor or for therapy, they do not want you to take Meclizine, so that they can better see what is happening with your body. Meclizine may lessen the symptoms (nystagmus) that they are looking for.  That being said, the Meclizine is not going to change the crystal placement in your ear, or hinder it from moving as you do the Epley.\n\nDisclaimer - I am not a doctor, but have worked closely with a dizzy specialist for months (vestibular therapist).\n\nGood luck getting through the Epley! The anxiety of performing it - is real! UGH! Thanks so much for this info. I am now feeling considerably better about it. Today I went for my first appointment and the therapist seemed to think that the meclizine was masking my nystagmus as she could not really see anything even though I was clearly having balance issues.", "Thinking I possibly have BPPV? Back in September of 2020, I was relaxing in bed on my right side, and then looked up at my partner's face when it happened. I felt a strange falling sensation in my head before the room started spinning. I was already very much stressed from my student teaching at the time and had never felt vertigo before, so I panicked and started crying because it was such a bizarre and nauseating experience. I figured it was a one-time thing... an anxiety attack from stress I would been feeling at work.\n\nFast forward to today, about five months later. I am no longer a student teacher, and I have pretty much been relaxing at home while unemployed. I wake up this morning, turn to my right side and look up to grab my glasses, when I felt the strange falling sensation again. Now that I was familiar with this feeling, I knew what was coming next and closed my eyes immediately. Though my eyes were closed, I could feel the spinning sensation. It made me feel sick and nauseated. I slowly turned my face to face up while lying down and kept my eyes closed. I opened my eyes when I felt the spinning was slowing down in order to confirm that yes, the room was spinning just like 5 months ago. I turned to my left side to see if the same thing would happen, and I did not feel any vertigo. Then, to make sure, I turned to my right side again and the spinning began.\n\nThis time, I felt lightheaded and nauseated the whole day and was unable to complete the chores I had planned to do.\n\nTo those of you who have been diagnosed: do these seem like typical symptoms of BPPV? Should I be going to a doctor, or can I do self therapy to correct this?\n\nForgot to mention, 29 (F) This sounds like my own experience. No matter what, I would absolutely see a doctor. Consider having someone else drive you if you are still feeling it. Wishing you well and answers!", "Just had my worst episode and it really scared me I had trouble sleeping at night, I was tossing and turning, I was sleeping flat on my back and went to roll to the left and it hit, it felt like I was spinning out of control , I lay on my side jugging my pillow for dear life, usually the episodes last for 10 or 15 seconds, but this one was different, It went on with intense debilitating spinning for 3 minutes, never before when I have had this happen have I opened my eyes until the spinning stopped, but this time I did and what a messed up surreal feeling it is, I was looking straight ahead but the room was rotating to the left and snapping back to center and repeating over and over, finally it stopped but it left my feeling sick to my stomach and any head movement makes me feel dizzy, at first I felt like I was dying I am so sorry you are going through this. You described my first episode exactly. All I can say is that it does get better and the spins stop.\n\nIt is been 2 months since I woke up with it and for me it was a super slow recovery and I am still not 100%. \n\nGo see a Physical Therapist or balance center to have them do some maneuvers on you. Do the post treatment steps and get some good rest.\n\nI hope you start to feel better soon. I know it sucks. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f This episode is still going on as I type, the spinning is not bad If I do not move, but I had to let the dogs out so I stood up and held on to my bed and opened the sliding window so they could go out, made it back to bed and started dry heaving Bless your heart, I know your struggle. Have you taken anything for the nausea?\n\nGinger tea, candies, etc helped me the most. I prefer the tea. There are also OTC meds as well. I am to afraid to move, I have to go to the bathroom and i am holding it in because I dont want to move Oh man. BPPV is positional. I found that if I kept my head as straight as I could, I could walk around enough to do what I needed to do but thankfully I had someone to help me. \n\nDo you have anyone to get you anything or take you to see a PT/Vestibular Specialist? There are videos on YouTube that show you how to do the maneuvers but I would recommend having a professional do it for you the first time. I tried do it myself and did not do it properly and made it worse. I just texted my wife to see if she could get off work That is good! I hope she can come help you soon. I am sorry you are not doing well. I hope you get this resolved and feeling good again soon.\n\nTake good care of yourself! \u2764\ufe0f Ty kitty Have you seen a vestibular/balance specialist? \n\n&gt; I was looking straight ahead but the room was rotating to the left and snapping back to center and repeating over and over\n\nYou described nystagmus which is one of the top ways of diagnosing bppv. (\n\nIt will not go away without proper treatment. You have a physical object that is fucking up your brain signals which is triggering the BPPV. It is not going to get better on its own. Go see a GOOD specialist. You might get lucky with a PT doing some Epley, but mine did not go away until I saw one of America's premiere vertigo specialists. \n\nGood luck. I took a small nap in a semi sitting up position and that has helped with the nausea, as long as I do not move my head to the left or the right I do not get the spins, I am starting to test if I turn my head slowly if that will work, Yes the spinning sucks but the nausea afterwards like you are Car sicks is bad as well, I have dry heaved like 20 times, but luckily I have not eaten Did yours linger until it was properly treated?\n\nI am beginning to wonder if mine was properly treated....and i just waited it out for 2 months until it went away on its own. \ud83e\udd14 Good question - No. \n\nDid I get it \"treated\" before? Yes. And it was not fully addressed. \n\nA pt can do more than you, but they most likely will not be as good as a clinic that specializes ONLY in vestibular/inner ear dizziness. For instance, the PT did as much as they can with their equipment. The specialist I saw had numerous diagnostic machines solely for the treatment of vertigo. The initial diagnostic testing took 6 hrs and I was not \"cured\" until (  that chair is crazy looking, you would think that alone would make you dizzy I am still at the beginning stages of figuring out what to do, my wife just got home and brought me some meds for the nausea and spinning and now were going to do the exercises, she is a nurse and when I first texted her about what was happening she worried it could be a stroke If you have BPPV it will. It flings you at angles that is not possible by doing the epley on a table. \n\nThe stone in my ear was pretty deep so I needed this chair to address the angle. I know this is old, but your case sounds exactly like my third episode, and I just wondered if you ever got better and how?"]
