["18y (Male) 125 pounds Hello im franky I am 18 years old live in LA im having some questions resulting my CBC I went in for night sweats and itching and swallon lymph node which for a cool minute i was scared i had lymphoma but my blood test show normal WBC but instead I found something interesting i had high RBC and billiburbin here are what my test looked like \n\n1st CBC -\nHemoglobin 17.2     Normal range (16.9)\nBilliburbun -1.5.        Normal range (1.2) \n\n2nd CBC -\nHemoglobin 17.1 \nBilliburbin 2.5 which i think was because i read about PV and got stressed \n\n3rd CBC\nHemoglobin 17.3\nBilliburbin 1.7 \n\nLiver function came out normal \n\nI got a ultrasound in my gallbladder to make sure it was okay all came back good \n\nNow I have a visit to hematologist on 8/13 will update pls repost if u have any idea what can cause these results i also do not smoke or drink i live 40 ft above sea level but i do have a abnormal EKJ as well Good luck with your upcoming appointment. Hopefully they can tell you more. Dont google too much or you will start to fret. Wait till you get answers then google. Any updates OP? Update: test came back negative also did all my tumor marker test and my liver function test they do not know why I have to much hemoglobin but it is nothing concerning im starting a trail in spring pf 2021 hopefully we can get to the bottom of this", "Spleen on high side of normal, high hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC, and iron. Joint pain. I have been having weird CBC\u2019s and my MRI showed a larger spleen. Repeat CBC hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBC dropped to just below normal. Any thoughts? Should I seek out a hematologist? My PCP said they were worried about my blood panels and sent me to a GI... I would request a referral to a hematologist. That is what I think I am going to do...", "Anyone with MPN's / Polycythemia get the vaccine yet? Curious if anyone who has myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), in the case I am interested in being polycythemia, been vaccinated with the Moderna or Pfizer mRNA vaccine? Since the vaccine sends a message to your cells (that receive the mRNA) to play with proteins, it makes me wonder if the gene mutations associated with MPN cause problems here. The gene mutations JAK2, ASXL1, etc. play a role in managing proteins in the bone marrow. Since the DNS has a mutation in this area, curious to see if anyone here has had the vax, has MPN's, and has had any issues?\n\nThanks. I got the Pfizer- feeling great. \nMPN specialists said in a conference (through the leukemia and lymphoma society) to please get the vaccine. That is encouraging news! I had the Moderna both shots January/February and I feel fine. Felt off a bit but I can never tell anymore lol All my doctors and specialists said get it if it is offered. Thank you. Just got the first dose of Pfizer yesterday. I think I am experiencing some symptoms, I just feel very fatigued and my muscles feel slightly achey. But nothing major! So far so good. I got the Pfizer vaccine and everything is great :) Great news. Thanks! That is awesome news. Thanks! Got my first Moderns shot three weeks ago. Had a sore arm and a little tired the next day but that was it. I got the Pfizer first dose and had very mild allergic reaction. I have been having allergic reaction to several things recently (e.g. terbinafine, minoxidil, finasteride, dunasteride)\nSince then I have been having adrenal fatigue, even thou it might not be related to the vaccine. Update: I got my second Pfizer dose on Tuesday (48 hours ago) and the only side effect is a sore arm. A little more sore than after the first shot, but so far no issues.", "Should I push my PCP? Hey you all\u2014 I am a 29 year old male and beginning of 2021 I decided to get a PCP since had some health anxiety and had an h pylori infection treated by a gastro. \n\nI never had a PCP in my life and my doctors visits consisted of urgent care visits besides going to a gastro after some bloating and loss of appetite.\n\nAnyway the PCP orders some basic blood work just because I never really had any performed in my life that I remember. \n\nBlood work comes back with high RBC\u20146.13 and the range is 4.2-5.8 and MCH and MCV is low. PCP orders some more blood work. RBC is high again\u20146.23.  \n\nSooo PCP tells me everything looks okay besides my high RBC and low MCV and MCH says to wait 3 months and do another CBC.\n\n3 months come along and again my RBC is high at 5.93. I get a call from the PCP office and they tell me that since I do not have any other symptoms they believe everything is fine.\n\nI google high RBC and Polycythemia/PV comes up\u2014-never heard of it but now I am questioning why my PCP did not bring it up. \n\nShould I push my PCP for more testing? I do not know if I am just being dramatic or what but I do not understand that if everything came back fine besides the high RBC  and low MCH and MCV than would not my PCP want to look into it more? The diagnostic criteria for PV looks at hemoglobin and hematocrit rather than RBC. The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria state either hemoglobin over 16.5, hematocrit over 49%, or red cell mass over 25%.    \nSee the WHO diagnostic criteria here:\n\n\n\nYour RBC is not very high, just slightly over the threshold. It is very possible that your counts could have been elevated due to dehydration. Another factor to consider is lab error, so repeating the blood test at a hospital lab is not a bad idea. \n\n\nIt is more likely your high RBC is not PV, but rather Secondary Polycythemia which is caused by factors other than mutation, including things that lower oxygen levels such as sleep apnea, smoking, COPD, asthma, etc; things that affect the EPO hormone (which is released by your kidneys) such as kidney disease and steroid use or high testosterone levels; plus a number of other less common causes. Once the underlying cause is treated, your blood levels go back to normal and you are cured. \n\n\nIt would not hurt to request a referral to a hematologist, preferably from this list.  \nVetted List of MPN specialists in the USA:    \n", "Should I Be Worried?? Hello,  \n\n\nI have kidney disease, and in my recent lab work for my nephrologist my RBC, Hematocrit, and Hemoglobin were all high. My Albumin and Creatinine were also high, tho my creatinine is usually slightly elevated.  \n\n\nAre there other reasons those could be high? Obviously I immediately googled my blood test results (my drs appt isnt for another week) and kept getting polycythemia in the results, which in turn freaked me out.   \n\n\nI am looking for some reassurance that this would not suddenly pop up out of nowhere! I had labs done back in Aug and everything was normal (except creatinine). Is there something else that could cause all three of those to be elevated at the same time, out of the blue like this?  \nI have been battling headaches for the last 6 weeks, but I assumed it was stress related or something as they started recently and just seem to crop up most days. They are pretty mild tho, minus the occasional one that wakes me up at night. Of course now after reading about polycythemia now I am worried about those as well.   \n\n\nThank you for any reassurances or insight everyone! Hello, googling polycythemia Vera is a frightening experience! There are Facebook groups with members who have been dealing with this for 30 years! \nThe only true definitive way to diagnose pv is through a bone marrow biopsy, but there are some\nBlood tests that will narrow it all down. \nIt is really rare, so chances are good that it is something else. \nGood luck!! PV is pretty rare as Jacksmom22 said. There are a series of tests that need to be done and guidelines that need to be met for diagnosis. You would have to be tested for genetic mutations along with bmb etc. \n\nNow for the answer can it just creep up on you, mine did. I looked at previous tests and there was no indication until the day I wacked my head my levels were out of whack. And that is what lead to the PV diagnosis.\n\nGoogle is not your friend when looking up symptoms and researching. Dont do that it will just stress you out more. Talk to tour health professional. A BMB is a bone marrow biopsy. They found mine on routine bloodwork. I am 28. The dr called and told me my platelets were abnormally high, redid the test. Still high. I freaked out. For years, I had migraines( still have them)  and I saw like 15 doctors in less than 10 years and I do not think a single one of them ever ordered bloodwork. \n\nThere is no indication that I had a problem. Other than I was in pain and they did scans and \u201csorry we do not know why you get migraines. We do not know how to help because it is not like you have a tumor or anything...\u201d then I got \u201cyou are having headaches because you are depressed. Maybe it is \u201csomatic.\u201d \n\nAll I kept saying was \u201cI am not having headaches because I am depressed. I am depressed because I have migraines and headaches.\u201d \n\nAnyway it was like \u201cI told you something was wrong, Doc.\u201d\n\nThere are Facebook groups but I am young so I just found it sort of annoying how old some of these people were and they were having a lot of pain that I just do not have like bone pain. And a lot of people seeming to ask about their blood work when they should be asking their doctor and people giving advice who are not qualified to give an opinion. I left the Facebook groups. \n\nBlood cancer\nBlood cancer\n\nThat big C word everyone fears.\n\nSo after going to a hematologist she sent me to a second opinion because she never saw a 27 year old with PV. Then left that doctor because she well was rude and unprofessional. \n\nMoving on, so now I see a nurse practitioner and an MD who are oncologists. They figured out that my headaches are much worse when my platelets are high. It seems I am being treated with hydrea and for a while it was keeping my platelets down and headaches were less.  But now I am on and they are not going down enough, so we will see. Headaches are my worst symptom. Might have to switch to Pegasus again, which is a self injection subcutaneously. We are you diagnosed with blood work only? (No bone marrow) No I needed a CBC twice then a hematologist did a bone marrow biopsy Do you have the mutation? I guess what I am getting at is does one need a BMB do be diagnosed? Yes I have the Jak2 mutation. I do not believe they can determine if you have PV unless they test the bone marrow for it. \n\nYes you need to have a bone marrow biopsy to be diagnosed it is how they test for the mutation. I thought the genetic test was via blood draw? Nope.", "How likely is Polycythemia Vera for me? Earlier this year I went to the doctor because my health was beginning to cripple me. Severe head pressure, massive memory problems, egregious and worsening Tachycardia, high blood pressure, joint pain, vision changes, potential absence seizures, and a host of other symptoms as well.\n\nI got some basic bloodwork done, and my RBC came out to be 11.44 ( 10 (6) ) in a range of 4.2-5.3. My doctor however made no mention of this whatsoever and told me \"everything is in the normal range\" which is complete nonsense. My thyroid was also high (people kept telling me I probably had hypothyroid because of the fatigue... but my tachycardia, rapid weight loss, and constant \"fever\" disagrees). She is either not interested in healing people, or knows she has no idea how to treat either of these conditions so she gave up that easily. \n\nThat number is extremely high, so much so that it is almost hilarious, and I see other people getting referred to hematologists with a count 4 below mine. People often get worried with a \"high\" RBC count of 5.8-6 or something and I cannot help but scratch my head why my 11.44 was taken so lightly by my physician (all of this is keeping in mind the different unit types).\n\nI am 5'7\" (Male) at 125lbs. I have gotten several phlebotomies done but it is not on any sort of schedule right now because I do not have a diagnosis, and it was after each time I would gotten bloodwork done. In a a few day time span, I would lost two pints of blood - one time from a phlebotomy, and then a few days after that, from blood donation (I was experimenting to see if the Red Cross would reject my blood) --\n\nA normal person would not be able to tolerate this at all - most people get lightheaded and dizzy after a regular blood donation, or at least have some symptoms like their head will spin if start running. But for me, that was not the case at all. I was not dizzy or lightheaded and I actually had positive benefits, like a dramatic drop in blood pressure (brought it from hypertensive to nearly normal).\n\nDoes anyone on here have experience with elevated RBCs to such a degree? I have insurance now, so I can start seeing doctors (this was forced on me by my parents, I wanted to go to them self-pay but I do not have legal authority over myself) --\n\nbut it does not seem like I will be getting my insurance card any time soon, and then I might be forced into waiting for when I turn 18 so I can visit an IM which will be another few months out. Then I have to likely get bloodwork done again, wait for the results, wait for his consult so he can give me his interpretation, wait for more testing or wait for my appointment with a specialist... it will take time for me to figure any of this out. \n\nSo in the meantime, does anyone here have a good understanding of what my chances of having this condition are? \n\nThank you! Your doctor is not doing anything wrong. It is quite possible she is just watching it because it does not seem to be a problem for you or she suspects it but is going to just monitor it for now. \n\nUsually to diagnose PV there needs to be a pattern of inconsistent bloodwork. PV cannot be diagnosed by blood counts alone, so stop acting like your doctor does not know anything.\n\nAlso\u2014a GP probably cannot diagnose you and it takes about a month to determine a diagnosis. \n\nThey cannot diagnose PV without a bone marrow biopsy. You get a needle in your back and then they take a sample of it and then send it to a pathologist and it takes about 2-3 weeks to get a result.\n\nTypically this is performed by a hematologist but I guess some GPs can do it too.\n\nIt is one thing to know something is wrong with you and it seems like someone is not taking it seriously, but if you think something is wrong, go to another doctor and get a second opinion. \n\nBut I do not see anything your doc is not doing. I would see an MPN specialist. Hello. I appreciate your input on this matter - I have seen you comment on here before and you have always given valuable information on this topic, I appreciate to see you trying to help me get things sorted as well.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot agree with you off the bat though. I could possibly agree with you if I thought she was even doing anything at all. Initially, she told my all of my bloodwork was \"in the normal ranges\" which is not true at all and, at least for my thyroid condition, has been touched on by a specialist and was confirmed to be Hyperthyroid. That went unnoticed, and so did my high RBC. But like with the Thyroid issue, where it was said to be a non-issue and ended up being one, I cannot be confident in her assertion that this is not anything to worry about.\n\nI do have a pattern of inconsistent bloodwork. My RBC is always elevated to an extreme degree, same with my Hematocrit. My hemoglobin fluctuates, it is generally right at the high end of normal or one over at most. Nothing concerning really. \n\nShe never monitored me. Every time I got bloodwork done, I have gotten phlebotomies done after to control the RBC. But nothing else was done really, and she is largely absent in this process - she just orders it to get done, and the phlebotomist does it, and she is not the one who can answer my questions.\n\nI am not a person at general risk for high RBCs due to lifestyle factors - such as living at high altitude, or something like that. I drink plenty of water, dehydration is not the concern. Sleep apnea is technically on the table only because I have not been officially told by a doctor that I do not have it, but I am not convinced I do since I have no signs or symptoms specifically relating to it (my sleep issues propagated by the hyperthyroid anyway), and even then I doubt it would double the count (from what I have read online, it would have to be extremely severe for that to happen, but I sleep great throughout the night all things considered).\n\nI am not expecting my GP to diagnose or treat me - what I was hoping for is a referral to a specialist who can at the very least. And the reason I have not seen one yet is because I went to two other specialists first (for unrelated reasons) but this one was on the list. I just got my insurance sorted out, so I can finally start seeing someone, but like I outline and which you briefly touched on, this will not be a terribly speedy process.  \n\n\n&gt; but if you think something is wrong \n\nDo you just mean with my blood? Well, I do think something is wrong. Generally a count doubled over what it should be is a problem, especially this one it seems. That is just common sense as far as I am concerned. And if you mean more generally, then I obviously think something is wrong because I have a host of horrific symptoms, some of which (I am thinking of my blood pressure and heart rate specifically) get massively improved when I undergo phlebotomies.\n\nOnce again, I appreciate your input and you taking your time to write out your thoughts on this for me. But to answer your last point \"But I do not see anything your doc is not doing,\" my response would be \"anything at all, even acknowledging the possibility of an issue.\" I am switching doctors but there is technicalities as to why I have not been able to yet and will not be able to for a few months. You do not need to get defensive with me. I was not at all aware that this was not just a first time one blood cell count. My doc actually repeated the CBC a second time to make sure it was not a fluke. \n\nI had a terribly unresponsive doctor and I switched and thank God, but even that unresponsive dr sent me for a second opinion. But I switched doctors because she could not be bothered to call me back. \n\nBut def go see another doc. Good luck. Hi, thanks for reading out everything I wrote and responding super quickly, I appreciate it. :) \n\nI actually was not defensive at all, I do see how it could seem that way, but I was only trying to point things out as I saw it and doing that did require me to push back on what you said a little bit. \n\nI have been told by various people that I am \"overly worried\" and \"should trust my doctor, she went to med school\" and promptly dismissing both my physical condition overall (indirectly anyway) and my legitimate concerns (even if PV is not even close to what I suffer from, which I realize is more of a possibility than not given how rare the disease is).\n\nAnd I hate it when people self-diagnose, but walking around knowing a number which could indicate an issue and not having an answer on it for upwards of a year now, it starts to become stressful especially when my quality of life has dropped so dramatically over the past 5 years.\n\nI definitely am switching doctors, I am probably going to wait to see anyone until I am 18 because then I can visit an internist who I would trust more than someone who is family medicine. Hopefully they can refer me to a hematologist (or someone else in a relevant field), but even if they do not, I can either switch to another GP or just book an appointment to one without a referral.\n\nI posted on here because I would seen so many people with RBCs that are not even 1 over the high end of their reference range, and their doctors are getting them tested because of it. How can my count be doubled and yet I am told to simply go home and forget about it? It makes no sense. Really I am surprised your doc has not sent you for a referral yet. I would encourage you to get your medical records with doctors notes because then you can see if the doc is negligent or just putting this off on purpose.  Do not tell them why. Also, I would call your insurance company and ask if you are able to go to a specialist without a referral. I know some insurance companies will not authorize specialist visits without a referral. \n\nSome doctors really suck. I do not care if they went to med school, something jaded them where now they are apathetic. Everyone is just a depressed hypochondriac. \n\nI had migraines for the better part of a decade.  I am 28. I went to 16 doctors obgyns, family doctors, neurologists, a dentist, an allergist, an ent, and not a single one of them decided to do blood work. I have tried all kinds  I was dismissed for a long time. And I had a doc after a CT scan, tell me, \u201cwell you must be fine, we do not know what is wrong with you and what else we can do with you.\u201d I still get\nMigraines but they are lessened now that my platelet count is normal. The migraines were CONSTANT. All the time. Almost all of my waking hours were consumed with a headache. \n\nBeing dismissed is incredibly aggravating. Turns out, I have had migraines because of PV and in more than 10 years all but one doctor ordered bloodwork. \n\nI was pissed seeing doctor after doctor, telling me nothing was wrong or they could not find anything wrong with me. Then one had the nerve to say I am having migraines because I was depressed. I am like, I am depressed because I am in pain, it is not all in my head. It is like \u201cI told you something was wrong!\u201d \n\nTurns out with my platelets reduced most headaches are gone now. Best of luck.", "FAQs about Polycythemia Vera I think this is how I make a post that gets stickied. Here are some FAQs that you should read before making your post. \n\n**FAQs:** Data was put compiled from the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, NORD and MPN research foundations. I will include links below so you can search yourself. Please read the sticky before asking \u201cDo I have this based on my symptoms and blood work?\u201d We are not able to diagnose you and are only people who have been diagnosed. Take what we say with a grain of salt. We are not doctors, and we are not YOUR doctor. **This forum is not to be used as medical advice.** \n\n**Do I have PV based on my blood work?** \n\nThe answer to this question is\u2014you need to be asking your doctor. Typically, if your numbers are only slightly out of range one time, it is not something to be concerned about\u2014unless a healthcare professional has told you that it is. \n\nUsually, your blood work would be consistently high. \n\n**My doctor told me I have polycythemia. What is that?** \n\nPolycythemia is an increase in the number of red blood cells in the body. There are two types of polycythemia. PV can be life-threatening if not treated, because you have a much higher chance of having a blood clot. Basically, you have too many red blood cells or platelets and your blood clots more easily (in layman\u2019s terms: thick blood) which can cause life-threatening blood clots. \n\n**Vera:** A genetic mutation of the JAK2 gene. 95% of PV patients have this acquired genetic mutation. This is permanent and there is no cure. B\n\n**Secondary**: Something else is causing it\u2014could be sleep apnea, snoring, kidney problems, obesity, cancer, and a multitude of other things. Once that underlying cause is treated, it will go away. The majority of people with polycythemia, have secondary, and it will go away once the cause is treated. \n\n**What causes the JAK2 mutation?** \n\nWe really do not know. Spontaneous gene mutations happen all the time sometimes with or without cause.   \n \n\n**Did I get this from my family?** \n\nThe research does not suggest that the JAK2 mutation is passed down from parent to child. It is possible, but the research does not suggest this. When talking about \u201cgenetics\u201d over here, it is best to use the word \u201chereditary\u201d instead of genetic when talking about family history. PV it is a genetic disease because it is caused by a gene mutation. \n\n**How do I know if I have this?** \n\nYou must see a hematologist, (blood specialist), a bone marrow biopsy is typical to diagnose and is usually performed after it is suspected you have PV. This will allow them to look at your red blood cells and get a decent sample. There are usually other minor criteria that are tested and supplementally used to determine PV in addition to the JAK2 mutation. \n\n**What is a bone marrow biopsy?** \n\nA bone marrow biopsy involves taking a sample of solid bone marrow material. A bone marrow aspiration is usually done at the same time. During an aspiration, your doctor withdraws a sample of the liquid portion of your marrow.\n\n**What symptoms are associated with PV?** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Headache\n* Sweating\n* Ringing in the ears\n* Blurred vision or blind spots\n* Dizziness or vertigo\n* Reddish or purplish skin\n* Unexpected weight loss\n* Bleeding or clotting\n* Early feeling of fullness (satiety)\n* Itching (pruritis), especially after taking a shower\n* Burning and redness of the hands or feet\n* Tiredness (fatigue)\n* Night sweats\n* Bone pain\n* Enlarged spleen\n\n**What treatments are available to me? THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE.** \n\n**Phlebotomy**  \n Phlebotomy is the removal of blood to reduce the number of blood cells. With fewer blood cells, the blood is thinner and flows more easily, improving symptoms and reducing the risk for blood clotting. This procedure is typically done to meet target blood count goals that are determined by the physician, taking into consideration the patient\u2019s sex and other factors.\u00a0\n\n**Low-Dose Aspirin**  \n Most, if not all PV sufferers are prescribed a low-dose aspirin treatment. Since aspirin prevents platelets from sticking together, it reduces the occurrence of blood clots that can cause life-threatening heart attacks or strokes.\n\nCombined with low-dose aspiring, the regular maintenance of a hematocrit below .45 for men and .42 for women is currently accepted as a non-leukomegenic approach and a first choice treatment for recently diagnosed, low-risk PV patients.\n\nIf phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin are not effective or appropriate, or if a patient is consider higher risk for blood clotting, physicians may prescribe medicine to lower red blood count and relieve symptoms, including:\n\n**Hydroxyurea (HU)**  \n Hydroxyurea is often prescribed for PV patients at high risk for blood clots, based on age and prior history of blood clotting.\n\n**Jakafi (ruxolitinib)**  \n Jakafi is the first FDA-approved treatment for PV patients who have an inadequate response to or cannot tolerate hydroxyurea. Jakafi inhibits the JAK 1 and 2 enzymes that are involved in regulating blood and immunological functioning. It also helps decrease the occurrence of an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) and the need for phlebotomy. Patients do not need to be JAK2 positive to take Jakafi, though the great majority with PV harbor this mutation.\n\n**Pegylated Interferon**  \n Younger patients who require treatment and women of childbearing age are often treated with pegylated interferon because it has not been shown to cause birth defects. Since Pegasys was developed for Hepatitis C and not MPN, it is considered an \u201coff-label\u201d medication. There are several clinical trials currently being conducted to evaluate Pegasys in people with MPNs.\n\n**What is the prognosis? Am I going to die?** \n\nYou are not going to die. If you receive treatment, you can live a long, healthy life. PV is an overwhelming diagnosis, because it is classified as the big \u201cc\u201d word. There is research available. \n\n**Possible complications of polycythemia vera include:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Blood clots.**\u00a0Increased blood thickness and decreased blood flow, as well as abnormalities in your platelets, raise your risk of blood clots. Blood clots can cause a stroke, a heart attack, or a blockage in an artery in your lungs or a vein deep within a leg muscle or in the abdomen.\n* **Enlarged spleen.**\u00a0Your spleen helps your body fight infection and filter unwanted material, such as old or damaged blood cells. The increased number of blood cells caused by polycythemia vera makes your spleen work harder than normal, which causes it to enlarge.\n* **Problems due to high levels of red blood cells.**\u00a0Too many red blood cells can lead to a number of other complications, including open sores on the inside lining of your stomach, upper small intestine or esophagus (peptic ulcers) and inflammation in your joints (gout).\n* **Other blood disorders.**\u00a0In rare cases, polycythemia vera can lead to other blood diseases, including a progressive disorder in which bone marrow is replaced with scar tissue, a condition in which stem cells do not mature or function properly, or cancer of the blood and bone marrow (acute leukemia).\n\n**I am in my 20s-30s, could I have PV?** \n\nYes. A lot of the research suggests elderly people get this, but I think it is because it has not been discovered in a lot of young people. \n\n**For more information and to read the sources this information was compiled from:** \n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\n(\n\nIf you are in the USA, this list has a good place to start with MPN specialists in most US states. There are certainly MPN specialists who are not on this list. \n\n(", "White Blood cell count question. Hello I was refered to a hematologist who I had an appointment with last week. In two weeks I am getting a bunch of blood tests as well as the JAK2 mutation test. Im wondering how common white blood cell count being elevated is in regards to PV. My last test my wbc was 13.3. a month before that it was 14. My other counts are 6.24 RBC, Hemoglobin 18.6, Hematocrit 53.1. \nI am worried about my wbc being high because I am not sure if it is related to my other blood counts being high. Any thoughts on this would be great. \n\nIf it helps at all I am 27 and male. Most of the symptoms I have are chest pain, abodminal pain, ringing in ears, sweating. These started about 6 months ago. My cbcs have been in this range that I know of since december which is when I was first sent for blood work. Your WBC is a bit high. Many PV patients also have high WBC. The reason for this is that the JAK2 mutation is causes the myeloid stem cell to be constantly stimulated to make cells. Your myeloid stem cell makes red blood cells, platelets and granulocytes. Granulocytes include eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils. \"White blood cells\" aka \"leukocytes\" are a blanket term that includes all the cells produced by your lymphoid stem cell (t cells, b cells, lymphocytes, phagocytes, etc) AS WELL AS the granulocytes produced by your overactive myeloid stem cell. \n\n\nEvery PV patient presents a little differently. Most present with high RBCs and hematocrit. Some mostly show high hemoglobin. Some (like me) have high platelets and WBCs predominate. But they are all caused by the same mutation / myeloid stem cell.\n\n\nYou have not been diagnosed yet, so there could be an entirely different reason for your counts. At any rate, your WBCs are not sky high, so try not to stress about it. The diagnostic part takes a while and the waiting for results sucks. I learned a lot from your post -- thanks. Hey! Did you end up getting results for those tests? How did things turn out? Thanks for asking! I got my results back and I did not have the jakk mutation. My counts where still high. My hematologist suggested a sleep study and I found out I have sleep apnea. Things have improved significantly from when I made this post after starting treatment for sleep apnea. I also am giving blood every two months just in case and because it is helping others in need. I did find out I have mthfr mutation (which is pretty common) and I am taking methyfolate for that. Much improved cannot thank my care enough!", "Is mildly elevated hematocrit with super low iron stores concerning? I have been spending months in bed for years with unexplained headaches, chest pain and abdominal pain.  \n\nMy hematocrit is 47+. Hemoglobin 15+.  RBC 5.3.  But, my ferritin is 9 (16-154 is normal).  EPO is 3.2. I am female. \n\nIs there any mechanism for a person to make that many red blood cells with such low iron stores/EPO besides a genetic mutation?\n\nI do not smoke, have a heart problem, live at altitude, drink, am very thin, do not have sleep apnea, etc. Have you met with a hematologist? Have you been tested for the JAK2 mutation (and others)? The only absolutely definitive diagnostic test is a bone marrow biopsy. How are your platelets? I have met with a hematologist.   He declined to test for the JAK2 mutation saying my symptoms were not specific enough. I have a referral into another.  My platelets are not that high 250 range. \n\nIm mostly wondering what else can create so many red  blood cells with no iron? I am glad you are getting another opinion. There is also a list of MPN specialists somewhere out there, so hopefully you get some answers soon. Yeah I saw that list.  There are no MPN specialists here unfortunately or in surrounding states where my insurance will cover visits.  I requested an appt for with an oncologist doing a jak 2 inhibitor clinical trial with openings. Ruxolitinib.  This seems to be the closest I am going to get. Have you been tested for other things like sleep apnea, kidney issues, and other issues? Kidneys have been imaged and egfr and related bloodwork is normal and I have been told they are fine.\n\nI do not snore or have the EPO levels to support sleep apnea (or kidney or other issues for that matter). \n\n\n\n\nSleep apnea epo levels were 30-60 vs mine at 3\n\nIs it typical to have to be tested for everything under the sun before a JAK mutation? Usually yes. It is going to be important that you are tested for the mutation prior to starting any trials. Yes, I just wanted to make sure I saw specialist  with at least one polycythemia vera patient. Really not sure about the last hematologist I saw. No way I would be included in this trial without a mutation. Oh well.  There is really not much else to test for. Totally! Good luck on your diagnosis journey. Have you had your thyroid checked recently?  It could be a number of things but I think if you do not have the Jak2 mutation, I would think it is something else, although there are people who do not have the mutation. I have not been tested for the JAK2 mutation. \n\nThyroid hormones have repeatedly tested normal. I am just suggesting it could be many other things. \n\nHave you had an ultrasound of your spleen? If it is enlarged and you are having abdominal pain, then this very much could be pv. \n\nThat was one of the diagnostic criteria that led them to doing a bone marrow biopsy and doing the Jak2 test.\n\nthe diagnostic criteria they used for me \n1. I had an enlarged spleen because it was making platelets.\n2. I had the JAK2 mutation \n3. I consistently had high platelets over 1 million for weeks at a time.\n4. My Erythropoietin was at a level 1. \n\nThe fact that I was having unexplained headaches, I had been having for probably a decade and no medication would touch them. I constantly had a headache. Thanks! I had headaches starting 25 years ago with such high white blood cell counts they did a spinal tap. But of course could find no viral or bacterial cause. \n\nI bled buckets during my period during my teens or twenties so if I was making an excess of red blood cell counts, nobody would have ever been the wiser.  I literally would have puddles of blood on the floor as the norm.\n\nOnly after being on the continuous birth control pill for twelve years where I do not have a period more then a few times a year, do I have enough iron \ud83d\ude02 to make a couple extra red blood cells. \n\nBut I have either beat my white blood cells into submission with years of daily antihistamine and leukotriene inhibitors,  low iron is suppressing them or I am running out.  They are going down. My immune system feels strangely calm after dealing with years of anaphylaxis and recent itching. \n\nI do not know if my spleen is enlarged. The hematologist said he could not tell. Other doctors are not concerned about anything bc levels are only mildly elevated.  There is a CT scan of it.  But, nobody has asked radiology for a read.\n\nMy headaches are incidentally under control btw with a calcium channel blocker which is for Raynauds and poor circulation to my legs - blood is like molasses. \n\nI am waiting to hear back from my doctor if I should start taking some iron supplements. That sounds very much like it could be pv.\n\nI do not have low iron, or have heavy periods, but they basically told me that is surprising. You will need an ultrasound to see if the spleen in enlarged.\n\nBut good luck friend. I wish you the best of luck in treating primary/secondary polycythemia. I hope you get some answers! &gt; But good luck friend. \n\nThank you. I need it!", "Looks very much like PV to me. Also the levels are concerning. I am going to see the doctor on Monday.

I just do not want to drop dead between then. I am so nervous.\nThanks for any response. Breathe. You are getting yourself checked out. That is the only way you will know. It is okay. Take it easy. PV is very treatable and it is not a death sentence. I know that is not always the case with multiple myeloma. \n\nWhy are you waiting to make another doctor's appointment? Or do you mean you MADE an appointment and you are waiting for that appointment?  I am not a medical professional but I think it is highly unlikely you will drop dead between now and your next appointment. That being said, I would still schedule your appointment for sooner than later if you have not already. \n\nIf it makes you feel any better,  I was waking around with a hemoglobin of 25 and a hematocrit of 74 before I was diagnosed and I never dropped dead. \n\nHope everything goes well and as others said, PV is not a death sentance. Well it was the weekend. Now I can make an appointment. I am just super stressed. I had another test that said it went back down to 5.6 but that was after an in IV and proper hydration. Sometimes that happens. Do not be scared :) you got this. You can handle this! Got back from my GP. He thought my labs looked okay and that I am being over anxious. Is starting me on ssri. The whole pulse rising when I am standing still keeps scaring me. This is also possible a response to some other stimuli. Usually regular secondary polycythemia is caused by something else and once that \u201csomething else\u201d is treated, it usually goes away.", "Anyone here contracted and got over Covid? So I just tested positive for COVID19. have had PV since 2017. Am on Jakafi, anybody gone through this already and pull through ok?  My mom had COVID and she just recently got over it; she seems to be doing good now! I am so sorry you tested positive; I hope everything is alright.", "Please please is it polycythemia  Those numbers are high but not incredibly high. Have you always had high counts? Or just this one test? If the latter, have your CBC repeated. Blood counts can fluctuate a lot. Before 3 months they were very high\nI had done phlebotomy of400ml\nMy jak2 is negative\nMy epo is normal\nToday i was fasting Please do a google search. We will not be able to tell you if this is PV or not. Polycythemia is reversible, and is secondary if caused by another health cause. It will go away once the underlying cause is treated.\n\nBut PV is rare, is permanent and is not caused by other factors. Most people have the JAK2 mutation. There is no way to tell from one lab if you have PV.  \n\nIt looks like you are within range of all of these and I see nothing that indicates anything abnormal. \n\nYou need to be visiting a hematologist and you will learn a lot once you educate yourself on polycythemia and PV. And everyone is different. If JAK2 is negative and EPO level is normal or high, you likely do not have PV. A BMB is the definitive test. However, you may have Secondary Polycythemia which is caused by factors other than mutation, including things that lower oxygen levels such as sleep apnea, smoking, COPD, asthma, etc; things that affect the EPO hormone (which is released by your kidneys) such as kidney disease and high testosterone levels; plus a number of other less common causes. Once the underlying cause is treated, your blood levels go back to normal and you are cured.\n\n\nSince you have had phlebotomy, this is an announcement in the secondary polycythemia group you should be aware of.\n\n\n\"ALL MEMBERS MUST READ.\nPlease, please, please keep in mind that this group is for secondary polycythemia and not for polycythemia vera. We need to be careful when telling people the HCT needs to be under 42-45 like in PV because in most cases of secondary this is not true and could be dangerous. The treatment is different and the risks are different. \n\n\nSecondary is caused from an underlying condition and the underlying condition needs to be found and treated and not necessarily the red counts themselves. Secondary polycythemia is not PV, is not a MPN and is not cancer. It is something that can possibly be cured depending on the cause. The clot risk is not the same in secondary as in PV so phlebotomies are usually not used until the HCT is over 51-52 and that is if the red counts are treated at all. In secondary there are more red blood cells circulating to compensate for the underlying condition. The bone marrow is not affected and is not over producing like in PV. The body needs these extra cells. \n\n\nPhlebotomies can actually make secondary cases worse if you are not careful and can actually be dangerous sometimes. Phlebotomies can drive the counts higher, can cause unnecessary iron deficiency that can be dangerous and in turn cause more symptoms like fatigue and headaches. The body needs these extra cells and taking them away can make it harder for the body to work. Usually in secondary there is not a different HCT target like in PV men and women. Studies have shown that the HCT does not have the same risk of clots in secondary as in PV.  The clot risk is believed to lie in the underlying condition or other risk factors and not because of the increased HCT so this means people who are smokers, overweight or have something else that increases the risk of clots. Phlebotomies also drive the platelets higher and could cause a higher risk of clots. \n\n\nThis is why it is extremely important 1) that you have a correct diagnosis 2) you find the underlying cause so it can be treated and 3) have a doctor who understands the difference between PV and secondary polycythemia. Keep in mind that the normal HCT range is usually up to 50-51. In some secondary cases, like certain heart conditions, the HCT might be up to 62 before being treated. It is not always possible to find the underlying cause but do not give up because it is the best way to treat secondary. This is also why most doctors who are knowledgeable will not do phlebotomies until that have confirmed or ruled out PV. Also please remember that the medications that are used to treat PV should never be used to treat secondary so this is also another important reason why we need to advocate for ourselves and know how to be correctly diagnosed and treated.\"\n\n\nSecondary, Erythrocytosis and Undiagnosed Facebook group: \n\n\nSee the WHO diagnostic criteria here:\n\n\n\nVetted List of MPN specialists in the USA:\n\n\n\nUnvetted List of MPN specialists worldwide:\n", "Hgb Levels Slightly High, Wondering if I should be Concerned 33 year old Male who does hot yoga. \n\nOne test in 2019 had a Hgb of 17.2, and a Hematocrit of 51.5%.

It answers a lot of questions I have had over the past couple of decades. I am starting a chemotherapy tablet on Monday and continuing the venesections I have been doing for the past month. My main concern and the least of my problems is giving blood. I have very good veins but the nurse has left me, on two occasions, with heavily bruised arms. I have difficulty sleeping and am taking strong pain killers. Interested in chatting with people on this page. Cheers Welcome to the group. Sorry that you are here but with proper care you should be just fine. \n\nWhich pill are they putting you on. Personally I am on Jakafi to treat it. Am not sure yet. My brain\u2019s awash with all the information I was given. How long have you been taking the treatment and do you have any side effects? About 2 years maybe a little more. Trying to find out if some of the things going on right now are side effects or not. I have some different issues that may or may not be related. But hopefully I have the results next week. Sorry for all the questions. How long did you know that you had it ? Have things improved. Since I had my first venesection my fatigue has lifted, my brain fog also and my short term memory is gone. My eyes are clear and my skin has improved. Most of all my depression is gone and my energy levels are incredible. My concern is that this will not last or be neutralised by the effects of the chemo. I didnt know, it was found after I had a head injury. Kind Of a oh why are these counts off and about a year of testing and was diagnosed sep 2017. Fatigue is a lot better, still have some fog on occasion, have little concept of time without hard dates but that may be a result of the head injury. I will say I feel better, not tired ALL the time is nice. \n\nThe goal of the chemo is to stabilize your counts so you dont have to do phlebotomy so often or even at all. I am on Pegasys, which is an interferon treatment. It is the only treatment so far that has put people into remission, so I have lobbied hard to get it. So far the side effects have been ok, and I feel, not sick, for the first time in a long time. My recommendation is to see an MPN specialist to talk about treatment options. The chemo hydroxyurea will bring your platelets down, but it really is not recommended for younger people. \nGood luck! I only got diagnosed about 6 weeks ago having nearly crashed the car with the family in it. One minute I am awake next... but I first tried to get answers 23 years ago and then it got really aggressive about 10 years ago so how I am even here I do not know. I had a couple of heart attacks but still nobody picked up on it. Yeah, fatigue is the worst. I am hoping that the tablet eliminates the need for venesections. You sound like someone who can, for the best part, live with this. I am 50 with a young family. I am hopeful for the future. Thanks for your help and time. Hi, is that the needle method? I was told by my doctor that it would cause flu like symptoms and fatigue. I said no as I have had years of debilitating fatigue. Oh I thought you meant side effects from the meds. As far as symptoms for PV, I had itching after showers, headaches, fatigue, heart issues when I was 20, and vertigo with syncope but that may not be related. But it sounds like you might have multiple things going on as PV in my experience and research is generally not aggressive. Best thing you can do for yourself is find an MPN specialist in your area. Sorry, I meant side effects from the meds. When I said more aggressive I meant for about ten years I was just generally tired and itched quite a bit. I did not see it as much of a problem. It is only the past ten years I have really noticed the fatigue but put it down to age and work. I think whatever else may be going on with me is all related to pv. The doctor said as much when talking about the heart attacks. If I had been diagnosed a few years earlier I might have avoided future events. Hi everyone! I have PV too. I have been suffering with this disease for almost 20 years, but cannot get use to it. I am wondering if anyone has  any advise on controlling the itching? Thanks It is, and I think you need a different doctor. Some people feel as though they have the flu, and some get depressed- it all depends on the dose. Most start out with 1/4 the dose. It is given me my life back! I do not hurt anymore, and my energy is coming back. It is a lazy drug and it takes a long time to bring your platelet count down, but it is changing my life. Are you getting venesections? I already feel so much better with the venesections alone. I have discussed treatment with my specialist and told him that I would not be taking the fatigue route so he recommended that I take the tablet. Yes Further than that I do not know. They brought my itching right down. Sorry. Ok, the venesections do increase your platelets, so the HU will bring them down. As long as you are satisfied with the treatment then no worries. There are Facebook groups with very experienced people there who have been dealing with PV for decades. Very valuable info! Thanks. My specialist gave me this website for valuable information...\n\n\n Good! Just FYI, my doctor said HU builds up, and 25% develop leukemia from it, which is why younger folks get Jakafi or Pegasys. Are you Jak2 positive? As to venesections, I am sure they told you to drink so much water that your back teeth are floating, and to eat something right before they draw blood. I have found that a super tight tourniquet helps too. Good luck Yes Yes, thanks. Just seeing this post now. I am starting pegasys on Monday. Small dosage then it will be slowly increased. Feeling confident.", "Dr said CBC was normal additional info in comments.  39 year old and have had symptoms of joint pain, muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue. Mother has multiple myeloma. How should I proceed? All advice welcome. \ud83d\ude4f That is not a normal CBC. Has it been repeated? No-I did not want to be a PITA so I thought I would ask here to see if I was overreacting. I am not sure if I should call this dr back for a f/u or try to find a new dr. Usually they do a repeat test to make sure it was not a fluke. It is not uncommon for blood counts to spike once in a while. In people with MPNs, blood counts are consistently elevated, every single time. For example, my counts have been high on every CBC going back to 2009.\n\nSo If everything is still high, referral to a hematologist, preferably an MPN specialist. The next step is more blood tests: EPO level and JAK2 mutation test.  Thank you so much. I will follow up with my PCP about another CBC!!", "Concerned I have PCV. Would love advice and support. This reddit group is such a life saver. Thank you to everyone who has shared their personal journey and the support you are offering each other. \n\nHi. I am a 40 year old female and I have had elevated hematocrit readings, elevated hemoglobin, thrombocytopenia, and thrombocytosis in different levels since I was 12. Usually I have an abnormal blood draw and then they recheck it and its normal so the doctor has always dismissed it. \n\nWell, I had a stroke in June and had elevated red blood cells and hemoglobin levels. Since I was young, I suffered sporadic and what I believed were sever migraines, but were actually TIA's. I have experienced blurred vision, blind spots, dizziness, numbness of extremities, fatigue, and ringing in the ears, inability to eat, and weight loss on and off for years. Does the severity of these symptoms usually lead to a poorer prognosis? Has anyone else experienced these same symptoms as a result of PCV? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Have you had the JAK2 mutation test? PV cannot be diagnosed by either blood counts or symptoms alone. Hi there. \n\nI am convinced I have had this since I was 19 because I too have had a history of migraines and nothing ever in 10 years made them go away: then they became chronic. \n\nI never had bloodwork before when my doctor discovered it and sent me to a hematologist. If you would like to pursue a diagnosis, then id encourage you to see a hematologist, and have the genetic test done to see if you have the JAK2 mutation.\n\nBut have you been tested for other factors? Secondary polycythemia is much more common and will typically go away if the underlying cause is treated. Thank you for the information. I have an appointment  tomorrow to get a referral to see a hematologist to test for the JAK2 mutation. I guess I am just nervous because of the strokes and symptoms I have had over the years. Did you have a bone marrow biopsy? I am being referred for the test tomorrow. Thanks for the info. Yes. Mostly everyone with a diagnosis of PV has a bone marrow biopsy. Some people say it is excruciating. It hurt sure, but it was not excruciating. Oh man. How long does the biopsy take? Have you been able to find a treatment or secondary cause for your migraines? I hope you were able to get some relief. About 30 minutes for the procedure, including getting sedation and coming out of sedation.  GET THE SEDATION.\n\nI got my results about 2 days later. Seconding get the sedation if you can. Makes it much better imo. I would also say to set up a table or something near your bed or couch or whatever beforehand if possible with some snacks and painkillers and some books or games. In my experience, it hurt quite a badly in general (though admittedly I was a 16yo kid with low pain tolerance so grain of salt) but was honestly excruciating when I had to get up and move, so it would have been nice to have everything I needed right next to the couch for the recovery period. Good to know. Thanks.", "My journey so far Four years ago I was diagnosed as having Polycythemia Vera in 2017 at age 33. BMB confirmed JAK2V617F positive, though low allele burden. I began phlebotomies from 2017 to 2018, low dose aspirin and one 500mg hydroxyurea daily. My counts stabilized in 2018 to the point where I did not need phlebotomies and just was on low dose aspirin and daily hydroxyurea for the past 3 years. I also began to develop a somewhat healthier diet and exercising daily. Well today, my counts are now going back up. Hematocrit is 50.2 and Hemoglobin is 15.7, which is not good. My hematologist wants to see me back in a month to see if they change, if not its back to phlebotomies and he wants to also see about switching me off Hydroxyurea to Jakafi. Which after reading about Jakafi it sounds like a good idea, although the cost is quite high. PV is progressive. Besides Jakafi and phlebs, he could up your HU. What dose are you on? Incyte, the company that makes Jakafi has a patient assistance program you could check into to help with costs. Another option is Pegasys, also expensive, but not nearly as expensive as Jakafi. \n I have been on 1 500mg Hydroxyurea per day, which has kept the counts relatively in check. He does not want to up the dosage because he believes I am becoming intolerant and risk of possible transformation considering my age and how long I will potentially be dealing with this. Have not experienced any symptoms so far but I know that will be changing. I will have to look into that Incyte program, thanks. I have insurance but there is no way I would think they would cover that. Do look into that incyte program. I think most of people on Jakafi are getting help through that since no one can afford $18,000/month. There is also assistance from the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. They have been wonderful to me.\n Been on Jakafi for while now at least 2 if not 3 years. No phlebs keeping counts right. Big thing for your counts is staying hydrated u have done some experiments to see how they change drinking plenty of water and not. It can change it quite a bit. Have you had any side effects from it? Slight rash on my face. Forhead and butterfly over nose. Other than that no but they are not sure it is a side effect of the meds or progression of PV. well I just learned some information this week that has sewn some doubt and I might be looking into a second opinion. Blood count has remained unchanged for the past few months but the real kicker is I received a report regarding my BMB from Quest that I should have been given four years ago when it was originally done. My hematologist's report says I am JAK2 positive, but the lab report from Quest who also looked at the BMB and they see no mutation at all. JAK2 CALR and MPL all negative, no immunophenotypic abnormality. They do recommend though a Serum Iron Panel Study however. Do you have the description of your marrow from Quest? Typically, PV bone marrow will have hypercellularity in all three lineages. ET will have huge megakaryocytes. \n\n\nIf seeking a second opinion, go to an MPN specialist from this list. It makes a HUGE difference.  report from Quest states normocellular marrow with mild megakaryopoiesis, mild increase in reticulin fibers. Differential Diagnosis includes iron deficiency or early myeloproliferative neoplasm but no cytogenetic or molecular evidence of MPN at this time.  \nJAK2V617F Exon 12 and 13 Negative  \nMPL  S505 and W515 Negative  \nCALR Exon 9 Not Detected You said your hematologist's report says you are JAK2 positive - was that from a more recent blood test? Have you had your EPO level tested? \n\n\nIf it were me, I would get a second opinion and a new BMB since it is been 4 years and you had increased reticulin fibers. Pre-MF and Secondary polycythemia should also be explored. No the hematologists report was from the first BMB which his test showed I was JAK2 positive with 2.1% mutated DNA. He had a CT scan of my organs done also to rule out any tumors, which that all came back negative but yeah I am going to see my primary doctor tomorrow and get a referral for another specialist and definitely going to get this looked into further because now I am not happy. Well if it is possible, get a referral to an MPN doctor on that list. I drive 2 hours to see mine. It is totally worth it. well my doctor managed to get me in with another hematologist at a cancer center and I have to say this new guy is great. Answers all my questions, very knowledgeable on MPN's. CBC and EPO came back normal. I had him go over all the tests my previous hematologist did, and he is certain its an early case of polycythemia vera going by the JAK2 detection and the increased reticulin fibers. He finds it strange the mutation only showed in the peripheral blood but did not show in the BMB. Believes it may be due to the sample, wants me to consider doing another BMB. Also finds it strange my previous hematologist had such low reference ranges for his testing compared to theirs. He said Jakafi would not be necessary and wants to continue on the current Hydroxyurea dosage for the time being. I would go for another BMB. You mentioned the JAK2 positive one was only 2% allele burden. Usually levels below 20% are too low to detect and present as negative for JAK2. My allele burden is 30% and is considered low. (This percentage is how many cells have the mutation. In acquired mutations like JAK2, it is never 100%.) So I think this is what your new hematologist is confused about. I am definitely thinking about it, I just do not want to not be able to sit or bend for a week. Cause after the first BMB my lower back felt like somebody went at me with a golf club. He did several other tests and wants to see what comes back before proceeding. So we will see. I have often wondered if the skill/experienceof the person doing the BMB has any relation to the level of pain etc. With mine, I felt pressure and my hip was sore a couple days, but it was no big deal. But mine was done at one of the top 10 hospitals in the USA, at a large leukemia center so I think the nurse did these BMB's all day long. Hopefully your experience at the new hospital will be better. it may have to relate to skill or experience. My old hematologist came from Walter Reed and when I had it done it was just in office. He gave me an oxycodone which made me a little loopy, and I think nulled the pain as he manually drilled into my hip, though I still remember that deep dull pinch. Then like the second day after, most of my lower back felt like I got happy gilmored. Could not sit, could not bend over, could not sleep. I think the only thing that felt good was a hot shower. Mine they injected my hip with local anesthesia and gave me an injection of ativan beforehand I will see if I can run that by them if I go through with it again. well I just received my new test results from Quest that they did on my first visit with the new hematologist and this blood test is matching up with the original BMB (also done by Quest), no mutations (JAK2, CALR, MPL, CSF3R) detected, Erythropoietin normal, negative BCR-ABL1 fusion, just low ferretin level, which the original hematologist never did ferretin testing.  I am returning to the new hematologist next week to talk about the results. From doing some research, the original hematologist that got a JAK2 positive test in the same blood test sent it to a doctor that is no longer practicing. So I am thinking false positive or somebody screwed up. Yeah, reading back, the part about the first test that does not make sense is the 2% JAK2. I suppose by 2% they meant allele burden, but below 20% is considered too low to give a positive result, so 2% does not make any sense. Mine is like 35%.\n\n\nIt is sounding more and more like you have Secondary Polycythemia. Your new doctor will have to rule out causes. Maybe that low ferritin level (unless you were doing phlebs) is the culprit. Hopefully, he figures it out and your polycythemia is cured. Just got back from the hematologist today, and he still thinks it is polycythemia vera. He does not think the original test was a false positive, rather the recent blood test may be a false negative. He thinks the effect from hydrea is masking the mutation and may also be a contributing factor to my low ferritin level. He says he is never seen a case like mine, finds it quite intriguing. He is submitting my case to a friend of his for further study, apparently one of the top MPN specialists in the country.", "Consistent CBC Results\u2026 Hi folks, I have been browsing around this subreddit for awhile now after discovering some disturbing trends in my blood work.\nI am a 24 year old female, healthy weight, super active, living in Upstate, NY.\nTo sum up the past few years for you, I have been tired, like this persistent fatigue that does not get better, no matter the circumstances.

This brings me to the question of, why has not this ever been brought to my attention? And should I request to see a Hematologist? While the values are not majorly high, the consistency between all of the tests raises some alarm bells for me.\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts? It hasn;t been brought to your attention for probably at least two reasons, maybe 3. \n\n1. Your bloodwork is not super out of range. \n2. I have been told it is not likely someone so young has PV,   But I was diagnosed at 27 years old, all of the above and it was on no one's radar. for me because I was young. I however am convinced not a single doctor did blood work in freaking 13 years because otherwise they would have found this.  Most people who get diagnosed with PV are over 60. I am convinced I have been dealing with this since I was 19 years old because of debilitating migraines that miraculously improved after treating PV. \n3. It is rare and most people including GPs, do not even know what PV is without reading about it. \n4. It is very possible you simply have secondary polycythemia. Which would be caused by a lack of oxygen in your blood--and something ELSE is causing it. Once that cause is treated, obesity, sleep apnea, COPD, tumor, heart or lung diseases, your polycythemia goes away. \n\nIf you want to, you can ask to see a hematologist. Make an appointment, you will probably be waiting 1-3 months to see one. \n\nNow, if you have a dismissive doctor, then I say, get a second opinion of GP. You are allowed to get second and third and fourth opinions. If none of them seem concerned, I would not worry about it. \n\n Your GP/hematologist should send you for an ultrasound to see if your spleen is enlarged. Then the next step would be to get a genetic test and bone marrow biopsy. All of those steps are used to see if you have PV.  PV is a disease that is caused by a mutation of the JAK2 gene, which is the gene that makes you more likely to get a myeloproliferative neoplasm. (PV, ET, Myelofibrois) \n\nYou might go through all of those things and come out fine. Do not freak out. Get a journal, document your symptoms. I know you are going to google if you have not already, but I would encourage you not to since you will get yourself all in a tizzy about something that may be very treatable and nbd. \n\nIf you would like to ask me any questions, I am happy to answer them and chat with you. Hope this helped. Thank you! I appreciate the time you took to write out a reply.  I think I may go the route of getting a second opinion, waiting a few months for a hematology appointment for it to be nothing would set me up for some major anxiety in the mean time. Thank you again for your suggestions! Wow. I have the same issue. My blood work gets flagged as abnormal, but then when rechecked it goes back to normal, so they often dismiss the abnormal findings and might not consider PVC. The fluctuations in blood count levels allow many to be left unaware that anything is wrong until something more sever happens like a stroke. I have had multiple strokes that I thought were sever migraines and I am extremely active and fit too. That might also be why we never raised any flags. We know our bodies and we have to be our own advocates much of the time. I hope you figure things out and find the relief you need and answers you are looking for.", "Chronic stress and anxiety about polycythemia vera- any advice appreciated. Hello everyone. Im M 20, i have obsessive health anxiety disorder (hypochondria) so this whole experience have been very hard on me. I will appreciate any suggestions\n\nSo just some background information when I was just 14 I kept nagging about extreme fatigue in my limbs and restlessness. So doctors did some tests. My hematocrit was 52% and hemoglobin 18. I was referred to a child cancer center where the doctor did some tests (idk what exactly as i was too young to understand anything) and then he told my parents not to worry and i should take aspirin and that i can donate blood later on in life.\n\nEver since i can remember ive had these specific symptoms that just exist with no medical reason based on doctors beside my health anxiety:\nRestless leg syndrome\nWeird breathing pattern where i need to take a deep breath every few minutes\nHeart palpitations\n\nGiven that my main doctor now knew that the cancer center doctor is not concerned he continued to ignore my hemoglobin at 18 in all my blood tests for 7 years. \n\nFast forward to a couple of month ago i check another doctor because im getting forehead tension pain and again my hemoglobin is at 18 hematocrit 48 and rbc 5.6. Now this doctor is very surprised and says he has never seen something this high and that im one in a million. He also noticed i have highish blood pressure and resting heart rate of 90ish. So i get referred to hematologist for hemoglobin levels and nephrologist for blood pressure.\n\nNephrologist does kidney renal scan and urine analysis which back clean but 24 hour blood monitor shows high bp so i am seeing him on friday\n\nNow for the important part: my hematologist orders tests which came out after 20 days.\nEpo: 10.1\nJak 2: not detected\nMpl gene: not detected\nCalreticulin gene: not detected\nHematocrit: 49\nHemoglobin: 17.1\nRbc: 5.4\nFerritin: 227\nIron: 200\nIron saturation: 60%.\n\nAfter the results come out i go see him ready to be told i have cancer. But he just simply reassures me and tells me all your results are good. He ruled out secondary pv bcz ive had it for so many years and i tried asking him if its hemochromatosis causing this but he also rules it out. Then i asked him if its PV and he simply smiles and says no you have nothing to worry about. I ask then what is going on and he says ite probably a minor gene mutation causing ur bone marrow to produce slightly high but within normal range rbcs. He then diagnosis me with erythrocytosis and tells me that we can remove one unit of blood just so i feel better and calmer. And that he will see me in a month so we do another complete blooe count.\n\nThat is pretty much it and if i was not someone with health anxiety i would have taken the \"ur bone marrow just produces a bit more\" and been happy. But i have been googling pv and browsing this sub, so now im worried that there was no bone marrow tests done and no jak2 exon 12 gene test done. So basically i just want your opinion about all of this. How likely is it actually pv and im not being diagnosed? Shoukd i just trust him that there is nothing to worry about and donate some blood? If its pv, will i live a normal life expectancy or will i die soon? Should i be questioning him or not? Is polycythemia a death sentence, im just so young, just graduated college and looking forward to a long g life with my partner. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much in advance. Hey, so I cannot actually speak to how much you should trust your doctor or if you should ask for more tests or whatnot, I admit I tend to default to trusting that the doc knows what they are doing.\n\nHowever, I *can* speak to the death worries. I was diagnosed with the jak 2 mutation at around 16yo, and was told that I probably would not live past my mid twenties, but then I went to a different doctor who had much more experience treating people my age, and she has reassured me many many times that my condition is manageable. She knows what she is talking about and I have worked with her for five years or so now, so I am inclined to trust that she is right. The first doctor had only seen my type of PV in people in their 60s and up, so she did not know how to deal with a kid I guess. I do still have anxiety about dying to some extent, but not as bad as when I went through a whole proper midlife crisis at 16. In my defense I did at the time think I was past the midpoint of my life lol\n\nHonestly I am not sure what might help you. I think for me, it was just something that got better post-crisis due to a mindset shift towards \"idk how much time I have got so all I can do is make the most of right now\". I know it sounds extremely cheesy, but aside from just trying to avoid things that could make things worse (in my case, things like the iron supplements I used to take and red meat), idk. My crisis was actually the reason I am currently majoring in linguistics and speak somewhat comprehensible Japanese, so I guess finding a goal I could pursue regardless of the time I thought I had left also helped at least pull me out of the depression if not actively helping my anxieties.\n\nIt is really rough man, I get it, and I am sure it is worse if you already have medical related anxiety, but, in my experience, pv is definitely not necessarily a death sentence. Im a year younger than you and I get you dude, it feels so ingulfing being told that at a young age had a similar age of diagnosis but it did not hit till I got older. The anxiety and pain it causes feels like an internal battle nobody gets and it wears you down. My best advice is just live for the moment man, do what u want to spoil yourself when u can. Enjoy your hobbies just enjoy being alive right now. Excepting your death is another thing, I have not came to terms with it in myself but in my aging dog I have and it makes me love her more. Set goals u know you can hit before your 30, with me its my dream car with you it can be whatever. My life may be shorter but I may live a long one too just depends and all you can do is hope for good days ahead, asking God for a hand is never out of the question. I did not belive until I had an experience were I met something, I was drawn to the idea after that. Just something to consider for a feeling of stability.\nI wish the best for you brother, you can reach out if you want to im here.", "Polycythemia vera and covid-19? I am sorry if there is already conversation about this but I could not find it. What I want to ask is if you guys have any experience eith receiving vaccine against covid-19 as someone who is also having polycythemia vera? Is it safe to receive and do you know some cases that ended badly because of blood clots? I was not concerned about it.\n\nI have pv and I got the shot.\nI felt lousy for the weekend and a good sleep took care of it.\nSeriously it is not a big deal. I got pfizer. My hematologist recommended I get it and I feel much more confident that I have it. Well I am worried because my blood is thick anyways and if vaccines cause even more...then there could be problem.\n\nWhich dose did u receive? What did your\nDoctor say?\n\nI have both doses of Pfizer. Well my doctor said that their advice for anyone is to receive anything you can at certain moment. But I am not satisfied with that tbh. When someone says get any you can,  it looks like they have no idea about potential problems for people with health problems like ours. What does your hematologist say? \n\nAlso what indicates you have thicker blood? I mean that is sort of a characteristic of PV in general.\n\nTo be honest, I have seen zero evidence that the risks outweigh the benefits. Also? I would like to move on with my life and do not have time to sit there and decide that I would rather put myself at a higher risk for dying or maiming myself by not getting a vaccine.\n\nAnyone I know who has had covid before\nThe vaccine says it has absolutely kicked their ass. Well my hct is high and I know when i go to check my blood test, usually that medical worker who is taking my blood for test tells me that it is a bit thicker. And it is often like that even when i drink a lot of water. I have PV.  I am 72 years old.  I have been told my blood is as thick as honey.  I take Hydroxyurea.  I just got a third shot.  Recovery was one day and not bad.  Benefit is greater than the risks.  Good luck! What does your hematologist/MPN specialist say? I also take Hydroxyurea. Literally nothing special. When my hct raises, they do venipuncture and that is basically it. Does your hematologist say to get the vaccine at you on aspirin I had both Moderna vaccines around March. I had a reaction to second but also had lymes disease at the same time. Treated that with Doxycycline and am ok now. There is a statistically significant chance of getting a blood clot if you catch covid. It is incredibly incredibly rare to happen from taking the vaccine. Unless you are allergic to one of the components of the vaccine, it is in your best interest to get the vaccine. But there are People who are also getting blood clots from vaccines too? That is probably because they are not good for specific diseases but we do not know which I guess Blood clots occur so rarely with the vaccine that we cannot even be sure the vaccine caused the blood clot. Something like 7 million J&amp;J shots were administered and like 6 people total got blood clots. Covid on the other hand caused many more instances of clots per 100k. I suggest you ask your doctor directly if you should get the vaccine.\n\nYou are putting yourself at much more risk by not getting the vaccine. Covid is here to stay. It is not going anywhere and no matter how safe you are, you will probably eventually get it. I suggest you take a look at the statistics out there about blood clots for vaccine vs. Covid. It is not even close. I was diagnosed at 1 year old and am now 24. My hematologist advised me to get whichever vaccine I had first access to. Hope this helps I had the Pfizer shots, no issues. Here is the American Society of Hematology Covid FAQ for MPNs. \n", "My brother's (28m) blood results, can someone tell me if I should be worried?  We do not have any history of cancer in the family. My brother does not smoke, but occasionally does not drink enough water. He drinks 120g of protein in shake form and I told him to stop because it could cause excessive dehydration. He has trouble sleeping with insomnia and frequently wakes up in the middle of the night. Sleep apnea? He was referred to an oncologist and to be honest I am shaken to the core and forgot how to conduct myself. Should I be worried? the appointment with the oncologist is on October 8th Was there a red blood cell count? Also PV usually comes with high platelet count. Wast thither a r'd blood cell count? eke pv usually cometh with high platelet count\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` RBC is 6.47 Million/uL\nWhile this is high, does the normal platelet count make it less likely? If you suspect PV, you need to go to a hematologist and get a JAK2 test done. PV generally is not inherited but caused by a spontaneous mutation of the JAK2 gene. If he has PV, with treatment, it is supposed to be a very manageable disease. If he has severe abdominal pain, that is when you should be really worried about blood clots, but that should not happen with treatment. A hematologist or an oncologist? Thank you Hematologist. You can also look for hematologists that specialize in MPN. They will be more knowledgeable about PV My husband was just diagnosed with PV in may, trust me an oncologist will get to the root of what is going on. My husband is doing great after tweaks some meds\u2026good luck I am not sure how it relates to likelihood but as other have suggested, have your GP refer you to someone who will do a JAK2 gene mutation test. What meds? He first needs to see an oncologist before you get to worried\u2026my husband is on oral chemo meds. What state does he live in? PV is more common in men..but there are 2 types of PV an not seeing his rbc numbers \u2026..my husband had therapeutic phlebotomies every week for awhile until his blood was were the the dr wanted it\u2026if you want to email me, I do not look at this to often.. my email is  Was this a one off high result? In other words, were previous tests normal? If so, then he needs to have a repeat CBC. All sorts of things, particularly dehydration, can drive up numbers.", "Young People with PV Hi all. I was diagnosed with PV at 27. I am now 29. I am in several facebook groups with people who have PV, but facebook is such a boomer space. I am not saying that to be disrespectful, I just see most of the people in the group are like 40+, which is fine, but they are all complaining about all kinds of symptoms and constantly asking is this thing and PV related? I just do not comment because I want to say... \n\n\"They more than likely are NOT related, you just happen to be old and have arthritis Betty.\" And people talk about how they have bone pain and whatever. I mean, I am not discounting their pain--but I really think a lot of those people are just looking for any explanation and then pin it on PV. It is like I have to pee a lot, but that does not mean it is because of PV. I have neck tension. Now migraines? I would say definitely a symptom of PV, since that is well-documented. \n\nThese people are telling others what they should do, when really they need to be getting this info from their hematologist. They are not really giving medical advice, but they are certainly giving their opinion like they are credible to take advice from. Like you have people saying \"Why cannot we take ibuprofren\" and you have a bunch of people who say \"here is why\" and also 20 people saying \"what are you talking about, we can have ibuprofen.\" And like here, you CONSTANTLY have people asking if their blood work is normal. \n\nI am like \"ask a doctor, Karen.\" Do not ask a bunch of strangers on the internet. \n\nSo, anyway, I just figured if there is any young people on reddit who have a diagnosis of PV, I would love to sit and chat with you or make a small community. Heya, I am 21, diagnosed around 16. Tbh, the fact that Facebook skews old is a big part of why I would not joined any sort of group until finding this sub somewhat recently. From what you are saying, it sounds real frustrating. I get people being concerned about anything and everything, I have been there before, but yeah, the internet is definitely not the place to ask. 28, got diagnosis with 24 I also had someone on Facebook tell me I do not have PV, I have ET. I have both.  I am like my MPN specialist says otherwise. I am like how do you know someone is DOCTOR is wrong? I am a boomer and in those Facebook groups too. As far as the Facebook groups go, I think that the \"polycythemia vera support group\" is the best of the bunch, mainly due to having a good moderator who believes in evidence based medicine. I think the worst of the bunch is \"MPN blood brothers and sisters\" and one other I cannot remember the name of. The vast majority of people with MPNs are over 60, so unless someone starts a group for younger patients (and I hope they do), I am afraid you are stuck with us, sorry to say.\n\n\nBut I agree with you about attributing everything to PV. It is like, I have a muscle cramp in my leg, is that because of PV? It aggravates me too.\n\n\nI have a biology degree, but sadly I think that science education in my generation was not as good back then as it is now for millennials and zoomers. For example, I notice that many people my age do not understand basic concepts of evolutionary biology at all. So I am irritated by all the \"how did I get this?\" questions and the subsequent zillion ludicrous answers. Seems like there is a total lack of comprehension that cell mutations happen randomly, happen constantly actually, and this is how it is supposed to work by design because...evolution. But you know, people have a very hard time with randomness...\n\n\nHowever, your example of bone pain is not a good one since it is a well documented symptom of MPNs. The NCCN guidelines require the administration of the MPN-SAF form at every hematologist visit, and bone pain is listed on it. (The NCCN guidelines are basically the cancer \"bible\" and all American oncologists and the insurance companies are supposed to abide by them. If you are not receiving this questionnaire, your doctor is not following the NCCN guidelines.)\n\n\n\nOn this subreddit, there are a lot of requests about blood tests, but that is the nature of Reddit, is not it? Reddit's the best place to go for info about random topics without doxxing yourself. Unfortunately, last week, r/hematology ended their pinned weekly thread for lay people asking about blood tests. The only other place to go is r/askdocs but a CBC test result question can get buried there. So I think that blood tests questions in this sub are here to stay, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\n\nI also get what you are saying about how patients should only trust their doctors but IMO, there is widespread lack of knowledge in the hematology community itself about current MPN diagnostic criteria and treatment algorithms. I see this as a crisis at this point. Far too many patients are being given misinformation by their own doctors. \n\n\nHell, I have received it myself. My former hematologist told me MPNs had no symptoms (wrong) and that testing like BMB and allele burden were totally unnecessary (wrong) and he subsequently misdiagnosed me and gave me the wrong treatment. This was after 12 years of not being diagnosed at all! 15 years ago, he would have been kind of right, but a LOT has changed in 15 years. I had just gone through dealing with my husband's cancer where I would learned the importance of the NCCN guidelines and after reading the physician version, I promptly switched to an MPN specialist at Harvard. (Btw I was such a huge advocate of the NCCN guidelines for patients with my husband's cancer, I was recommended by the president of his cancer association to the NCCN Foundation as a spokesperson. I gave a speech about the guidelines to doctors and researchers, and was on the NCCN website for a while.)\n\n\nI used to recruit doctors for a living and I know a lot about the business of medicine. They are overwhelmed by patient visits, paperwork and the constant arguing with insurance companies over approvals for tests, prescriptions, etc. There is very little time leftover for reading medical journals. While Social Media MPN communities can give the illusion that MPNs are common, but they are in fact still very rare. The average non-specialist hematologist gets only 1 new MPN patient per year. So when they use their extremely limited time to read articles in medical journals, are going to choose one about their 1 patient? Or one about their hundreds of patients with common, more acute blood cancers? On top of that, in contrast to their other cancer patients, they often feel that MPNs are No Big Deal. Understandable, but unfair. Doctors are also required to get a certain amount of CME (continuing medical education) credits every year. It is not free and most practices pay for only 5 days of it. There are no required courses - the doctor chooses topics they are interested in for which they earn credits. Again, for the same reasons as above, I do not think the topic of MPNs is at the top of their list. This is why it is vitally important to see an MPN specialist if at all possible, because they are interested in and usually at the forefront of MPN research. My experience with my MPN specialist has been night and day different from a bread and butter hematologist.\n\n\nSorry this is so long, maybe I have had too much caffeine this morning, lol. Thank you for your intelligent reply. I know bone pain is a documented symptom and I know I am very lucky. Thank you for taking the time to reply. \n\nI did not mean to dismiss that one, as I see it all the time and people back and forth with the \u201cwhat is going on with me,\u201d from more people who are not credible. One of my own hematologists admitted they have not seen this before. It is definitely not common knowledge among hematologists. However there are so many resources on the web that I think people should utilize more. \n\nAnd doctors as well. It is well documented that doctors miss things. What I am concerned about is that you are asking strangers to interpret their bloodwork. It is possible someone who has not seen this before could miss it. \n\nI definitely support the bringing awareness and sharing a list of MPN specialists or hematologists before because I had a fine hematologist, but she was apathetic in returning my calls and would not answer my questions when I had them. So I switched doctors and they admitted they had not seen it before\u2014but they learned about it and it is been night and day. I appreciate that they were honest about it and that they chose to learn about it and work with an MPN specialist for direction on how to treat it. They definitely do not have all the answers. \n\nThey consult with an MPN specialist with my treatment. And return my calls and emails. Your doctor should be able to get back to you and if your hema is not answering your questions\u2014you need a new doctor. I think your doctor needs to be a partner in your care\u2014not the authority. It is important that people can ask their physician about these questions and if they cannot answer them or will not, find another doc who will. It has made such a difference.\n\nBut interpreting bloodwork is something that is specific to you. Someone else\u2019s normal may not be your normal. I have never had a phlebotomy. So that is why those constant \u201cis this pv\u201d question is annoying when it is very clear on the internet if you search polycythemia it can be secondary and you can see other causes and those are usually treatable and the research is pretty clear that it will clear up once treated if it is secondary.\n\nI have ppl in my group who literally think they got a gene mutation because they worked around a steel mill or in a factory. There is no evidence that supports that.\n\nMy only guess for me personally is\u2014I took benzos for a few weeks. That was it. But I suffered with migraines long before that so I think I had this way before benzos. I suffer from headaches too. However, I have cervical stenosis so my neuro-oncologist and I agree that it is a combination of the neck issues (cervicogenic headaches) and the PV. My headaches did not become unmanageable until my blood counts went sky high. PV causes a constant state of inflammation, so it can exacerbate headaches. But I never thought they were ONLY due to PV. I think a lot of people think it is all or nothing? That you cannot have a symptom with multiple causes? I am right with you there on how annoying that is. I have migraines and Pv. While Pv makes migraines hell, I still have migraines when my pv is under control. Was diagnosed at 22 in 2004, am now 39, and just freaking learned that it is cancer, from the internet, not any of my drs. In 2004 they did not define it as cancer I am over 40 and the Facebook groups are ridiculous. They constantly complain and try to fit it all into their PV box. I completely agree with you on all points. I am old so I will now bow out of this conversation but I hope you find some people your age. I wish you well. I would not mind you hanging around because you share my pain with the whiny people on Facebook. I totally get it\u2014people looking for answers but honestly nothing good comes from Facebook. Absolutely nothing!!! 38 now diagnosed 4ish years ago. I understand. I created this group because I dont care for facebook in general I have been asking my hematologist if there is any new info pretty consistently.\n\nI have had the same one for 6yrs and tells me nothing.\n\nI had to learn about the genetic test online.\n\nBut he is supposed to be the best in BC, so I should try and stick with him if I can. When did it become listed as cancer? Agreed but Reddit is moving in that direction too. True Probably around late 2009? Idk \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f really. Just my first hematologist called it \u201c a disorder,\u201d but the internet says cancer. You did not have a bone marrow biopsy to confirm?\n\nI thought PV and ET were mutually exclusive. I did not? I was under the impression that is how they performed the Jak2 test because that is how they saw how many cells were being produced.\n\nI was told I needed that to do the genetic test.\n\nBut I have both ET and PV with the JAK2 mutation. Apparently if you have PV you do not usually have high platelets, but even the information on NORD states that is it is an abundance of red blood cells and or platelets.  But to clarify I did have a bone marrow biopsy.  My MPN specialist said I have PV that presented like ET. And the last time I talked to her, she said \u201cwell you are interesting because you have both.\u201d I am now 24, was diagnosed as an infant. I was in the Facebook groups and PROMPTLY had to leave. It was so toxic and people were privately messaging me", "Waiting on PV test I am waiting on a lab result to know if I have PV, but the doctor is convinced I was dehydrated when my other doctor referred me.

What test are you waiting for Jak2? Yes. I know more testing will likely be done if that is positive. \nI just specifically thought it was weird that my doctor just kept saying I was just probably dehydrated because it is too rare to have PV. I already have another blood clotting disorder so maybe she was thinking \u201cwhat are the chances?\u201d Good luck, my husband was diagnosed in May of this year, I have him on some amazing natural supplements an he is going 3 months between his therapeutic phlebotomy which is huge\u2026\u2026you just need a great dr an a positive attitude, let us know how your results turn out!\u2764\ufe0f Thank you so much.

But my question is how do I know if if it is PV1 or PV2. PV1 is cancer right? And PV2 is not??\n\nSorry. I am flying by the seat of my pants here and my doctor is not telling me anything until the results are in. So I am waiting until these new tests come back, but that will not be for 3 weeks and I am just sitting around in dread. \n\nCan anyone help me with info? Thanks in advance. Firstly, I totally understand the waiting around for clarification! Before I was diagnosed, everyone thought I had ovarian cancer. I ended up having Polycythemia Rubra Vera, which is a chronic cancer, and is different from secondary Polycythemia, which can be reversed, and is acquired. I also have Budd-Chiari, which is common with PV. \n\nIf you have a diagnosis, it should definitely say Rubra Vera for cancer, or secondary (PV2). Most Polycythemia Rubra Vera diagnoses come with a JAK2 mutation. That was present on my diagnosis sheet, so that could also be something to look for? I really hope you get some answers soon....the waiting is so uncomfortable. You gave a lot of good information here. I would say to OP try not to panic. People did not call it \u201ccancer\u201d around me because I think they did not want to scare me. I have never seen it called PV1 or PV2 though. Polycythemia is caused by an underlying condition and PV is typically caused by the JAK2 mutation.\n\nWaiting for the bone marrow biopsy was like the longest three weeks of my life. Do not I repeat do not google PV. You will psych yourself out. I will second the \"do not panic\". I feel absolutely grand most days, and am on only aspirin! There is a great community out there of people with PV and lots of great advice! Thanks for comforting words. You have no idea how much I appreciate it.\n\nSo regarding the diagnosis, I made a little progress. My doctor still has not contacted me and my test results still are not on my hospital's website portal. However, there was one change to my online record of \"Conditions.\" This doctor did add \"Polycythemia\" and that is it.\n\nSo I know I have PV, but I do not know if I have the JAK2 mutation or whether my PV is \"Primary\" or \"Secondary.\"  From what I have read, \"Primary\" = cancer, and \"Secondary\" = not cancer. Is that right?\n\nSorry for your diagnosis and your situation --- I am forgetting that everyone is going through this same thing. Thanks for replying.\n\nI am weeks away from the bone marrow biopsy. My doctor blew through 3 steps of tests of tests. I remember him saying the bone marrow biopsy was step #3. \n\nYou are also right, I did Google. I have since stopped.\n\nCan I ask what your biopsy showed -- PV1 or PV2?\n\nThanks again Thanks for replying  :)\n\nCan I ask if you are PV1 (JAK2) or PV2? I have Polycythemia Rubra Vera, which is a chronic cancer (neoplasm), so PV1, I suppose it would be in those terms. Only diagnosed in 2017. I did the bone marrow biopsy back in 2017; I already had the PV diagnosis when  would done it, so I know they were doing it to see fibrosis levels. I am not sure if they do it for secondary Polycythemia. Thank you for the info. Obviously I am sorry to hear about your situation. Just a note on the terminology, the PV you are using stands for polycythemia vera, which is the chronic blood cancer. Secondary polycythemia also has high hematocrit/hemaglobin but caused by some other issue in your body (things like sleep apnoea, COPD, etc). The word polycythemia really only refers to the high hematocrit/hemaglobin levels - the secondary or vera notations refer to the cause. So at this stage the doctor is only noting the high levels in your condition. They would most likely have done an EPO test, if that is normal or high then you would probably be given a secondary diagnosis, if low then more testing, like the JAK2 and possibly a bone marrow biopsy. EPO is something the kidneys produce that basically sends a message to the bone marrow to say the blood needs more oxygen, for example in high altitudes, with COPD etc. If the EPO level is low it means your body is not seeing a need for more oxygen, indicating your bone marrow is a bit confused. For me, my EPO is suppressed but all genetic tests and the bone marrow biopsy were negative at this stage. My diagnosis is technically idiopathic erythrocytosis, but it acts just like polycythemia vera. Hope this helps because I know how confusing it was for me.", "Hi all: weird question for females I am wondering if your polycythemia was not found during periods but when taking bc which stopped it, it was found? Sorry if this makes no sense but typically your red blood cells are lower when having a period( my anyways) then when on bc I have a high rbc count", "My brother was recently diagnosed with PV My brother just called me today to say he has PV. I did not know what it was and broke down crying at work. He is my only sibling and a year older than me. He is 45.

Thank you.", "I want to Apoligize to the real patients on this Sub Hi im Bastian im 18 and have shared my lab results a month ago cause i was concerned because of elevated rbc and hct counts i did this out of the anxiety that i had when i googled it google isnt my biggest friend i have talked to hematologist and they say that Pv isnt suspected and that i will have to test every 6 months to see if it stays in these ranges i understand and should respect that this sub reddit cannot diagnose Pv and as a person who really has that disease it might be annoying to have concerned people i dont blame them but i think that its just that google isnt the best place to search up lab results im still trying to get my jak2 tested but ill probably have to wait 6 months to see if rbc is still high thank u all for the advice and sorry for posting that i probably have no place here but ill keep it updated on the earlier posts i wish everyone the best and a happy new year,  Bastian", "Dealing with the mental aspect Im almost 19 and I have been diagnosed since I was 15 and I have a really hard time. I hear all these horrible stories and it bothers me thinking I can be suffering that bad. But overall I feel alone in this nobody gets it, girls do not want to be with me when they find out. My family acts like its nothing when it keeps me up at night, I wish someone would just hold me close and care about what im going thru. I talk to God and he gives me strength but I cannot help but feel alone when symptoms pop up and nobody gets it. Sometimes I feel the symptoms and I cannot stop crying because it feels like a foreshadow to what im going to be and im always alone in it. Been living with it for 2 years and most of the time things are fine. If you were already not in a good place when this all started, then things can feel intensified and overwhelming  but hey, there is a lot of things that can be done to mitigate the symptoms. I have been able to keep it at bay with heavy exercise, fasting, meditations, and most important of all, breathing exercises. Now I am going through a bad fase again and will call doctor tomorrow to get anti-depressants, but soon the sun will rise again and life will feel normal again. I did not tell anyone for the first 2 years, only told people when they asked why I got the vaccine being so young. Life around your age, in general is already quite difficult. And be hopeful about the future, the medicine technology has advanced a lot because of Covid and huge investments, Crispr technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, proof of it its the HIV vaccine coming up in less than 2 years. Crispr technology is already being applied for 2 genetic conditions. In 10 years we will be in a completely different place than we are now so you should be feeling hopeful. We are lucky this is not even seen as a cancer for many doctors, and as a chronic condition that can be managed rather well. Deal with the mental aspect separately, each day is a new battle, and we are human, we all are resilient, strong and capable of dealing with so much more than we believe we can at first. We are built this way. You will be just fine. Having a rare and chronic illness is hard; what you are feeling is absolutely normal, and I want you to know you are not alone! Looking back (I was not diagnosed until later), I remember joking during yoga that I had 'weak wrists' and wondering why I bruised so easily. Little things that now make so much more sense.   \nThere are some excellent support groups on Facebook (if you use it) from people all around the world. Always remember that you are here in the same boat with all of us, rowing, and some days are easier than others.   \nYou are super young and you will absolutely find someone one day; PV will have nothing to do with it. The partner I had when I was diagnosed and helped me through it is not the man I ended up marrying! There are wonderful, good people everywhere and you will find the right one.  \nSymptoms are annoying when they appear out of nowhere, are not they? Some days I feel fine and then WHAM....suddenly I have itchy skin, I feel bloated, and my joints hurt. Sometimes the worst part is that people forget you are suffering because it is not as outwardly apparent as other diseases.   \nI want you to reach out any time you need to and I am happy to put you in touch with some other PVers if you need to talk.   \n\n\nYou are never, ever alone, and you are doing best you can, which is all anyone can ask of any of us. Be gentle with yourself, friend. The hardest part is what u mentioned nobody notices your in pain, your just slower that day and its almost became normal for me to just be feeling. My least favorite thing is some days I just cannot eat, it feels like u fill up so quick and your just trying to keep down your quarter of a burger. The hard part atleast for me is finding people to relate to the situation, it does not Control your life its just always a part of it and when its just you I slip into the what ifs. The stuff I hear from older people 50+ I have gathered it sounds like it can be like a hell u cannot escape because it is your own blood. What Is been the hardest is dealing with it alone the mental struggle of just trying to enjoy now because tomorrow may not be good. It feels like im over reacting sometimes symptoms wise because its not common and im ok 90% of the time. I do not think u get how happy you made me reminding me im not truly alone I feel safer knowing that I can reach out to you, you made my night!", "Need some advice So for the past year and a half I have been presenting with symptoms that are similar to polycythemia, I have severe itching and burning every time I shower( so I stopped taking them) and whenever I am in heat or when my body starts to heat up I get a rash and itchy, I have taken a blood test and it is come back negative but I do not know what to do, does anybody have any advice? I also have a bunch of GI issues too The only way to know if you have polycythemia Vera is with a bone marrow biopsy. \nItching is a common symptom, but it is not only a pv symptom. Many, including me, take beta alanine for itch relief- it works! I get it from Amazon and take it when I shower, (works before or after, but better about 10-15 minutes before) \nAlso limit sugar and fats help too.\n\nGood luck! If you have normal blood counts, it is very unlikely you have polycythemia vera. Have you seen a dermatologist?", "Medication Side Effects Hi there, relatively new here. I had a bone marrow biopsy last week that confirmed a PV diagnosis. I am a 38 yr old male. I was displaying several of the symptoms, but so many of them are so minuscule I had excused them away as something to shake off. One of those symptoms was ocular migraines. These migraines did not cause any pain, but obstructed my vision with a fractal rainbow filter for up to 10 minutes. It was disorienting and I did not mention it to anyone for at least a year. When I mentioned this to my eye doctor he told me I was probably just dehydrated. Since I have begun a daily regimen of Eliquis, Droxia (1200mg) and Procardia XL along with weekly phlebotomy, I no longer experience the visual effects sans pain and now experience a range of headache pain from momentary sharp spikes to a day long dull ache. Am I alone in having experienced the ocular migraines? Has anyone else felt their frequency or intensity of headaches increase along the journey of their treatment? I have the same thing, (JAK2+ PV since 2015) when I was on Hydrea and she had me cut my dose in half and that helped. Yes I have! The rainbow vision I had too. I went to a pain doctor and he said it issues with connective tissue. Are you flexible? Do you also have a connective tissue disorder? Did you experience pain with the rainbow visual? I did not, but now that I am on the medicine the rainbows are gone and fully replaced with pain. My doctor attributed the ocular migraines to my high blood pressure, which was 162/110 but has lowered significantly.\n\nAnd no, I am not terribly flexible (I am guessing that has more to do with the connective tissue?) They are starting out a bit aggressive with the Droxia, hopefully I can taper down once my numbers are more stable and these headaches will subside. Thanks for replying :)", "Frantic google search led me here. These results are from a few months ago. Getting them redone soon. Am also shedding a lot of hair (May/May not be related). How concerned should I be?  A lot of things could change those values, may not be PV. Google is not your friend looking up illness. Just makes you panic. Work with your doctors, stay off of search engines. This could be anything. Literally, so many things cause polycythemia. I agree, stay off google, but these do not look so wildly out of range. Have they consistently been high? This was my first time ever getting it tested for as long as I can remember, getting an additional test this week. I also moved up into the mountains recently, and I was reading that moving to a high altitude can increase your red blood cell count but idk. Keep us posted on results of your next CBC.", "can secondary polycythemia cause similar symptoms to PV? I have been having symptoms such as itching and dizziness and fatigue for 2 months now and my blood work lately has had raised HGB, RBC and Crit %.\n\nI have an appointment tomorrow afternoon with my hematologist who I have been seeing for the last 2 years since I had a unprovoked pulmonary embolism and have been on eliquis since.\n\nMy symptoms have begun since my blood counts have left normal range. They are been going up gradually over the last 6 months but only been over the limits since I started getting itchy and tired all the time.\n\nI started vaping around the time the incline started, so maybe this has had an impact on my blood counts.\n\nHowever, my question is if this is secondary polycythemia can you still experience similar symptoms or are the itching and fatigue symptoms only brought on by PV itself.\n\nThanks", "Recent blood counts Hello, so recently I have had conflicting test results.  After a couple high RBC and HCT readings my PCP decided to do a JAK2 617 test. That test came back NEGATIVE. Which was a relief . However I have since had to labs after that and one time the results were low and then high . Just curious what to make of them.\n\nFor record here is the time line \n\n2018: RBC of 6.12, HCT of 49.1 and HGB of 17.0\n\n2019:RBC:6.04 HCT:49.3 and HGB of 16.5\n\n2019 tested negative for JAK2 mutation as well\n\n2020: RBC:5.90 HCT:49.3 HGB of 16.8\n\n2021: RBC:6.04 HCT: 50.4 HGB: 17.2 I am a 25M and the max normal range at the lab I go to is 6.0 for RBC 17.5 for HGB and 50 for HCT. So the only one consistently above is the RBC count. So all of them are slightly above the normal high range Has your EPO level been done? Yes, they said it looked to be normal . They expect it to be due to the fact I likely do not hydrate enough or it is my baseline/normal levels that just happen to be on the higher side. Did they rule out causes of secondary polycythemia? \nI am not super knowledgeable about secondary but there is a Facebook group for secondary and undiagnosed and you could ask there.\n They think if there is a reason behind it that it is likely lack of hydrating as I do not drink enough liquid and that had been a problem in the past. My levels have fluctuated to above normal and high normal on there own without any medication and the lack of Jak2 and a normal epo they believe that if I hydrate it would help. Other than that they believe that my normal just so happens to be on the normal side and to not freak over it The baseline levels are really key. I was lucky enough to have had a few years worth of baseline levels that showed as quite low, like haematocrit around 40%. Then had a blood test because I was unwell and my GP mentioned that one level was just in the high range but he was not worried because it may have been dehydration. Some time later I asked for some testing because I thought I might have diabetes and the levels had sky-rocketed. Initially my specialist set a haematocrit target of 45% but it did not ease the symptoms much. Because I had evidence of my lower baseline he was happy to drop the target to 42%.", "Should I ask my doctor for a JAK2 test? Hi everyone. I am no a 35yo male with a suspicion  since around February 2019 even though I have been showing symptoms in November 2018. But the diagnose was never \u201cofficial\u201d. First doctors said it could be either because I was a smoker, PV or leukaemia. He sent me to do tests for leukaemia and told me to stop smoking. \n\nI did both but took a few months to go back fo see my doctor to get the results from Leukaemia tests. I freaked out and started meditation, gym 1 - 4 hours a day, healthy keto diet, intermittent fasting, actual fasting (from 2 to 18 days of water fasting whenever I could) breathing exercises, reconnected with nature, started using loads of natural healthy herbs, fermented foods, etc. \n\nWhen I came back to the doctor my bloods started to come down to normal. He never actually gave me a proper diagnose. I explained I did some changes in my life and he did not mention anything, just said that my blood my coming back to normal and to do some more tests in 6 months. I took it that the blood changes was because of the cigarettes and felt proud of myself for returning to normal without medication. \n\nRecently I started showing symptoms of adrenal fatigue and doctor is investigating if I have Addison\u2019s Disease. I have been through a lot of stress recently with my mom on hospital and best friend also going through some major health issues. Had to travel to Brazil and spent a couple months there, and started smoking again when I was there. I smoked for 2 months and quit as soon as I got back to UK. \n\nMy GP changed the system they use to see the test results and I can now see my previous test results compared in a graph. Even thou my blood is still within normal limits I can see there is a trend and that some of my results are going up again, and always the same ones that were high before. \n\nWhen I asked my doctor if the PV was back, he only said: \u201cwho told you that it ever left?\u201d And conformed it seems its coming back.\n\nGuess that this was my proper diagnose. I checked my medical history online and noticed he put the diagnose in November 2018 when I first started feeling ill and took my first test, not when he ruled out the smoking and leukaemia. Im\nNot sure which healthy things I can do to try to fight this disease naturally, I am in the UK and it is not like my doctor spends more than 5 minutes explaining me what to do. \nOnly now he explained that I need to monitor my blood every 6 months for life. Since I heard 2 days ago that sexy never left, I started researching and found out about the JAK2 test. My GP never asked me for this test to rule out PV and ensure it is not because of the cigarettes. Should I ask him to run this test for a definite diagnose? \n\nI took a genetic test on Tellmegen with 390 tests but it does not seem like they tested for JAK2. I do have my raw data though, anyone know if I can get any more information from it? PV is a permanent condition caused by the JAK2 mutation. The majority of people (some boomers on Facebook) say they do not have it, but it is highly unlikely. \n\nAnyway PV does not \u201cdisappear.\u201d Polycythemia can disappear which can be caused by smoking which you were saying your did.  I would say if you are concerned about your doctors diagnosis or lack thereof\u2014I would encourage you to go see a hematologist. If your blood is within normal limits I would not worry about it, but just keep doing the 6 month blood tests and they will see if there is a problem. It is too early to tell. They found mine on a CBC with high platelets. Then off to a hematologist I went.\n\nPV is a genetic disease but it is not inherited. By using a drug called Pegasys, you can lower the allele burden which is really the most effective way right now to help try to regulate the blood cell production\n\nSomething causes the gene to mutate and copy wrong making your blood cells high because it does not stop like it is supposed to.   \n\nI need a CBC every six weeks and for basically a year I spent almost every week at the doctor getting bloodwork done. I would go see a specialist.  You will have to ask an mpn specialist I am not a doctor", "Hello you all! Hello from Germany guys!!\nI am 15 years old and my name is Hristian. I am from the beautiful Black Forest and I have a lot of questions regarding PV.\nMy first and most important question is: Do I need to be afraid of this cancer?\nLately I have experienced 3 random hematomas around my toes and I could not explain it at all. So we went to the g.p. and he took some blood and discovered that my Hemoglobin is slightly high (and some other blood ingredients). Because of that he sent me to an oncologist, which I have an appointment on the 15th this month. If they test me positive, what should I think of, or what shall I expect? I am really scared of reading a lot about this topic, but in the end I have noticed that it is not even like \u201ethat\u201c kind of cancer, so I could just live my life normally? How are you guys handling your PV? It is probably the same as any other cronic disease, needa learn to live with it...\nI look forward to hearing from anyone what they have experienced and I wish you all a great day!\nKind regards,\nHristian Hey welcome to the group. Directly by definition Polycythemia Vera is a cancer. The best thing you can do is find an MPN specialist. I see that you may have already had your appointment. How did that go? It went really good. Even tho I had signs of this cancer, turns out I have antiphospholipid syndrome. So no cancer :) but I need subcutaneous low molecular heparin injections for now... I am happy it is not something worse", "Headache/pressure/dizziness Has anyone experienced the above, I was diagnosed with PV over a year ago, 6 months into the diagnosis, I started getting what I could only describe as a pressure sensation that never eased, but in the last month this has gotten basically unbearabl, I have spoken with my hematologist who has stated it is condition of PV that I just have to learn to live with.\n\nAdvice would be welcome. I have got chronic headaches, but so does my dad, so I am never sure if it is because of pv or the same deal as him. Maybe both, idk. I will sometimes get really rough headaches after phlembotomies, so I am guessing there is some connection.\n\nPain meds do not tend to work for me if I do not take them before the headache really starts bugging me, so what I tend to do is either take a nap or suffer through my day until I can. Headaches are a known symptom of MPNs. Jakafi may help but hard to get insurance authorization. I see a neurologist and she is helped me a lot. You might benefit from a referral to a neurologist and/or an ENT. I have chronic headaches, and I believe it is because of PV. I see a neurologist and a hematologist. My headaches are just like you are describing and so far, hydroxyurea has brought them way lower. I always had a headache for years and since HU, much less of them and severity is lower once my platelet count went down. Interestingly enough, those are what my headaches feel like and I guarantee that is when my counts are up. I have an excess of platelets.If we leave it untreated, God, I hate to be in that constant headache hell. \n\nI also take a CGRP inhibitor, Emgality, because it really has also helped a lot with the constant headaches. I do not know about pregnancy though because these two things are absolutely not safe for an unborn fetus, and they have me finally feeling semi-normal. Totally open to others experiences. Before being diagnosed with PV in February I had ocular migraines, but only the visual aspect which I called \"rainbow vision.\" No pain was associated with it other than just being a bit disorienting.\n\nMy hematocrit was 75 when my doctor recommended I check myself into the ER and I began an intense treatment with Hydroxyurea and phlebotomies after a bone marrow biopsy to confirm.\n\nI am one of the unfortunate 7% that experience \"ice-pick headaches\" as a side effect of Hydroxyurea and switched to an injectable medication called Pegasys. I still experience a range of headache pain, but nowhere near the intensity I was while on Droxia. I consistently feel as though I am literally going to pop. The pressure in my ears ,eyes, and the roof of my mouth is almost unbearable. My fingertips feel as though if they get any more pressure, the nails will pop off. I am losing my vision.  Like my body is completely made up of a slowly expanding balloon. Waiting for hematology now. Just wanted to let you know you are not alone. Things are going to get better. Please reach out if you need.", "PV and serotonin ", "Looking for Advice on Possible PV Symptoms Hey you all,\n\nI think I may have PV and am looking for some advice/people to compare symptoms with. I am brand new to Reddit, so if this violates something, please take it down!\n\nI have just gone through a diagnosis process for MS, which was a dead end, and in doing research on my own I came across this subreddit. For the past two months, I have been experiencing double vision (worse in my left eye, no signs of ON); random numbness in my hands, feet, arms, legs, and face; muscle cramps/spasms (legs were so bad last week I could not walk without pain); severe random vomiting; pain in my mid/upper back that ranges from a dull ache to shooting pain; fatigue like I have never experienced; urinary incontinence/urge/frequency; bowel changes (very dark and tarry); and worst of all an EXTREME itching that seems to be brought on when  my body temperature is raised (hot showers, walks, etc).\n\nI had a blood test when the double vision began a couple days before new years eve, and my HCT and HGB were both high but not crazily so (15.3 and 46.5). My RBC were also a bit high (5.34 million). The symptoms are getting worse.\n\nMy maternal grandmother died from EHE cancer, a rare blood cancer. Her mother died from a blood cancer too. My paternal uncle had leukemia but survived. Does JAK2 have genetic connections to these?\n\nAnyways -- I have just been really struggling with a lot of this pain and fatigue and do not know what to do after the MS was a red herring. Is it worth getting another blood test? would these numbers change/go up if symptoms are getting worse? If no one has flagged this yet, am I just being a hypochondriac? I am really just desperate for answers now, and want to be able to see again!\n\nThanks everyone!! Oh, I also have a history of horrible migraines, which I have seen could be linked to PV. These have not seemed to change in any way since I lost my vision. You need to see a hematologist or an MPN specialist. The definitive test is a bone marrow biopsy, but they will check your hematocrit and red blood cell count - a CBC. Would I need referrals to these specialists or can I make appointments on my own? \n\nHave you had a biopsy? That seems painful! And is that more of a \"last resort\" test or a first pass if the blood tests come positive? Sorry for all the questions, I am just feeling a bit failed by my neurologists now (the first one tried to tell me it was all in my head, which seems to be a common theme on this subreddit!) and now it seems the second one has wasted the past two months on MS since my brain and cervical spine MRIs are clear, and I am just really confused on what to do next.\n\nThanks so much for your response -- I have never heard of a MPN before, but I will look into it! It depends on your insurance. BMB\u2019s should be done under sedation, and usually only done after blood tests to check for a high hematocrit, hemoglobin and rbc. Thank you! Bone marrow biopsies can be completed with a local anesthetic, I know mine was. That is completely fine and realize sedation may not be covered by your insurance for this procedure. \n\nYou probably need a referral to see a hematologist. Some insurances do not require a referral and you can just ask to become a patient. \n\nThe JAK2 mutation is genetic, but it is not hereditary. It is important to distinguish here because a lot of times when people say \u201cgenetic\u201d they do not realize that it is referring to the GENE and not the chromosomes passed down by their family members. \n\nJAK2 is considered a gene mutation therefore making it genetic, related to a gene. The JAK2 mutation is not typically hereditary and basically the instructions for your cells got copied wrong and it is making more cells because of that wrong copy.\n\nI had terrible migraines for a decade and no one had ever done bloodwork before. Since I have been treated for PV they are almost completely gone now. That is all really great information, thank you so much! I got myself a bit worried there with the family history but it sounds like that would have nothing to do with it. There are a lot of nonspecific symptoms associated with PV so it is really not the best thing to go by. Your primary can order an EPO blood test and JAK2 mutation test. Over 95% of people diagnosed with PV are JAK2 positive, and most have a low EPO level. A bone marrow biopsy is definitive. (They are not a big deal. They numb you up and it takes about 15 minutes. I was not sedated. A root canal is far far worse IMO.)  See a hematologist, preferably from this list:\n I have nearly the exact same thing. I get super itchy when my body temp increases, visual disturbances, cold feet, black stool (recently) \n\nMy hematocrit was 54% and i am only 18 so it is quite strange, i am trying to get treatment but my doctor is SO painfully slow and will not order a phlebotomy until I see a hematologist which is booked for weeks. I have been diagnosed with this for 4 months and they have still done nothing about it, my symptoms are also getting worse.\n\nMy advice would be to drink a lot of water, and get treatment as soon as you can. I am glad you finally got relief, migraines are horrible. Can I ask what your treatment regimen is? weekly/monthly phlebotomies, aspirin? I only take 500mg of hydroxyurea once a day. It took awhile for my cells to regulate. Doc said I can take baby aspirin.  \n\nI am not trying to get pregnant so hu is not a problem for me right now. My MPN specialist told me there is no evidence to support that hu causes leukemia other than this disease can mutate into it.\n\nI have never had a phlebotomy and was told that makes platelets go up which was my problem. oh gotcha! interesting, my doctor said that phlebotomies and drinking lots of water were the main treatment for this universally, but yours is saying that actually makes platelets go up?? Do you have high platelets? they are on the higher end yeah Mine were over 1 million. So your specialist will have the best line of treatment for you. I am strange because of my age and I had ET and PV. PV presented like ET Also go see another doctor! It is night and day when I switched.", "How was your life before diagnosis and after? Hello all! I am curious and intrigued by this illness. I had a phi lobotomy recently and my doctor said there is a possibility I may have PV \n\nWhat was your life like before diagnosis? For example: when they say you itch, how often? And where did it itch the most?\n\nIf you had headaches: how often and how severe? \n\nDizziness: was it subtle or was it crippling? \n\nWas your fatigue chronic or like a quick nap every here and there? \n\nThings like that. I would love to know!", "\"Do I Have PV\" posts We understand you are concerned and have questions but...\n\n\nNOBODY HERE can tell you if you have PV or not.

If you are not getting the answers you want/need then you might need to find better team members. \n\nI do not so much mind people asking questions pre diagnosis. But the do I have PV posts with results have to stop. I have allowed them and it is becoming too regular. And its always the same answer, talk to your doc, talk to your team. \n\nWhat I will do is sticky this post. If you want to post results and ask do I have PV they need to go here and only here.

I have had elevated RBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit for about a year now.  I never knew about this and just noticed these numbers recently.

My primary doctor never mentioned anything about my elevated numbers.\n\nThe following are my numbers:\n\n9/26/20\nRBC: 5.71, Hemoglobin: 17.5, Hematocrit: 55.8\n\n6/28/21\nRBC: 5.54, Hemoglobin: 16.7, Hematocrit: 55.1\n\n9/20/21\nRBC: 5.72, Hemoglobin: 17.3, Hematocrit: 55.3\n\nWhat do these numbers mean and is it bad? Are you having symptoms? If your GP has lived at your blood levels and has not sent you to o a hematologist then I would not worry. \n\nUnless I have been feeling like shit and the correlation. I have had minor symptoms for many years, but never really correlated the two:\n\nTired all the time, issues with concentration, numbness, slight high blood pressure. Persistent high counts should always be evaluated. You need to see a hematologist and be tested for the JAK2 mutation and EPO level. If those are negative/normal, then you have Secondary Polycythemia and the cause needs to be determined. Since you have diabetes, kidney function should be looked at. Other causes are pulmonary in nature: sleep apnea, smoking, lung disease, etc. High testosterone levels can also cause it. If the cause is treated, your blood levels go back to normal and you are cured. Yeah, I am not too happy.\n\nMy primary doctor never mentioned anything about my high blood counts and when I finally noticed it and mentioned it to my doc, my doc did not seem concerned.\n\nWanted to clarify that I have stayed out of the pre-diabetes range (A1C of 5.4 consistently although there were was a time in the far past where I did step into the pre-diabetes range).\n\nI will be visiting a hematologist finally (finally found one who did not require a referral from my primary as my primary feels it is not necessary for me to see a blood specialist at this point in time).", "How high is too high? my rbc is 6.4 million \n\nwas wondering how much everyone else's is because i cant find anything online about when it becomes dangerously high.

These are the only things that have been flagged as abnormal. Some sources online suggest that these arent even abnormal and have higher ranges for men.

Doc, said they recommend bloodletting first because the tests for JAK2 mutation (blood, not marrow) and EPO are \"expensive\".   Only thing I have found so far on avg/estimated cost was from 2008 and that said $600.\n\n(\n\nQuestD fee for EPO test is 75 dollars.  \n( My bone marrow biopsy was about $14k but I only had to pay about $1500. Do you have insurance?  Yea, I cannot retire yet because Pegasys is $27,000/month without insurance. Working on ways to get it though. I am hopeful! Yes. Had to get prior auth for the jak2 blood test to be covered. Without waiting for the prior authorization my hematologist said $4k. I saw a quest diagnostics fee schedule and the JAK2 test was $175. However, most doctors order a \"cascading\" test. So first you are tested for the JAK2 exon 14 mutation, if that is negative then the exon 12 mutation.  So a potential total cost of $350 for PV only.\n\n\nIf they are doing a workup for ET or MF as well, it would then cascade to the CalR mutation test, and if that is negative, then the MPL test. Total cost of $700 for all MPNs. The doctors office billed my insurance over 14,000 for a bone marrow biopsy. I called my insurance company and they are like, \u201cno they probably just billed it wrong, I will send a form for them to rebill it.\u201d They set it up as \u201cexperimental\u201d which at the time is why it was so expensive. Is that without insurance? It is criminal what some of these doctors offices charge and wild what some of them do and do not do for insanely different prices. I wish our healthcare system in the USA was transparent with pricing like in Mexico. I was looking for the blood draw tests, not the necessarily going right to bone marrow. EPO was like 30 bucks with insurance 70 cash no insurance.  Seems like bone marrow is more common for direct confirmation?( I agree. I am not all for \u201csocialized medicine,\u201d but there ought to be safeguards for the public in pricing for treatment.

Severe shivering, teeth chattering, and almost unable to bend or walk.  An immediate hot bath is the only way to warm him up.  But that is just the start - then terrible pain starts in in bones, especially his hip bones.  These episodes happen unexpectedly every 2-3 days.  Indomethacin and a narcotic are the only way we stay out of the ER several times a week.  Once the pain gets stabilized, then he sweats.  Right through all the bedding.

I had a routine physical the week before and my red blood cell count (23ish), hemoglobin (23ish) and hemocrit (70%ish) all came back high.  We redid the blood work to make sure that the numbers were correct with plans to do a follow up the week after (last week).  Unfortunately, I ended up in the ER on the Sunday before with blood pressure of 200/110.  After a night in the ICU, I was sent to the hematology ward, got a bone biopsy and the first of what will be many therapeutic phlebotomies.  I was sent home on Wednesday with an appointment with a hematologist on Thursday to go over the biopsy.  The biopsy came up positive for the JAK2 mutation, so for the time being I am having 500 cc's of blood taken out once a week until the hemocrit gets down to about 45%.\n\nLooking back, I had really bad itching after a hot shower or working outside and getting overheated.  I got tested for allergies and they all came back negative, so I just wrote it off as something I will have to tolerate.  My numbers at physicals were never cause for concern, so I guess it is just flown under the radar for close to a decade now.\n\nMy wife mentioned that I am taking the diagnosis well.  So far I have come up with a handful of possible reasons why:\n\n1.  This is a much better diagnosis than leukemia or other cancers.  This is manageable and I am an adult who will follow through on managing it.  I get that it is a lifelong thing, but that is just how it is.\n\n2.  It is still too big to process.\n\n3.  I am ok with it for now.  Ask me again in a month when I have had a lot of blood taken out.  I may be way more bummed out about it then.\n\nI am leaning toward numbers 1 and 3.\n\nAnyways, this is a wonderful community and just wanted to say hi. I have had Polycythemia Vera for years. It was overwhelming at first, but quickly became just another part of my life - a thing to deal with, not my entire existence. \n\n\n&gt;1.  This is a much better diagnosis than leukemia or other cancers.  This is manageable and I am an adult who will follow through on managing it.  I get that it is a lifelong thing, but that is just how it is.\n\n\nExactly. I encourage you to read *recent* medical information about PV if you decide to look into it. Old research indicated that the average lifespan was something like 12 years, but we know this to be completely, utterly wrong. Older research also indicated that most patients are elderly men, which is not true, either. I have seen many people who have had it for longer than 30 years. There have been huge jumps forward in understanding and treatment in recent years. It is important to ask questions, not get discouraged, and follow through with treatment. \n\n\n&gt;2.  It is still too big to process.\n\n\nIt may be difficult to get your head around at first, but know that you will feel so much better when you follow through with doctors visits and treatment. \n\n\n&gt;3.  I am ok with it for now.  Ask me again in a month when I have had a lot of blood taken out.  I may be way more bummed out about it then.\n\n\nHaving blood taken quickly goes from sort-of-scary, to just a thing you do when you need to. It really is not that bad. I tend to reward myself afterwards with a soda so I have something to look forward to. Hi quick question here.

I am a 27 year old female who has had consistently elevated RBC, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels for the past few years. I do have rheumatoid arthritis, so it could contribute to bone pain. I do have reddened skin which at one point they thought might have been Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, but was consistent with it. I have very itchy skin and frequent headaches. My ferritin is in the normal range at 130. My most recent blood work showed a RBC count of 5.63, hemoglobin of 17.1 and hematocrit of 49.8. Prior labs showed RBC of 5.53, hemoglobin of 16.7 and 48.5% hematocrit. Then a few months prior my labs showed a RBC of 5.36, hemoglobin of 16.2 and hematocrit of 48.3. \nI have had a a hematocrit in the 50\u2019s percent range before this. I am a smoker but I do not live in a high altitude area. I am a nurse so I consistently look at lab work and mine is always above high threshold. Should I be concerned? Have you seen a hematologist? \n\nA few things may be causing elevated counts. \n\nI do not think anyone other than a hematologist evaluating you can definitively say they think you have PV. But I think it is worth investigating. I will tell you, the headaches are the worst for me. \n\nI would see a hematologist. They will try to do other tests to rule out other causes and may request to do a bone marrow biopsy and then do a genetic test to see if you have the JAK 2 mutation. If you do, chances are, yes you have essential thrombocythemia or you have polycythemia vera. I have not seen one yet. How long did it take before you actually found out you had it? 10 years? I went to the GP, had a CBC and the doctor calls me and tells me platelets are high. She repeats the test because something is abnormal. \n\nSecond time we ran the test, she refers me to a hematologist who is really not great. But back and forth with the first hematologist who just monitors bloodwork for a few months and since my blood platelets stayed high, she said we needed a bone marrow biopsy. That sucked.\n\nThat took about two-three weeks to come back and it says I have PV. This confused my\nHematologist because she says \u201cI have seen this before, but Not in someone your age.\u201d \n\nThen she makes me get an appointment at university of Maryland and sees an MPN specialist. They reviewed my case and the doctor says \u201cyou are unique because, your bloodwork shows you have PV, because your erythropoietin is low, in addition to the JaK2 mutation and your PV presenters like ET.\u201d \n\nAfter the first doc who ran bloodwork, it took maybe 5 months? \n\nThen I had a diagnosis about a month or two later back and forth with my shitty hematologist, she gives me a med I do not know how to take and long story short, I get to taking Hydroxyurea and my headaches significantly improved. You cannot diagnose PV based on blood counts alone. You need to get the JAK2 mutation test, EPO (erythropoetin) test and possibly a bone marrow biopsy. \nHere is the WHO / NCCN diagnostic criteria:\n\n\nIf you are JAK2 negative, it is likely you have Secondary Polycythemia which is usually caused by pulmonary issues (smoking, sleep apnea, asthma, COPD, etc), renal issues (kidney disease or cysts), or other things like high testosterone. Once the cause is treated, the blood counts usually return to normal levels.\n\n\nIt took 13 years for me to get diagnosed despite being sent to hematologists multiple times. Too many are diagnosed AFTER having a stroke or heart attack. Do yourself a favor - print the WHO diagnostic criteria and bring it to your appt. If they do not order the tests, ask why. I was finally diagnosed in 2020 after my counts were sky high. The first hematologist I saw was a real ass. I immediately switched to a MPN specialist. Here is a list of them:\n had a massive heart attack at 34 and for 6 years of visits afterwards to my GP's for blood tests hearing nothing but negative feedback regarding my bloods (high red count), low iron and liver function tests coming back as abnormal, \n\nI finally took a step with my GP and asked why for 6 years are we continuing to say we will revisit on the next test, the GP finally referred my onto a hematologist and after further investigation (6 months) I was diagnosed with PV, one thing I know is they do not come to the conclusion easily, \n\nBut if I did not sort of kick up with my GP now much longer would I have gone on not knowing.", "Is it PV?

I was diagnosed a little while ago with cramp fascilation disorder from complaints of numbness, twitching, muscle spasms, cramping, and the like.  A couple months ago, I was looking around for potential explanations, and PCV came up.  I recalled that my dad mentioned something about his overproduction of red blood cells or something (he passed many years ago from an unrelated illness), so I looked through his old email and did see he mentioned PCV a couple times.\n\nI am currently freaking out a little, as the dizziness and high heart rate are scaring me.  What should I do?  I do not want to overreact, but I have no idea how to go about getting a diagnosis or whether this is an emergency situation.  Should I make an appointment with a doctor to confirm/deny?\n\nMy hemocrit/hemoglobin/RBC count came out high on one CBC test over the last couple months:\n\n * Most recent: RBC 5.69, Hemoglobin 16.9, hematocrit 49.1\n * Abnormal one from April: RBC 5.88, hemoglobin 17.4, hematocrit 50.5\n\nI was fairly dehydrated during the April one, it being fairly early in the morning. I would say that if you are that worried, definitely make an appointment with a doctor to check things out. Though I believe for PCV you typically need to have a bone marrow biopsy to actually confirm anything, not just a few blood tests. Maybe family history makes it more likely, but I would not know. I have not looked into that side of things since I have never wanted kids. PCV is usually genetic, not hereditary. Although there is no way to tell if this was passed on. Do not freak out. Go get a CBC at a hematologist and go from there. \n\nLet them tell you it is abnormal. Actually also in order to be diagnosed you will need a bone marrow biopsy and genetic test for the JAK2 mutation. \n\nYour numbers are sort of high. But I am not a doctor nor do I know your history and have no authority or credibility to diagnose you.

My hemoglobin, hct, and WBC have all been above normal since at least November 2019. I am kind of anxious. My PCP said this is likely secondary PC. I have never had an EPO done, so I am not sure what they are basing that on. I do have fairly severe asthma and have been diagnosed with very mild sleep apnea in the past. Can even mild sleep apnea cause PC?  Does that explain the high white count too?\n\nI have a history of facial reddness and have had a PE in the past. After the PE I had a hypercoaguable work up with a hematologist. I am not sure what that consisted of, though, and he is not practicing any more. I am now waiting for the schedulers at a new hematologist to call me. \n\nAt my request my PCP said they would order an EPO, but I went to the lab today and the order was not there. \n\nWhat else should I be doing right now?  How concerned should I be?  Does secondary PC need treatment? I have tried joining the secondary polycythemia Facebook group that has been linked here before, but it looks like my requests are being denied. I have tried twice. I know my counts are not that bad, but I am anxious. Do not be anxious. There is no way to define if you have PV UNLESS you have a bone marrow biopsy and Jak2 test. Honestly if your doc is not concerned, I would not be either. Blood only a little outside the range of normal is not typically cause for alarm.\n\nDo you treat the sleep apnea? Usually once it is treated it would go away. I try and use the CPAP but always wake up after about an hour feeling like I am being strangled and push it off. I barely even qualified to get it on my sleep study. I used to be on home O2 at night, but the concentrator was so noisy I could not sleep with it. I am thinking about buying a quieter concentrator out of pocket and trying that again. I am a little more paranoid than normal bc PV landed my husband in the ICU with 6 surgeries so far. You should probably talk to a hematologist and get the JAK2 test done. Husband did not need a bone marrow biopsy to confirm diagnosis and the doc said biopsy can be done under sedation if and when we decide to do that, which apparently would check for other issues but is not strictly necessary I ended up getting repeat labs. My erythropoietin was smack dab in the middle of normal range. My hgb was slightly lower. My hct and RBCs were still high. I was able to get in with a hematologist in 3 weeks. I am questioning if I need to go now that my hgb went down for the first time ever, but also thinking no harm in keeping the appointment at this point. Hi! I have like the EXACT same bloods as you, and similar to you was at the top of the normal range for a while before they popped above it. Also have normal EPO and no JAK2 mutation. Did you end up getting any answers? My hgb ended up stabilizing by itself for the most part. I am seeing a hematologist now. I have had a few appointments, mostly just watching labs. Now my CBC is almost normal, but my CRP is high. I recently started on nocturnal oxygen to see if that would help. \n\nHope you get answers soon! Glad to hear it is getting back to normal! My doc also did not seem too concerned but he is referring me to hematology (8 month wait, ugh) and rechecking periodically until then to make sure nothing crazy happens. Hoping mine starts to go back down too and that your CRP goes back down as well! \ud83d\udc4d Have you had a sleep study? No, I will have to look into that!

I feel fine and yes i am able to work. With treatment it is done for me That is great to hear, how is secondary POV diagnosed? PV. Secondary polycythemia, NOT VERA is diagnosed through finding another cause like sleep apnea, or an autoimmune disorder and once THAT is treated and it goes away, then usually secondary was diagnosed. For PV they have to do a JAK2 test. If you do not have the JAK 2 mutation, you probably do have secondary polycythemia and they should do other tests to see if they can fine an abnormality in something else. If you DO have the JAK2 mutation, you probably have primary  PV. I not only feel fine but in have no symptoms . I only got diagnosed 2 months ago. I have had 5 phlebotomies since (tested positive for the JAK mutation), and my blood levels are close to normal.

Also, make sure you are hydrated, dehydration will raise your levels.\n\n\nThe main things that cause high hemoglobin and hematocrit (besides the rare genetic mutation responsible for PV) are conditions that affect oxygen levels (sleep apnea, smoking, high altitude, COPD, heart disease, etc), conditions that affect erythropoetin (EPO) (kidney diseases, high testosterone / testosterone supplements, etc), other blood conditions. Thanks for your reply. I stop and I am going to retest it. My last blood test was fasted state and I quite did not sleep the night before (like 3 hours sleep) so I hope it is the reason.

What is the defining test that doctors use to establish if results are polycythemia or polycythemia vera?

Is there any difference between the two that would make a doctor think it is vera from the CBC?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust checked my notes from my lab work and apparently I have polycythemia and \"needs erythropoetin added to labs\". Doing some research while I wait for the office to call me back. So polycythemia is just a symptom of an underlying condition. This means you have too many red blood cells/platelets, but it is caused by something else, sometimes sleep apnea , copd, hypoxemia, obesity. This is called secondary polycythemia.\n\nOnce the underlying condition is treated, polycythemia will go away. \n\nIf you have Polycythemia Vera, then your bloodwork will reflect high blood counts in your cbc consistently and they should test you with a bone marrow biopsy at a hematologist to see if you have a genetic mutation that most people with PV have. This is permanent. That said there are people who have been diagnosed with PV without the mutation. \n\nIt is called the JAK2 mutation and it stops working correctly and it is supposed to turn off but it does not. So consistently your counts are high because it is supposed to stop making cells but it does not. \n\nI had the jak2 mutation and then I got a second opinion with another doctor and they did an erythropoietin test. If you have PV you will have low erythropoietin. It is a secondary thing they use to diagnose or confirm a diagnosis. Mine was one.\n\nIf you have kidney disease or a tumor , it will show you have high erythropoietin. \n\nPV is what they call a myelopriferative neoplasm. This is a treatable slow growing blood cancer. With treatment, people can live a very long time. This is very helpful, thank you! I have PV but am in the 5% that do not have the JAK2 mutation. #lifeisweird Your EPO level was 1? Yes. Do you think it is unlikely I have PV with an EPO of 24? Ranges (4-27) I am not a doctor. You would have to see a specialist. I am just someone living with the condition.\n\n It seems like that is getting kind of close to the top of the range, but I am just no doctor. I really did not know what the range was! \n\nA lot of times a high erythropoeitn (spelling) count is indicative of kidney failures or tumors. I really think you need to get checked out. I am not saying it cannot be PV if you have a norma EPO number. I do not know that for certain. also if anyone wants to pm me i am happy to share.", "Help with questions to ask my hemotologist? My unusual bloodwork was flagged in July of this year. I was referred to a hemotologist in an oncology department (Swedish Hospital Oncology in Seattle). Tons of tests. I have the JAK2 mutation, have been getting phlebotomies every two weeks, and had my bone marrow biopsy two weeks ago and have an appointment to go over those results with the hemotologist tomorrow. My blood levels are getting close to normal, but still above normal. I have almost no symptoms.\n\nThe hemotologist is kind of matter-of-fact about it all (I am sure she sees way worse cases) and mentioned the Hydroxyurea during my first visit in August. That scared me, as it is a chemotherapy drug and it is used for some pretty gnarly cancers. How should I evaluate that suggestion based on the fact I am not symptomatic? And what should I be asking?\n\nIf the choice is between phlebotomies every other week or a chemo drug, what would any of you guys do? Phlebotomies are not fun and also eat up an entire afternoon, but like I said, the chemo drug seems like an awfully big gun to bring to a knife fight.\n\nWill I have to have phlebotomies forever? Will I ever be able to donate blood instead?\n\nThis is apparently a progressive disease--what happens when it gets worse? Like, I know I am at a higher risk of blood clots, but what else happens ten, twenty, thirty years from now?\n\nAny advice on questions to ask about things I have not listed here is extremely welcome. Ever since the diagnosis I am kind of under a dark cloud and just get overwhelmed thinking about everything, which is why I have not asked all these questions before. Tomorrow will be different!\n\n\\--Liz Pegasys is the only med that can bring heme remission. This is only in about 20% of patients, but I am willing to try.\nI started with 45/week and have only needed three phlebotomies in a year! My symptoms are better and the brain fog and fatigue are not constant anymore. \n\nIf you are in Seattle, have a consult at the Seattle cancer care alliance woth one of the two MPN specialist there. \n\nYou cannot donate blood since it is a cancer. \n\nHU can lead to leukemia, but it is cheap and so many docs offer it first. \nI refused HU and went straight to Pegasys, best decision ever. \nThe leukemia and lymphoma society is a great info resource as well, and they also offer peer to peer counseling! \nGood luck! THANK YOU! I take Hydroxyurea and have since 2019. I am a 29 year old female for reference and was diagnosed at 27. \n\nMy bloodwork initially got flagged because I had high platelets. Really high platelets like over 1 mil territory. \n\nI have terrible headaches\u2014and since taking hu I feel tremendously better. I tolerate it pretty well. Of course I do not want to do this forever or when I am ready to have kids. I actually have a pretty annoying headache right now. I can bet I have an abnormal spike right now.\n\nMy specialist says I am special because I have PV that looks like ET. But my epo was very low so that confirmed the diagnosis. \n\nI tried Pegasys before and my liver enzymes got too high for the my hematologist\u2019s comfort. It got my platelets and blood counts down but it never quite got them to a reasonable level either. I now see a regular hematologist but I was diagnosed by a doc who sent me to an MPN specialist. I do also have Jak2. \n\nThe only problem is I have to get off hu if I want to have children. And that is fine but I have dreadful migraines if my blood counts are even just a bit high. I had constant headaches that could not be diagnosed for literally like my entire life until I was 27. Have seen a bunch of specialist to diagnose constant headaches and no one ever ordered bloodwork because once I started taking hu, guess what, the headaches improved. I am also on CGRPs for migraines. \n\nI think I want to have kids, but I am afraid to go off of these meds, both CGRPs and HU. I have never had a phlebotomy because apparently those raise platelet counts. I am hesitant to get pregnant because of the terrible pain I might experience during pregnancy. Notice I did not say childbirth. \n\nMy other blood counts are high, but still within normal range. I think my blood counts are high right now hence the headaches. Too many phlebotomies can lead to myelofibrosis. Bone marrow suppression is better. I am on 500mg hydroxyurea a day, no side effects, blood cell counts generally stay in the normal range. Here is a great list of questions for your doctor.\n thank you!!!", "Just diagnosed. Can I live a long fulfilling life? Im scared my quality of life will be terrible for my last few years.\n\n(", "I am new here with a question... Hi everyone.. I have been lurking around for about a week and have a few questions..\n\nI saw the hematologist on Tuesday and am waiting on the results for my Jak2 and a few other tests to come in. My original appointment was to begin yearly testing for Iron Overload (I am a compound heterozygous for Hereditary Hemochromatosis). However, when my PCP did my original Iron Panel seven-weeks ago, my ferritin was at a 10, Iron Saturation was 14, and Iron was at 50. BUT, my hemoglobin was at 17, with normal hematocrit, white blood count and platelets. My PCP decided to give me ferrous sulfate for a month, which to me is a bit bizarre and left me feeling horrible.\n\nFast forward to Tuesday, I brought hard copies of my results to the hematologist and he ordered a series of tests, including Jak2, Von Willibrand, a panel for adrenal hormones, and a few other things. He also performed another Iron Panel, which my Ferritin went up to 49, but my CBC came back with a Hemoglobin of 18.5, 44% Hematocrit, and a MCH of 34 (everything else was in range). Von Willibrand came back mostly normal, except for my Factor VIII, which was 199%.\n\nI have always had high normal to elevated Hemoglobin, which I thought was probably due to my iron stores and there are quite a few symptoms of PV and Iron Overload that overlap each other. \n\nFrom my research of both conditions, I really did not find much on the two together, but I gather that one would cancel out the other. So my question is can you actually have Polycythemia, PV (depending on the Jak2 results) and Hereditary Hemochromatosis together or is there anyone on here who deals with both? Depending on my Jak2 results, and if there is anyone here who has both; how do you manage it?\n\nThanks for your help and input! I think I have heard of people with both. You would probably have better luck asking on the Facebook polycythemia vera support group \n\n\nand/or the secondary polycythemia group  Thank you! I received my Jak2 results this past Tuesday. I do not have a mutation on V617F, but I have one on Exon 15. However, it is listed as unknown. I do not typically use Facebook, but I will check out the links that you shared. \n\nMy blood work showed that I have high Factor VIII as well, so I have no idea what my hematologist has in store. I see him again in December. Hopefully, we can get something going, where everything is treated without any added problems. Interesting. Yeah, I am not a big Facebook fan, but you are not going to find many knowledgeable people or people like yourself outside those groups. Good luck with your upcoming appointment/treatment! Here are my results:  ... It is from the Jak2 Exon 12 mutation test and I have no idea if my reply will get flagged over the link. Also, my EPO levels are 10 mIU/ml... Exon 15, very interesting. I have heard of quite a few people with exon 12 instead of v617f, but they must test for exons 12-15 for a reason. Did you have a bone marrow biopsy yet? Because it says it is an unknown variant with this mutation, he wants to keep an eye on my hematocrit since it is technically in normal range, before performing a biopsy (this was the first question I asked him after my results came back). But he also wants to keep an eye on my iron too since my ferritin was originally low. I am going to try and push for one after the holidays to find out what is going on, rather than go on some wild goose chase. The Exon 12-15 test also included CALR and MPL mutations, which those were normal. The only definitive test is the bone marrow biopsy. Low ferritin can drive up numbers too, but there is so many things going on with you, I would push for the BMB just for peace of mind at least. \n\n\n Btw, are you seeing an MPN specialist? I saw 3 hematologists before switching and only then did I get an accurate diagnosis. I drive 2 hours to see her. MPNs are very rare, the average hematologist might get only 1 patient per year. \nHere is the list:  Not yet on the MPN specialist, I only got my results a week ago. I was originally sent to the hematologist, because I have the compound heterozygous Hemochromatosis mutation and my family history of the condition (my dad and three of my uncle's (his brothers) died from liver cancer that was related to it). My PCP did the iron panel originally, and that is where the low ferritin came in. \n\nWith my hemoglobin levels, I thought it was Iron related, since higher levels can cause them to rise too. I have done some research on PV over the last three and a half weeks, and if my hematologist actually has me do a biopsy, it will be one hell of a road to travel down. From what I have read from all of the other posts in here, I am floored that the doctor was on the ball this quickly.\n\nI will take a look at the list and hopefully, I can find one that is close to me. If you do not mind, I may send you a PM. I appreciate all the help and resources you have given me to check out. Sure, no problem Cool, thanks. I have tons of questions and I figured you did not want some random lady pm'ing you without at least asking first.", "Should I see a hematologist or are high-ish levels probably nothing? Hi there! I am 20F and I have have a very long history of weird and vague health problems that doctors never really have answers to. As a result, I have gotten a lot of bloodwork done over the years, and my RBC, HCT, and HBG have consistently been flagged as high. They are never crazy high, which I guess is why no doctor has ever been alarmed, but considering the high scores go back to when I was 11 and my health problems date back that far too (and levels are supposed to be lower when you are that young, I believe), I wonder if it something that should be given more than a glance. I have had migraines and headaches for over a decade, plus a degree of blurred vision that glasses do not help and vision tests do not recognize. I have gotten dizzy spells and vision disturbances for years, too, and I have passed out on a few occasions. I sweat to, like, a disgusting degree, even when I am cold. I get redness on my face that comes and goes--like, my nose randomly gets hot and unbelievably pink. I have always had joint pain and general weakness since I was a kid, and have always had huge problems with exercise and getting extremely dizzy and out of breath despite never being particularly out of shape. I have also had this weird symptom that has befuddled doctors for years where my legs and feet get dark, acrocyanosis or red blotches when I have been standing, and the discoloration is hot to the touch. I also sometimes get red blotches seemingly randomly on my legs, arms, chest, stomach--anywhere, pretty much. Lots of bruising, too. I have also had nosebleeds for years, and they have been getting worse lately, really gushing at the slightest touch and not stopping for awhile even with pressure. Plus a ton of stomach issues. Soooooo, I attached my log of blood draws compiled in an excel (keep in mind they range from age 11 to 20). Basically, I just wanted to see if anyone had an opinion on whether I should bother seeing a hematologist or not? I have seen so many specialists that ended up being useless, and I do not want to waste the time and money if it is probably just a dead end. Thanks!\n\n Have you considered investigating a dysautonomia, like POTS? Sounds like you might have some co-morbidities though. That is a lot to pin under a single diagnosis.", "I have got diagnosed with essential thrombocytosis and then with polycythemia vera and recently I looked it up online to learn about it, and the first thing that came up was that it is a type of a blood cancer. My doctor told me it is not but I wonder why it says that in several medical sites?  The way i explain it to people so they do not freak out that i have a cancer is that it is only a cancer in the very basics of the word: overproduction of cells. It can become leukemia which is a scarier cancer, it is just not a tumor creating cancer. My doctor said it does not called cancer, so it is? I understood that cancer mean Malignant tumors and not just overproduction of cells I literally go to a cancer center for care so i think your doctor may be missing a piece if they are adamant about it not being cancer.\n\n*Edit*\n\nIs your doctor's definition of cancer requires a tumor to be present, what is leukemia? It is cancer, perhaps you can see an MPN specialist? If you have polycythemia Vera it is cancer. If you have polycythemia, it is a disorder than can be \u201ccured\u201d usually through life style\nChanges. \nHowever, if you have been diagnosed with pv, I would see a specialist to get the latest and best treatments. It is cancer. It is different than having a tumor though and a lot of people think once you just \"remove it\" you suddenly \"beat cancer.\" There is no such thing--especially since it can always come back. \n\nI go to a cancer center to get treatment--and it is cancer, but some doctors are old-school and do not want to call it that or are REALLY not up on the terminiology or literature. My first hematologist called it a \"myeloproliferative disorder.\" (sorry, spelling) The thing about polycythemia vera is that it is life-long and can be very treatable. I also was diagnosed with PV presenting as ET. \n\nPV is the overproduction of red blood cells or platelets. Like cancer, the cells divide and copy, but then they copy wrong and keep making wrong copies. With the JAK2 mutation your JAK2 pathway does not turn off, so it just continues making these cells. \n\nI think they started calling it cancer so that they could get funding to study it. It is not leukemia, but it can become leukemia if not monitored and addressed. My friend who is a NP does not even consider it cancer. It is not \"cancer,\" cancer. If Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Duke, and the CDC call it cancer, I think it is safe to say that it is. Thanks, he did not say it is the definition I thought that. He just said \"no\" when I asked and that he does not know why it say so on the internet. Thank you, I do not know if I have one in my country but I will look it up. Thanks, I do not know how my doctor does not know that he is the head of the hematology department in the hospital, it is really weird. My doctors are saying the same, that it is categorized as cancer, but cancer cells are not being produced, it is the overabundance of red blood cells. I have also just been prescribed Hydroxyurea, a low dose chemo. Even a lot of newly-minted doctors do not always refer to PV as a cancer. As above said, namely because it is not a \u201cclassic\u201d cancer (tumor, usually treatable with surgery/chemo/radiation, other \u201cclassic\u201d symptoms of cancer).\n\nA lot of physicians prefer to say it is a myeloproliferative neoplasm or myeloproliferative disorder (as above also said).\n\nTL;DR It is a cancer by most accounts, but it does not fit into the stereotype of cancer. Therefore, there is differing opinions on referring to it as a cancer.", "Should I be concerned? I am a 20 year old female. I have a hemoglobin of 16.2. A hemocrit of 47.7. A RBC of 5.39. My labs were drawn several years ago and they were all lower than this by a lot. Polycythemia Vera cannot be diagnosed by CBC alone. First, tihe CBC should be repeated because levels fluctuate. (In my case, my levels have always been abnormal, going back 15 years...never had a normal CBC). If still high, ferritin levels are done to rule out iron deficiency. If that is negative, blood test for the JAK2 mutation and EPO level is done. If you are JAK2 negative, they will have to rule out Secondary Polycythemia which is generally caused by low oxygen levels due to smoking, lung disease or sleep apnea, etc. Taking testosterone can cause secondary polycythemia as well. Once the cause of low oxygen levels is treated, secondary polycythemia is cured. If you are JAK2 negative AND secondary polycythemia is ruled out AND your EPO level is low,  you have to get a bone marrow biopsy to confirm a Polycythemia Vera diagnosis. If you are JAK2 positive, it is still recommended to get a bone marrow biopsy to establish a baseline and determine if you have early myelofibrosis. We cannot draw any conclusion based on a single test. So, drink at least 3 litres of water daily and stop smoking if you smoke and then go for the CBC again after few weeks, if the trend is towards the higher side, further investigation needs to be done.", "My rbc, hemoglobin and hematocrit are little high so I got my lungs and ecg checked but doc said they were ok. I dont know if these values are high enough to be considered as PV. I have the symptoms though. I read there are some tests to check it. Should i go to a doctor for those tests?  Which symptoms do you have? Are you a male or female ? I am male.\n\nSome of things i experience but not sure if they are related to PV are dizziness(worse after walking), headache, tinnitus, nausea/bloating/low appetite. These symptoms also get worse when i sit for at least an hour.\n\nSometimes when i try to sleep i start to feel weird feeling in my arms and legs, my head feels heavier and finally shortness of breath and tightness on chest after awhile. I feel like i am going to faint. Then i have to get up. It feels better when i move. I thought this may be happening because  of low blood pressure but i am not sure. Better to consult an hematologist then. I have numbers higher than yours and going also to consult. I have also some of your feeling but for like quite 5-6y and I put them under the fact I am anxious because of my startups and some insomnia. Hematologist is definitely the person that could answer. It could be some sort of polycthemia that need to find the cause. Oh yeah i have these feelings for several years too but now it is more noticable and annoying for the last years. I am also an anxious person. People around me and doctors say \"It is psychological, you have nothing wrong.\" :D I have exactly the same diagnosis from my doctor, but it say to go to see an hematologist. I have high hemoglobin since a long time more than 13 years. Doc say it because I am physiologically like that but this time it is also a bit higher. Complications are so dangerous. It is better to be sure if it is PV or something else.\n\nDoctor also told me i can donate blood if this situation bothers me.\n\nHave you ever donated blood and if you did, did it make you feel better? It is better to not be anxious about it and just verify with an hematologist. You could also do a blood test for blood thickness You are right. I should not overthink that. I will just wait and get the results.\n\nThank you for your replies :) Yeah your result are not also really bad, in my country they start to talk about PV over 54% HCT Yeah maybe it is just physiological as you said. Though I will donate blood to see if it makes me feel better :D Yeah maybe it is just physiological as you said. Though i will donate blood to see if it makes me feel better :D Your numbers are high. The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria state either hemoglobin over 16.5, hematocrit over 49%, or red cell mass over 25%. Have your numbers always been high? Or just this one test? If just this test, it should be repeated and I recommend using a hospital lab over a private lab.\n\nPV does have symptoms but they are non-specific and cannot be used to diagnose PV.\n\nPV also cannot be diagnosed by CBC alone. 95% of PV is caused by the JAK2 genetic mutation so you will have to get that test. The other relevant blood test is EPO which is low in PV.\u00a0\n\n\nIf JAK2 is positive and EPO is low, you have PV. You do not necessarily need a bone marrow biopsy, but it is recommended to provide a baseline for future reference and to determine if you have early fibrosis.\u00a0\n\n\nIf JAK2 is negative but EPO is low, you may be one of the 5% of PV sufferers who are JAK2 negative. In this case, a bone marrow biopsy is the only way to confirm PV.\n\n\nIf JAK2 is negative and EPO level is normal or high, you do not have PV. However, you may have Secondary Polycythemia which is caused by factors other than mutation, including things that lower oxygen levels such as sleep apnea, smoking, COPD, asthma, etc; things that affect the EPO hormone (which is released by your kidneys) such as kidney disease and high testosterone levels; plus a number of other less common causes. Once the underlying cause is treated, your blood levels go back to normal and you are cured.\n\n\nSee the WHO diagnostic criteria here:\n\n\n\nVetted List of MPN specialists in the USA:\n\n\n\nUnvetted List of MPN specialists worldwide:\n\n\n\nIf you are not near an MPN specialist, it is a good idea to look for a hematologist at a teaching hospital or younger doctor who has recently competed residency. The reason for this is that MPNs are rare cancers and the diagnostic criteria and treatment algorithms have changed drastically in the last 5 years. Community doctors do not have time to keep up with the research on a condition that affects such a tiny percentage of their patients so they rely on their training which may have occurred decades ago. Unfortunately, it is quite common to see hematologists going by the obsolete 2006 guidelines rather than the 2017 ones. This results in under-diagnosis and/or misdiagnosis as well as incorrect treatment. So save yourself time and aggravation by finding a specialist! 1 month before this results rbc: 6   hb: 17.4 hct: 51.3\n\n2017                                        rbc: 5.7 hb: 16.2 hct:49.1\n\n2016                                       rbc:5.6 hb: 15.6 hct: 45.2\n\nThese are the hospital results. It seems like it increased over time. I once donated blood several years ago and it might be 2016. This might be the reason it is lower. I am not sure though.\n\nAfter the last results doc checked my chest x ray and ecg. She said they were ok too. Maybe there are some problems that cant be diagnosed by these methods so i am not sure about secondary PV but i will definitely go to doc for the tests you mentioned.\n\nThank you for your reply. Oh thanks, i will try to find a mpn specialist if i can. I hope you are getting better. Could also be dehydration or sleep apnea I am having the same issue right now except my eosinophils are also very high and I am panicking because I do not know what is wrong, I went in with body aches and fatigue and they put me on steroids and now they are talking about PV so I am also confused as hell", "Double Red Blood donation and polycythemia vera I am not officially diagnosed primary polycythemia vera, but have had elevated hemoglobin for 4 years now and no indicators of secondary polycythemia. My PCP has just advised me to donate blood as often as I can and monitor it with regular yearly check ups and I have donated whole blood every 8 weeks for a year now. Today however, I decided to donate double red so that I would not have to come as often.\n\nMy hemoglobin was 17.0 today before I donated - the highest it is ever been as it is usually around 16.5. I am not eligible to donate again until October. Should I follow up with my doctor about the higher hemoglobin level? Blood work obviously would not be that valid for me as I just donated 2 units of red blood cells, but I am concerned that phlebotomy alone does not seem to be enough to keep my hemoglobin in the normal range and it appears to be increasing. \n\nMy PCP has honestly seemed to dismiss this issue and the possibility that it is polycythemia vera which is why I do not have an official diagnosis. What are next steps here? Not exactly sure how this works logistically, but if you are really concerned, then you may want to look into getting a second opinion from a different doctor, especially if your PCP has been rather dismissive of your concerns.\n\nBeyond that, I have never actually given blood since I was diagnosed before I reached blood-donating age, so I do not know if official phlebotomies for PV management are any different from donating and as such do not think I can really speak on that side of things. Sorry I cannot be more helpful! That pisses me off. If you have primary polycythemia Vera, you cannot donate blood. It is diseased. And they may not know about you and you would just be wasting your time and everyone else\u2019s considering they will have to discard your blood.  \n\nI think what your doctor was getting at was to see if a phlebotomy or removal of a significant amount of blood made you feel better. But idk why would not she just order a phlebotomy? \n\nIf you are not seeing a hematologist for this and only a PCP, you need to see a hematologist and consider looking for a new PCP. That is down right careless to be recommending something like that. My blood has not been discarded by the American Red Cross - it is being used. They send you an email now when it is after passing all of their checks. I have been upfront with the Red Cross nurses, and they have all acted like it is no big deal because my hemoglobin has always been under 20.0 - their limit for donations - and I am not taking any medicine for it. The reason I donated Double Red was because of a recommendation from one of the nurses that I would be an ideal candidate because of my \"extra blood\".\n\nIt is like every medical professional I have encountered has recognized that my blood is a little weird, but not a single person has said that it is really a problem. But then I come on here after my PCP mentions polycythemia vera and it seems like something I should at least be diagnosed with. Well high hemoglobin does not necessarily mean PV. Has a JAK2 test been done? That is usually the major diagnostic criteria. \n\nI have been told my both the American Red Cross and my hematologist that I cannot and should not give blood. \n\nI did not mean to get all militant on you about the donating blood thing. It is all good. And no, I have not had a JAK2 test. My insurance is awful, so I cannot really get another PCP either - this one took me 6 months to get. I have had EPO tested and that was normal which is why my PCP even mentioned polycythemia and that I should start donating blood regularly. I have got a regular yearly check up in a couple of months, so I will bring it up then. If I try to schedule an appointment for this on it is own, my insurance will charge me an arm and a leg to even have the appointment, and I am not sure any testing they would do would be valid anyway due to me just donating blood. Maybe I am not understanding you correctly. Then it sounds like secondary polycythemia. Which is fine, it means that there is more than likely an underlying cause that has not been discovered yet. That is a good thing. \n\nMost insurance will cover a referral. You have nothing to lose by asking for one. Also, I would encourage you to call your insurance company and flat out ask them what needs to happen for you to see a specialist and if they will accept it and how the copays go. \n\n. I am sorry your insurance blows. That can make things difficult. Insurance is a pain with PV and migraines. But I have found great success being nice and just asking. Ask for a referral to a hematologist. (This is out of a PCPs wheelhouse. They are probably googling it just like you.) As long as he refers you, your insurance will cover it. PV is a rare chronic pre-malignant blood cancer and most medical professionals have zero knowledge about it beyond having heard the name. \n\n\nIf you do have PV, your blood cannot be donated. The reason is that not only are there too many cells, the cells are often abnormal and do not function properly. (As an example, in the related condition of essential thrombocythemia (characterized by high platelets) there is a risk of clots AND paradoxically a risk of hemorrhage - clots because there is too many, hemorrhage because they are abnormal.) PV patients have what is called \"therapeutic phlebotomy\" and the blood removed is discarded.\n\n\nI do not know if you are male or female but the criteria for hemoglobin is &gt;16.5 in men and &gt;16 in women. How are your other counts, such as platelets, hematocrit and WBCs? Are they ever high as well? While your hemoglobin is not astonishingly high, the fact that it is consistently high is concerning and should not be ignored.\n\n\nNormal EPO does not rule out PV. It can rule PV in, but not out, which is why it is a minor criterion in the WHO diagnostic criteria.\n\n\nSo, you must have the JAK2 test. Donating blood will not invalidate the JAK2 test. It is a genetic mutation and is present regardless of blood levels. If that is negative, you have secondary polycythemia and the hematologist will need to investigate the cause (ferritin levels, sleep apnea, smoking, high testosterone/steroid use, kidney or pulmonary issues, etc.) \n\n\nAlso, you mentioned your levels were not affected by blood donation. Some need frequent phlebotomies for a while, and others do not respond to phlebotomy and need to take medication instead to lower levels.\n\n\nSave yourself some aggravation and when your doctor is writing that referral, request to go to a vetted MPN specialist:  Thank you! I am female, and my hemoglobin has never been below 16 in the past several years. Other counts (platelets and WBC) are also often elevated as well, but not always.

On further testing, I am positive for Jak2 mutation and wanted to ask fellow redditors, has anyone been on Interferon injections? That is what my haemotologist is suggesting. I have been prescribed aspirin and doing venepuncture first while I research on interferon. \n\nIf not may I know what treatments are you all on and how has the management of the condition been? \n\nThank you and stay safe! Yes. I have been on interferon and now pegalated interferon aka Pegasys. I sometimes feel lousy after my peg injection but otherwise I have been fine. Hi Serene. I was diagnosed two years ago at 44 y/o. My high platelets were what sent me to the hematologist. I too have the jak 2 mutation. The first year I was doing phlebotomy treatments every couple of months along with an aspirin daily. I am still menstruating so it seems my body kind of took over. I have not had a phlebotomy treatment for over a year. I am not on anything but the aspirin just yet and feeling good. Hi there \ud83d\ude0aThank you for your reply. Glad the phlebotomy treatments and aspirin worked well for you. I am incline to go along this route and am glad there are people like you doing just that. Have a good weekend! Hi there! Thank you for your reply. Is the feeling like you have the flu kind of lousy and how long does it last?  And if it is not too intrusive, may I know why you decided with interferon? My haemotologist says as I am still young, I should try to stop the mutation which I understand but the thought of having injections for life is rather daunting. \n\nThank you! The injection is not that bad honestly. When you have this disease, you kind of get used to needles.   \n\nI get minor flulike symptoms sometimes when I take pegasys. I feel nauseas headache but that is it. \n\nIt is to make the allele burden drop. \n\nBut me and my first lousy doc decided on interferon because they are all concerned I need to have a baby. I am good if I do not. \nI was on regular interferon for a few months. I tolerated that pretty well. One thing I have learned is we need to stay away from iron. I started taking a multivitamin and that sent my numbers up. Just something I have learned along the way. Good luck to you! Thank you! And all the best to you too \ud83d\udcaa I am okay with needles, just concerned about the side effects. Thank you for your reassurance \ud83d\ude0a I have been on Jakafi (ruxolitnib) for almost three years. We just increased my dosage to 15mg twice daily along with one aspirin a day. No more phlebotomy since on Jakafi. The itching is about gone unless my shower is way too hot. Still get tired bouts but overall ok. Thank you and take care! Hello, my name is Elizabeth.  I am 41y/f and was diagnosed on 10/2020 with PV.  I have the JAK2 mutation and I am currently doing phlebotomy treatments every 2 months or so.  I was wondering if any other females were experiencing changes in their menstruation cycles?  Mine has recently been on 5-6 days and then off 10 days and then back on again for another 5-6 days.  I do not know if it is my hormones or my body's way of helping with p. vera.  I am tired all the time except a day or two after my treatment.  Pressure builds up behind my right eye and I get headaches, along with tingly sensations in my hands and feet when I use hot water right around the time I need to get treatment.  I recently had COVID-19 and now I am really worried about blood clots.  Any advise or news would be greatly appreciated in all the above listed things going on with me....", "My Polycythemia results from the doctor came back negative but I still have to get a bone morrow biopsy. Hey, so a couple of months ago I collapsed at work and ever since I have been feeling weak and getting dizzy spells. I have been doing a bunch of tests over the last few months and my hemoglobin levels are high on half the tests and normal on the other half. I can tell when my hemoglobin levels are high because I get bad night sweats, extreme cold in my hands and feet, extreme weakness and dizziness. The doctor told my tests for polycythemia came back negative but still wants my blood levels tested and have a bone marrow test done. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Question on the phlebotomies.....is it really true that they have to bleed you with the largest needle known to man? If so, why cannot they just use needles like when you have blood work? Technically, I think they can use smaller needles, they just do not because it would take forever. I hate the phlebotomy needles... Is not the mutation test a blood test? Would not they test that before doing a biopsy? Yes, they can test it before a biopsy. That is what I thought, someone else on here was saying a biopsy is needed If you test JAK2 negative, you must have a bone marrow biopsy to be diagnosed with an MPN.\n\n\nIf you test JAK2 positive AND your EPO level is normal or high, you must have a bone marrow biopsy.\n\n\nIf you test JAK2 positive AND your counts are high AND your EPO level is low, you can skip a bone marrow biopsy.  (IMO that is a bad idea because you will not have a baseline for future reference and you will not know if you are in early fibrosis.) If you test negative for jak2 and your epo is normal, wont they just assume you have secondary poly? Sorry, should have written JAK2 negative with low EPO needs a bone marrow biopsy. But yes, JAK2 negative with normal or high EPO likely means secondary polycythemia and they would have to test for that. Lol so I am getting a BMB no matter what? Not if they find a cause for secondary. In other words, if you are JAK2 negative and have normal EPO, they will look for other causes. If they cannot find a cause for secondary, then a BMB may be in your future. (BMB's really are not that big a deal. I would rather get a BMB than dental work.) Thanks for clarifying :)", "Cannot get a straightforward diagnosis  Hello,\n\nAbout 8 months ago I noticed 2 swollen level 5 lymph nodes on the right side of my neck. At this point I had chronic fatigue, headaches, weakness, frequent urination and felt that it was hard to breathe. I had also involuntarily lost about 12 pounds. The cat scan and ultrasound on the neck showed 2 swollen but benign lymph nodes. My bloodwork since has shown an elevated iron % saturation(59 H), high total bilirubin (3.6 H),  high hemoglobin (17.1 , 17.7,17.6 ), and high hematocrit (51.3 H, 51.2, 51.3). My rheumatologist sent me for an ANA screen to see if I had any markers for autoimmune disease which came back positive , but the rheumatologist could not connect that result to any of my symptoms and did not give me a diagnosis. I was then referred to a hematologist that sent me for an abdominal ultrasound due to the hemoglobin/hematocrit numbers, but that also came back clean. At this point, all of my symptoms remain + I am starting to have chest pains. I have not gotten a direct answer from any doctor as to what is causing these symptoms or the results in my bloodwork. I do not smoke or drink and I exercise frequently. Did anybody with polycythemia experience anything similar to this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you. The hematologist probably sent you to get an ultrasound of the spleen. So they are saying it is not enlarged?\n\nDid they text your erythropoietin levels? And bone marrow biopsy would be next step and genetic test for JAK 2 mutation No, the abdomen ultrasound was completely normal(kidney, liver and spleen). My EPO levels are normal and I tested negative for JAK2. Then it is unlikely you have PV.", "What symptoms led you to getting tested? I have had extreme itchiness, super easy bruising, fatigue, dizziness and it is hard to catch my breath doing simple things. I had my CBC and everything came back normal but my doctor referred me to a hematologist to cover the all of the bases. I had all those symptoms for years and a blood clot on my liver made them test me for Jak2. I say if you have those symptoms for sure get tested and do not wait for a deadly blood clot like I did. It is so rare you have to really push your doctor's. If your blood count is normal then you should be ok. Fatigue. My doctor tested my blood to check for thyroid issues. My thyroid is perfectly fine. My red cell, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels however... Yeah, I would say if you have normal platelets you are good. I have high HCT, HG, RBC\u2019s but my platelets were only 178,000. They call it Erythrocytosis However? We are high? Yes. All were high. \u201cErythrocytosis is an increase in RBCs relative to the volume of blood.\nPolycythemia is an increase in both RBC concentration and hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body\u2019s tissues.\u201d Mine is Secondary Polycythemia Hi, newly diagnosed today. I am a 38 year old white male. As far as symptoms go I experienced optic migraines for a couple of years, but did not think much of it because it was not associated with any pain. It is like seeing a soft, rainbow fractal filter over part or all of my vision that lasts 10 minutes at the most. I have a pinkish complexion, another thing I did not think about being an outward expression of my blood pressure. I am itchy for a few minutes after I get out of the shower, which I had attributed to my being hairy or using cheap body wash. Over the course of the pandemic, available work dwindled and I felt depressed and sluggish taking more naps in the process, but looking back it may have been at least partly due to fatigue. Recently I felt pain in my scrotum and following an ultrasound, it turned out to be a blood clot (thrombosis) and the dominos fell from there. Extremely high blood pressure. Cirrhotic liver. Enlarged spleen. High red blood cell count. High white blood cells too. My blood was very thick as they tried to draw it for tests. Upon receiving those results, my Doctor advised me to check into an ER within the hour. As the doctors got further into testing, they became perplexed as I seemed perfectly fine otherwise and felt as such. While I never saw myself in a situation like this, I am optimistic simply to know what is wrong and that there are treatments and medication available. Many of these symptoms were so minimal that I had a rationalization for each one, it is been a wake-up call for my family and me as I am sure it has been for many of you here. Pulsatile tinnitus.  I went to my specialist who referred me to a hematologist as a precaution after being diagnosed with chronic thrombosis.  I just wanted the damn noise to go away.  Turns out all of the things I have been living with for the last few years could be explained away by this diagnosis.  I have chronic fatigue, dizziness, major bruising, awfully bad itchiness, joint pain especially in my hands/feet, pain under my left ribs all the time, bloating after eating a small amount etc, heart palpitations and pain, racing pulse, shortness of breath etc.  I had migraine type headaches for a year that just went away on their own to be replaced by the tinnitus.  I guess that was the blood clot doing its thing.  \n\n  \nI am waiting on the results to come back.  Fingers crossed it is negative but I cannot explain away all of the above if it is.  I want to feel normal again.", "Have you had an enlarged liver with PV? I am waiting on JAK2 blood test to confirm.

I was recently diagnosed with polycythemia vera after about a year of symptoms. My blood levels are:\n\nRBC: 6.4 million hemoglobin: 18.4 hematocrit: 53.4 eosinophils: 647\n\nDoctors cant get me in to start my treatment for a few weeks and the life span without treatment is about 1.5 - 3 years. its been a year already with these symptoms and Im having heart palpitations every 5 minutes and my symptoms are getting worse by the day.\n\nMy question is how dangerous are my levels and if anyone else has this cancer, what were your levels when you got diagnosed?\n\nim just worried im not going to make it to my treatment in time. What are your symptoms? You are not going to die. Do not get afraid of that estimate of how long you will live without treatment. There are many people who lived a long time with PV undiagnosed. \n\nHow are they treating you? Night sweats, red palms and feet, headaches, fatigue \nweight loss, tingling in my hands and feet, high blood pressure (140/90) Im supposed to get my first phlebotomy on may 6th\ni have not been told much else as we dont really know how fast its progressing atm. Do not stress yourself. Phlebotomy is just for symptom management mostly. We produce too much blood and phlebotomy helps with that. I find I can breathe better after. Do you have any clots? That is what you need to worry about. You will have all of those symptoms for years it progresses slowly. Did they mention medication? You are young for diagnosis, I was 37 and I thought that was young. Just rest and know there is a whole community of us online \ud83e\udd17 i appreciate all the support, my doctor has not said anything about medication yet, given it only was confirmed through my bmb and jak2 last week. i still need to go over all this in my next visit. its just scary because im in the dark rn and i dont know what to expect. I do not know where you got that 1-3 year life span, but it is definitely incorrect. Most people with PV are diagnosed after age 60, so they usually die from other causes first. Average lifespan at that age is 15 years, but for you it would be much longer. I have had PV since at least 2009.\n\n\nYour phlebotomy should give you some immediate symptom relief. You should speak with your doctor about the drug Pegasys, which is the only treatment for PV that reverses allele burden (percentage of mutated genes).\n\n\nHere is questions to ask your doctor:  It is a cancer, but do not think of it like a cancer. It is a mutation of a gene, usually JAK2 which is involved in working with the proteins in the bone marrow. It is not something that spreads like a tumor. I am assuming you are seeing a hematologist on this? If not, I would recommend you do that. Palpitations were my indicator something was wrong which led my doc to send me to a hematologist and to my discovery of my PV. Once I got the phlebotomies going, they went away. Premature ventricular contractions (your palps) will not kill you; they are a sign your body is retaining too many metals and toxins resulting from the increased red blood cell count. If your doctor thought you were in imminent danger they would have told you to leave their office and drive immediately to a blood donation center and donate blood or they would have you scheduled to see a phlebotomist in the hospital the next day. I would not be overly concerned. It will take a while for your doctor to find out what your phlebotomy schedule will need to be. I started out every 3 weeks for several months which sucked, but now I am at every 60 days and it is been that way for 3 years now. You should be fine my friend. Drop me a message anytime if you want to chat about PV. I think at this point, we patients know more about it than the medical profession, considering how rare it is, and how little research is being done on it. Hi there, sorry to hear about you diagnosis, just chiming in to tell you you are going to be ok. My hematocrit was at 75 when my journey to diagnosis began in Feb of this year. After 5 phlebotomies (once a week) and daily Hydroxyurea, Eloquis and Nifidepin I am down to 66. This is not a death sentence, the treatments work making this a manageable condition. You will learn to start pushing your doctor. Definitely ask to be referred to a hematologist. It is a rare disease and stressful to navigate. Definitely do what you are doing and reach out to others who understand. Do you have Erythromelalgia? Are your feet and palm always red or only become red after certain activity?(hot shower, exercise). Also when was your last blood test prior to this? I have similar symptoms but I had a blood test about 1.5 years ago. my hands and feet are always red. my last blood test prior to this was high aswell back about 6 months ago, before that was back in 2016. my levels were normal around that time. Alright man, I hope you will do well. Beat of luck! Best* how do you feel with your hematocrit that high? mines at 53.4 and i feel horrible. i could not imagine anything higher. hope you doing well. im seeing a hematologist currently best blood test? idk what my other ones were off hand. i just know its been trending upward. That \u201cbest\u201d was for another comment that did not post for some reason \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 i said Best of luck oh my bad i did not see it Throughout all of this I have felt relatively fine. Many of the symptoms I had attributed to getting older (I am 38) or as quirks (like, \"I am just a hot sleeper.\") and when my primary doctor recommended I check into the ER after the results came in from blood tests, the doctors there all seemed pretty surprised at how fine I felt considering my numbers. I do feel different as the treatments are taking hold, more clear headed and less sluggish, but I have also made several changes to my routine adding exercise, changing my diet and I have not had a drink in 2 months (My PV also gave me cirrhosis of the liver) Best of luck to you, sorry you are having to go through this at such a young age, but just know that you are not alone and that the more cases they study, the closer they will get to finding better and better treatment and hopefully, eventually a cure. I had a blood clot blocking my portal vein on my liver. I had high platelets mostly. I am learning we are all different. The Jak2 test is the test they use and that only started in 2008. I think a lot of people have it and do not know. If there is a relief in any of this be less stressed that you did not get a blood clot. Also be prepared to grieve the your life as it was, just know a better you will grow through this very difficult piece of your life. It is been 3 years for me and I have good and bad days. I find the hardest part about being sick is having to explain it to \"healthy\" people. I will say the \"sick\" community is amazing! I know how scary this all is and how few people understand \ud83d\ude09 how did you find out you had the blood clot? An ultrasound lol I was diagnosed at 22 as well in 2004.\n\nI literally just found out today, from the internet, not my hematologist, that it is a blood cancer.\n\nDo your phlebotomies on time. I panicked like you when I first got told I might have PV. My GP knew nothing about it but I learned very quickly to read Dr Google much more carefully. I had an elevated hematocrit for at least 6 months before they realised it was an issue and I am still here. I absolutely understand your anxiety but try not to stress, as soon as you start treatment that risk reduces substantially, regardless of whether you start at 6 months or 12 months. I know where he got it because I found the same thing in my panicked googling! With zero intervention that is the average. But we have to renege that average would include people that were diagnosed super late and maybe had other health issues. Once I calmed down and did more research I realised I was unlikely to drop dead next week and got onto treatment. I will also say that I totally understand the panic over palpitations. But they are actually really common and not life threatening in and of themselves. They are just a symptom and will likely reduce as you start treatment.", "Is this CBC test cause for concern? (F20) I recently got bloodwork done because I was experiencing some joint pain. My doctor said that it seemed like anxiety-related physical symptoms to her, and she only did the bloodwork to appease my anxiety. She ordered a CBC test, and the results came back today with my hemocritin and RBC counts slightly elevated- My hemocritin was 45.2% and my RBC count was 5.45x10\\^12/L. My WBC, Platelet count, hemoglobin, etc. were all normal. Is this cause for concern, and should I ask for a referral to a hematologist? You mean Hematocrit. I really do not know what is normal for red and white cells because I had high platelets. But your hematocrit is pretty high for a woman. It is not something to worry about unless they repeat the test. \n\nThere are a lot of people who have polycythemia which is caused by an underlying condition such as sleep apnea, obesity, smoking and other factors. Once that is treated it will go away. \n\nPV is much less common, and you will need a blood test to figure out if you are positive for Pv. The majority of people who have PV have a genetic mutation of the JAK2 gene. Your numbers do not look bad. I would repeat the CBC, preferably at a hospital lab. In most cases of MPNs, the counts are consistently high. For example, I have not had a normal CBC in over 13 years. Not saying you should wait that long! - but blood counts can vary a lot and you want to be sure this is not a one-off.", "How does the disease progress? I am an 18 year old Male and I have been diagnosed since i was 15, I show pretty minimal symptoms right now the most prevalent is feeling full quickly. Anyways how does it progress in your personal experience and what are some complications you face? I would love to start a conversation as it is pretty hard to find good info online. The best advice I can give is to meet with an MPN specialist. Many people manage just fine until their 80\u2019s but the key is \u201cmanagement \u201c. Some never progress! Absolutely find an MPN Specialist the disease progresses differently in everyone. However with proper treatment and care most live a mostly normal life. Can you all explain why it is important to find an MPN Specialist?   I was just diagnosed with PV.   Thank you! MPN specialists study this disease, so they have more knowledge of different treatments instead of the old hydroxyurea. They also might know if clinical trials. I get to try Pegasys which is interferon and has put some people into remission! Good luck- Thank you!!!", "Question concerning my father, please any advice helps! Hello, today my dad went to Carti and he had some blood work done. They also had some blood work from him from a couple of weeks ago. This blood work showed that his hemoglobin levels were at 18.8 or 18.9 I cannot remember exactly and his hematocrit levels were at 57. These results were from a test he did a couple of weeks ago and they did another blood test on him today to check everything again. He has not gotten those results yet. He told me that the doctor said this could be a sign of PV or kidney cancer. \n\nMy dad has been dealing with excess blood production for a long time. He usually goes to get it drained but not very often. He is told me he is had a bone marrow biopsy before but that was like 8/9 years ago. He said it came back negative. Would PV have shown up in the tests then or is this something that can happen overtime? I do not know if he is had a JAK2 mutation test done before. \n\nHe deals with sleep apnea, he takes testosterone occasionally, has high blood pressure, sweats excessively and has sarcoid in his lungs. This leads me to believe it could possibly be secondary PV but I am also so afraid because what if it is not?\n\nHow deadly is PV? My father is 57 years old, so I do not know how long he could have been living with this. He is always fatigued, mentally exhausted or confused, and he is always telling me about all the other things he deals with on the day to day. He is been telling me lately that he is been having a terrible burning sensation in his back. I do not like seeing my father struggling with this and literally any knowledge you can give me to help my father would be so greatly appreciated. If you are concerned about PV, you should go see a hematologist. My understanding is that most people live with PV well with treatment. My partner almost died earlier this year due to complications from PV, but we did not know that is what he had and the doctors said his case was very unusual.

I have frequent CBCs completed, so this was easy to track. My doctor monitored it and finally did some more testing and discovered the Sjogrens. The elevated WBCs continued and I was referred to a hematologist who looked for leukemia and lymphoma, did a CT scan, and found nothing. She did note that my face was abnormally red and that I was sweating for no reason. She told me she would see me again if my WBC count went \"crazy high.\" My hematocrit has also been elevated the last several work ups. I just had blood work done for my family doctor and the following were my results: \n\nWBC HI 13.7 (Reference range 4.0 - 11.0 x E9/L) - Differential - Elevated neutrophils and monocytes \nRBC HI 5.38 (Reference range 4.00 - 5.10 x E12/L)\nHemoglobin HI 170 (Reference range 120 - 160 g/L)\nHematocrit HI 0.493 (Reference range 0.350 - 0.450 L/L) \n\nSymptoms: Red face as noted by hematologist and family members. Face is usually pale in the morning and my cheeks and forehead get very red throughout the day, almost looking like a sunburn. Excess sweating in the night and during the day. Had an appointment with my neurologist who noted that I was sweating while just sitting and talking. It is not constant and can start randomly when I am relaxing or can be brought on by light physical activity. I have headaches, blurry vision, dizziness, and tinnitus but I also have IIH so it is hard to say what is caused by what. I have episodes of tachycardia (I had an ECG yesterday and will get results in a week). Last weekend I stood up and blood shot out of my nose (I do not have a history of nosebleeds, my house is not dry). I bruise easily, gums sometimes bleed when I brush my teeth. My big toes and feet feel like they are cramping at night. \n\nI am wondering if this rings a bell with anyone.

Thank you for your reply! Sorry, I should have been cleared in my post. I guess my question is should I proceed to dig deeper into a diagnosis of a polycythemiavera as the blood results are a bit high -- though the normal ranges for this lab seem off from the ones I found online. If they are in normal range there is nothing to worry about PV can only be confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy. Usually people with PV have a common mutation like JAK2, although a certain percentage of people do not have a known mutation.\n\nAll of the results you have posted are normal. The normal range for HCT is usually 40-50, and not sure why the lab you got it from is saying 26-35. What exactly makes you think you have PV? Have you gone to a doctor to talk about your symptoms? I got a sleep apnea test done just a few days ago and am waiting for results! Do not smoke, do not think I am dehydrated, have lived in a 1km elevation for the past 2 weeks! They do not do bone marrow biopsies anymore because they are too invasive.  The Jak2 test would be enough. OP's levels are all in normal range.  I would say they are fine.  But I am just a small town pizza lawyer. Thank you very much for your response! I was going with just the test results. And, yes, the lab probably messed up the normal range. I am guessing they meant 36.5 - 45.4.  They literally outputted that that value was normal though. Um since when? I had one two years ago.", "Worried it is something sinister.

Pegasys is slow acting, and many people increase their dose from 45-90, and sometime up to 135 for a bit. \nMy experience is that 45 worked well for a few months, then I needed a phlebotomy and we increased dose to 90, and I am feeling good again. My numbers are also normalizing too. \nHu has been known to cause progression to leukemia, and there are some bad side effects, like mouth sores, skin cancer and some people lose their teeth! \nTalk with an MPN specialist re dosage of Pegasys. Thanks. It is a lot to think about. My numbers are normalising. The fatigue is killing me.", "Going to a blood disorder and cancer specialist. Do you think these may indicate PCV. Third blood test with same result, slightly more elevated  No They will do a bone marrow biopsy and then do genetic tests Only a genetic test will tell. It could be so many diseases, in my case it was Antiphospholipid syndrome, where those 3 were elevated aswell. If the genetic tests are indicating something, you may have to do a biopsy. At least in my case it was like that. I think if the doctors see those elevated levels, they get concerned and directly think about blood cancer or something. No reason to be afraid! Good Luck Your numbers are high. PV cannot be diagnosed by CBC alone. 95% of PV is caused by the JAK2 genetic mutation so you will have to get that test. The other relevant blood test is EPO which is low in PV. \n\n\nIf JAK2 is positive and EPO is low, you have PV. You do not necessarily need a bone marrow biopsy, but it is recommended to provide a baseline for future reference and to determine if you have early fibrosis. \n\n\nIf JAK2 is negative but EPO is low, you may be one of the 5% of PV sufferers who are JAK2 negative. In this case, a bone marrow biopsy is the only way to confirm PV.\n\n\nIf JAK2 is negative and EPO level is normal or high, you do not have PV. However, you may have Secondary Polycythemia which is caused by factors other than mutation, including things that lower oxygen levels such as sleep apnea, smoking, COPD, asthma, etc; things that affect the EPO hormone (which is released by your kidneys) such as kidney disease and high testosterone levels; plus a number of other less common causes. Once the underlying cause is treated, your blood levels go back to normal and you are cured.\n\n\nSee WHO diagnostic criteria here:\n\n\n\nList of MPN specialists:\n So crazy, I tested positive for antiphospholipid then polycythemia Vera. I cannot tell which symptoms go with which. I agree even if it is either or both do not be afraid \ud83d\ude09 There is so many others you start to feel lucky to meet so many strong people.

Thankfully, they havent found any signs of pv, just ASP... Stay strong!", "What can I look forward to? Hi guys,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack in January, I (26F at the time, now 27) was diagnosed with Polycythemia after a blood test. I am negative for the JAK2, and have phlebotomies 4X a year along with regular follow-ups with my specialist. I feel just fine right now, but was wondering if anyone here is also JAK2 negative and what life is like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA!", "Foods good for Polycythemia? Foods to avoid? Hello! I am posting this question here because my mom has Polycythemia Vera *(and Hemochromatosis)* and she is not on medication for it, so I was wondering what dietary changes would be good to make that would help with her Polycythemia Vera? What foods benefit it and what foods should be avoided with the disease?\n\nThank you very much in advance. There is not really a dietary fix for PV because it is caused by a genetic mutation. That being said, you want to avoid foods high in iron or vitamin K since they are involved in blood production. The Mediterranean diet has been studied in MPNs and found to provide some benefit for symptoms. I am curious why they do not have your mom on daily baby aspirin? Gotcha. Is there any specific foods *to* eat? I will let her know about that stuff though!\n\nMy mom has had negative personal experiences with doctors throughout her life and I think the idea of going, especially during a pandemic, has her really anxious. I am going to recommend she does a video appointment though; I do not know if she is considered that as an option. Also, would it be ignorant of me or rude in any way to post a list of stuff I have found that I am wondering is good for Polycythemia Vera, and stuff that may be bad for it? I am trying to compile a list for my mom *(in addition to telling her to see a doctor and get medication for her Polycythemia, of course)*. I have just been looking on for dietary stuff for Polycythemia and it is confusing me and I sorta want to make sure the info I have stumbled across seems correct(?) or not.\n\nEdit: Of course posting it with a disclaimer that the information maybe not be correct and it is just stuff I have cobbled together from parts of the internet saying \"eat X for Polycythemia Vera. Do not eat X.\", etc. Is your mom a compound heterozygous or is she a homozygous and is she currently receiving phlebotomies to treat both conditions? Oh goodness, I do not know the specifics; why does it matter? I can ask her tomorrow though! She is recieving no treatment, though I have re-mentioned it to her tonight. Well, the phlebotomies are the go to treatment for Hemochromatosis and can be a first line treatment for PV, so if she is receiving them, then going crazy on a diet would probably not be in her best interest. Whether she is a homozygous, heterozygous or compound can determine on how mild or severe the iron overload is or if you get it at all. \n\nI am a compound myself, with a Jak2 mutation, who is in the process of being diagnosed with PV. While diet can help a little bit to keep the iron from getting out of whack, we still need some in order to function.\n\nAs for PV, I have read that lower fat or something like the Mediterranean Diet is what doctors are aiming towards. Myself, I eat mostly plant based and it seems to do something positive.\n\nI apologize if my question threw you off, but knowing will help you and your mom go in the right direction with her treatment.", "Advice on some recent blood tests and Polycythemia Hello to you all,\n\nI have persistent and chronic fatigue which started at around the age of 15. I am now 35. \n\nI have been trying to get to the bottom of why I feel so ill and tired and my GP agreed to have some bloods taken.\n\nAll results were normal except the following:\n\n Red blood cell (RBC) count 5.67 10\\^12/L   Abnormal           Normal range   4.3 - 5.6   \n\n Haematocrit 0.516 L/L  Abnormal              Normal range   0.34 - 0.5\n\n Serum cholesterol   5.4 mmol/L  Abnormal               Normal range  0 - 5  \n\n Serum HDL cholesterol level   0.9 mmol/L  Abnormal              Normal range  1 - 4  \n\n Serum albumin  52 g/L  Abnormal                       Normal range 35 - 50\n\n Serum triglycerides  3.2 mmol/L  Abnormal                  Normal range  0 - 2.3 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should also mention that I have lichen sclerosus, exfolitaitve chelitus and folliculitis decalvans of the scalp. The GP is not willing to act on the test results as they consider them to be within normal ranges. \n\nA recent test I had (paid for privately) showed positive for Lyme bacteria and I am awaiting a herbal treatment protocol but I would like to rule out polycythemia as well. I am not able to get an appointment from the GP to see a haemotologist as obviously they do not feel the test results warrant further investigation. I have a lot of symptoms similar to those described by polycythemia. Any help or information you can give me is very much appreciated. \n\nThank you for reading. Your ranges do not really looks abnormal, just at the top of the range of normal. Typically to diagnose PV you need to CONSISTENTLY have abnormal blood tests. I can understand why your doc is not eager to send you to a hematologist. \n\nI would not assume PV at first. You may also have secondary polycythemia and that will usually go away if the underlying problem is treated. \n\nHave you had your thyroid tested? Your numbers do not look bad. If that is a one-off test result, the most common explanation is you were dehydrated when the blood was drawn. Ask for a repeat CBC with differential at a hospital lab. You might want ferritin levels checked as well. Low iron can drive up counts. What is your diet like? Any common foods?", "PV and Covid vaccine Hello,\n\nBit of a background on me: diagnosed with PV three years ago, recovered on my own from Covid in May of this year, no other health issues. Facing decision to take a jab or lose my job. Does anyone have any recommendation or is willing to share their experience with a particular Covid vaccine? I like the one jab approach but heard of possible blood clotting issues with J&amp;J:   It is very difficult to find any specific to this topic information. Unable to reach my hematologist but back in spring (before I got Covid), she said it is safe to take any Covid vaccine. The clock is ticking, I am scared... \n\nThank you for any help! I was told to get Pfizer for both shots. Had minimal side effects. Have PV too and had moderna earlier this year without issue. You should get it! I had it without issue. In fact, my doctors strongly recommended I get it, because I have PV. I got Pfizer. It is not that bad. I did feel crappy for the next few days, but sleep and rest really helped and I had a sore arm for two weeks. But it is not that bad. I have had PV for 2 years.  I am 72 years old.  I recently got my third Pfizer \u201cbooster\u201d shot.  Minimal side effects.  I take Hydroxyurea daily for PV.  I feel the shots are definitely worth it. Based in Ireland and had both AZ shots, first shot was on the morning 1 hour before they were pulled due to clotting fears, i was very hesitant and probably felt a little railroaded due to being diagnosed with PV, and believed this was my only reason for getting the vaccine. But on the basis of loosing a job this seems very unfair but would not think twice if my lively hood was at stake, only side effects was, felt like crap after both for roughly 24h, however your the only person who can make the decision. Hello friends,\n\nThank you so much for sharing your perspectives! I really appreciate this! \n\nI can see a strong consensus on getting mRNA jabs, not J&amp;J. Except for our friend from Ireland who did not seem to have a choice at the moment.\n\nWas the type of vaccine you took based on your preference, research you have done, recommendation of your oncologist or was it because where you are located the J&amp;J was not/is not available or in other words you had no choice?\n\nThanks, again! Hi.  I got the Pfizer shot.  I was diagnosed with PV last year.  I was worried about getting Covid because it thickens your blood.  Which is something none of us need. I was worried about getting a blood clot if I got Covid.  Which is a thing.\n\nWhen I got the shot it was pretty easy going.  No issues other than I felt poopy on the 2nd shot.  I live in Idaho and at the time in writing this Idaho has a very low vax rate of 42.  Most people here will not wear a mask and if they see you wearing a mask you might get called a communist/sheep.  It is super annoying.\n\nMy wife's work would not allow her to wear a mask.  My wife is vax but she got the Delta variant and brought it home.  Then I noticed a few days later that my black coffee tasted way watered down.  We got tested and sure enough we all tested positive for Covid.\n\nBecause we were all vaccinated it went just fine.  My taste and smell came back after 2 weeks and it was a fairly fast recovery.  My in-laws are anti vax.  So they did not get the shot.  It nearly killed my father in-law and it did kill my mother in-law.  Her funeral is on Tuesday.  My father in-law recovered which is mostly due to getting the monoclonal treatment.\n\nI recommend getting the shot.  I will probably be haunted by the noise my mother in-law made as she was choking for air but her lungs were filled with fluid.  It is a pretty terrible thing to go though. Good luck with this decision! My husband has PV an he is against getting the jab, however he did have a bld clot a few months ago an it was a very scary experience, just please do your research, make sure your fact checking what you read. I am a big advocate for natural health an I have been able to get my husband\u2019s health turned around an he has not had to have a phlebotomy for almost 3 months which is a HUGE improvement\u2026..his numbers are staying stable!!! We are so happy I found this product! Wishing you the best with your decision! I got Moderna before I was diagnosed with PV.  Felt rough the day after the 2nd shot, but totally worth it.  During my last visit with my hematologist, he suggested that I get the Moderna booster if/when it is approved, which I will. My oncologist recommended either Pfizer or Moderna.  So I went with Pfizer because that is what was available. Thank you for letting me know. Very important information! 2 x Pfizer shots with high platelets and hematocrit for me. Only side effect was swollen/tender lymph nodes after second shot. Hematologist did not recommend a specific vaccine to me, just to get vaccinated. J&amp;J was not available yet though when we talked about it. So not sure if he would have any thoughts against it since it is the one people have been having clotting issues with. Best of luck, and glad to see you are having a good discussion about it. Thank you for sharing your experience with us! I am not sure now (the more I am reading about it) that the blood clotting issue is limited to J&amp;J only. In counties where J&amp;J is not available, there are still cases of trombocytopenia/trombosis. I am not aiming this comment at you specifically, just a general impression after spending the whole day reading about it.  Perhaps I need to take a break and sleep on it. Rate of clotting incidence would be helpful to distinguish between the vaccines. Not sure that is easily accessible. But, my understanding is that J&amp;J is the highest, although still really low in the context of all vaccinations given. I understand you hesitation given your medical situation. I think it has a lot to do with how predisposed you are to clotting. Have you ever had a thrombotic event? Are you currently taking medications that may help or hurt after getting the vaccine. Those sorts of things. But if your hematologist says you are okay to get any of them, then seems like you are good? If you are concerned about J&amp;J, then do not get it. It is not the only vaccine out there. Our hematologist said the vaccine should be safe for PV patients, and our PCP said PV makes one more vulnerable to infections like COVID. My poor husband then had to take 2 jabs for the flu shot and pneumonia (already fully vaxed before PV diagnosis). Some expected reaction afterwards, but he was totally fine a couple days later. Thanks you for your insightful questions! My PV is managed very well currently by phlebotomies every 6 months (they were more frequent initially). My hematologist is content with the results of my blood work. Also, I am taking baby aspirin 3x / week ( now every day due to preparing myself for a vaccination). No trombotic events whatsoever. At the time of our discussion it was very early stage of vaccine rollout, not much info was available, shortly after i came down with covid so that also changed a bit (I think) the situation. Which Covid vaccine did your husband receive? Considering his condition and all the shots he had to take, he is got a lot on his plate indeed. Glad to hear he recovered well and got everything under control!\n\nI am concerned about all of them and if I had a choice I would not take any, especially since I have already been exposed to Covid. If I had to choose, which is the situation I am facing now (mandatory vaccination for work), then J&amp;J would be my preferred option as it is one shot only, I am just trying to find more info, hear from others who had experience with this and other vaccines due to reports of clotting issues afterwards. Pfizer. If you look at the statistics, all the popular ones (Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, even AZ) have proven to be extremely safe, especially compared to how dangerous COVID can be. Sorry if it seemed like I was asking those questions as if you needed to answer them here, haha. Just things to think about, which seems like you already have. I guess, I should also throw out a disclaimer that I am no expert and not giving medical advise, just my personal take on it. \n\nJust to give you a little more peace of mind, my treatment is more aggressive than yours, more blood draws but not on any meds other than daily aspirin. Have not had any symptoms since the lymph node thing. More weird than anything, and was told that was a good sign that my immune system was reacting to the vaccine. \n\nOne more thing to consider, they say probability of getting a clot with Covid is much higher than with any of the vaccines. Of course, this is hearsay until a study can provide some real data to help us make a good decision.  But if true, with you having Covid already, it stands to reason you would be safer getting the vaccine. Ultimately, I think it is a gut decision. I do not think you will be wrong whatever direction you go. Good thing I did not know about possible clotting issues when I had Covid! Puts getting the vaccine into a different perspective now. Thank you, this is very helpful factor to consider! I was diagnosed with PV in August but got Moderna-ed up back in May/June. It was fine. Had to leave work early the day after my 2nd dose because I felt like crap (but that is something I heard a lot of people dealt with regardless of health). I am fairly young at 28 so that could make a difference in how my body vs others may have dealt with it tho. Thank you very much for your response. Wishing you all the best; you are still very young perhaps there will be a medication for PV in your lifetime!", "Polycythemia and extreme hypertension I (33F) have recently been diagnosed with polycythemia vera, and have been diagnosed with hypertension since 16 years old and ulcerative proctitis since I was 24 years old. I am 5'5\", 180lbs. I am not yet receiving treatment for polycythemia as I had to switch doctors due to moving to a different state for work, and my new doctor wants to confirm my diagnosis. In July, my RBC(5.49), WBC (10.75) , Hemoglobin (16.1) , Hematocrit (47.3%) , Platelet (422 k/ul), and ABS Neutrofil (7.67) were all elevated. Pathologist report noted: Leukocytosis including absolute neutrophilia with reactive lymphocyte morphology, Erythrocytosis with increased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and Mild thrombocytosis with occasional giant platelets.\n\nFriday I had an episode of hypertension after forgetting to take my blood pressure medication that morning (I was up super late watching the news after Trump got COVID). I started to feel off - heart palpitations, racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, and very mild chest pain/back pain. I took my blood pressure medication (Losartan 50/ HCTZ 12.5) right away and continued to work for about 30 minutes, but I did not feel much better so I checked my blood pressure with a home monitor and it was 191/171. I immediately took another blood pressure pill and laid down. While I was laying down, I started to feel a little nauseous, but it subsided after a few minutes. After an hour, my blood pressure dropped to 139/96. \n\nThe next day, my blood pressure was still elevated all day at around 150/100 despite taking blood pressure medication as prescribed in the morning and I had pretty much constant palpitations and a high pulse rate. My sister recommended aspirin, so I have been taking two 81mg aspirin morning and evening from Saturday on.\n\nOn Monday, I went to the doctor and had an EKG which was abnormal, and I am supposed to be scheduled for an echo cardiogram sometime this week. Also had blood work done which I do not know the results of.\n\nTonight had yet another episode of abnormally high blood pressure: 190/74 at rest and sitting in a chair. I am having palpitations and have a bit of a headache, but otherwise feel okay. I took my blood pressure medication as normal this morning, and I took a second pill along with two 81mg aspirin, and an hour later my blood pressure was 140/90.\n\nQuestions: \nIs there a relationship between polycythemia and high blood pressure? \nWhat questions should I ask my doctors? \n\nAlso of note: Extensive family history of cardiac problems - all immediate family has high blood pressure, all grandparents have/had high blood pressure, both grandfather's had heart attacks, paternal grandfather and grandmother both have/had aortic aneurysm. I have never smoked, only drink socially (which is not very much these days!), and have never had COVID-19 that I know of. Yes, your blood is thick as honey. Your mom specialist should put you on a regimen of low dose aspirin and phlebotomies to lower your hematocrit. My bp is always lower after a blood letting, and I am on valsartin for my high bp. I just started Pegasys, and my bp is perfect and I was able to skip this months blood letting! Are you seeing an MPN specialist? Or at least a hematologist/oncologist? That is the best thing to do! Polycythemia can cause high BP, but your levels look way (some slightly elevated, but not extreme) too low to cause 190/xx BP.\n\nIf you had an abnormal EKG, I would definitely say it is something else, i.e. cardiac related.

She has been Googling everything and some of the symptoms say that you can be out in the sun or you cannot get vaccines. Naturally she has been incredibly nervous and anxious about taking it due to the side effects. \n\nI am just trying to reach out to people who may have experience with this disease and medication to help ease her mind some. Not true. Hydroxyurea for me is not that bad. I actually feel better taking it because it helps the migraines. \n\nShe can still go to beach and stuff. Just get her some coverups and always a beach umbrella. Rash guards are my friends because 1. Skin cancer and 2. I guess HU. \n\nI also have had both doses of the covid vaccine and my doc recommended I get it. No reason not to. I also have the Jak2 mutation. \n\nSome people however do not tolerate HU very well. I do though. HU is usually the first drug they try, mainly because it is really cheap. It can work well for some. The side affects can be brutal for some, yet others experience none. \nPegasys is the only medication (so far, there are promising trials of new meds) that has out people into remission. \nIt is expensive and off brand for PV so the doctors have to fill out forms for insurance companies.\nSome have great results with Jakafi as well. \nI fought for Pegasys and it has really improved the quality of my life. Good luck. Well that is good to hear! Her migraines and headaches are the worst part of PV right now so I am hoping comment this will help her stress lol. We have great medical facilities near us so I will pass along the info! Glad to help. My migraines have been much better since being treated for PV. I am 29. I take HU. No side effects whatsoever. Got my blood counts lower, but has not helped with symptoms. Hoping to switch to Jakafi eventually. \n\n\nYou can get the vaccine on HU. It is not an immunosuppressive treatment. I had the Pfizer vaccine with no issues.

My WBC, MCH, MCV and platelet count are all normal however. The HCP does not seem to be too concerned, even though in my bloodwork 1 year prior I was showing a Hemoglobin of 15.8 and a Hematocrit of 47.2. Do you all think I should seek a second opinion?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Have you CONSISTENTLY had abnormal bloodwoork? It looks to me you are only a tiny bit out of range on the \"abnormal\" results. Unless you are having symptoms, headachees, unexplained itching, bone pain,  I most defintiely would not be concerned. \n\nIt IS possible you have another health problem you do not know about, causing SECONDARY polycythemia which could be many things--and once THAT health problem is treated your bloodwork should go back to normal. \n\nI am not a doctor. I am not diagnosing you. You can always ask your GP about it and ask THEM what they think. In fact, please do. If they are concerned, they will send you to a hematologist. But I would not bother unless you are having symptoms. In 2019, my hemoglobin was slightly elevated. Then in 2020 my hemoglobin and hematocrit were elevated (as stated above).  I suffer from migraines, and have been having migraines since I was 18 years old. Most the women in my family suffer from migraine problems as well. I am going to see my doctor tomorrow to talk about the results, so I will what he has to say.\n\nThank you for your feedback, I really appreciate it :) I suffer from migraines and have had REALLY bad ones in the past, and I am quite frankly convinced PV caused it. For years, NO ONE did bloodwork. And I am convinced my migraines would not have turned chronic had someone found this out over a decade ago. \n\nI also have had migraines since I was 17. Seriously, though once I have been treated this way, migraines have definitely improved. I am curious to see if this has anything to do with my migraines. If it did, it would honestly be quite a relief to know the cause of them. I have tried everything, and I always thought it was related to the estrogen in birth control pills. \n\nNo one has done bloodwork on me either for my migraines, they just sort of blamed it on my period. I had a similar problem. I just had daily headaches all the time and I was not on birth control. \n\nThe hematologist told me that she did not think it would stop my migraines, and it has not stopped them completely.\n\u2014at some point idk my brain is just in a constant state of pain now, I was without my cgrp med while the docs office took forever to complete the prior authorization and it was just a different kind of chronic headache.\n\nApparently I just have two kinds of dueling headaches and I have to treat both to feel remotely okay. Omg that sounds horrible. Have you seen a neuro to see if maybe there is a secondary cause? I know I should probably see one as well, I have just been lazy about it. Oh I have seen 7 neurologists in 10 years. I do not know what has created chronic migraines but pv for sure has contributed to them being worse. \n\nI have lived with headaches for so long and it just feels so amazing to have gotten some relief. I do not have a diagnosis.  I am just barely out of range (female with a hematocrit around 48, that is steadily  climbing).\n\nBut,  I am on calcium channel blockers for sluggish blood flow to my hands and legs. This is an off label treatment for Raynauds.  But, it has also gotten rid of my headaches.  \n\nI used to get obnoxious headaches that lasted days to weeks at a time.

I have been reading through some of the posts here and want to say I am really glad I found you!!  I apologize in advance for being long winded\n\nI saw my first hematologist in 2009 or 2010 because I had high RBC, HCT, and hemoglobin.  He told me that I should get a sleep study because I was so fatigued and not to worry about my blood work because I live in a high altitude (5400 feet). I got the sleep study, which showed low moderate apnea during REM\u2014I slept fine if I was not dreaming.  CPAP never helped my fatigue.  Note that my RBC, HCT, and hemoglobin have not been within normal limits since at least 2009 (that is as far back as my personal records go).\n\nThe last 10 years has been filled with all sorts of specialists for nonspecific symptoms including fatigue, brain fog, headaches, visual disturbances, sweating, bleeding gums, and the list goes on.  No one ever found a cause for anything I was complaining of.  Some of the doctors even suggested I was making up symptoms.  My primary care doc suggest I see a hematologist but I told her I already had and what he had said.  She insisted I at least take low-dose aspirin (bless her!)\n\nSeptember of 2020 I hit a wall.  The headaches were constant.  I was forgetting the simplest things (like my birthday).  I was having 4-5 migraine-like auras a day.  Let us not even start on the itching.  This past January I finally went to the hematologist.  At that point my hematocrit was 60% and I had my first phlebotomy.  That was an AWFUL experience\u2014I got stuck 9 times for them to get 500 ml. My arms were completely black and blue and one of the nurses felt so bad that she cried.  Good news is that after 8 phlebotomies I know where the ONE vein that is functional is and do not let them try anywhere else.\n\nMy current challenge is that my hematologist still will not give my a firm diagnosis\u2014my JAK2 test was negative and that is all he is going by.  Keep in mind that he is NEVER even asked about my symptoms\u2014it is all about lab results for him.  He is convinced that I have erythrocytosis (secondary polycythemia).  At first he said it was because of the sleep apnea until my sleep doc told him it was not.  Then he said it is from my heart until I brought him records from my cardiologist (I have a rare genetic arrhythmia and implanted defibrillator) showing that my heart is in better condition than most people my age.  Then he said he \u201cwill assume\u201d I have COPD.  I told him I did not want him to treat me based on an \u201cassumption\u201d and asked him to send me to a pulmonologist for diagnosis.  He said he did not need to refer me and ordered a pulmonary function test.  That test came back showing MILD obstruction and perfect oxygen diffusing capability.  NOW (2 months later) he is referring me to a pulmonologist and will not do any further work ups until the pulmonologist says my breathing is not the cause.  My appointment for that is not until late June.\n\nThis hematologist will not even consider doing EPO, arterial gas tests, or BMB.  He is put the threshold for my hematocrit at 48 even though I brought him WHO treatment criteria and medical journal articles saying to put the threshold at 45 (some say 42).  In early March, I tested at 46, so they did not take my blood.  When I went in for a draw 2 weeks later I was back up to 51 and feeling like crap.  Last week I was at 48, so I was turned away.  Four days later and I can barely move.  \n\nYes, I know the answer is get a new doctor, but there are NO MPN specialists anywhere in the state that I live.  The good news is that I sent my records to the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix AZ and have a telephone consult in 2 weeks.  My understanding is that they will bring me in for a week and run all necessary tests and I will walk away with a confirmed diagnosis rather than this whack-a-mole game my current doc is playing.\n\nSo, that is my story.  If you got all the way down here, thank you for reading.  I know some of you are sensitive to people being here that might not have PV, and I hope you will not dismiss me for that.  I have read in depth about this disease.  If by some miracle I get a BMB that shows I am perfectly healthy, I still know a lot and maybe can provide some support to others.\n\nMy question now...has anyone else had difficulty getting diagnosed?  How do you advocate for yourself? You have already done what you need by setting up the Mayo visit. I hope they get to the bottom of it. It sounds more like secondary polycythemia, but JAK2 negative PV has not been entirely ruled out either.\n\n\nWhat I would do with your current hematologist is to print out the WHO and/or the NCCN diagnostic criteria, bring it to your appointment, and ask why the next logical step is NOT the EPO test. Not in a confrontational way, just a \"can you explain this to me?\" way. Most oncologists follow the NCCN guidelines by the letter, but they do not have to and sometimes they have legit reasons for that. So there is nothing wrong with asking him to explain his reasoning. I can understand his reluctance to do a BMB, but the EPO test is a simple blood test that is not nearly as expensive as the JAK2 test. \n\n\nI assume you have used the list of vetted MPN specialists to find the Mayo doctors:\n\n\n\nThere is an unvetted list of doctors recommended by other MPN patients. These doctors are not necessarily specialists, people have just had good experiences with them. You might consider switching to one if your doctor is not willing to communicate better. \n\n\n\nI travel 2 hours to see my MPN specialist. It is well worth it. Ideally, you can find a hematologist willing to collaborate with your specialists at Mayo. \n\n\nI also suggest joining the secondary/undiagnosed Facebook group. \n Thank you for your input!  I guess I should have added that my Dr tested for JAK2V617F, but not the exon 12 mutation.  He said it was not necessary.  Yes, I have taken in the WHO criteria and discussed it with the doc.  We even discussed that the negative JAK2 is not a firm requirement for PV if you have low EPO levels.  Again, he said it is not necessary and will not discuss it further.  As for secondary PV, even his nurse practitioner agrees that I have tested normal on every test that would point to a condition that causes hypoxia, thus the increased blood counts. Additionally, I had a kidney work up when the sweating was at its worst, and kidneys are functioning fine with no tumors there or the adrenals.\n\nYes, the first thing I did was check the lists of MPN specialists.  The vetted list has no one in my entire state; the one doctor on the unvented list that apparently has MPN patients is now retired.  &lt;sigh&gt;. Thus, the Mayo Clinic\u20148 hours by car.\n\nThanks for the FB group; however, I am not much of a Facebook person.  That is why I was excited to find this group.  Is there one on Reddit for undiagnosed?\n\nI noticed that you, too, took a long time to get diagnosed.  How did you finallly get there? Agree completely!  Part of the frustration is that current hemo doc is the HEAD of the hematology/oncology department at our major hospital.  You would think he would be up on the guidelines, but apparently he is not.  Perhaps he is too busy with the normal cancer patients.  The closest MPN specialist I can find is at Mayo, which is a 8 hour drive/4 hour flight (assuming COVID gets under enough control that I am comfortable flying again).  \n\nAre you familiar with Mayo Clinic?  I am hoping that they can recommend someone local that will follow their lead.  I have not mentioned it to the current dr, but I have heard the entire department resists Mayo Clinic recommendations. One other thing I recommend is finding a young hematologist, preferably one who competed residency in the past 5 years. They will be totally up to date on MPNs. I just wrote this novel length thing about my journey to diagnosis, but I am going to make it a post. You are so right about the head docs not having to keep up to date.  Yesterday I mentioned to my heme here that I was seeking second opinion from Mayo.  His response was, \u201cSo, your appointment with Mayo is on Wednesday? Then let us try to get you in for BMB on Tuesday.\u201d  It was like he did not want Mayo to know he was not doing his due diligence.  I am nervous about the BMB.  On the other hand, I am excited about Mayo.  The doc they have me seeing there is really into quality of life, and that is been my biggest complaint\u2014I just want my life back. Looking forward to your \u201cnovel\u201d!  I hope you do post it.", "MPN Clinical Trials 2021 Update ", "Secondary Polycythemia What is the standard treatment option for this? Is low dose aspirin enough to handle it? I was approaching a state of severe symptoms for a number of days, especially cognitive ones, but with treatment I have halted the progression of things. Still not getting my cognition back though, and I am a little concerned that I might need to be bled if the aspirin is not enough to handle it", "Should I/we tell our kids Hi all, as someone who has been diagnosed with polycythemia vera (PV) \n\nI am in a bit of a dilemma, I have 3 kids oldest been 15 youngest 10. \n\nI am stuck on the difficult decision do I tell the kids about the illness, my wife believes we need to wait a while, and i know its difficult for her also. \n\nI am sure they know something is not quite right with me, they see all the hospital and doctors appointments that come in, they see the everyday effects this illness can cause  but the one that is got me is the lack of energy (fatigue) also as my body does not produce or store iron resulting in myself being constantly out of breath.\n\nSort of going off the question this should have been a simple 2/3 lines", "Early diagnosis? Hi all,\n\nI am a 36 year old woman with a history of unexplainable blood clots -- both DVTs and PEs.  I am finally seeing a hematologist for the first time and in running labs, he found I have elevated white blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells.  When I looked up the official levels needed to diagnose PV, mine are all high enough to be abnormal but not quite high enough to reach the levels needed to diagnose PV.  He has also ordered genetic testing, so I do not know whether or not I have the JAK2 gene yet. \n\nI guess I am just wondering -- has anyone had an experience earlier in life where doctors suspected PV but your levels were not quite high enough for an official diagnosis?  From what I know about PV, it develops over a long period of time... could this just be early onset?\n\nI realize this is Reddit and not a doctor's office.  Just curious if any of you had experiences like this. I was diagnosed at 27 which was last year. The only thing that indicated I had PV was a high platelet count on a CBC. I wish I had something more to offer you. I wanted to respond because I did not want to let you think you were alone. Hi there -- thank you, I really appreciate this!  It is kind of scary, but honestly, I have already been dealing with the blood clots for 10 years... so in a way, it would at least be nice to have a diagnosis to know WHY.  I hope that you are dealing with it okay!  Seems like there are not a ton of people on this sub, which makes sense seeing as it is rare to begin with, and even more rare in people under the age of 60! No not me personally though I and they are pretty sure I had it for numerous years before diagnosis based on symptoms. Wait for all the testing to be done before you start to worry. I know easier said than done. But if it is PV know that it is pretty manageable. Yeah.  I think there is only like 6,000 people in the US with it.   I was just referred to a hematologist-oncologist by my GP today as my blood cell counts have been high/in PV range for several months now from several tests.  I just turned 50 last month.   \n\nGood luck with finding an exact diagnosis.   Wishing you the best!!!", "Kind of annoying Sorry, I know wondering if you have PV is scary. I know because I have it. It is getting a little annoying that most of the posts lately are people asking us if their blood looks like PV. \n\nIt is a bit insensitive. I would love to support you all but I am on here to meet others already in my shoes and get support there.\n\nMaybe it is me and I am having a bad day but for real a lot of people post their blood work on here freaking out terrified they have a disease or cancer when we already are living that way. \n\nIt is a bit triggering as this disease is limited in info already. Ask your doctor's or start a thread for this specific thing? I totally agree with you. Please use google and see a hematologist before coming to this subreddit. We are not doctors and cannot tell you if you have PV. We do not know all of your health history and even if we did we still would not be able to give you a diagnosis.\nI live with PV. Sometimes it is hard. I am lucky since being treated I feel and do fine most of the time.\n\nIt is annoying going to the doctors so often and having bloodwork. It is annoying having to take days off work to go to the doctors office. It is annoying to have to take Hydroxyurea every day. It is annoying. But it is not a death sentence or unbearable for me. It is annoying sweating to death all the time and itching out of the shower. I am very lucky I am not in a lot of pain from it anymore with constant undiagnosed migrainesz\n\nAnd there are also a lot of people on Facebook, mostly older people on Facebook talking about their symptoms and I am convinced it is because you are all just getting older and those are symptoms that everyone gets. Maybe side effects of PV are worse if you are older. But I am convinced none of them are PV and they are just old I totally disagree. I have PV too. My platelets were abnormal beginning in 2008. 3 primaries, 1 hematologist, a surgeon, and more failed to diagnose me. I always asked about my bloodwork and was always told it was just the way I am and not to worry about it. So I believed them. My platelets started out around 475 and gradually crept up over the years. I remember that they were 775 before my total knee replacement surgery in 2017 (which is notorious for causing clots) but no one said a word to me. By 2019, they were over a million and I requested a hematologist. The first one I saw went off the obsolete 2006 guidelines and told me I had ET and to just take aspirin. He also said MPNs have no symptoms. By then, my other counts were all hanging out on the upper borderline and my hematocrit was high but he said I did not need a BMB. I switched to an MPN specialist. She always does a BMB and it definitively showed I have PV. My EPO was low as well. In all likelihood, I had ET that progressed to PV in the 12 years I went undiagnosed. Or I had masked PV. There is no way to tell now. I am so symptomatic and I really suffered a lot for years, needlessly. Most of my symptoms are being addressed by my MPN specialist. Things are looking up.\n\n\nIn the PV Facebook group, there is an awful lot of people who find out they have an MPN AFTER a catastrophic event like a stroke or heart attack. I am damn lucky not to be one of them. So, do I trust your average doctors to be up to date on a rare condition like PV? Nope.  Do I believe people with legit high counts should be blown off until something terrible happens? Absolutely not. I, for one, am happy to share the WHO and NCCN diagnostic criteria with them, the list of MPN specialists, etc. I realize many of them probably have a one-off weird CBC or  secondary polycythemia, but they also could be me 13 years ago. The me being told my shitty blood counts were \"just the way I was.\" Ya I was really feeling frustrated. I have offered support many times and still there is been loads of threads lately of people panicking showing me blood work. We are all different. I have PV and antiphospholipid Syndrome, there is nothing worse then trying to soothe someone who has not even seen a hematologist or been diagnosed. That is great I did not say do not help just start a thread for it. The only poly site I found on here in inundated with undiagnosed people that is what I was saying. Also I know well I found out because or portal vein thrombosis. Ultimately if a doctor cannot tell you how are we supposed to know. This is not WebMD Where do you think the undiagnosed should go? They Google high RBCs, high hematocrit, the results say PV and they come here to ask. I had not noticed that many requests, but if it is a big problem, the mods could make a weekly test results thread, and all those posts could go under that. A lot of subreddits do that. \n\n\nThe WHO and NCCN guidelines are very clear. You do not need to be a doctor to refer people to them or explain the process of getting diagnosed. In fact, they even have patient versions. I share the criteria a lot. To the point where I saved a doc with all of it and just copy/paste. If it prevents one heart attack or stroke, it is worth it.\n\n\nI think there is a perfect storm of things happening right now that have led to the frequent postings of blood test results:\n* Patients have access online to their test results and doctors do not have enough time on their hands to field questions for non-urgent issues.\n* MPN symptoms are nonspecific (e.g., fatigue) so anyone looking at a list of them could believe they have an MPN if they are unaware of the genetic mutation part of it.\n* There is a need for updated required continuing education on MPNs in the medical community. There has been drastic changes in the diagnostic criteria as well as the treatment algorithms which did not occur until 2017, only 4 years ago. Any doctor basing their treatment on their training prior to that is doing it wrong. And a LOT of them are doing it wrong. \n* Most hematologists only get 1 MPN patient per year, so they have sparse experience and little motivation to use their very limited time keep up with the literature for a very tiny percentage of their patients. I do not really find it insensitive but I do not think it will help anyone to ask people who are not doctors, to diagnose them Yeah everyone for a entitled to their view. I think it is and if these people do have it there is not much any of us can do seeing as it is a blood test. I am feeling sad lately and I come on Reddit because it has threads. This thread is about the disease and not for diagnosis. I do not mind one or two but every day there is more and the people are freaking out. I have it and it is insensitive to me to have to read someone freak out about something I have. My post was my feeling and whether you agree are not is totally fine. I wanted to remind people some of us with multiple diagnosis can get triggered by people asking us to diagnose them. If you do not mind start a thread!!! Do people know how to use Reddit anymore?? Omg all the down votes lol at least I know you feel me lol thanks! I have three diseases and reading people freak out and they only had one test... I guess I am gna have to go somewhere else to meet others who actually have polycythemia Vera and want to discuss that. I get it. While I totally agree that a lot of doctors miss it in younger people, and some doctors really have zero clue about it\u2014I still do not think asking people who have the disease on Reddit will somehow give you a diagnosis. I am happy to share information and offer encouragement to people who like actually have PV.  \n\nBut no one on Reddit can diagnose you anymore than we can say you are pregnant without taking a pregnancy test. There is just no other way then to diagnose you without the proper medical tests. \n\nOnce again I was dismissed forever with migraines and in 7 years not one doctor did blood work. Because I went to 6 or 7 neurologists in 5 years and had the eeg, the mri, the ct scans, Botox, whatever treatments they had since 2009. CGRPs are a godsend too but my chronic daily headache is gone. No one ever thought to do bloodwork since 2009. It was not until 2019 I got diagnosed. I am convinced I had this way longer. But they just told me \u201csorry. We do not know what is wrong with you all of your scans look normal. You are just sensitive and there is nothing we can do.\u201d \n\n\n\nTurns out my platelets were over 1 mil. Treating the PV with HU and my headaches are not as frequent now I am talking about a pinned thread that would be at the top. I am not a moderator, I cannot pin. Oh okay I think I understand better your point of view.. I hope your post will help change things I am relatively new to Reddit, so please forgive me if I am not replying to this correctly.  (I will introduce myself in a separate thread\u2014when the brain fog is not hitting so hard).  Perhaps it would be more helpful to reply to the \u201cDo you think this is PV\u201d posts by redirecting the individual to r/hematology.  That...uh....I do not know the term for Reddit subjects....anyway they have a specific area where people can post test results and get the thoughts of hematologists or students.\n\nFor years patients were not allowed to have copies of their test results simply because of the tendency to self-diagnose and panic.  As mentioned elsewhere, these posts that you are annoyed about appear to be a direct result of the availability of medical information via test results, Google, etc.  Yes, PV is scary\u2014especially as you are struggling to understand the implications of the diagnosis.  For those like me who do not have access to an MPN specialist, anything that can ease the anxiety helps.  \n\nI simply ask that you put yourself in the other person\u2019s shoes...explain we are not here to interpret results, but to provide support to those who have been diagnosed.  Then tell them where they can get their question answered.  I find it interesting that this is the only place that does not do that.  Perhaps it is because those of use dealing with PV are often over burdened with the physical/emotional symptoms of the disease ourself that patience is hard to come by.\n\nThanks for listening to my rant.  I just could not let this one go. I wont be creating a pin or sticky for blood test results. I see both sides to this. This group is primarily for those with PV to discuss their issues, talk about living with it. I agree that at times it can be annoying to see people asking do I have PV? \n\n However we all know how scary it can be being in the guessing stage of diagnosis. It took me a year or more of testing to be diagnosed. Being able to reach out to others with the disease you are being tested for or docs/you might be thinking you have can be therapeutic. As others said most if not none of us are doctors. Or at the very least not your doctor. Medical advice on any internet forum or thread should be taken with a grain of salt. \n\nI dont see an issue with people posting their blood test results here. And really a bulk thread really does not do much good imo. As every test is different. \n\nI will watch and see how many of these we are getting. If rules need to be changed due to overriding test results of non diagnosed I will evaluate and discuss with everyone. Wow thank you everyone for being so supportive! I love Reddit for this \u263a\ufe0f", "Hopefully the mods can sticky this. Here are some FAQs about PV because it seems understandably, when we read blood cancer we freak out. Good morning lovely people. I asked the mods to maybe sticky this because I think it might clear up some questions that newly diagnosed might have.\n\nPolycythemia Vera is a rare blood cancer caused by the Jak2 gene mutation. This basically means that your red blood cell maker does not turn off, leaving you with excess blood cells.\n\n1. Polycythemia and Polycythemia Vera are not the same thing. \n\nThere is primary polycythemia or PV which is typically caused by Jak2 mutation. \n\nIt is possible to be diagnosed with polycythemia without it being cancer. It is called secondary polycythemia and can be caused by sleep apnea, obesity, COPD, smoking, anything that reduces oxygen. Once it is treated it will go away. If you have secondary polycythemia, you will be just fine. It will go away once the cause is treated.\n\n2. Abnormal bloodwork 1-2 times does not indicate you have a problem. If your GP is not concerned about it and your symptoms do not affect your life, I would not be concerned about it. Sometimes I think we all become hypochondriacs and then get symptoms. \n\n3. If you think you have this disease, before asking if your GP should be concerned, I would encourage you to start writing in a journal to track your symptoms. In addition to looking at your own bloodwork.\n\n4. To diagnose, usually a bone marrow biopsy is done as well as a genetic test to look for the JAK2 mutation. \n\n5. Gene mutations are random and radiation or working in a steel mill did not cause your gene mutation. Just random.\n\n6. You are not going to die\u2014unless you do not get treatment. This is not a death sentence.\n\n7. If your insurance company denies a medication for you, let the doctors office know and they likely have to fill out a prior authorization form . If they still deny, call your insurance and be nice as pie and ask them how to get an appeal accepted and follow tho steps . Write down who u spoke with and the date .\n\n8. Common treatment fr PV is hydrea, Pegasys, phlebotomy and jakafi. \n\n9. Symptoms of pv can be headaches, itchy skin after a shower, bone pain, fatigue, and some other symptoms. \n\n10 We cannot diagnose you based on your bloodwork.  Please ask your GP for a referral to a hematologist. Write down any symptoms you are experiencing in a journal or note on your phone and bring to the GP.  Also not all hematologists are familiar with myleoproliferative neoplasms or MPNs. \n\nI sill be happy to answer anyone\u2019s questions if you just want to talk to someone about it. My husband was diagnosed in Mexico and they said his white blood cell count is high not his red blood cell count. He did a bone marrow biopsy and they said the treatment is phlebotomy, blood thinners, and possibly steroids?\n\nI am not in Mexico with him so I am unsure about the facts of the information. \n\nHe has chemotherapy for colon cancer last year and they said that the medicine for the chemo is what caused it. \n\nI feel so ignorant on the situation since I am not there and have not seen any paperwork. I also do not speak/read Spanish.\n\nEdit: They said its Absolute Polycythemia...trying to figure out what that means. They said its Absolute Polycythemia...trying to figure out what that means. There is no guarantee your husband was diagnosed with this because he had chemotherapy. It is possible, sure. \n\nAlso, if his white count is high, that means he likely has an infection or autoimmune issue because his body is fighting off attackers. He may not have PV and may have only secondary polycythemia hence the high white count. This would mean that he has something else going on in his body causing temporary polycythemia. Tumor? Kidney function? Has he had erythropoietin checked? If it is low, then usually a diagnosis of pv but if it is high? Could be kidney tumor or failure.\n\nI am not a doctor and I am not qualified to make a diagnoses or interpret any medical results. \n\nSteroids? I have never heard of that. Blood thinners and phlebotomy and  Pegasys/interferon/ hydrea and jakafi are the only things I have heard of to treat this disease. \n\nIs your husband getting treatment in Mexico? I do read some Spanish and could probably make out some of it, but google translate may help you.\n\nIf you want to message me with more questions I am happy to do chat with you. We both are HIV positive. I wish you guys the best of luck. But based on that info, it is very likely a flare up of your illness, is the cause of this increased white count. \n\nBut what criteria was used to diagnose your husband with PV? because based on what you have told me, it does not seem to line up with PV. \n\nI am not a doctor and most definitely not invalidating what they have said. \n\nBut remember: Polycythemia is not the same thing as Polycythemia Vera. Absolute polycythemia sounds like he is certain the disease is called polycythemia but not that it is caused by the gene mutation Of the JAK2. \n\nWas a genetic test done to test for the JAK2 mutation? They did the bone marrow biopsy though like a month ago and he just got the results. They said that his blood is too thick as well. His HIV status is undetectable though. He had colon cancer last year and they treated it as well and he had a colonoscopy and endoscopy recently and they said everything looks good. \n\n They also said that he has h. Pylori infection and also maybe a stomach ulcer. Wonder if that can cause this? \n\nI am sorry my husband just has a lot of health issues and he was deported back in February 2019 so it is been hard on us for sure. He has been in and out of doctors and now this. He also has alot of back pain which we found out his disc seem to be touching...we were in a rear end car accident in 2018 and I am pretty sure that caused that. He also hit his head on the dashboard then so I think they are going to do an Xray of his brain soon to see if the brain bleed is gone. \n\nI will see if he can send me clear pics of the paperwork. Do not send it to me. It just seems like something else is really going on here. Good luck to you and your family. It seems like you guys have been through a lot. I would ask a hematologist to see if they are able to interpret his bloodwork because usually a high white count is not the red flag for pv that the red blood cell, platelet, hematocrit and hemoglobin are. Okay thanks My boyfriend who is 22 had a blood clot about 6 months ago and it is cleared up now but he was just diagnosed with polycythemia and he is getting tests run to determine whether it is secondary or vera. He is 22, male, eats healthy, and exercises. What are the odds that it is PV? I am praying it is secondary but what are the chances it is PV? And if it is, would this shorten his life span? I cannot answer that. Pv is rare. Unless he has the JAK2 mutation, it is likely to be something else.", "anger and frustration first time posting. \n\nbackground: hi. i am a 34 year old male who recently went in for a check up. mainly due to my dependence on alcohol. embarrassed to put it out there but i guess this is a place for that..\n\ni have not been in the best mental health for a while now. i have been chronically abusing alcohol for several years.. \n\nit was only until i was having health issues that i assumed were due to alcohol that i decided to get checked out.\n\nanyway. found out there is a high probability i have polycythemiavera. my PCP kind of hinted at possbily a tumor but was really vague. i assume because he thought it was best until further results.\n\nit was only after googling my results and reaching out to few other friends that the reality is setting in.\n\nmy RBC is 6.82\nHemoglobin 19.8\nHematocrit 59.9\nNeutrophils 7.5\n\nother numbers seem to fit within the \"normal\" range\n\nanyway my question is about how i am feeling. mainly towards friends.\n\ni feel like i am lashing out and trying to burn bridges.\nall because i am frustrated and basically sad. i am a type of person who is very generous with their time. to get straight to the point..\n\nis it wrong to feel upset and angry that my close friends are not being as supportive or reaching out to me. i know everyone is different but i have always tried to be there for those in their trying times.\n\njust feel very alone and extremely depressed.\n\nany insight/thoughts/opinions are greatly appreciated (both positive &amp; negative)\n\n\nthanks in advance Hello and welcome. What you are experiencing is normal. Dealing with something like this wether diagnosed or in the testing stages, is likely to put you through the stages of grief. I went through it without a doubt especially that anger phase. Friends, family took the brunt of my anger. I had to step back and watch myself in third person in order to control it. The fact that you are aware of it means you have already started to look from over your shoulder and you can help yourself correct it. Take deep breaths and know that nobody is at fault for what is occurring, not even you. Good luck and if you ever need someone to vent to feel free to PM me. appreciate your response and going out of your way to talk to a stranger. appreciate the kind words and sharing your experience. thanks for the well wishes! i hope you are in good health! Have you gotten the diagnosis for PV yet? BMB or gene testing? It seems like you are overreacting at least to some extent, because you could have secondary polycythemia from the alcoholism. That is fairly common. Your doctor sees numbers and sees a related health condition but it does not mean there is a direct link. I would wait for further testing before actually lashing out at people. The PV journey is such a complex one. I really felt frustrated with my diagnosis because I would been so good to my body with diet and exercise. My doctor told me there was nothing I could have done; it was a genetic and chronic neoplasm. I would always had it and it just chose now to appear on bloods.  \nI retreated from a few friends. Others became closer and I do not have any regrets. I will say that because PV does not operate like a traditional cancer (we are not going to hair-loss chemo treatments or hooked up to tanks and wires in the hospitals), people do not seem to react in with the level of compassion we would expect.   \nThis is a really tough time and it is okay to say that to your friends. Honestly, the time I was waiting for my results versus the diagnosis was harder. I did not know if I had 4 months to live (they thought is was ovarian cancer) or if I was fine. I did a lot of hiking and walking, and rejoicing in the day. I was still scared. It is okay if you need to say this to people. You are scared, frustrated, and you need them to be there. PV cannot be diagnosed by blood counts alone. You must have testing for the JAK2 mutation, an EPO level and a bone marrow biopsy. Are you seeing a hematologist? Is your hematologist an MPN specialist? \n\n\nGiven your other issues, it is very possible you actually have Secondary Polycythemia which will resolve once the cause is addressed. Hi I like you was just diagnosed with PRV . My doctor sent a message through my health portal telling me I had tested positive for the JAK2 mutation and that he would cAll me to discuss soon . The irony is about 4 years before I woke up covered in hives and was diagnosed with chronic urticaria . For whatever reason the allergist also ran my Tryptase count which was elevated at 32. \n\nWent on Xolier and about a year later was asked to get off to see if the hives would or would not reappear . They did not thank God but now with the Tryptase elevation allergy sent me to hematology oncology to be evaluated for systemic mastocytosis another mass cell disorder that also can be fatel as it also can  lead to leukemia .\n\nBone marrow biopsy negative and Tryptase dropping I was estatic! Thought I had dodged a bullet until this diagnoses .\n\nSo going back to the JAK2 test . When I opened my health portal and saw the positive test result I was numb. Ofcourse knowing nothing about PV I did what all of us do and ran to Google. I am employed at UCLA were the JAK2 test was developed so I know there is no mistake as our own labs ran the test. When I saw the C word on Google I was my God I am going to die soon. I walked around a parking structure for hours . My wife is calling and texting non-stop as I know she has seen the test results and is aware I am probably frantic. (She is right) .\n\nI finally text her please give me some time to process this . She says PLEASE call me . \n\nI call her and she is initially felling the same way I am about my impending demise . She happens to be at UCLA getting her annual physical . Her doctor comes rushing in because the nurse tells her my wife's blood pressure is dangerously elevated . Wife tells her Dr what is going on . Doctor looks at my health portal and tells my wife call him right now . I am on a three way call and my wife's doctor says Jim I know you are scared but listen to me . I have patients with this JAK2 mutation and not a one has passed away from PV and two have had it over 20 years. You are not going to die and Dr.Eradat (hematologist) is going to tell you the same thing. \n\nI hope this gives you some comfort and I will tell you this my numbers are a little lower  then yours and my blood pressure is normal . Hematology was not that concerned. Two baby aspirin a day and phlebotomies until my numbers drop back down . Hematology also feels that I will not have to have that many phlebotomies per year after they get my HTC to 45 . There are patients who have problems that are more severe but since you are not mentioning any of those issues I would say you are probably at my level . You will need to get the alcohol consumption under control though . \n\nIf you have anymore questions and I can answer them feel free to message me . Let us know hematology path of treatment for you please . Godspeed.", "Does Pv effect vitamin b12 levels?  I am about this as well. \n\n*bump*", "Any thoughts \\ advice is much appreciated Hi all\n\nI would appreciate your thoughts on my situation. I am 39F. My iron and ferritin since I was a child have always been on the low side, as well as my RBC indices: red blood cells count, hemoglobin and hematocrit, have always been borderline anemic to slightly anemic.\n\nIn the last few months I have been seeing a hematologist due to my high B12 levels with no supplements. The hematologist did some exams and could not find anything wrong. In one of the exams, he ordered a CBC. Due to a lab error, they could not find my results and asked me to repeat the CBC two days later. In the end, they were able to find the results of my first CBC as well. \n\nSo in the first CBC my RBC count was 4.0 (ref. 4.2 - 5.4), Hemoglobin 11.4 (12 - 16), and HCT 34.6 (ref. 37 - 47).  \n\nIn the second (two days later) my RBC count was 4.6, hemoglobin 12.6, and HCT was 38.3.\n\nThe hematologist said that was impossible and there probably was a lab error. He said there is no way I would produce this much blood in two days. In our next appointment though, he said he would like to test for PV, with the reasoning that I am iron deficient which could be masking the PV. He said with my iron levels, hemoglobin over 12 would not be expected, and that often B12 is elevated in PV.\n\nWhat I am wondering though is:\n\n1. If we assume the lab results are correct in both cases, would a person with PV have RBC count 4.0, Hemoglobin 11.4 and HCT 34.6, even while being iron deficient? Maybe with hemolytic anemia? (I was taking antibiotics a few days before so maybe it caused hemolysis?). And in general, would someone with PV really have hemoglobin around 12 (which is what I always have) even with iron deficiency?\n2. Have any of the people here diagnosed with PV had high B12?\n\nThanks! There is a correlation of high B12 and MPNs. I do not understand his reaction to the second blood test, it does not seem amazingly higher than the first. I am thinking maybe you should try posting this question in r/askdocs . At any rate, a JAK2 mutation test and EPO test are simple enough to rule out PV. (Both are blood tests.)", "What is your blood glucose vs plasma glucose?

My glucose was 115 (range is 65 to 99). Doctor is doing more tests thinking it could be pre-diabetes. Extremely terrified googling my labs and now discovering PV.  Do not google your lab results. \n\nYou are not dying\u2014and even if you were, you cannot know that by one CBC. \n\nIf you have pre-diabetes, it is very likely that this is causing your hematocrit to be high and cause you secondary polycythemia which will go away once the pre-diabetes is treated. It may also be indicative of a kidney disease. \n\nThey will likely do other tests before doing the JAK2 test because that is to rule out any secondary causes. They will probably do several tests before testing for the Jak2 mutation on a bone marrow biopsy.\n\nYou are not going to die. You are seeing a doctor, who is testing for other things. You are in a good place friend. Try not to worry yourself into something you have no control over. I know that is easier said than done . \n\nYou are going to be okay. Breathe I hate google. Thank you for the kind words! I am comforted knowing that if there is something actually wrong there is a community to fall back on. Thank you so much. Be calm, ofc. But Google having saved my life quality tremendously for almost a year now, I cannot whole heartedly agree about the do not Google. If you are out of range consistently, you are not prediabetic but diabetic. \n\nHave them check your insuline instead to be sure. (Is it called hema IR something?) We are going to work to find out. More tests next week! ", "Partner is going through PV diagnosis and needs insight. He is JAK2 negative but has had multiple test and it is not heart, lung, or sleep apnea related. Oncologist/hematologist wants to start him on hydroxyurea. Since he is JAK2 negative, would a bone marrow biopsy be the next test before chemo meds?  Yes.\nHydroxyurea is okay. I have been on it for two years and so far it is been the only thing to help with my headaches that I have had for well over a decade. \n\nIs it kidneys? Has your partner had an erythropoietin test? It is unlikely he or she has PV because of the absence of the JAK2 mutation-of course, I am not a doctor and more importantly I am not his doctor. Just someone diagnosed two years ago. My husband diagnosed with PV in May of this yr, jak2 positive, high bld hgb,hcrt, etc, he had bone marrow it was fine etc. he started on hydroxyurea, had hard time after couple weeks\u2026oncologist cut his dose in half an I started him on some supplements an today it is been over 4 months since he has needed a therapeutic phlebotomy\u2026dr is stunned an my husband feels grt\u2026I want a repeat jak2 as this supplement has done amazing things for others posting testimonials!! Are his bld levels Normal? If he is JAK2 negative, he must have a low EPO count AND a bone marrow biopsy positive for PV to be diagnosed with PV.\n\nIf those are negative, then he has Secondary Polycythemia. Sounds like they ruled out pulmonary causes. From what I hear, they usually then look into renal causes and do urinalysis and an ultrasound of the kidneys. His testosterone levels should be tested too. \n\n\n\nHere is the World Health Organization and the NCCN diagnostic criteria:\n\n\n\n\nJoin the Facebook secondary polycythemia group for better info on what testing should be done for that. \n His EPO levels is within normal range. I do not think testosterone levels have been checked yet. We will need to look more into the kidneys as well. We were just thrown for a loop when his Dr wanted to start him on Hydroxyurea without a clear diagnosis of primary PV. He is doing the therapeutic phlebotomy every two weeks which seems like the safer route before doing chemo meds. We are current trying to get a SO at Stanford since we are not too far from the Bay Area. A second opinion would not hurt. Make sure it is a doctor on this list:\n", "Curious how my experience compares to everyone elses? Hello,\n\nSo I have been diagnosed with PV since July of 2020 and after reading a some of the posts on here, I was curious what everyone is experiences have been regarding the first year of their diagnosis, how they compare with mine so far, and also get an idea of what I may expect in the near future. \n\nTLDR on bottom for those that do not want to read the entire post. (Do not blame you haha)\n\nHere is my story:\n\nI am currently 26 year old male, but was 25 at the time of diagnosis. \n\nIn October 2018 I got a new job as an engineer which required long hours and alot more physical labor than my old job. It was around that same time that I noticed I was feeling more and more exhausted but always attributed it to the recent job change. Through out the next year I felt continued to feel constantly exhausted and it was starting to affect my relationship since I was always too tired and wanted to rest so I would be ready for the next day of work. \n\nFast forward to January of 2020, I suffered a work injury to my shoulder. I have played hockey my whole life and have been hurt many times through out but never had anything serious that did not heal on its own so when my injury occured I thought the same would happen.\u00a0 By the time the end of February came around and was still experiencing shoulder issues I decided to bring it up to my pcp since I already had an appointment scheduled who referred me to see an orthopedic surgeon. Well before I had a chance to, covid shut everything down for months and it was not until late June that I was able to be seen. It was then that I found out I would probably need surgery and that I would need to get an MRI to confirm. One MRI later, I go for a follow up to go over the results, praying he was wrong and all I would need was some PT. \n\nWell turns out he was right and that surgery was required but that was not all. The MRI also showed that I had some bone marrow that was lit up like fire works on the up coming 4th of July. The doc said that it should not look like that at my age and although it was probably nothing, I should get a blood check taken to be safe. \n\nThat Sunday I got a call from the ortho surgeon telling me that I most likely had something called Polycythemia Vera which \"basically just means you will have to give blood more often than most people.\" This was (what I thought could be) the absolute worst news I could have heard cause I absolutely hate getting blood drawn. Something about having a needle inside the sensitive area in your elbow freaks me out.\u00a0 Anyways, he never mentioned that it was actually cancer, something that seems to be common from reading a few of the posts here, and the only thing that tipped me off was that he referred me to see an oncologist.Luckily my mother relatively higher-up in the Healthcare industry and was able to get me seen by a hemotologist on short notice.\u00a0 \n\nAfter some blood tests, turns out my blood levels were a bit high sitting at 24.7 Hemoglobin and 73.9 Hematocrit. The hemotologist sent out some samples to be gene tested to confirm the PV while I went to get my first of many phlebotomies. My Jak2 test ended up coming back negative but after further testing and with a bone marrow biopsy to confirm, I was positive for the Jak2 Exon 12 mutation and was officially diagnosed with PV.\n\nI ended up getting 3 phlebotomies week for about 6 weeks until my levels got to stable range at which I began receiving them less and less. At the end of August I had a phlebotomy and continued to get tested every 2 weeks without need for a phlebotomy until early December, however my hemotologist told me to forego it as I was cleared to finally have my shoulder surgery at the start of the new year and did not want my levels too low for it. \n\nAfter a successful surgery I went back to have my first phlebotomy in 6 months in early March at which my levels were around 18 hemoglobin and 54 hematocrit. I have another blood check and most likely a phlebotomy this Friday.\n\n\n\nI am not quite sure when it all started because I experienced a few symptoms in varying severity for years. The most notable ones for me were:\n\nBloodshot Eyes: People would constantly think I was high/smoking weed.\n\nItchy After Showers: Did not always occur so assumed maybe I did not wash all the soap off or something.\n\nHeavy Fatigue: Constantly tired and often had achey joints.\n\n\nOnce I started to receive phlebtomies and my levels started to lower, I was shocked how good I started to feel. I had never knew how bad I had gotten until the symptoms started to disappear. Eyes are super white now, only get itchy when it is been a long time since last phlebotomy (kind of my warning alarm now), and I have a alot more energy.\n\n\nAnyways, for those of you who read the entire wall of text, thanks for reading. I would love to hear your experiences from your first year and see the similarities or differences. If you have already made a post of your story and want to link it instead, even better.\n\nAlso, if anybody, especially those that are \"younger\" like me, needs some one to talk to that has recently gone through it or just wants to ask any questions, feel free to message me!\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: MRI of shoulder led to me finding out I had PV. Blood levels were Hgb(24.7) and Hct(73.9).  ~15 phlebotomies later down to one phleb every couple months. Symptoms of after shower itch, blood shot eyes, heavy fatigue among others. Alleviated once phlebotomies started. Hey, I have been diagnosed for I think around 5 years now. For the first year I actually had to have a phlebotomy around once a month after the initial rounds to lower my numbers. I honestly forget how many I had to do at the very start. Do not think 16yo me wanted to remember much of that lol\n\nFor the next few years I managed to get down to having a phlebotomy once every few months, but last year I started on Pegasys injections and I have only had to have a couple phlebotomies since, which has honestly made me feel much better about the future.\n\nAs for symptoms, I am lucky I suppose, in that I do not tend to feel any, even when my numbers are extremely high. The most I tend to feel is lots of itchiness out of warm showers, and a similar feeling in my feet if they are encased in something warm, like snowboots. I have had shortness of breath when things have gotten super bad too. Plus, I cannot handle cold temperatures either. idk if this is actually a common PV thing, but the reason I was diagnosed is my hands were turning ghost white at even the slightest hint of cold, and that did improve after all the phlebotomies and treatment so it was a symptom for me at least.\n\nThe idea of needles really freaked me out at the start. I was that one kid who had to be pinned down by multiple nurses just to get a flu shot when I was little, but I mean, it kind of became part of life, so I did manage to get used to it after a year or so. My rationale at some point became \"I survived a phlebotomy with my blood clotting as they tried to draw it, I can sure as hell survive a couple tubes\"\n\nOh gosh, did not mean to ramble on for so long. Hopefully something in there is helpful.\n\nEdit: I should probably add that my experiences were probably pretty influenced by the fact that I was a minor, since I was definitely handled with kid gloves a bit in retrospect, at least after the first doctor I saw told me I would die in a decade or less. For one, they did not ever tell me about the cancer bit, because yknow, that is a scary word I guess. Plus, the nurses loved fawning over me in pediatrics when I had to get phlebotomies and the like, which is a very different vibe to getting it all done in the adult departments in my experience. I was diagnosed at 27. I am 29 now. For years I struggled with migraines and at some point, my migraines went from episodic nightmares to chronic never ending migraines. Tension in all. \n\nFor years, I went to 4 neurologists, an ent, 4 family doctors  and two obgyns and I am convinced none of them did bloodwork because I do not remember. \n\nI kept seeing them  after the meds they gave me that they still did not work. Got the CT scans, the MRIs, and I had an EEG, no tumors. \n\n. \u201cSorry dear, you just have headaches. We do not know what else we can do for you.\u201d I tried Botox, and it just hurt and it was no fun. It did not work and my insurance did not want to pay for it. Honestly that was way worse than the blood draws. \n\nI cried. I was in excruciating daily headaches and no one seemed to care. I am like if you knew what I did every day in this much pain and if you felt even half as bad, I am sure you would be driving yourself crazy too.\n\nI called the suicide hotline more than once. I got told by my asshole doctor, that my headaches were \u201csomatic.\u201d And if I treated my depression maybe they would go away. I was pissed like \u201cfuck you dude. I am depressed because I have fucking migraines all the time not depression causing me migraines!\u201d \n\nEventually got put on nortiptaline. Hell of a drug. Took topamax and it made me so forgetful. So much of my cognitive function will never be the same. \n\nAnyway go for years with I am certain no bloodwork. We move to Maryland. Certain the new family doctor did not do blood work either. I never thought of anything of it because I did not realize they are supposed to routinely do blood work. And got on an antidepressant because I was so stressed out about my job. Got some benzos. Small quantity. Antidepressants were why I went to the family doctor. I felt less anxious but still always had freaking headaches. I just got used to living with headaches at that point. \n\nGot a new job and I was sharing with a coworker and she told me about this dentist in Bethesda and I called the office and saw the other doctor in the office who specialized in migraines. \n\nThe first doctor who said \u201cgood lord I can see why you are in so much pain your neck is like ridiculously tight.\u201d \n\nHe gave me a muscle relaxer and gave me a nerve block in my neck and then said \u201clisten I am glad this works, but I do not take your insurance. So I am going to send you to GWU hospital in DC and see the guy who wrote the scientific paper on nerve blocks. My daughters go to him. He is the best. \u201c Took three months to see him. And they set me up with a CGRP. Life changing, headaches were not as bad, still living with pretty bad headaches but worlds better than before. \n\nThen, had to switch family doctors in md because the other one just had horrible time management skills and I kid you not, you would be at the office waiting with an appointment for freaking 4 hours. \n\nSo found another doctor, scheduled a physical. She did bloodwork and called me the next day. Honestly i thought I forgot to fill out paperwork or something. Pick up and it is the doctor not the office staff.\n\nShe goes your platelet count is really high. It is not normal . They are supposed to be 400,000. Yours are over a million. She repeated the test. Still high. Sends me to a hematologist. \n\nGo through no diagnosis for a few months. Testing blood. Hematologist says she is seen what I have but not in someone so young. Have the bone marrow biopsy. Comes back with PV presenting as essential thrombocythemia. She says \u201cI do not know what to do, so I am going to send you up to the university of Maryland and see this doctor, since they have probably seen this before in someone your age.\u201d God bless my husband he took me to all these appointments. \n\nThen it is around November now and go to university of Maryland. Doctor tells me I should start taking Hydroxyurea. I was afraid to and annoyed because we were going to Georgia. \n\nDid not notice but for some reasons it was like my headaches were almost gone. Kept going back to the hematologist to get blood checks then covid hit and we were doing telemedicine visits but she was not having me go to a lab or her office but collecting my copay. \n\nThen up until about March I was on interferon. Did not really do much. Doctor non responsive when I had questions injecting myself with a needle. \n\nSo I decided to switch hematologists and they were actually seeing patients. They were honest with me that they also have never seen this before in someone so new. \n\nAnd then they just did bloodwork every other week and we try Pegasys and it was like 4000 a dose. After taking Pegasys and not hu, I was still having bad headaches. But my counts went down with hu. To almost normal. Pegasys made my liver enzymes go high. Consulted with university of md doctor and she says do Hydroxyurea if you respond well to it. \n\nNo problems since. Migraines are not really here and more. Whoa, I was also in Maryland when I got diagnosed. Ended up at John's Hopkins, but I got the same deal with the whole \"never seen someone your age\" at wherever I would first gone. I do not remember where that was since I was 16, and therefore most definitely not in charge of handling any of the logistics at the time.\n\nI am currently on Pegasys, which is going well. One doctor wanted me to start on Hydroxyurea but my parents and I both were concerned about it, since from what we would heard it sounded like it would be really unpleasant. I am glad it is working for you though, and I hope it is not as bad as I have heard. Thanks for reading my novel. \n\nI appreciate it. I mean idk Hydroxyurea makes me feel better and not having a constant migraine but I really do not know what to do when I do not want to be on this. But I do not know what else to do.\n\nI have never had a phlebotomy. But I am not afraid of needles.\nI do not mind them. Honestly, before joining this sub fairly recently I never really heard anyone's stories besides my own, so I am always interested to know. A bit selfish I suppose, but it makes me feel less like I am dealing with all this on my own, especially since, like it seems quite a few people on here, I am kind of on the lower end for PV agewise.\n\nGlad it makes you feel better for sure, constant migranes sound like hell. I get the feeling of not knowing what else to do, you are definitely not alone in that. Honestly, that feeling might just be the worst.\n\nI am actually impressed you managed to not have any phlebotomies, wow. That was pretty much the first thing my doctor had me do and I had to have a bunch in a row right off the bat. Unlike you, I was terrified of needles, so I spent the entire time buried in Netflix or a book so I would not panic. Kudos for not being afraid of those things, I have had to be poked at least once every week for 5 years and I still dislike them greatly. My husband does not do needles. He is lucky he does not have PV. I mean I do not have a high hematocrit or hemoglobin so I guess phlebotomy does not really do that.\n\nI hate the Facebook groups because it is a bunch of old people in their 40s and up constantly asking if their blood work is normal or if they can have xyz or whatever or if they think their old person ailment is related to PV or how they are asking how they think they got the gene mutation. It is like no, radiation did not cause it, exposure to agent orange did not cause it, inhaling noxious gases when you were younger did not cause it. And these people constantly whine about how much pain they are in. There is no evidence that any of those things caused the JAK2 mutation.  That perpetual victim hood is so prominent on FB and on Reddit. Not this sub though. \n\nWe had a laugh the other day on this sub about how we ALL hate the Facebook groups.  \n\nWhen I was diagnosed, it took me probably 2-5 months to like be okay with it. Nobody called it cancer because they did not want to scare me, but a quick google search will tell you it is cancer. I had to go back and check, since I am rubbish at remembering usernames, but yeah, I remember that thread. Is not something about screw the Facebook groups even in the sub description? I dislike Facebook in general tbh\n\nYeah, I do not really remember how long it took me. It certainly did not help that one of the staff at the school I moved to post-diagnosis (unrelated to said diagnosis though, my family just moved) had PV as well and then just went and died later that year, which freaked me out even more. I feel like it took me a good year to really come to terms with PV. It is definitely a good thing no one around me called it cancer for a while, that would have probably made things worse.\n\nI will say though, one good thing to come from this ordeal was my interest in linguistics, which I am now majoring in, because I had way too much free time after the bone marrow biopsy. Silver linings I suppose lol What were ur epo levels please I apologize, I do not have that value atm. The values I provided in my post were from my blood test right after receiving my MRI results and does not appear to have the EPO value as I do not believe they are usually checked unless specifically requested.\n\nThat being said, I do remember my hemotologist saying they were extremely low/non-existence when he had them checked. This was one of the reasons he was still convinced it was PV even after the initial Jak2 test came back negative since \"all signs pointed to it being PV.\"\n\nIf you are still interested, I can try to ask what it was when I go there this friday. Haha I have definitely gotten a bit more used to them. Now the tiny needles from the blood draws do not bother me much. Still cannot stand the bigger ones they use for the actual phlebotomy.  I actually use something called EMLA cream which is a topical anesthetic cause it bother me so much.  It is not the pain that bothers me tho, it is just the idea/image of having the rigid needle in that spot lol. \n\nIt also did not help that my first phlebotomy took 90 minutes to complete haha. That was a rough day to say the least. Came out of there looking like Swiss cheese between the number of blood tests and bruising that occurred. \n\nShots bothered me as a kid as well but Im not to phased by them anymore, even before the diagnoses. Was just diagnosed. In February i was hospitalized for mono, and my HGB was 19 and HCT 65. Hematology thought it was reactive to mono so told to return to PCP for repeat labs 8 weeks later To make sure things normalizes. 8 weeks later i was feeling all better but labs showed same levels. Returned to hematology, i was negative for JAK2 V617 but positive for exon 12. EPO was tested 3 times (2, 1.9 and 16). Had BMB done and PV diagnosis confirmed at age 31. Have done 8 weekly phlebotomies and now HCT down to 42.8.\n\nMy worst symptom is episodes of redness swelling in feet, and sometimes hands. I have seen slight improvement since phlebotomy but the issue persists.\n\nBesides that, i had constant red eyes which have cleared up 100%. Also used to get ~monthly ocular migraines which have stopped too. No more headaches either. \n\nStill have joint pain and sometimes bone pain which seems to be attributed to PV.", "Sudden onset of intense itching I was diagnosed with PV in July. I did not have any symptoms, until this week. A couple of days ago I got extremely itchy, mostly legs and arms, after a warm shower. This morning I took a shower that was cooler (although, not actually cool water, more like lukewarm) and am crazy itchy right now. Took 2 Benadryls but they have not kicked in. My questions for the group:\n\n\\*Does anyone else have the experience of the itching suddenly showing up out of nowhere? Wondering if there is something I am doing that triggered it (i have always taken hot baths and showers without itching).\n\n\\*Any tips for managing it besides antihistamines? \n\n\\*The LLS cites as a remedy \"Light therapy (phototherapy) using a medicine called psoralen combined with ultraviolet A (UVA) light\" does anyone have any experience with this?\n\nThanks for any info! Yes. I usually put cortisone cream on the itches and also I do not dress immediately after getting out of the shower and walk around in a robe until my body naturally dries off. The treatment I have heard used the most is claritin or zyrtec plus famotidine (pepcid) Beta-alanine , I take it 45 minutes before I shower. If I do not take it I am itchy for 1-2 hours. The itch is on the inside, not topical. It is caused by over production of bad blood cells which release histamine.\n\nI also get itchy going from hot outside temp to air conditioning, so it is not just showers for me, any temperature swings.\n\nGood luck! thank you for this information! just looked for this, is there a brand you recommend? i hate how we all know some brands of supplements are fake, it makes it paralyzing to choose one. I got the \u201cnow foods\u201d  or \u201cnow sports\u201d capsule, 120 count. They sell a 2 pack on Amazon for $29. I know other people use the powder form but the capsule works well for me.

Other relevant info- I am a type 1 diabetic (poorly controlled right now) and have moderate sleep apnea. \n\nThanks for your time! Sleep apnea is a major cause of secondary polycythemia. If you are JAK2 negative, you more than likely do not have PV. If you treat the sleep apnea, typically polycythemia will go away. I guess I will be seeing the sleep\nSpecialist! I thought sleep apnea would cause high eos though? I do not know what eos is. If you read up on secondary polycythemia you will see sleep apnea and obesity can cause it Was your EPO level done? If that is normal/high, you likely do not have PV. If it is low, you need a bone marrow biopsy to definitively rule out PV. Most likely it is secondary polycythemia which has many causes: sleep apnea, lung disease, smoking, high altitude, high testosterone levels, kidney disease/cysts/tumors, and more. Your hematologist will have to rule those out as well. I meant EPO in my original post, I had it done- it was normal (7). I guess I now have to be paranoid about what may be causing the secondary polycythemia Do you know if polycythemia can effect the shape of the blood cells? I do not think so. It does change the size of megakarocytes (the cells in bone marrow that make platelets) but this would not be seen in a CBC, only a BMB.  Anemia, however, does change the shape of RBCs. Yeah, it is probably secondary then. The good news with secondary is that once the cause is addressed, your blood counts will return to normal. You mentioned you are type 1 diabetic and poorly controlled.  Have you had your kidney function checked?  As funkygrrl mentioned, secondary polycythemia (also referred to as erythrocytosis) can be caused by kidney disease.  Good luck! Yes, thankfully my kidney numbers are also numbers. Fingers crossed that it stays that way! I am unlucky in that my EPO is suppressed but all of the genetic tests came back clear. The bone marrow biopsy was also clear, which I assumed was absolutely conclusive but apparently is not, just based on a standard expected range for your age group. No point doing another one to see if anything has changed until 5 years after the first one. So technically my diagnosis is idiopathic erythrocytosis, but managed with phlebotomy in the same way as PV. Interesting! If you do Facebook, I recommend the group for secondary, erythrocytosis, and undiagnosed.   Thanks!", "Yet to Diagnose(Need Advice) I am 26 Male, From the past 3 years, my Haemoglobin was fluctuating around 16.9 to 17.6. Recently I had diarrhea with dehydration which lasted for 2 weeks and when my blood test was done, my Haemoglobin was 18.8 and Ferritin level was 53%. \n\nLast year I took Acid reflux tablets and this caused a side effect of B12 deficiency which made the doctor to give 13 doses of B12 shots, and also take Folic acid tablets for 3 months! \n\nI have now moved to another country and I have my appointment with Haematologist in the next 3 weeks. I do suffer from Insomnia from many years and I wake up in the night literally everyday for peeing. I have also been told on several occasions by my friends that I keep my mouth open unconsciously and I am YET TO get diagnosed for SLEEP APNEA.\n\nFrom the last 1 year I had Tingling/burning/needles sensation in my hands, feet and other parts of my body and doctor was not sure whether its because of B12 deficiency or Polycythemia.  When I got B12 shots, after each shot I felt better. \n\nMy symptoms returned back in the last 4 months and I this is why I have decided to go to a Blood specialist?\n\nAs I do not have much idea about this Blood disorder,  I wanted to know what are things that I need know beforehand, before having the appointment with the Blood specialist. Do you think taking these Folic acid tablets may  have further spiked the Hamelglobin? \n\nI am bit scared about this as I have read a lot about this on the internet and sometimes I feel so depressed. Symptoms exist but are non-specific so not useful for diagnosing. PV also cannot be diagnosed by blood counts alone.\n\n\nPolycythemia vera is a rare blood cancer caused by an acquired genetic mutation in the bone marrow stem cell. The test for this is the JAK2 mutation test. 95% of people with PV are positive for the JAK2 mutation. The other blood test that is important is the EPO (erythropoetin) test. In people with PV, EPO is low. Most people with PV also get a bone marrow biopsy which is definitive. \n\n\nSecondary Polycythemia is not cancer and not caused by a stem cell mutation. There are many potential causes, but they are usually pulmonary (sleep apnea, smoking, high altitude, COPD, etc), renal (kidney disease, cysts, etc) or other things like high testosterone or anemia. In most cases, once the cause is found and treated, the high blood counts resolve. Is it possible to have JAK2 negative and still have PV? My HB floated around 18.5 for 4 years and no body cared until I had trouble with heart beat. My HCT is 53%. After couple of phlebotomies it is down to 14.5 and HCT is 45%. I am feeling extremely weak now, I cannot focus at all maybe because my iron level is lower than referenced ranges? Yes, 5% of those with PV are JAK2 negative. However, in order to be diagnosed with PV when you are JAK2 negative, you must have both a bone marrow biopsy positive for PV AND a low EPO (erythropoetin) level. Here is the diagnostic criteria: \n\n\n\nWhen PV is treated with phlebs, it will drive your ferritin levels down and they should be kept at a lower than normal level in order to keep your counts down. Sometimes phlebotomy also drives your platelet count up. Has your doctor tested you for Hereditary Hemochromatosis? Sometimes high levels of ferritin and or iron can cause high hemoglobin levels as well as the tingling sensations in your limbs. Actually, a lot of the symptoms of HH and PV can overlap one another. If your iron saturation levels were high before you became dehydrated, that is something to discuss during your visit with the hematologist.", "New to Group Hello,\n\nI know a lot of people would say 2020 was the worst year in a while, but for me it was 2021. I will explain:\n\nI was diagnosed with Polycythemia secondary to CHIP when I was 28 (I am now 32). My hematologist is against diagnosing me with full blown PV due to the percentage of my JACK2 mutation although it is still present and increases year after year. \n\nWhen we started treatment, I did notice a significant increase to my quality of life. I was able to enjoy showers for the first time, I was more alert, had more energy, stopped having long drawn out headaches, and just felt better. I could tell when my HMCT was getting high as I would start with headaches, than have fatigue, and then the itching would start.\n\nI was having to have phlebotomies ever 3 to 6 weeks.\n\nIn January of this year, I had an ache in the upper right quadrant of my abdomen. Doctors at first thought it was my gull bladder, so they did the work up. Turned out I had a fatty liver. During their diagnostic procedures, they did an endoscopy as well and found that my duodenum had total atrophy of its villi. So as well as a fatty liver, I was diagnosed with celiac disease as well. To cure the liver, lose weight (started the year at 300 lbs, now down to 240 and the liver feels great). Now I am on a gluten free diet as well.\n\nWhile treating the liver with diet and weight loss, treating the celiac with 0 gluten, and having phlebotomies every 3-6 weeks another issue arose. My iron and ferritin levels tanked.\n\nWe were not regularly checking my iron levels as they had always been on the low end of the normal scale. But around may of this year I started feeling brain dead and they decided to check. At that point my ferritin was 5 and my serum iron was 22. RBC, HMGB and HMTC still higher, but what do we do. They take blood they take my iron, they give me iron, my levels increase even more. So we have been trying phlebotomy followed immediately by an iron transfusion. \n\nI was offered hydroxyurea, but the long term effect for somebody my age turns me off of the meds until I get older. I have not felt good all year. It gets tiring. Even though we are trying to manage the lack of iron and surplus of blood, we have not quite figured the balance out. I feel like I am to young to feel the way I do.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to put my story out there to help me cope. Thanks for anybody who enjoys the read. Why is everyone so against Hydroxyurea? I mean I was hesitant at first, but I did not have much of a choice. I am 29, diagnosed at 27. I have similar symptoms, especially with the headaches. The headaches have been better since I have been taking Hydroxyurea. I tolerated it well. \n\nI tried Pegasys and it made my liver enzymes too high.  Still trying to find the right med for me since I am 29. Long term use of hydroxyuria can lead to leukemia. I am a father of 2 and would like to avoid that if possible. I am not against it when I am older, but at my age I would prefer to avoid long term use of it. According to my MPN specialist she said that can happen regardless, using it or not.\n\nAlso, no one is suggesting to use it long term. Using it for a bit until you find something else is ok\n\nI am not really into using it so much right now, myself but I have not found something else.\n\nBut open to suggestions\u2026 At your age, I am surprised they do not treat you solely with phlebotomies? Does your PV affect primarily platelets, or RBCs? My platelets are only mildly affected. Why are you looking to switch medications if this one works for you and you do not have any concerns over long term side affects? My pv affects mostly my platelets. Untreated, I had over 1 million platelets, apparently phlebotomies make your platelet count go up which is why I am not being treated that way. \n\nI still do have concerns over using hu in the long term, although two of my doctors have told me that sickle cell patients take it for the rest of their lives. \n\nI am not saying I have zero concerns, about the drug, because I too have read that stat you shared about how it can morph into leukemia and this drug just keeps my levels like not clot worthy. Personally I would rather do something too and would not choose hu as my ultimate treatment, but few things have helped my headaches and hu has\n\nI tolerate it well, but I am young and they are concerned about me having kids. Which I personally am on the fence about. Yeah, sorry to hear about your struggles. On the fence about having kids due to the PV or the hu? Have you ever considered adoption? I know some people are against it. My wife and I struggled to have our first, and would have adopted if we could not, and the consideration never leaves our thoughts as after our second we could not have anymore. Sorry to get off topic. I have considered adoption even before I was diagnosed with Pv. Yes. Very much so and there is nothing wrong with it. I completely agree. Rewarding in its own right giving kids a loving home, even if they biologically are not yours, is the greatest thing people can do Why has not your doctor done a bone marrow biopsy? You cannot diagnose based on blood counts and JAK2 test alone. Are you seeing an MPN specialist? \n Sorry, yes, have had a bmb, which was normal. Like I said, not diagnosed with PV but polycythemia secondary to CHIP. We do not have MPN specialists in Iowa, however my hematologist does consult them at Mayo in Minnesota. Ah, sorry I missed that. If you do Facebook, there is a good private group for secondary. The treatment and blood count targets differ quite a bit from PV, so I suggest posting this in that group.    \n Also, in case you do not do Facebook, here is their stickied post:\n\n\nALL MEMBERS MUST READ \n\nPlease, please, please keep in mind that this group is for secondary polycythemia and not for polycythemia vera. We need to be careful when telling people the HCT needs to be under 42-45 like in PV because in most cases of secondary this is not true and could be dangerous. The treatment is different and the risks are different. Secondary is caused from an underlying condition and the underlying condition needs to be found and treated and not necessarily the red counts themselves. Secondary polycythemia is not PV, is not a MPN and is not cancer. It is something that can possibly be cured depending on the cause. The clot risk is not the same in secondary as in PV so phlebotomies are usually not used until the HCT is over 51-52 and that is if the red counts are treated at all. In secondary there are more red blood cells circulating to compensate for the underlying condition. The bone marrow is not affected and is not over producing like in PV. The body needs these extra cells. Phlebotomies can actually make secondary cases worse if you are not careful and can actually be dangerous sometimes. Phlebotomies can drive the counts higher, can cause unnecessary iron deficiency that can be dangerous and in turn cause more symptoms like fatigue and headaches. The body needs these extra cells and taking them away can make it harder for the body to work. Usually in secondary there is not a different HCT target like in PV men and women. Studies have shown that the HCT does not have the same risk of clots in secondary as in PV.  The clot risk is believed to lie in the underlying condition or other risk factors and not because of the increased HCT so this means people who are smokers, overweight or have something else that increases the risk of clots. Phlebotomies also drive the platelets higher and could cause a higher risk of clots. This is why it is extremely important 1) that you have a correct diagnosis 2) you find the underlying cause so it can be treated and 3) have a doctor who understands the difference between PV and secondary polycythemia.Keep in mind that the normal HCT range is usually up to 50-51. In some secondary cases, like certain heart conditions, the HCT might be up to 62 before being treated. It is not always possible to find the underlying cause but do not give up because it is the best way to treat secondary. This is also why most doctors who are knowledgeable will not do phlebotomies until that have confirmed or ruled out PV. Also please remember that the medications that are used to treat PV should never be used to treat secondary so this is also another important reason why we need to advocate for ourselves and know how to be correctly diagnosed and treated. &gt;HU\n\nDoes anyone know the % chance of HU leading to leukemia? Been trying to research that but have not found the specific odds. Thanks.", "New to PCV sub I have read through several of the messages. Was looking to see if anyone has had any success with the vaccine having PCV? If so what kind and any side effects? I work for a large company and have not due to PCV. Obviously I would talk to your doctor first to make sure they do not have any concerns (very very unlikely). However keep in mind that the potential side effects the vaccine can cause including the extremely rare ones are far far far more likely to occur just by getting covid. There is a lot of scare about the vaccines causing blood clots, but it is very rare and waaaaay more likely to happen just from getting covid. \n\nI got the Pfizer vaccine. After the second shot I had fever, chills, body aches for about a day. After that I had pretty bad migraines for about 4-5 days and some nausea. Hi.  \n\nI am fully vaccinated.  One of the biggest reasons I decided to get the shot is our blood tends to be thick already and Covid can also cause blood to be thick.  Normally that happens in severe Covid cases.  So I could see a huge problem with getting sick.  I knew with getting sick I could have a heart attack, stroke or getting a blood clot.  \n\nThe shots were easy.  The 2nd one was a kick in the pants. I felt like shit for a day and then I was fine.\n\nUnfortunately I did end up getting the Delta variant.  My symptoms are very mild.  I lost my sense of smell and taste.  A mild headache and I was congested.  My brother in law did not get the vaccine.  He is in better shape than me and he is not doing too well.  We honestly do not know if he is going to make it.  \n\nI highly recommend getting the shot.  Mine was Pfizer. I was told to get the vaccine as soon as it was available.\n\nI felt like shit a day after the vaccine. Sore arm, achy, bad headache. But I survived. Thanks for all the great feedback. I have talked to my Dr and my specialist and since I work from home neither pushed either way as I have made a point to research. and that was several months ago I see them both again soon and will discuss again. Knowing what you know now. This far into the pandemic would you still make the same decision? Thank you for sharing with me. Absolutely", "New diagnosis, trying not to freak out. Received a preliminary diagnosis of Polycythemia a few weeks ago, waiting on my hematologist appointment scheduled for the 20th. Late 30s male, relatively normal medical history. Hemoglobin at 18.5 or higher on three tests, Hematocrit at 55 or higher, MCV at 98 or higher, MCH at 35 or higher. \n\n\n\nDespite the username, I have very little idea of what any of that means outside of my doctor telling me that this is pretty serious and I need a referral to a hematologist. Then my doctor went on vacation for three weeks without filling out any of the referral information. So, I have been left to be a big bundle of nerves for almost a month now. \n\n\n\n\nI am not feeling any symptoms that are generally ascribed to this, so I am not entirely sure what to do or how to feel. It is just I have got this dropped on me in the middle of buying my first home and it is just a few too many life-altering things happening at once.\n\n\n\nIf there is any link or site or pamphlet or catchy jingle someone can send along to try and help me out, I am all ears. Alright there is nothing to freak out about yet and here is why.\n \nPolycythemia Vera is different than polycythemia. PCV is primary and is usually caused by the JAK2 gene mutation. This is permanent. \n\nPC can be secondary and this means that it is caused by something else such as sleep apnea, and many other causes. Look them up I cannot remember them all right now, but the point is, PC is a SIDE EFFECT of a different problem. Once the main problem is treated it will go away. \n\nThere is not a doctor at your doctors office that can fill out a referral form? Or a nurse or office admin? Just ask them to. If your insurance does not require it, just call around to a few hematologists that you can check in with. \n\nI did have symptoms of PCV and I did not even know it. \n\nPCV is due to a gene mutation the majority of the time. Your hematocrit does seem high and the other numbers do not seem out of the ordinary to me but I am not a doctor and I have not seen your blood work. Thank you. I needed to be talked off the ledge a bit. \n\n\n\nI finally got the hematologist appointment after multiple tries, but it took the hematologist's office literally walking to the doctor's office down the block to get the records. \n\n\n\nAll the blood test numbers are highlighted in yellow as HIGH on my results, which is why I mentioned them. I am hoping when I have the appointment, I find out it is a secondary case caused by something else. My issue is I do not appear to have any other underlying cause, so I am hopeful whatever is triggering this is not somehow worse. You do not know yet so just do not get on google and freak out. Even if you are diagnosed with PV, just remind yourself its not a death sentence. From the sounds of it you were lucky enough like I was to find out about the condition without having to go through a cardiac event in the process like many do, and trust me, that is a very good thing!\n\nI am currently 26 and have just passed my 1 year anniversary since being diagnosed. You can find a post of mine some ways down where I detailed my experience with it (and other peoples experiences as well). May be worth a read to give you an idea that you are not alone in this. Many of us know exactly how you are feeling and went through it ourselves and we are still around living full lives. The way you are feeling will get better no matter. If you do start undergoing treatments you may realize that you do have some of the symptoms without even knowing since they will start to be alleviated, causing you to feel better and more energetic! \n\nAlso important to remember that medicine is constantly evolving. A lot of research has been done into PV recently as a result of the coronavirus due to them sharing a lot of the same symptoms when it comes down to blood clotting. My uncle passed away from Leukemia some 30 years or so ago, before I was born. If he were to be diagnosed today, they would actually be able to treat the type of Leukemia he had which goes to show how fast medicine is advancing. Sorry to hear about your diagnosis but try not to stress.\n\nI am late 20's and got diagnosed with PCV in my mid 20's. Freaked out for a bit, all the literature and online searching spooked me as it is sometimes classified as a type of blood cancer, made out to be quite serious. Over time though i have learnt how it is a very manageable condition and can honestly say it has not impacted my lifestyle or stopped me doing anything\n\nIf anything I am probably healthier now than ever before and get more checkups and bloodtests than the average joe! \n\nThe following snippet from the NHS website gives some good context:\n\n\"Many cases are mild and may not lead to any further complications. However, some cases \u2013 particularly cases of PV \u2013 can be more serious and require long-term treatment.\n\nIf well controlled, polycythaemia should not affect your life expectancy, and you should be able to live a normal life.\"\n\n\n\nMessage me if you have any questions or want to talk.", "What tests should I do to rule out/confirm and what immediate life style changes if any? 30 years old, lot of bruises, been to ER twice lately for a week of high blood pressure, pins in my feet and sudden \"stinging\" at random spots all over my body. \n\nSo: I need some help with what to get my doc to test and if there is anything I can do on my own?\n\nChecked my blood work online minutes ago and found out my erytrocytes are slightly outside of the reference values. No mention of this from anyone treating me, so maybe it is nothing, but let us say I am a bit tired of simply waiting around to get put on blood pressure medication/get basically told it is all in my head.\n\nAdditional background: \n\nRestless legs, insomnia and walking pain for years. My docs have given me melatonin and imovane for my sleep for a long time, other than that treated me as a hypochondriac. Eye twitching and stutters, lot of brainfog from the insomnia.\n\nRecently got IBS diagnose due to a weird combination of constipation and diarhea, pain and feeling sick all the time. Cannot break down most foods properly.\n\nAnother doc (I have seen many) a few months after the first ER confirms I have some hypertensive and unusually high pulse episodes in a 24 hour window of measurement. If I am lucky I might get to see a dietitian again, otherwise they already mentioned bp lowering meds and I have heard a lot of \"you are sooo young\" which I unfortunately look too. Anything slightly out of normal range is not any red flag. I can sympathize with you with the \u201cwhile you are so young, lose weight, you are depressed and once you are not depressed it will go away.\u201d \n\nAlso been treated like a hypochondriac for many years with constant getting worse debilitating migraines. All your tests are normal. So you must just be pain sensitive. \n\nI am certain within maybe what 10 years? I saw probably 14 doctors and not a single one of them ever did bloodwork. If they ran it, I do not remember but I am pretty sure I did not even know it was normal to have blood work every year because I was definitely not doing it.\n\nI was told that my migraines were somatic and if I got treated For my depression the migraines would lessen. That was 2015. I had had migraines since I was like 16. Then on a regular CBC, platelet count abnormally high. You are supposed to have 400,000 or something and I had over 1 million.\n\nI am convinced I was undiagnosed for all those tears being treated like a hypochondriac. \n\nBut if you do not consistently have abnormal bloodwork, I do not think it is Pv.\n\nCGRPS and Hydroxyurea changed my daily debilitating headaches. It feels so liberating finally having a diagnosis like it all makes sense now Thank you for your answer.\n\nI am digging further. It does not appear to be a typical varicose vein issue at least, had that checked. It could be arterial, in which case I am already doing what I can by exercising and adjusting diet based on what science I have come to know over the years. (not overweight)\n\nMy leg veins are growing still. My left hand veins are huge compared to right, so this led me to take my blood pressure side to side. It shows a 23 point difference, which apparently is not great. Will monitor this over time until I can say for sure it will be there when a physician finally is available to me again. If so, I might bring it up with reference sources it is indicative of an issue.\n\nRandom bruising appear to have stopped for now. I acquired some skin level rash or other irritation that looks like it could be shingles, which the physician suggested but test came back negative. It is not shingle she wrote me. Good luck. It has not gotten any worse for weeks at least.\n\nI have had plenty regular tests done over the years but nothing all that specific. Now looking for any semiprivate options left on the largely regulated local market. I am getting nowhere with the public system. I am fed up with these well wishing amateurs frankly. Time to get more serious than they are.\n\nA few days ago had the feeling of cold water running down outside of my  leg. This I am reading could be indicative of an issue with the spine. But then again, that is just something I read from an authoritive source. It is not an actual diagnosis anyone has made. At what point do I dare bring it up without being labeled the village idiot yet again? Physia therapist has honestly been useless and I have to go there or else the doc is not having me back. The cat scan or xray she sent for at an earlier point was rejected because of my low age. What can I say, do not move to Europe for health care reasons.\n\nHope you get better.", "Treatment and Iron levels Hi,\nI started treatment for my PV back in January and my levels have had a hard time going down but it has gone down.  I am no longer in the 60's and now I am in the high 40's.  So we decided to change treatment from every 2 weeks to every 4 weeks.\n\nWell my symptoms last week got pretty bad.  I was super sluggish and and had some bad headaches.  Both are signs I need to see my doctor to get treatment.  Well they did their blood test and my levels where 48 (not bad) which was a surprise because I felt far worse.\n\nThat is when the doctor said that I have \"full blown\" (his words) iron deficiency anemia and that is why I feel like shit.  I started on my iron supplements and have been taking them as directed. I still feel like dog shit and I guess the symptoms last for several weeks.\n\nWhat do you all do to keep your iron levels up while doing treatment.  I have the chronic version of PV so I will be doing treatment for a bit.  This is something I need to adapt to so I would figured I would ask for some advice. I am very new to this. What is your treatment? Blood wasting.  They take about 500 cc / 1 liter of blood to reduce the red blood cell count.\n\nThus the problem. Thanks. I am worried about that form of treatment. How long does a session take?\n\nI have been severely anemic in the past. Pills made me so sick. Eventually my doc did iron shots. Honestly, that was preferable for me. The actual treatment is around 15-30 mins.  But it is a whole day thing. Here is how my day looks like when I get treatment.\n\nArrive at the doctor's and get checked in\n\nWait 10-15 mins till they call me then we go into the treatment room and get an iv started and do my blood draws.\n\nThen I go out and wait another hour for test results.\n\nAfter the hour has passed I meet up with my doctor and we go over the numbers and see if I need treatment.  If so I will then go into the treatment room and wait for another 20 mins then they start draining me.\n\nThen after they have pulled the 1 liter of blood I wait another 30 mins and they give me fluids.  Afterwards to go home and try to eat something.\n\nAll in all it takes about 4ish hours from start to finish.  Sometimes I can speed up the blood wasting process if I pop an aspirin.  But it really does not speed the whole process up because they will make me wait anyways and give me fluids. I am sorry, this sounds awful to me. I get remicade infusions every 6 weeks, and that only takes an hour and a half start to walking out the door. A full 4 hours? I do not think my back could take that in the usual chemo chair. I did not realize they did the IV for that at the same time, but it makes sense.", "Might be living with Polycythemia Secondary 2021 is literally worst year of my life. I started having stomach trouble like extreme gas and then consulted several  doctors but no joy. I chased down the stomach issues for 6 months and still no joy. \n\nAfter that I started having weird troubles like walking in the sun and having fast heart beat and feeling like passing out especially in sun. Felt very very fragile and weak. Difficultly exercising, gas problems and increased thirst. \n\nSuddenly my heart doctor, who helped me with my SVT that got ablation in 2018 saw my hands and they thought they are more red than usual. After blood tests I got an 18.5 hb + 54% HCT. I was asked to consult with hematologist. \n\n\nMy hematologist is a well reputed man with 35 years of experience and he ordered a JAK2 and Erythropoietin tests. My JAK2 came negative and  Erythropoietin came 10.9 mIU/mL. He thinks I do not need to go further with bone marrow test. After a couple of phlebotomies my HB is down to 14 and HCT to 43. I feel a lot better, my heart does not go berserk like before. I suppose I have Polycythemia secondary and my underlying reason is still undiscovered? \n\nI am posting this to seek help from other Polycythemia carriers to help me diagnose my underlying disease. I am a 28 year old software guy who works hourly and is sole supporter of the family. My daily life and work life is halted because of all this. I am depressed and stressed. After the phlebotomies, I am feeling extremely weak, pain in joins especially lower back, my serum urea is elevated to 8.3 too. I am feeling disoriented all the time and not able to work. I suppose this is because of iron deficiency? I have no stamina at all. \n\nAny words or wisdom will do. Thanks guys! I recommend this Facebook group for secondary.

The first doctor that diagnosed me told me I would most likely die within the decade. Plus banned me from going to a sleep-over college science program that summer, playing all the sports I enjoyed, and traveling in general, among other things. She must have expected me to just sit around the house depressed until I died. I got a more experienced doctor, and have a great treatment plan, but when I hit 10 years I am definitely going to have a fuck you party for the first one because that really did fuck me up for a few years.\n\nCongrats on still being alive! It is nice to know that there is other people diagnosed relatively young who have lived for longer than doctors thought. May I ask when you first started the phlebotomies did they wipe you for more that 2 weeks? \n\nI am still working with my hematologist who initially thought it was secondary polycythemia, because I responded to sleep apnea therapy for about 6 months with the borderline hematocrit &amp; hemoglobin levels, that changed on 04/06/21 and I am negative on the JAK gene, but he has seen patients have it without the gene but it is very rare, so next step is bone marrow extraction. At the beginning I was weekly for I think, two months, then monthly for like, 12yrd, then every two months, as I was not able recover enough at every month. This year I have switched to every 3 months, and last month my levels were good enough to not need one. It was a week recovery for a while, but got longer and longer. \n\nI am horrible with my bloodwork, but I am starting to take better care of myself.\n\nI had a bone marrow biopsy, negative. Never had the genetic test. My hematologist says I have \"clinical polycythemia\". I was originally diagnosed with secondary polycythemia as well. I was told 20yrs to start, then a few years later they told me 7-10 because I am big, hence the party.\n\nI was the youngest ever when I was diagnosed, they were sending my bloodwork globally to specialists and such. Oh wow, dealing with PV while knowing that you are a bit in uncharted territory like that seems absolutely hellish.\n\nI think that the reason my first doctor had such a depressing lifespan estimate right off the bat is I was the first young person she would seen with PV. I do not remember exactly how old her patients typically were, but I think it was around 70 or something, so she was a little out of her element having to make guesses about how it would affect a teenager's lifespan. We started end of 2019 every 6 weeks, 2020 lost my job as I could barely function. By summer 2020 I had cancel appointments because I just could not get to the doctors, when I did my ferritin was so low he decided to move appointments to 8 week intervals. \n\nI consider myself very lucky medications, foods, supplements cause unusual responses so this has changed the way eat by strict avoidance, which has improved my blood work. \n\nI was using the online direct labs to track my blood work, where I could make lifestyle changes &amp; see if it improved my tests, CBC, thyroid, metabolic panel, etc. without my doctors knowing unless I shared the information. What I learned is some labs test vary depending on the lab, so standards can be different. \n\nI am a part time cyclist more for exercise &amp; personal pleasure along with body weight exercise, I was told by one of the phlebotomist that if workout before the tests, it can alter the test...have you ever heard this before? Which indicates to me that I can change the outcome of the test, but I really need to ask the hematologist..... Exercise/manual labour totally can change the results of a CBC!\n\nTotally understand the low ferritin, mines been in the gutter for years, also my iron saturation levels. That is one of the phlebotomy side effects, and why it can burn you out so hard.\n\nBut! DO NOT TAKE IRON SUPPLEMENTS, or iron rich foods!\n\nI was doing weekly bloodwork for years. I should be doing it monthly now, but have been slacking.\n\nWay back in my first year, when I was first at monthly, a friend made me clam chowder, as clams have the most iron, I had two bowls, and the next day I woke up with a confused, with a blood headache, and I did not know who my parents were, I walk out body my room an genuinely asked 'who are you?\". We took me too emergency and my hematocrit had jumped from 0.37 to 0.61 overnight. No sir, really??? So the phlebotomist knew at the UPMC cancer center, but my stupid hematologist could not or did not tell me....that ticks me off.\n\nI had read about iron supplements, so there was no way I was about try that... but I have been eating iron rich foods with citrus fruits, just finished a small 3 oz steak salad with pineapple mango steamed broccoli spinach trying to get iron back up because I was so tired. \n\nI did not know it could raise my hematocrit by doing that... I really feel stupid for not asking.\n\nI am not able to take most supplements but our local Wegmans has Zero Vitamin water with B-Vitamins, which really help me get my B-12 back up because it was extremely low.\n\nTHANK YOU, you are awesome you have no idea how much you helped me!!!! Undiagnosed from at least 2008 until 2019. Misdiagnosed in 2019. Properly diagnosed with PV in 2020. That must have been really rough.\n\nI am glad you have got diagnosed and can get treatment. Wow!  Thanks for mentioning this!!  My latest labs showed low MCHC/high platelets, which I know points to anemia.  I ALMOST went to the grocery store for spinach and iron supplements.  I guess I will hold off. I was diagnosed in 2008 at 37. Had weekly phlebotomies for a couple months. Then it went to monthly, then every other month, then finally every 3 months. Which is where I have stayed for a long time now. When saying your ferritin has \"been in the gutter for years\". That is a perfect way of describing it! lol.", "Should I be worried about polycythemia?? Hi all,\n\nI am a 28 year male, studying in the US.

(F20) Hello,\n\nI had a CBC test done a week and a half ago (April 2) that came out with a sort of high hematocrit and a sort of high RBC- 45.2% hematocrit and 5.45x10\\^12 L RBC. My provider said that these are relatively within normal range. A week and a half later, I had another CBC done (my provider said she would do one to satisfy my anxiety) and the hematocrit and RBC came back sort of high again- 45.4% hematocrit and 5.44x10\\^12 L RBC. Is this cause for concern for polycythemia vera? I am in the same situation as you with levels being at the high end of average or ever so slightly elevated. Have you had a Jak2 test done? Nope, the last CBC test my doctor said that these levels are normal in the test result comments and did not mention anything about them being too high... I am just concerned because they were a little high a second time around too. I get that way myself and get really anxious about it.From what I have read here and online one of the signs is taking a Jak2 test (for me it was just done during a cbc blood draw) in 95% of cases of PV there is a positive Jak2 result . I was negative for mine. The only way to know if you have it is to go to a hematologist. Please do not ask if it is something to be concerned about. It may be you have PV but no one on Reddit here unless they are an MPN specialist will be able to let you know if that is something to be concerned about. It is more likely you have an underlying condition but obviously not unheard of to have PV.\n\nIf your doctor has not referred you to a hematologist I would not be concerned about it\u2014UNLESS you are having severe symptoms consistent with the disease. I would encourage to start a diary with dates and symptoms and blood results and what you ate, how much sleep you got, how much water you drank because all of these things can affect your levels on a CBC. \n\nWarning to everyone else on this sub: we cannot tell you if you have PV. Only a doctor who is seeing you can diagnose you.

Secondary polycythemia, it is not secondary polycythemia Vera. It is usually diagnosed by testing your erythropoeiten levels (if you have low, probably PV, if it is high you may have a kidney issue.) They should also do a bone marrow biopsy, and probably should test you for any autoimmune diseases or diabetes or sleep apnea. If something else is causing it, once you treat it, high blood counts will go down. My blood tests were all normal Then why would you think you have polycythemia? Polycythemia is an excess of red blood cells or platelets. \n\nIf your blood tests were normal then you do not have polycythemia.

I have never heard of somebody so young getting PV!\n\nHow was it growing up with PV? Did it limit you from doing anything or cause any setbacks?\n\nAre you asymptotic or get symptoms from PV? I was diagnosed as an infant, I think I was having some breathing difficulties. At first, mom took me in, they told her just a cold and sent me home, then back in, they told her I had Leukemia. After 11 weeks in hospital and (I think?) 1 clot, they diagnosed me with PV.\nThankfully (knock on wood) I have had little to no symptoms. I take meds, see a hematologist every 6 months, and get bloodwork every 2 weeks to 1 month, depending on how stable levels are. I am incredibly thankful and blessed. Most of my child/preteen/teen years, I had forgotten I had it, except for taking meds every morning and the hospital visit twice yearly. I play sports, have a partner, party, work, drink alcohol in moderation and eat junk foods in moderation, etc.\n\nThere were times where my mother would keep me home from school if a bad bug was going around-regardless of if I had it or not.

It took meds and my family doctor explaining to me that science has advanced and that I am a healthy person with little reason to worry. I am so privileged in many ways, one being that I have not had the experience of so many with PV. I guess you could call my case so far \u201cmild\u201d compared to some out there! I am curious which meds you are on? As for googling PV, I totally agree, I freaked out. Since the average patient for PV is 60+ male, my theory is that most people in the past probably did not get blood tests as frequently as we do now, and they probably had significant symptoms before getting diagnosed, which may be why some places still say that the prognosis is 20 years. Is that your understanding too?

I hadnt heard of it until I was having dizziness episodes and went to the doctor and my counts were high and she mentioned polycythemia vera. She repeated it and it was back in range although still on the high side so she said there was nothing to worry about because in polycythemia vera, the counts stay high. Is this the case for you? I just do not understand why there are ranges if it means nothing when they are out of range several times. Sorry to rant. Just curious. Polycythemia is not the same thing as polycythemia vera. Polycythemia is high blood counts caused by an underlying condition. Maybe sleep apnea. \n\nPolycythemia vera is high blood counts in platelets and/or red blood cells and it is typically indicative of the genetic  JAK2 mutation. Not all ppl with PV have the JAK2 mutation, but most of them. Nobody knows what caused this mutation. It is also permanent. \n\nThey found my platelet count to be over 1 million in regular bloodwork. It is only supposed to be like 400K. My GP ordered to repeat the bloodwork to make sure it was not an error. Well, after the repeat test a few days later, it was still that high. She sent me to a hematologist. \n\nIf they are out of range a few times, it might be \"secondary polycythemia\" which is caused by an underlying condition. Once the underlying condition is treated, the bizarre counts are less common.

High hgb and hct for years now  Your doctor should have referred you to a hematologist. Then they would do further testing to diagnose PV with a bone marrow biopsy. \n\nYour GP may be able to do it too. But if it is been consistently out of range you should be seeing a specialist. I am meeting with a hematologist oncologist on the 12th. Just wondered those that have been diagnosed, what were your numbers like? I know mine are a bit out of range, but not sure at what point those numbers usually equate to a PV diagnosis. Many things can cause the numbers to go out of whack. There is more to the PV diagnosis besides those numbers. You have to be tested for some genetic mutations along with have a bone marrow biopsy. There are NCCN guidelines for diagnosing PV. The hemo onco should know what to test for. The WHO diagnostic criteria for PV is either: high hematocrit, hemoglobin or red blood cells PLUS JAK2 mutation positive PLUS low EPO (erythropoetin); OR high hematocrit, hemoglobin or red blood cells PLUS low EPO PLUS bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity in all blood lines. A bone marrow biopsy is strongly recommended regardless to establish a baseline and detect early myelofibrosis. \n\nOther tests done are BCR/ABL and ferritin. You could also have secondary polycythemia which is generally caused by low oxygen levels due to smoking, COPD, sleep apnea, anemia, etc or by steroid/testosterone use.\n\nTry to see an MPN specialist because it is a rare disease and most hematologists are behind the times. \n They have ran the other tests, and have already ruled out the secondary causes. That is kind of why I am a bit worried. They have not done the JAK2 mutation test. I am thinking he is going to want to do that first, and then depending on how it comes back, a BMB. \nI guess it is just wait and see how that goes. Yeah, the JAK2 and EPO test have to be done. 95% of people diagnosed with PV are JAK2 positive. If it comes back negative, then you must have low EPO and positive BMB to meet the criteria. I saw a regular hematologist at first, but realized that they were not up to date on diagnosis or treatment, so I switched to an MPN specialist and it is made a world of difference in my care. I will get those tests likely in a couple weeks.

My doc has been doing CBC's on me every month to 100% confirm it is not dehydration and it has continued to show up high. Fast forward and I am now seeing a hematologist who is in the process of checking my EPO level, and for something called JAK2. She also thinks it could be sleep apnea so referred me to a sleep specialist. I am 22 years old, is it possible for somebody my age to having Polycthemia Vera? And what is the outcome of this? Can somebody live a full life with this disease? I am also currently awaiting the results of the JAK2 gene mutation test, and it is anxiety inducing to say the least. I am a 35F and from what I have read, you can live a long life with this disease, given you take good care of yourself and stay consistent with your phlebotomies. It is also a very, very rare disease... especially for someone you are age. First of all, yes it is possible. I was diagnosed at around 16 and I am certain I am not the youngest.\n\nSecondly, it is been my experience that it is also possible to live a full life even with PV. I still have to go to the hospital weekly and get tests and injections done, but I am honestly pretty lucky in that the Pegasys treatment has been working well for me. You do not necessarily have to despair if you are diagnosed, though you may have to adjust your schedule/lifestyle to accommodate.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask. not to mention that there is some recent treatments that (iirc from what my doc told me) have been shown to actually put people into remission, or something along those lines even if that is not the exact right medical terminology\n\nETA: for me, I was doing a phlebotomy every couple months or so prior to starting Pegasys injections and now I have gone over half a year not having to do one, so honestly it feels like there is certainly reason to be optimistic Me too and also was diagnosed in my twenties. Happy to talk or chat with you I mean. I have been diagnosed for 2 years. \n\nI was diagnosed at 27. You may hAve Pv and I am usually not quick to suggest it to most people because they are people who are just googling their symptoms and freaking out that their doc is not doing the right tests but if it were concerning they would do the tests and it would be over several months with consistently abnormal bloodwork which it seems like you have.\n\nThey are trying to rule out SA because then that means you probably only have secondary polycythemia and it will go away if this is causing it. The Jak2 test will probably be the certainty of PV. \n\nGood luck, friend. Always happy to chat with you. Oh yeah, like I said, I was diagnosed when I was 16 and that was around 5 years ago now, I have definitely got the mutation, had to go through the bone marrow biopsy in my teens and everything lol\n\nI like to at least chime in with a bit of optimism on these sorts of \"i might have pv yall will I live okay\" posts bc the doctor I was first diagnosed by scared the heck out of me by saying I was probably only going to live another decade or so.

Here are my lab results: WBC=10.5, RBC=5.90, Hemoglobin=18, Hematocrit=52.7, EPO= 4.5, Ferritin=95, and low iron saturation. I have additional labs if that might be helpful. \n\nSince this was first identified, I have undergone 5-6 phlebotomies that have slowed down the rate of the hemoglobin rising but I still continue to have high lab results. I do not live at a high altitude, I do not smoke or use testosterone enhancement, or have sleep apnea. Prior medical history is asthma and CVID. No history of blood issues in my family. Past symptoms before treatment were: extreme fatigue and drowsiness, night sweats, dizziness, bone pain and heat flashes. Since phlebotomy, most symptoms have improved, along with daily aspirin therapy. However, bone pain and fatigue still remain. \n\nI had a bone marrow biopsy done in Jan of last year that was mostly normal, except for slight neutrophilia and a slight but not significant left shift. \n\nI have also tested negative for any rheumatoid conditions.

After those first 12 back to back I had to go in for phlebotomies every month and a half to keep my numbers stable. That worked for 3 years. \nIt was a scary time for me cuz even with some answers I had more questions as to what, why, and how. It took years to find a dr that believed me and tested me.\nI hope that you find a dr who can help you. It is frustrating. Good luck. Do not miss those phlebotomy appointments and drink plenty of water!\nBe safe. I feel like I am reading my own story. Last year my polycythemia was discovered and I also tested negative for the JAK2 mutation and have none of the risk factors associated with secondary polycythemia (smoking, high altitudes, lung problems, etc.). I have been doing phlebotomies every two weeks for the last year and last month was scheduled to slow down and continue monthly. They have not been able to find the reason for mine either and are unwilling to do a bone marrow biopsy. Unlike you however I have a history of ITP, and just about any form of autoimmune disease runs rampant in my family tree. The shooting pains in my bones and the daily exhaustion have never left me either. Our bodies are strange but no matter what please do not stop looking for answers.

I have been trying to figure out this mystery for years and will continue to do so. I hope you find answers, too.", "I have not been diagnosed but polycythemia keeps popping up when I research. My rbc, hemoglobin and hematocrit are elevated this time. Before it was usually my hemoglobin anf periodically my hematocrit. Could this be polycythemia?  The only way to tell is through a bone marrow biopsy. If you are concerned meet with a hematologist/oncologist. \nThere is a secondary polycythemia Vera which is not a cancer but due to sleep apnea or other causes. You can have secondary polycythemia (no vera)--which means something else is causing the elevated levels.  If you have not already, you need to see a hematologist. Seconding the other person, agreeing only way to tell is with a bone marrow biopsy, and they will probably NOT do one unless your blood tests have consistently been out of normal range. \n\nAlso, based on this one blood test alone, your levels do not look THAT far out of range that I would think it is cause for concern, however you did not mention if you are having symptoms such as cramps in places of your body, headaches, cannot eat that much, bone pain, or skin itching. Ask your doctor to do a blood test to see if you have a  jak2 gene mutation. That is a very good indicator of PV My hematocrit has been at 54% and my doctor hesitates to diagnose me with polycythemia, apparently 60-70% is when it gets serious, i do not really know. I do get itching in the bath sometimes. I have hip pain and pains throughout my body periodically. I also get headaches but mostly migraines with aura. I went through my old labs and saw that I had elevated rbc, hematocrit and hemoglobin in 2017. Usually it is my hematocrit and hemoglobin that are slightly elevated with most tests but I am a smoker. My sp02 are usually between 97-99 so do not think oxygen issues are an issue.  I think I will ask for a new CBC soon to see if it is still elevated since I read dehydration could cause an elevation as well. I read about that. I will definitely ask if he can order a test but if he does not I will order it myself. I also get migraines. They are a sunroom of Pv for me Sage advice about getting a genetic test.  I have secondary polycythemia - just found out a few days ago.  I only took about a week for results to come back.  Negative for pv genetic marker, but positive for secondary polycythemia genetic marker.  I have had really high red blood cell counts come back for the past year and a half but it actually took my oncologist to suggest it to my primary care to get a test done.  Having my first phlebotomy next week.", "Cannot get an answer to what is going on. PV or not? I am 34 years old and trying to find answers that have eluded me for the last 5 years and to see if anyone would have some insight.\n\nDuring a routine physical in 2015, my blood tests came back abnormal: Hemoglobin was 17.3, rbc 5.80, and hematocrit was 51% \u2014 all 3 just above the normal threshold. My doctor thought nothing of it but I compared it to to old blood work and it looked like years before that, my normals were lower. He begrudgingly agreed to send me to a hematologist.\n\nThe hematologist said it did not look like a PV case to him but he would run a bunch of tests anyways. He ordered a repeat CBC, EPO serum test, jak2 and jak2 exon 12 genetic tests, and CALC mutation test. He also sent me for a spleen sonogram to check for enlargement. Lastly, he said if I was very concerned, he would send me for a Red Blood Cell Mass test which he said measures the blood over a 4 hour period which is a hard test to find a center to do but I live in NYC so there was not one too far.\n\nMy RBC mass test came back normal, the spleen sono came back normal, my EPO was 7 ( reference range 4 - 27) and all genetic mutations came back negative. The CBC however showed elevations, with my hematocrit at 53%, rbc at 5.90 and hemoglobin at 17.7  He said \u201cyour testing rules out any pathological condition, as I suspected. Just make sure you stay hydrated.\u201d I went back in 6 months and he did a CBC and EPO, to which my hematocrit was 47 and hemoglobin 16.6 \u2014 well within normal and EPO was 10. He said \u201cthat is what I like to see. There is no need for you to come back. Again, just make sure you hydrate well\u201d\n\nSince then ( 2016 ), my results still fluctuate on blood tests. Most recently, I had a blood test Last week and my hematocrit was 53%, hemoglobin 17.9 and rbc 6.0. Six months ago , they were similar.\nAm I missing something here or did my doctor check everyhing he was supposed to and just let it go? I really have no cause for elevated numbers \u2014 I do not live at high altitude, was tested for sleep apnea and do not have it, I do not smoke and do not have any lung or heart conditions. IANAD, but based on what you describe you dont make the criterion for PV. Check WHO for the criteria here.  thank you for the reply!  Yea, I have gone through these criterion over and over throughout the years. I just do not understand why my elevations are occurring which always makes me question if the doctor missed something. The only thing you can do is get tested for the mutations again. Those numbers can fluctuate in anyone depending upon diet, hydration and exercise. It sounds like you had several docs test you. Your normal doc and a hematologist. And they sont feel like it is something to be concerned about. You could ask to see an MPN specialist but if it were me I would watch the numbers and be happy they are not telling me it is a chronic illness or cancer.\n\nDo you have any other symptoms? no other symptoms.  I do not drink a lot of liquids but I know I am not severely dehydrated.  I read dehydration can raise those numbers but can they really cause elevations to be out of the normal range?\nThe one thing I have never seemed to find an answer to is if someone has PV, will their blood tests always showed elevated rbc numbers? \nI know phlebotomies lower it but I have never had a phlebotomy and I have had a few (2 or 3) blood tests within the last few years that show normal ranges (hematocrit 48, hgb 16 and rbc 5.24).", "Should I be concerned about PV? \nI am a 30 yo female who had a CBC done due to chronic fatigue and weakness. The first time my results were as follows:\nHemoglobin: 15.9\nHematocrit: 47\nWBC:  12.1 (neutrophils elevated)\nRBC: 5.25 \nPlatelets: 439 k/ul\n\nThe dr said I was probably dehydrated and I did another CBC 3 weeks later, and I drank a lot of water beforehand. The results were: \nHemoglobin: 14.8\nHematocrit: 44.6\nWBC: 11.4 \nRBC: 4.96\nPlatelets: 421 k/ul \n\nDo these numbers look concerning? For Polycythemia Vera or anything else? The dr was not concerned at all, but I would like another opinion. Also can drinking a lot of water mask PV? If your doctor said they are not concerned at all, the reddit community should not be the place to get a second opinion. \n\nYour doctor has more training, education, and experience than we have. If you feel you need a second opinion I would consult another doctor, preferably a hemotologist.\n\nAlso to answer your question about the water, I was informed that dehydration can lead to increased hematocrit levels, especially during the summer. That being said, I do not believe drinking water or an excess of water can mask the symptoms of PV. Sometimes it helps to hear it from other people too especially when you are scared and anxious. I got diagnosed with PV at 27 years old. It took a year to diagnose with bloodwork. If your doctor is not concerned, I do not think you should be either. My doctor found it in me, when I went for a physical and my platelet count was over 1 million thinking maybe it was a lab error. So she repeated the test, and it was still over 1 million. That was WAY out of the range of normal. Then she sent me to a hematologist. \n\nUnless YOU FEEL something is just NOT RIGHT. I say this because even though doctors are the experts, we are experts on our own bodies, and how they feel, and if we are always in pain or whatever. I spent a large majority of my life knowing something was wrong but to be told it was all in my head and if I was not depressed I would just stop having constant migraines.  \n\nIf you want to get a second opinion, I would encourage you to do that if you really think it is PV, but it could be thyroid issues, sleep apnea, stress, etc causing your high levels.\n\nI would encourage your pcp or gen practitioner to just occasionally maybe once a month or 2-3 months to keep an eye on it. Once or twice bloodwork is not really something to worry about. 5 or 6 blood work? That is notable. Glad to hear that your numbers went down.  I am in a similar situation. My RBC\u2019s, Hematocrit, and Hemoglobin are all high.  Dr. suspects dehydration and wants me to retest in a few weeks. I am a bit worried because my father had myelofibrosis.  When I told the doctor that, he said that MPNs are not hereditary.  (However, I am finding out that is not completely true).  I feel good knowing that whatever is going on, that it is getting checked out.", "Bone Marrow Biopsy Only just discovered this subreddit and found it really helpful and appreciate all the contributions.\n\nWas diagnosed at 24 (now 29) and take regular Pegasys Interferon and the odd venesection now everything is under control.\n\nI had a bone marrow biopsy when first diagnosed and found it really tough. Was given local anaesthetic which did not really help with pain relief. Been told I might need another biopsy soon and wondered if anyone had any tips on how to get through the procedure? \n\nAlso happy to answer any questions on the condition, treatment, fertility, getting life insurance post diagnosis etc  - based in the UK so my treatment and diagnosis journey might be different to others. Get sedation. It will take longer to schedule though, but worth it. Thanks for replying - did not even know that was an option but definitely something I would want to request next time around! I had an injection of valium beforehand rather than sedation. It helped a lot. I agree! I have had 3 bone marrow biopsies and each time with sedation. It is like twilight sleep. Zero sensation except slight bruised feeling on hip afterward. Good luck! my hematologist gave me hydrocodone before he did it, which I was not prepared for the effect but it was very effective. All I can say is just bite your lip and give it heck and enjoy a sore backside for the next few days. Good luck", "Does this look like PV? (Sorry it is in French)  No My Hemoglobin is quite high 18,5g/100ml\n\nAlso, my Haematocrit 51,3% Do epo test and show me I do not have it since my doc said it is not important. But I will try to get it. Not necessarily but you should see a hematologist. Your numbers are high but PV cannot be diagnosed by CBC alone. You need to see a hematologist and get the JAK2 test, EPO level and bone marrow biopsy. Thanks for your answer, should I need to take aspirin my doc told me I could be at risk of blood clog but did not get me anything. She said I need to see the hematologist Thanks for your answer, the only thing I would like to be sure for sure is about blood viscosity. I do not want to have blood clots issue but the doc did not gave me anything yet. She said I need to check the hematologist That is a question for a doctor. Taking aspirin as a precaution should not hurt unless you have other conditions. I ask but she was not really worried about it, she said there is more risk to take daily aspirin if I fall down or things like this and wait the 8 April for the appointment. Ask your doctor if it would be okay to take a daily low dose aspirin. She said there is more risk to take than where I am for now", "High hemoglobin/hematocrit, low alkaline phosphatase? I am pushing my primary doc for answers but I have had high and often \"in the red\" hematocrit and hemoglobin for years now as well as a low and now in the red alkaline phosphatase.  Being treated for chronic diverticular disease and now prostatitis, not sure if there is any correlation.  Anyone have a similar experience?  This is getting old. You really need to go to a hematologist. This is out of a primary care doctor's wheelhouse."]
