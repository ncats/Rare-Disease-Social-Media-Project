["10 years of PFS \u2013 what has helped I just had my 'post-finasteride syndrome' 10 year anniversary. Thought I would summarize some things that have had some effect, in case it could help others here. It seems like most ppl here have only had symptoms for a few months, but these things might still help you.\n\nAbout me \u2013\u00a037 y/o, used Finasteride for 10 days in Nov 2010. Got hit with cognitive and sexual side effects. Cognitive sides have improved a fair bit \u2013\u00a0some sexual symptoms have gotten worse.\n\n**What helped me**\n\n* Water fasting (both 24 hour and multi-day ones) (seems to help w cognition/brain fog/energy)\n* Strength training + high calorie intake (reasonably healthy) (seems to help w cognition/mood/erections)\n* Endurance training (seems to help w erections)\n* Meditation (seems to help w mood/energy/motivation/coping)\n* DCT / relaxing the pelvic floor (seems to help with sensitivity/erections)\n* Good sleep (seems to help with mood/energy)\n* Positive social interactions (seems to help with mood/energy)\n* Not working too hard / taking time off work (seems to help with cognition/brain fog)\n* Activities involving complex coordination (climbing, dancing, yoga) (seems to help all around)\n* Methylation supplements help (esp 6S-5-MTHF and B12) (seems to help with brain fog/cognition)\n* L-Glutamine (helps with digestion/neuropathy)\n* Eating SCFAs (e.g. cold potatoes) (helps with digestion)\n\n**What helped a little**\n\n* Hydrocortisone\n* Thyroid medication (helped with cognition, killed my libido)\n* Low dose Naltrexone\n* Not drinking alcohol\n* Cutting out sugar and processed foods\n\n**What has not helped**\n\nI have used a million different supplements and tried most conceivable diets (I will not bother to list all of them). But I would say that in general, dietary and hormonal interventions have not been successful for me.\n\n* Hormonal interventions (DHEA, human growth hormone, progesterone cream, pregnenolone, Danazol, 5a-DHP)\n* Testosterone/hCG (I have gotten chest tightness and breathing problems from these... might try again later, though)\n* Tadalafil/viagra (they work, but erections are not my main problem)\n* Diets of all kinds (paleo, low-FODMAP, vegetarian, vegan, SCD, raw vegetables only, low carb, etc)\n* Probiotics (I have tried many kinds and protocols)\n* CBD, THC\n* IV ketamine\n* Testosterone boosters like Tribulus and Maca root (Maca was a disaster)\n* NoFap (5 months)\n* Trying to pretend that PFS is not real and just be \"normal\"\n* Dozens of other supplements\n\nI have stayed away from aromatase inhibitors \u2013\u00a0I have anecdotes where people have reported worsening (and permanent) side effects from them. Also have not used antidepressants, because they are reported to cause similar side effects as Finasteride. Tribulus didnt help you?\n\nI felt as though it helped me while I was taking it, but I crashed hard afterwards.  \n\nIt is been 6 months post fin for me now, and I have not taken anything since November. I have seen small improvements. \n\nFor me it is just my libido now, I want that back!  I am a lot better than where I was a few months back, so am very thankful for that.   \n\nHow do you feel day to day?  Do you have crashes here and there?\n\nMy doctor sent me for a bunch of blood tests, if nothing comes up, she will recommend a specialist.  Any idea what type of specialist I should ask to see? It is still debated whether pfs is even real in the medical community. But there are some studies like this which examine this possible condition: \n\nIf finasteride can really affect neuro-steroids long term, medical specialists are unlikely to be able to help unless you can find someone who has researched this area. For me helps taking Maca (about 3 upheaped teaspoons of it, the mechanism of action of maca is still unknown). I tested my steroid levels and the blood results came perfect. There are also websites like propeciahelp.com forums where people study possible treatments.\n\nIt is entirely possible that the side effects you experienced were caused by nocebo effect, the mind can be a powerful thing, it is also possible that your finasteride intake was just a coincidence and you are deficient in iron something, I would recommend to be open to multiple different possibilities. \n\n\"There is a body of scientific evidence from studies in rodents which finasteride may reduce the concentration of several neuroactive steroids important for neurogenesis and neuronal survival. An important neurosteroid is allopregnanolone (ALLO), a metabolite of dihydroprogesterone. ALLO is a potent ligand of the inhibitory GABA-barbiturate receptor. GABAA receptors have variable sensitivities to ALLO in the settings of neurosteroid withdrawal, stress, social isolation, and aging. Less ALLO, as a consequence of finasteride treatment, could alter GABAergic transmission with implications for neuronal progenitors and young neurons. Interestingly, the mechanisms of irreversible tardive dyskinesias from phenothiazines may be similar to the mechanisms underlying the persistent side effects of finasteride: in rats treated with the phenothiazine haloperidol to induce orofacial dyskinesias, co-administration of progesterone prevented this side effect, while pretreatment of the rats with finasteride reversed this protective effect, demonstrating an important role of the progesterone pathway and its metabolites. Since neurosteroids are believed to have anxiolytic, antidepressant, and memory enhancement properties and play a role in neuroprotection, the decrease of neurosteroid biosynthesis through inhibition of the enzyme 5-alpha reductase required to synthesize these neurosteroids, may contribute to the respective psychiatric adverse events.\" Wow! \n\nThis makes a lot of sense.  \n\nI will look more into neuro steroids and mention this to my doctor.  \n\nThanks! I am managing. Trying to keep the hope alive that I will feel like myself at some point.\n\nI have a job. I make money. I have friends. But intimate relationships are hard because of the anhedonia and lack of libido. \n\nI have not had any crashes after the initial one. I have had setbacks, but they were not as dramatic as the first one, where I felt like I had been lobotomized.\n\nI gave up on doctors a few years ago. Nobody has a clue \u2014 they just prescribe random tests to get me out of their office. I have had the best experience with \"holistic\" doctors, who are willing to explore and try new things. Also had a good experience with a psychiatrist. Endocrinologists and urologists have been arrogant and unhelpful. I have heard of something called a \"neuroendocrinologist\", but I have not been able to find one. Be prepared to hear that you are imagining your symptoms. \n\nI have tried to get referrals to research hospitals, but I have been rejected because PFS is apparently not real. So much for scientific open-mindedness.\n\nHere is something you can ask your doctor to see if they are actually trying to help - \"how will the results of this test change how you approach my treatment?\" If they cannot answer that, they are just on a fishing expedition. \n\nGood luck! &gt;how will the results of this test change how you approach my treatment?\"\n\nI will definitely use this, thank you!\n\nHonestly, I do have a lot of questions for you.  10 years is just such a long time. \n\nI just looked up what anhedonia means, and wow.  Inability to have pleasure?  You do not even enjoy watching movies?  Or working out?   \n\nYou mentioned you make money, i just made a bit of unexpected money recently, and I was very excited. Anhedonia is torture. Pleasure is not completely gone, though, it is just very diminished in many areas. I still enjoy music somewhat, but food, money, relationships, sex, achievements, success, alcohol... the response is dim. It is a bizarre thing.\n\nAnyway, just be happy that it is not on your symptom list!\n\nI will answer whatever I can! 10 years has given me quite some time to think. Tbh, what I am looking for is a timeline of what is happened and when.    Such as after x months you felt this way, after another months you felt this again. Something along those lines. \n\nWhat milestones can you recall?   I feel as though other than my libido I am pretty much 100%, but I am at times way too optimistic\n\nHave you gotten morning wood again?  Or is that a long gone memory?  I started taking Cialis a few weeks back, I feel as though it helped.  But again, I am a bit too optimistic.  \n\nSorry if you have answered these questions before. I hope they were not too personal. The symptom timeline seems very variable, so I do not know my personal experience is a guide.\n\nBut here goes - I was really fucked up for 3 months after I took finasteride. Nothing worked, I slept 14 hours a day, could not form coherent sentences, no sexual function, anxiety attacks, could hardly find the energy to go to the grocery store.\n\nI had steady improvements for two years (esp sexually), but I got impatient. I had a big setback after trying probiotics in 2012. The improvements slowed down after that. \n\nI was on a Paleo diet for a while during this time, which I think unnecessarily spiked my SHBG and prevented hormones from balancing.\n\n2013-2014 I used thyroid meds. Helped me perform at work, but slowly drained my libido. \n\n2014 - I experimented with making my own meal replacements from basic ingredients. This really fucked me up. \n\n2015-2017 - started focusing on eating a high calorie diet along with more compound weight training. This was good. Did a 10 day water fast. Also good. I still do a 24 hour fast every week. I wish I had done this a lot sooner. Steady improvements in cognition. \n\n2017-2020 Focused more on meditation and lowering stress, which I also wish I had done sooner.\n\n2019 - big setback with maca root. \n\nOverall - Cognition, energy, and general intelligence has gotten better. Erections got to 80% and sensitivity went from 0-15% within the first 2 years and more or less stayed there. Libido has gotten worse over time. Very happy to be rid of extreme brain fog and suicidal/disturbing thoughts and panic attacks. I am more comfortable in social situations. I still have very dry skin, and my sense of smell is not as acute. I am probably leaving some stuff out... DM me if you want to discuss further.\n\nAnyway, the symptoms ppl experience with PFS are diverse. You might not experience these symptoms and you might heal a lot quicker than me. It seems pretty rare to encounter people who has had this problem for 5+ years. So the odds are that you will improve by just living a healthy lifestyle. Can you share some supplements that contain 6s-5-methyltetrahydrofolate? I saw that folic acid contain some but not really sure. I have been there for 10y like you, I recovered from sexual sides but not my response to stress and anxiety, also insomnia is really easily triggered. I can get stressed and anxious super easy. Also brain fog sometimes but it is manageable. In what sense have you recovered sexually?  Is it possible to go back to having erections like before finasteride?  I have lost hope, I have had weak erections for 6 years now ... while before finasteride I was a raging bull. I recovered sexual sides in 2 years then 2 years of soft erection and now is on and off but would say recovered to 80%, did you check your prolactin and and progesterone levels? Since it is been 10 years, you can probably try out some supplements. But I would not recommend it for more recent sufferers, though.\n\nIt took a bit of experimenting to get the right kind of methyl folate. I ended up with a type from Designs for Health - \n\n1mg is right for me, but you might find that you need 5, 10, or even 20mg. \n\nI have a mutation on one of the \"methylation genes\" - A1298C, so I think this is why it worked for me.\n\nMTHF can also have side effects for some people, so I used this protocol that a naturopathic doctor gave me before I started 6S-5-MTHF - \n\nSupplements\n-Jarrow Formulas Methyl-B12 5 mg\n-Source Naturals Dibencozide 10 mg\n-Thorne Methyl Guard\n-Jarrow Formulas Sam-e 200 mg\n-Now Foods Potassium Gluconate\n\nInstructions:\nBegin taking Dibencozide. Place 1 lozenge between upper lip and teeth and retain in that position for 45 minutes or until fully absorbed. Do this once a day. Also begin the potassium gluconate at 3 tablets 1x/d. Do this for 5 days before moving to step 2.\nAdd Sam-e at 200 mg 1 cap/d. Do this for 5 days before moving to Step 3.\nAdd Thorne Methyl Guard, 1 cap 2x/d. Do this for 5 days before moving to Step 4.\nAdd Jarrow Methyl B-12. Place 1 lozenge between upper lip and teeth and retain for 45 minutes or until dissolved. Prolactin is ok, progesterone I do not know but from what I have heard everyone who has taken finasteride has progesterone cleared.  Did you just wait 2 years without taking anything to recover? Have you ever tried something with allopregnanolone? Allopregnanolone was not available as a drug until very recently. There is a drug called Zulresso that is pure allopregnanolone (as far as I know), but it has to be administered via IV and it is $30k+. So it is not really an option yet.\n\nI have tried a precursor - 5a-DHP - but that made me feel a little weird. Might try again though. How did you recovered from sexual sides? I have been dealing with this for 4yrs now. Did you check your prolactin levels ? What cognitive side effects did you experience, and did they subside due to a specific protocol/regiment or just due to time? Take a look at the list above, and you will see that I have written \"helps with cognition\" next to the therapies that helped.\n\nI would say it is been a long, cumulative process to improve my mind. Water fasting, methylation supplements, and meditation were the biggest factors, I think. Still took years, though.\n\nI had most of the common mental symptoms - anxiety, lack of motivation, panic attacks, poor word recall, slurring speech, de-realization (the sense that I am not myself and/or the world is not real), anhedonia (lack of pleasure and feeling), poor memory, brain fog, attention problems, lack of empathy... I am probably leaving something out... Just trying to remember all this is painful.\n\nI still struggle with anhedonia and low libido, but I am happy that I no longer feel like I have been lobotomized. Sorry for the late reply, but seeing your side effects it really seems like something like this that could really help you :/ Yes, I would have thought so too! OMG! Could we PLEASE keep this post at the top of this blog? I want to tag your messages with \u201cnew PFS sufferers- start here!\u201d\n\nYour posts are some of the most informative and comprehensive run-downs on what it is like to be on the path of PFS recovery. It is terrifying. It is not pretty. It is definitely NOT fast, nor easy. \n\nAs a spouse of a sufferer - it is THE most taxing and dark period of our 20 years together. This month, Feb 2021 marks the 1 year anniversary of my guy quitting the drug. His crash was in March. This anniversary is bittersweet. \n\nRegardless, he is still alive and battling back. Our focus and values have shifted, certainly. Battle onward PFS suffers. partners, and supporters! All best wishes for full and fabulous recovery. FU MERCK! Why was Maca a disaster ? Can you share what happened with maca ?\nI think I might have experienced some adverse effect with maca while being on Fin. I checked it a few years ago. Nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nI have found that hormone levels do not really have any correlation with how I feel. Nothing is particularly out of range. \n\nWhat is the intervention for high/low prolactin? I wrote about it here \u2013 ( Now were you actually able to mentally say/believe ,'pfs is not a thing'? That has to be incredibly hard if not impossible for a sufferer and if any pfs sufferer could actually do it I think it would definitely work to a high degree Hard to say that if was able to do it 100% of the time, but I was trying to use NLP and mindfulness techniques like those outlined in the Gupta programme for a few months.\n\nThey say it can as much as a year to feel better, though, and did not do it for that long. Thank you!", "Irritable bowel syndrome as a reaction from Finasteride/Dutasteride? I started out with gluten sensitivity before ever taking any fin (2017), but later on, 6 months into treatment with fin, my GI symptoms kept worsening more and more. Not sure if FIN was, responsible or just my condition's, natural worsening... It is not often talked about, because the mental and sexual side effects tend to be more distressing. Finasteride interferes with the production of bile acid ( which helps break down fats in your food, so that could be one explanation.\n\nChanging your hormones with fin could also throw your HPA axis out of whack - this is one of the main regulators of digestion. \n\nFinasteride effects a lot of different hormones and processes in the body, so there could be other factors that explain it too. Thanks, in my case I do not have issues with bile, no diarrhea, just insane bloating, food intolerance and, above all, PAIN. \n\nI have been looking for cases who had these symptoms after starting fin and got better months/years after stopping it (this is important to prove that the culprit was finasteride), but I never found any, not a single one...  I do not think there should be much doubt that finasteride is playing a role in this situation. \n\nFinasteride is an endocrine disruptor, and your endocrine system regulates tons of different things, including digestion.\n\nIf your symptom is mostly pain, it could be an issue with runaway inflammation. Well, finasteride interferes with hormones that help control inflammation (primarily testosterone).\n\nThis is like standing inside a burning house holding a flamethrower, and wondering if shooting flames around might have something to do with your house being on fire. To be fair, the house was already burning before I started taking fin. The gluten sensitivity came first. But it is true that finasteride might have added fuel to the fire, and made the condition worse than what originally was. \n\nStill, it is discouraging that I cannot find a single case like mine that got better of their GI issues upon finasteride discontinuation. There are lots of cases like this when it comes to sexual or cognitive side effects, but none about GI sides... There are some stories on the propeciahelp forum, like this one - \n\nIf you do more searching, you will find more. Of course, there will be more people who come complain about gut problems than people who talk about them being resolved.\n\nMight be redundant to say, but I am assuming you have stopped taking finasteride? I stopped for a while last year but did not notice any change in any of my symptoms. Then took it topical for a few months at an extremely low dose, and all blood tests on hormones came back almost like my baseline, but my symptoms were still the same. This year I was using topical, and now I have not taken anything for a few days.\n\nI will look into the story, thanks. Do you know of cases with severe pain that also resolved upon discontinuation? I read the thread but he did not get better after finasteride discontinuation, but after starting a carnivore diet. It makes sense that a drastic reduction in carb intake would deplete the gut bacteria of fermentable foods, hence improving symptoms like gas and probably diarrhea (if the cuts were lean). He also took ciprofloxacin (which is an extremely dangerous antibiotic known to cause neuropathies btw), which could have killed a parasyte or given him a transient improvement (usually happens in IBS after antibiotic use). Not too my knowledge. But I would think that the people whose GI issue were caused by finasteride would see it improve after stopping. It would take a months or three though, just like with the sexual and mental side effects. Use the search function, and you will find other narratives. I just grabbed the first I found.", "Wanted to give my experience after taking finasteride for 2 years and then stopping I started taking TRT 2 year ago at the age of 33. I noticed right after starting TRT that the number of hairs on my hands after shampooing increased from about 2-3 to 9-10, which was enough to scare me into taking finasteride. I started taking 1mg/day every day. The number of hairs on my hands after shampooing dropped back down to 2-3, and I did not notice any immediate side effects, so I was happy. Over the next 2 years, I started noticing very weak erections. The kind that would deflate immediately without constant stimulation. Also felt like when I did have an erection, it was skinnier than it used to be. A lot of guys have erection issues on TRT because of low/high estrogen levels, and I figured that was my problem too. \n\nAfter trying every thing (taking more aromatase inhibitor, skipping my aromatase inhibitor, injecting more frequently, taking various supplements, etc) and still having weak erections, I decided to stop taking finasteride to see if that was the cause. After only 4 days, I was having the hardest, thickest, longest lasting erections I had in years. Every morning since then I have woken up with morning wood. It was god damn finasteride the whole time. I have been off finasteride for 3 weeks now and the erections are still great. I also feel slightly mentally sharper. It seemed like for the past 2 years, I had a 10% headache in the middle of my forehead. Not anymore.\n\nThe downside is that I am back to losing 9-10 hairs per shower, but I would much rather live with that than not having a functioning penis. Keep us posted on the catch up loss. Ok... So the side effects went away, and you kept your hair. \n\nGG right? How long did it take for everything to start working properly again? Or was it immediate?", "Do you recommend finasteride microdosing to avoid pfs long term? i  started 1mg/day for 8 days i had side and i had recovered recently, i wonder if i do finasteride microdosing i could avoid side effects\n\nhave you ever tried microdosing ?  its worked ? Only way to avoid side effects is to not take it.\n\nPeople have gotten side effects on as little as 0.25 mg \n\nStay away from it and save yourself a world of trouble Agree 100%.\n\nAlso, going off and on may elevate your risk of persistent adverse effects, because you are changing the environment in your body (finasteride inhibits an enzyme at a key stage in hormone metabolism). You are hitting the on and off switch which could be disruptive to a delicate and important system. I thought I was Microdosing, did like a mg every third day or something, still got sides. Not sure what the threshold would be because severity, duration, and perception of sides varies so dramatically. \n\nIf you want to fiddle with the dosing until you find something you are comfortable with than great, but you may not see the results you want from it, and that is why we take the damn drug in the first place.", "I think finasteride caused nerve damage in my body, or at least changed my brain signaling The first week I took 1mg of fin daily, I felt fine, but there were some immediate changes that I should have realized. The first was that I could not for the life of me, cum. I usually can bust no problem, but this one might I could not bust for shit. I literally had to force myself to cum by kegeling. I remember thinking \u201cdamn this drug is great! I can last way longer now.\u201d \n\nI have also been recently diagnosed with gastroparesis, which occurs when the muscles in your stomach do not work properly. This occurs when there is weakening or damage to your vagus nerve. I never had gastroparesis before I took finasteride, and now I get it after every meal.", "Need help with recovery (Please help) Hey all,\n\nTo start, I am a 23 year old male who went on fin from July 30-August 25, 2020 originally. During that time, my symptoms got worse and I eventually lowered my dose and completely got off. From there, I waited another 3 months to see if symptoms changed. Things became a bit better over the first month, but got worse over the next two months. \n\nWith that said, I again wanted to try the medication again at a lower dose and went back on as symptoms were slightly recovered. I went on Nov 30-December 29 of 2020 and once again got off as it caused side effects again. From there, the symptoms were almost the same. First month better, second month worse, and third month even worse. Now, I am over 4 months off, but this past month (since around March 30), has been unbearable. I have barely been able to leave my bed, anxiety and panic attacks multiple times a day, depression has kicked in, bad sleep, deep and negative thoughts, libido issues, and brain fog. It has also been the cause of ending my relationship and I have had to take time off school for the time being. \n\nI am posting here as I am losing hope. I need help and I have no idea what to do as almost everyone says it is just in my head. I know I can make it worse myself, but not being able to drive or leave my house has been extremely hard. Just need advice on how to try and fix this so I can feel like myself again. Much love all. I really would not start to lose help at all yet. 4 months is still quite early stages. Would recommend getting tests done, blood, stool etc and try and act from there. Supplementation can be useful in moderation imo, but you need to know what you are targeting first. There is no point taking loads of, say Vitamin K, if your levels are already high.\n\nBefore you do your tests I would recommend eating v clean, plenty of fibre, and try and lightly exercise. Thank you, I should point out I do have periods where I feel closer to normal, although I tend to crash for some reason. My testosterone came back from an online test. It was at 35 on a range of 49-180 (yikes). Also, the rest of my bloods came back good. Higher B12 than I would like and cholesterol but that is normal for me. As for health, I am well in shape (12-13% bf), so it is not like that would cause anything. I do not have a history of depression as well. I do take ashwaghanda daily to help as well Hello, I also took fin in august, around same time you did, and i stopped December 16 2020. I have suffered about the same sides you did, especially the anxiety, depression and brain fog. I know exactly how it feels, but i can already tell you it will get better, although what is actually going on, is mere speculation. There are a couple of things i can guarantee you, and i have a couple of tips.  \n\n\nBrain fog is very narrowly associated with anxiety and depression. Its rarely a side effect on its own, so regard brain fog as a subsymptom from anxiety, not directly from finasteride.  Also, anxiety will get better. It might not immediately dissapear, but it will get better as your body simply is not able to cope with long term anxiety. That Is why panic attacks last for only a brief moment.., its too exhausting for your body, and it will lower with time. That being said, its not really resolved as you might notice, once the anxiety lowered, you may have become numb in regards to emotions, it makes you a shell, but even that will clear up as it becomes a smaller part of who you are.  \nAvoid all stress. be kind to yourself and give yourself time. Your bodies chemistry has been thrown out of whack. I would definitely suggest you would get your blood work done and check for estrogens, testosterone, and DHT. tell the doctor what you did, and you will then at least have the certainty no mayor problems are going on, and please come back here. Do NOT visit propeciahelp, PFSfoundation and all that crap. Even though pfs is real and we do not know for sure what is going on, you will there read all sorts of horror stories, bro-science and frankly, insane testemonies. Stay away from there.  \nNext up, go outside. take walks. Tell a close friend about it who will understand, and meet up with him. Under no circustances, talk yourself into doom scenarios because you will get better. Try to pay close attention to small things. For example, when i was at my worst, i took a walk in the forest, collected an acorn and it is now sprouting. Funny thing is that i by chance picked up a polyembryonic acors which means that two stems are growing from once acorn, a fairly rare phenomenon. Look at the sky, leaves, pay attention to the wind, ... These small things will allow you to reconnect with your environment and help ease the pain. I know its not an easy fix but others will give you more great tips. I would like you to realize that i may come across as someone who figured it out, but that is not true. Four months ago i was an anxiety, depression and misery ridden mess, but now, 4 months later i can somewhat function. I wish you all the best, and please keep us updated as this is valueable for all of us.  Take care. I appreciate the kind words, I absolutely will keep everyone here updated as I am doing about everything possible to figure out how to fix this. And yea I have stayed far away from those sites. They do nothing but make the symptoms worse. Do you think something such as the Wim Hof breathing method would help? Definitely. its a form of meditation so it will definitely do you good Sounds good, apparently it helps with the nervous system. Have been noticing it works a bit but need to do it more. I will update everyone on how it is working as it goes along Hey man, I was in same position as you. My DMs are always open and I am happy to try to help you along as I know how horrible this can be. \n\nPlease reach out as it is complicated and I cannot just give you the necessary advice in a single post.\n\nNEVER get back on it. You WILL get better. Keep believing and trying to improve I hope you get better bro. Appreciate it, I will keep this entire subreddit up to date on the progress and what works so we can all heal together \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f I am dealing with this shit for almost 7 years now. I am MUCH better now than I was the months after the crash. The first year was tough but I got better fast after that. I spent a fortune on tests and supplements so I am kind of an expert in that area \ud83d\ude09 If you have any questions just DM me. All the best. There is some great advice in this thread. Do things that bring you calm and positivity. Work on getting your gut and health as good as possible. Exercise when you can and get fresh air and sunshine. Stay away from unnecessary sources of stress. Get a comprehensive hormone panel done that includes pregnenolone so you know where you are at. Your brain and body are trying to heal right now and everything you can do to support it will help. Try to let go as much as you can and have patience. Do not be too hard on yourself for the negative thoughts and anxiety, your body is not producing the proper balance of hormones and a difficult mindset is the side effect. Look for ways to bring in some positivity and forgive yourself for the times you cannot do it. You have got to be kind to yourself while you go through this. And find some people to trust and confide in about this whether online or in life, you need a circle of support and that is a non negotiable. Thank you, it means a lot Has libido gotten back to normal and what is best thing for it ?  No problem. You are only 4 months in and taking care of your health and giving it time could be all you need. \n\nIf you need more help in the future or want to get a head start on it now just in case, I would look into naturopaths who have taken courses with Dr. Mark Gordon. He is been pioneering traumatic brain injury treatment for veterans and the hormone levels in the brain are very similar for TBI and PFS. So much so that his organization is actually treating PFS patients now. He has three episodes on the Joe Rogan show you could listen to. I cannot remember if he mentions PFS in those episodes but I have heard him mention PFS in other videos, and there is at least one press release discussing it. A naturopath who is aware of his work can probably help you figure out where your body is under stress and what the best course of action would be to support your brain and hormones.\n\nHow are you doing? For sure, and I am on and off. I am currently going through some therapy and next week I am seeing a neurologist. Any advice on what exactly I should be asking the neuro? And what test I should be getting done? (Test/estrogen, progesterone, allopregnenolone, etc?) I think being on and off is pretty common, I think what is happening is your brain is sometimes more effective than other times at producing what you need. That is good your doing some therapy. \n\nFor sure a comprehensive hormone test. Not sure if neuros look at that or if that is only endocrinologists, but its worth bringing up. Mainly I would make sure they are at least willing to look at the possibility that your issues are from fin use. Some doctors are a lot more open to the idea of it that others. Maybe mention how fin is a 5 alpha reductase inhibitor? As long as they are open to the idea they will have a better chance of figuring it out from a neuro perspective.\n\nBest of luck with your appointment! How ya doing man? UPDATE: Doing much better! Recently been going to therapy and getting a lot more sunlight. According to my neurologist, the best way to get past this is both time and getting enough vitamin D (as it is very important for neurosteroid production). The vitamin D had easily been the biggest difference maker for me. Also, mood is stabilizing, libido is back for the most part, and sleep is getting better. Will continue to update \ud83d\ude4f awesome:) Good to hear. What side effect lasted longest and How long did you take the fin initially? So the doctor told you time and sun exposure are only things for full recovery from sexual side effects ? Did doc tell you how much time it could possibly take for full recovery ?", "Hate myself for restarting Fin - should have known better I started on Fin Dec 2018. I did not realize I guess but my mental health was deteriorating gradually. I was started get performance anxiety during sex and minor issues for ED that I was sure were all psychological because they only happened around my sex partner who I had fallen for and so was nervous around.\nIn Jan 2020 I started having sleep issues. Then later that month I had a terrible heart break with my sex partner rejected me outright when I decided to make my feelings known. \nI went really downhill from there. I chalked it all to my natural anxiety though and the circumstances in my life. There were some other things going wrong too. In Jul 2020 my doc decided to do my baseline levels so I discontinued Finasteride for 2 weeks to get accurate testosterone reading. \nBut then I decided to just discontinue to see what happens - it seemed like minoxidil was doing all the work.\n\nOver the next few months I kept going through my waves of anxiety, panic and depression. But then I started improving - really improving. I feel like I started getting my confidence back and I was doing great. I never thought it could have been Fin.\n\nI decided to see start seeing my sex partner again which I am sure was not the best decision but covid has one's choices limited and a reliable partner is difficult to come around.\n\nIn Jan 2021, 4 weeks ago, I decided to re-continue Fin. I should NOT have. I had shed more for a while after discontinuing but then it seemed to stabilize and at least to my eyes I could not tell if there was any difference after 6 months. \nThings were going ok for a few weeks - I continued to have good sex with my partner. Although my usual background anxiety did seem to be getting stronger and I was starting to get that same panicky feeling again. That should have been a giveaway. But like an idiot I kept going on Fin. I never even suspected it.  \nAbout 10 days or so ago I started noticing libido dropping. I took maca. Couple of days later when I tried jacking off - I felt like my member was rock hard. Too hard. I was turned on to the porn but not THAT turned on. It was disconcerting to have this disconnect between what I was feeling in my mind and how my body was reacting. \n\nAnd two days ago - it happened again but the opposite. \nThings were started to get heated between me and my sex partner - I started getting hard. And then suddenly - limp. Complete limp. Like no life. Worse actually, my dick receded inside. It did not even respond to physical stimulation. This has never happened to me. I always respond to physical stimulation even if it takes a bit. This caused me to freak out and get embarrased which made things worse. But I again chalked it to anxiety somehow.\nThen yesterday, a day later - I decided to jack off just mostly to see what the night before was about. I was still feeling quite freaked but this time there was no pressure. I still could not get hard to porn and physical stimulation. I came but while flaccid. This has never happened to me. That is when I suddenly thought Finasteride ! And I have been reading everyone is horror story since then.\n\nNow I am completely freaked out. I still do not feel horny and in fact hating the idea of sex and porn.\n\nIf anyone has any words of advice - it will be much appreciated. \n\nRead this then PM me. We are all going through this, there is a way to get better but it is not easy. I am going to caution you with this approach. Many people have reported worsening symptoms when they take supplements like tribulus, maca, and more. This therefore is not a universal cure and could potentially make you worse. Yes. I was on maca while being on fin. \nI wanted to get my libido going a bit so I tried maca and 7-8 days into it is when I went completely limp.", "Has anybody here experienced remission of their depression after stopping finasteride? No matter how long after, just a yes or no.  Yes Yes Yes Yes \ud83d\udc4d absolutely Not depression, but severe anxiety. And yes, within 3 days I felt better. Wow, how long were you taking 3 months when it hit me. Originally thought it was something else so my doctor prescribed me prednisone. A medication that I could not take with finasteride. So after several days I got better, weaned off the medication and started finasteride again, then it hit me like a train. Massive panic attacks 4-5 times per day that would last 20 minutes at a time, literally thought I was going to die. Googled if anxiety was a side effect of finasteride and learned that is, so I stopped it and within 3 days I felt normal. Yes. I had it all: anxiety attacks, suicide ideation, depression, andhedonia, insomnia, tinnitus, muscle loss and every sexual sides.\n\n4 months later, I have slight tinnitus, lowered libido and penile sensation, and decreased orgasm pleasure.\n\nThat is it. I thought I was dead and permanently fucked. I am not recovered and I still wish I could recover quick. But it is night and day compared to where I was barely 6 weeks ago.\n\nSo things can change. I wish I had read a similar message when I was at my worst. If you ever need to talk you can PM me\n\nKeep your head up man I just quit easter morning after almost 5 months for prostate issue. Never felt more depressed, could hardly speak at dinner. Today is day 3 without still feelin bad", "New subbreddit exposing medical corruption / pharma-harm: revealing the corruption and lies of dermatology (r/AccutaneLies) This group seems to be pretty open-minded to the dishonesty and corruption of the medical establishment (with the terrible experiences of psychiatry), so I hope it is ok to post this here. If not, delete.\n\nDermatologists are dishonest and lying about the serious effects of a very dangerous medication (Accutane), which they claim to be \u201cvery safe\u201d. Their entire establishment of Dermatology is full of corrupt and pharma-funded research, lies, and false claims.\n\nTons of research and finances have been invested into online promotion of this drug on social media (TikTok and Instagram) directory to children and youth, where doctors tell followers how amazing and safe this drug is, with no permanent side effects.\n\nDermatologists falsely deny the link between accutane and IBD, depression, and long-term health effects. They deny any association to fertility damage (despite evidence of this risk), and generally say many egregious lies about the drug.\n\nI made a subreddit platform to expose these lies: ( and another one to expose the permanent damage many thousands of young users suffer: (\n\nPlease do not let yourself, your child, or your family member become a victim of these lies by the medical establishment. This project may accumulate into larger legal action, if possible. Children are dying because of their greed and corruption.\n\nThe Reddit group is brand-new and there are hundreds of examples of lies, corruption, dishonesty, and false claims made about Accutane. For the uninitiated, there are many reports of post-accutane side effects closely resembling the symptoms of PFS. This post is more than tangentially related to the purpose of this subreddit. This is very true.   \nAnyone can feel free to joint the r/AccutaneTruth page if they wish. ", "HELP Tailbone area hurts from sitting, happened right after I took finasteride Right after I started taking finasteride, i developed severe pain in my tailbone area and also developed a small hole????\n\nA year after, I stopped taking it, the small hole is still there but smaller and the pain starts appearing after 30 minutes of sitting, in the tailbone area. \n\nAnyone else have experience this? Please help me I have heard of both muscle atrophy and osteoporosis associated with finasteride, but nothing as specific as this. Do you have any other muscular or skeletal issues? Thank you, I do not have any skeletal issues. I will get an mri to see if anything pops out Very interesting, I have never heard of that. I would not be too considered especially considering you have no other issues. But definitely worth getting checked out. I started a new regimen to increase my DHT naturally, let us see if that reverse the damages And what does that regimen entail if you do not mind me asking. You developed a hole in your tailbone? As in a fissure that breaks the skin? I have had a pilinoidal cyst (google at your own risk) that describes a hole near the tailbone.  Is this musculoskeletal pain? Either way, go to a doctor or a physical therapist for pain like this. Could very well be completely unrelated to Finasteride.", "Some recoveries for you  It looks like this post has sadly been deleted - certainly, I cannot see any text below it, which is a shame because I would like to know more detailed about how he recovered, whether it came all at once or gradually and what his symptoms were. Stories like this are important to share, but it helps if people can actually read them! He just moved his original post to the proper section in the sub reddit.", "Taking a benzo ... Finally found a doc willing to give me Klonopin. I think the risk vs reward is tilted towards reward right now. I have not been able to relax enough and this pill is allowing me to do my job and I need my livelihood to stay a functional member of society .. even if it only works for a few months it is worth it for me .. Any advice on how to use this stuff smartly so that it benefits me the most and avoids addiction and tolerance buildup? I do not really need it for sleep .. just need it during the day so I can focus on things that need to be done. Be careful. I took 1mg daily for anxiety for 1-2 years and could not tell you what happened during that period of my life. Benzos feel like miracle drugs while you are on them, but be mindful of your dosing schedule. Taking a pill is such an uneventful part of your routine, but forgetting when you took your last dose and redosing can cause some serious blackouts do u have pfs? they say take no longer than three months so I will atleast stop for a month after 3 months How do they make you feel? Good .. normal but I have an addictive impulsive personality - same reason I carelessly took fin - I am going to have a friend if mine keep them from me only to dole them out when I truly need I think benzos usage is ok if you are prepared to have a really long hand careful taper schedule when you decide to come off. Klonopin is a tough one to taper because it is so potent so you will probably switch to diazepam and taper on that. Seroquel under 75mg might be worth it. Jn that doses it is used help for sleep (i know you dont need that specificalle). It keeps away painful racing thoughts easier because it blocks some of the recrptors for the hormone responsible tgat binds on it. Dosed in 150-400 it used for depression and higher even as antipsychotic. Keep it low, or you will get fat. It is a huge hunger booster above 75mg You cannot safely take Klonopin for several months! Do not do it!\n\nKlonopin is **extremely** hard to get off of once your body grows dependent on it. You can use it for a few weeks maximum, after that you will start to need a baseline dose just to feel like you did before you started taking Klonopin. Then to feel like you are actually on Klonopin, you will need a higher dose than before. Eventually your body gets used to that higher dose and that becomes the new baseline. Then eventually your doctor will cut you off because the prescription is too high, they think you are a drug addict, etc, and you will need to go to a doctor to detox and basically be treated for drug addiction. (Which is a lifelong problem.)\n\nIf you need to take it for two or three weeks so be it, but it is not a long term solution. When I used to take it, it would be for a week when I was having a crisis, maybe two weeks, and then every few months I would take one dose morning and one dose evening on days when I was very stressed out. Then I switched to meditation and exercise and I never need Klonopin anymore.\n\nYou can take it on a sporadic basis (not every day, not every week, maybe every month or two) and not get addicted but if you are taking it daily for months, you *will* get addicted. Doctors do this to patients all the time without realizing it or even warning you of the risk. Well my therapist recommended it, she said it is hard to work on any other coping skills when your anxiety is so high, I will try to use it as little as often but im at the point of losing my job if I cannot get it under control, I am nearing 6 months of pfs now", "Polling for fin side effects? If you guys can please help, for those who have taken fin and HAVE experienced side effects, what were the side effects, what was the dosage and frequency that you took and how long did it take for the side effects to show up. And if you are still on or off are you still experiencing side effects? Is there a shortage of this info? First time I took it: \nTook it MWF 1 mg for a week then had testicle pain (moderate)\n\nSecond time I took it: \n.5 mg every other day, I developed gynecomastia. And yes, I got it diagnosed by a physician. \nTook it for around 2-3 months. \n\nNow I am off fin completely. No sides. Started off with no sides, did not get any sides until about 5 months in. Started off with a sharp pain in penis when ejaculating. The biggest thing for me was that my facial hair grew extremely slow while on Fin and I started loosing leg hair. I also lost that drive I used to have in the gym. It is almost like it takes away that \u201calpha\u201d instinct in a man. I felt like I was just cruising instead of being in control. Then of course the sex drive got lower and lower the longer I took it. I have been off for about a week now and feel much better without it.", "Is this PFS symptoms? I used Saw palmetto topically once- yes you read that right 4 weeks ago and developed total erectile dysfunction(never had ED in my entire life)., decrease in libido and pain on top of the penis and testical pain.\n\nMy ED resolved in the next few days and a week later i got ED again \n\nThis ED again resolved to get back to ED 5 days later . I went to a urologist who was concerned and tested for the following:\n\nTestosterone - 34.7 ng/L (9-30ng/L ) ---- increased 11ng/L from previous testing of 23.8 ng/L 2 week ago.\n\nFSH : 5.2U/L (2-12)\n\nProlactin: 219 mU/L (45-375)\n\nOestradiol: 110 pmol/ L( &lt;200)\n\nLH : 3.8 u/L (2-9)\n\nIts been 4 weeks since i took saw palmetto. I think what is happening now is that my DHT has crashed and my body is producing large amount of testosterone to produce little bit of DHT. Its a matter of time till my body stops producing massive amounts of testosterone and i would be completely screwed. Pretty sure the above is synonymous with i dont want to say it but PFS. \n\nCan anyone tell me otherwise? It is not really possible to say - the endocrine system can take a while to straighten out, so the best thing you can do right now is to not freak out and cause yourself unnecessary stress - it is the last thing your body needs right now.\n\nTake care of yourself, and check back in after a month or two. OP, check after like 3 months and see if symptoms have subsided.", "If i am 2 months off and I still have like a little bit of sides, should I continue using minoxidil or quit? My sides never were strong only little ED, and I al still figuring if its from fapping or not, but If i do not recover after stopping porn, should I quit minox because it can prevent me from recovery? I would say yes. It is quite the potent antiandrogen, at least in vitro.\n\nBest case scenario it is not hurting you, worst case it is a hindrance.\n\nBut I see no scenario where it is actually beneficial. Yes, i would wait until 4 mont mark, I can already fap I think that is 100% and I can have sex but some times goes down that is why I am suspecting everything was from excesive porn, because I only have weaker erection, and less sensitive while using condom, but orgasm and somehow libido is fine, not brainfog or anything and I was using minixidil before finasteride for my beard like 2 years before, since 17 and I started fin at 19 so that is why Im going to wait I am not going to rush, I wonder if its quite potent why is never enough as standalone treatment for balding, I mean it always losses efficacy like en 2-3 years at best The antiandrogenic effect has only been tested in vitro (test type), not in vivo (in humans).\n\nSo we do not really know how potent it is, but some people have developed \"PFS-like\" symptoms on minox alone.\n\nAlso it is a prodrug who needs to convert through an enzyme to become active. It is likely this enzyme might downregulate as time progress, making it less potent.\n\nAlso remember androgens are not the root cause of hair loss, but merely a catalyst. Yeah and the thing is that the minoxiidil also has alfatradiol, I have seen that there is no any systemic effect but if after the three month mark is not solved I will use minoxidil alone for another month and then after one month quit everything to see if it helps, but I am like in a good way right now", "Finasteride - tell me your side of the story. Hi everyone,\n\nI just want to know more about the negative effects of finasteride on your health physically and mentally. I have read many negative stories related to using the medicine. However, the stories were not all clear and professionally evaluated. \n\nSo this is the post where you can share your side of the story but keep in mind that: \n- What is your side effect? \n- When do you feel the side effects?\n- How do you know the effects are real? Did you have a consultation with your GP about the effects or just self-diagnosed? \n- Do you think the negative effects also relating to your lifestyle? Are you eating healthy or not? Regularly exercise? \n- What do you do to help yourself? \n\nThank you. I was taking 1 mg daily of Finasteride for almost two years. Hair became thick and stopped falling out. I was happy. December 2020 I went home with someone and I could not get it up, like, not at all. Literally since then and ongoing now, I have been living in hell. I used to read this sub, and other subs, prior to my experience thinking that PFS was overhyped but dude. No. I could not believe it. And still cannot believe how fucked it is made my life.  \n\n\n\\- Side effects: No libido, left testicle shrunk (and has not come back), inability to concentrate, slurring of speech, TERRIBLE memory, panic attacks (although these seemed to have stopped), anxiety and depression. All of which I had never experience before.  \n\n\n\\- I feel them most of the time, but most noticeable in social settings I think. Also worse in the mornings for me.  \n\n\n\\- I have spoken to an endocrinologist and as well as my GP about this. Both of who have been super helpful. My endocrinologist has dealt with finasteride users a lot, and while she does not have specific answers or a one-size-fits-all treatment, it is nice that she seems to understand my symptoms and has explained to me what is going on.   \n\n\nI mean, some side effects I have, like inability to concentrate ARE self-diagnosed...because how else would they be diagnosed? But others like anxiety, depression and insomnia have been diagnosed by my GP.   \nThe one thing that is weird about this sub and others is that so many sufferers seem to find doctors that dismiss them? My endo and GP deal with finasteride users a lot and are aware and mortified by what it does to certain people. Their advice was basically get the fuck off it and never touch it again. Do not go through TRT, do not use MACA, stay away from anything that fucks around with your hormones.   \n\n\nI am not sure what you mean by your last question, but I mean, I like to go to parties every now and then and drink a lot...and yes, alcohol/hangovers do cause anxiety and sometimes depression but...this is not that. I am telling you, finasteride has ruined and ruled my life. I got faith I will get better, I really do, just hate the fact that I feel like I am wasting my years away currently because of a drug I did not do proper research into. What treatment has the endocrinologist &amp; GP recommended?  I have the same sexual side effects. Zero Libido. Erectile dysfunction. It feels like there is no connection between head and dick. I stopped taking Propecia 2012 and still have these nightmare side effects! I wish my doctor had never prescribed that shit!! \nWhat is your age? Here you go:  Because of the damage done to the Gaba channels, alcohol exacerbates the symptoms greatly.  I would avoid any gaba agonist. Regardless of the treatment, until the root of the problem is fixed, anything they do is just going to be a band aid approach, which, will not last forever.  You will be right back to square one. Exactly.  No connection whatsoever.   This is why TRT or any kind of hormone replacement therapy does not work.  The connection is neurological.  You can pump yourself FULL of testosterone and not feel shit.  And, to add insult to injury, most of it is going to aromatized to estrogen causing even more problems. Are u also affected? No....I was.  I am recovered.  I am simply here to help. How exactly did u recover please? What to do? What is ur age and how long did u take Propecia? This is EVERYTHING you need.: (\n\nI have been doing this for a decade.\n\nI am available to chat if you need: ( Simply here to promote your shitty herbs you mean? Horrible attitude.  \n\nFirst, the herbs are not shitty.\n\nSecond, the protocol is more then just the herbs.\n\nI'f you do not want my help, no one is asking you take it, but I have a forum full of guys who have recovered and are recovering as we speak.  Do as you wish, but do not put me down because you feel like shit.  Again, Im here to help.  You should be thankful. Elevated estrogen is not really a problem unless it is giving symptoms. People naively think estrogen =&gt; female hormone =&gt; bad for men but it is actually quite anabolic and essential to male health. If unwanted side effects start to occur most people just take an aromatase inhibitor and it is fixed pretty quickly. It can take some time to \"dial in\" to the right Test to E2 ratio but it is pretty standard protocol for TRT. \u201c\u2026we can help more people who can actually benefit from the medicine and have a fair viewpoint about finasteride.\u201d What does this mean? Can you clarify your intentions for this post please? I am sorry, but that is a ridiculous statement. Several of them actually.  Estrogen is only needed in small amounts for men.  If it goes to high, it does cause many  many problems.   It is a female hormone, and despite what you have read, it is NOT anabolic, this is why women can never develop muscles like men can.  And yes, they will throw an aromatase inhibitor in there.....great..more meds.  Do you know what the side effects of those aromatics inhibitors are? So add more horrible symptoms on top of what you are already dealing with? Smart. Guess what....none of it means anything until you fix the neurological connection.  Like I said, you can get it \"dialed in\" by the numbers on the test, but you are still not going to feel normal, and it is only going to end up causing more problems.  I have been doing this for ten years my man, believe me, I am not blowing smoke.\n\nThis is why you will NEVER see anyone recover from pfs with TRT......Not ONE  ... because of a drug I did not do proper research into...for this ...I did not do just a little look to the internet only about the fucking generic called Finural, I cold kill myself and I think every second why I did not check Finasterid in the internet. The package leaflet only says ED can rest after quitting the drug. And I thought 1 : 10 Impotence but no rest over two weeks. I did not informed myself about Finasterid and it is long time effects.\n\nSo I have gotten fully blown pfs fir half a year. I am 59 yo. Fucking urologist gave me Finasterid for my prostate just to try, a pharma muster package. I crashed in bed with the love of my live. This alone is death penalty. I lost her an my personality as a man, as a sexual being, as my former character as a creazy freakout. \n\nI am now like all the PFS victims a lobotomized and castrated zombie and no more human being anymore. My dick does not function anymore, I m half bedridden because of the fatigue, my muscle atrophy cones as cold feeling over my body. It is a killing joke a nightmare that I to this fucking cyc...B poison!! I can feel your pain in your words. Listen to me. You can do this but you have to want to. I do not think I have ever talked to someone in your age bracket before so you will respond slower than the rest is my guess but you should still check out the site because you do not have to stay that way. I feel for your man.  I took fin for about a year at the age of 22. Started with 1mg and worked down to .25mg because I was having sides. Convinced myself sides were just in my head and kept taking it. Eventually could not take it and stopped. \n\nSides: very frequent urination, low libido, numb/cold penis, disconnect between brain and penis (cannot tell if I am erect without looking or using my hand), weak erections, and constant tightness in perineum. \n\nIt is been about 1.5 years and I have seen some improvement. Most of my dick is still 75% numb. Erections recovered to a 4/5, but cannot get a full erection without cialis. Most improvements came because of pelvic floor pt. \n\nI have seen two urologists, a therapist, primary care physician, and now a Neurologist. The neurologist is sending me to a second neurologist to look at pudendal nerves. One of the urologist thinks I have Post Finasteride Syndrome, while the rest are neutral on whether PFS exists. \n\nNo way these are due to my lifestyle. I am extremely active and fit. Do not ride bikes or do anything that would cause numbness. Drs have given me all kinds of tests, most recently for diabetes, and they all come back negative. Testosterone levels are normal.  You do not want to get the herbs from Amazon that is the whole point of the website I have tried and tested hundreds of different herbs and lost Empire by far has the highest quality. That is why they are recommended and that is whatever one uses Same as everything else on the website Can you have sex without cialis/viagra ? I can, but it sucks having a weak erection Why no maca? Havent you tried tribulus and other herbs? Maybe they would help you. Wellbutrin? Gebaptine? What have you tried? But u suggest herbs that boost testosterone so what is the difference? You really need to read the website.  There is a HUGE difference in having your body create it is own juice as opposed to taking exogenous hormones.  And the herbs have other functions as well, not just boosting Test.  Again, the herbs are just ONE part of a big system..... I should be thankful? Please allow me to laugh. You do not have any more information than anyone else here. I have read all the studies on finasteride, minoxidil and many on SSRI. We clearly have a low understanding of the underlying issue.\n\nYou coming here telling suffering people they can recover 100% with your \"protocol\" is preposterous. All while you make money of these poor souls, without even disclosing it.\n\nAnd do not worry, I do not feel like shit. I actually feel decently well. Thanks for asking.\n\nThat is why I cannot stand a snake oil salesman as yourself coming in here and telling lies.\n\nPeople are free to try your method if they like, some of it is even quite good. But they should know that there is not even close to a 100% success. This is also evident if you take a quick glance over at \"your forum\". I am so sorry. I am fucking throwing away the 2 bottles I have now. I have been on it for 2 months now do you think I have hope of quitting cold turkey with no permanent effects?? I do not know if finasteride is actually the cause of what I went (and still going) through, but here goes.\n\nIn May of this years I was diagnosed with benign prostate enlargement. I was given some antibiotics (which wrecked havoc on my gut) and also finasteride and tamsulosin.\n\nI stayed on the course of antibiotics for 1 month or so, and the fin and tam for about 3 months. \n\nIn late August I began having SEVERE panic attacks. To the point I called the ambulance and went to the hospital four (4) times. It was chalked up to anxiety, although I had NEVER had anxiety before. \n\nI checked into an out-patient treatment facility and underwent CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), and they tried to put me on Lexapro (a strong SSRI), which I did take for about 6 days total, until refusing any further meds. The psych was pissed, but so what.\n\nI got better, but also developed some very weird symptoms. By this time I was not taking anything except my regular blood pressure (BP) meds:\n\n- Very high BP (like in the 160s/100)\n\n- Shakes (tremors)\n\n- Body twitches\n\n- Weakness\n\n- Overall sense of feeling unwell \n\nI have had a series of bloodwork done (some multiple times) and was found to be somewhat deficient in B12, low in D, low in choline, and something else (escapes my mind at the moment  ... it is 6 a.m. as I am writing this).\n\nI had testosterone checked and it is LOW. I also had a series of thyroid tests, which came back as relatively normal. I do have benign cysts on my thyroid that I have to have checked each year, but I had not done so since before the pandemic. \n\nAt any rate would vitamin deficiencies/low vitamin or mineral levels cause all of those symptoms?\n\nWhile I cannot blame this entirely on finasteride, discovering this forum has given me some insights as to what happened with me. You would have credibility if you were not trying to sell the world the herb and diet routine. If someone is cock shrunk and having no libido along with a handful of other sides with a Test level of mid 200\u2019s, which is considered hypogonadism, what makes you think the user would not benefit? Stop being a used car salesman Lol....Credibility is not the issue.  That is on lock to the people that have actually done the program and healed.\n\nYou do you bro.  Have fun.", "I feel like this is something everyone in this community should see. We are not crazy and this is a very real thing that is happening.  Thank you for posting this. I just sent this video to a friend today. Very important information. Nice to see it posted here too. Absolutely 100% correct. Thanks for posting.", "Retaking Fin? I may do a small experiment seeing as I have not had much improvements on the sexual side effects which has been my only symptoms. Anecdotally I have read some people have restored this by retaking fin and slowly tapered off, since I do not have much to lose, will be trying it. Oh boy. I wonder about this too, but I have heard a bunch of people have gotten worse after trying it. Yeah seems risky. How long have you been off fin? Approaching the 4 month mark, forgot to note but I will be trying this at the 1 year mark if no more improvements. Ohh okay. That is the same as me right now. Hopefully we both recover naturally before then! Do not do it. If you only have sexual side effects consider yourself lucky. You are obviously sensitive, why the fuck would you risk damaging yourself further?? Just take a look at the long list of side effects you could induce into yourself, why risk it.\n\n\n Permanant pfs can be caused if you start, stop, start so I would avoid it at all costs. What? where did you read that? lmao Lots of people have sides dissapear after 2-3 months... And for others they are permanently damaged for years Sure :D Post Finasteride Syndrome is very real dude. You will never understand how serious this condition is until you experience it yourself Yeah, if you use it for a long time with serious side effects. I do had side effects, and after 6 months I took a break, and sides went away after 3 days. Doubt people here loose their dick after a few weeks I took it for 7 weeks and have been suffering with severe PFS since. Some people take a couple pills and are damaged for life. Duration of exposure does not correlate to the severity of permanent side effects i used for 10 years it lowered my sex desires i forgot my morning moods i decided to stop it after 2 weeks i got back horny and i got my morning and evening and daiy woods, i am back energetic and horny. Glad you recovered so quickly! Remember never try fin again. You might not be so lucky the next time! This is what I have been questioning. See, I took 0.5 mg for 4 days. Then stopped. But after a short time (2 weeks max.) got back on for 4 months in total. I think the start-stop is definitely worse speaking from my experience. In the small window that I have stopped my recovery felt much faster and better. After quitting now I seem to have problems that stay. Never get back on this shit again. I see also no scientific reason why hopping on this again and tapering would work. I think if you start and commit and then stop it, the side-effects MIGHT be less persistent as your body only experiences one shock.", "If I do not care about the sexual sides, should I go for it? Honestly, only concerning thing to me is the brain fog. I hate thinking about my hair multiple times a day and am ready to do something about it (not shaving it). One thing to know is what DHT does for you.  I mean the benefits of having high DHT.  \n\nFinasteride can cause depression, and brain fog is real.  It is like cloudy tunnel vision. \n\nEven if you do not care about the sexual side effects, I would still recommend NOT taking it.    Too many horror stories.  \n\nIf you do take it, good luck! \n\nPlease keep us updated. The fact that you are on this sub means you do care. How is your sex drive right now? No. There is multitude of mental sides that can be much worse than any sexual sides. They can cost you your job and your life. For example, I got extreme, like extremely intense anxiety and it took a year to realize it is from finasteride, because of all the \"it is all in your head, bro\" mentality on the internet. I would say the mental side effects are far worse than the sexual ones. Depression, brain fog, suicidal thoughts, anhedonia, anxiety attacks, problems remembering words and names... finasteride can give you all those and more.\n\nYou might hate thinking about your hair, but you know what is worse? Thinking about whether you have become permanently brain damaged!\n\nI should say that the risk of this happening is small (nobody knows the probability), but when the potential side effects are so life-altering (and possibly permanent), it is an insane risk to take for a cosmetic problem. Yes, I do care about sides, just not the low libido or other sexual related sides. Seems like the most common sides are sexual related. I would hate to end up with the brain fog or suicidal thoughts though.\n\n\nSex drive is through the roof, which is why it would be a win-win (if I did not end up with other issues). I am not using it, so it is alright if it is lowered or extinguished completely. Yes, I have been on Rogaine about three years now. I think it is slowing down hair loss since I have not noticed a huge difference. I can still hide my bald spots with longer hair. This would not be a problem if I knew I could keep the hair that I have, but I honestly do not know if I am still losing it or not. By the time I do know, then it probably be too late. \n\n\nI know hair transplants can be good, but then you end up in the same spot if you do not maintain with rogaine and finasteride. How are you doing now? Yeah, I already have issues with remembering words, so I am guessing this would make it even worse. What is hard to understand about the symptoms is that they have no relationship with your existing tendencies or past diagnosis.\n\nNever felt anxious before? Well, now you do, 24/7.\nNever knew what depression even meant? Well, now you are in the middle of it.\nNever knew what mental illness even meant? Well, now you know!\n\nOn top of that, imagine going to a doctor and being told that there is nothing they can do, and that it is likely all in your head.\n\nI had a doctor say to me - \"have you considered the option that these symptoms might be permanent?\"\n\nThe chances are low that you will end up in the long term PFS hole, but once you are in there, you are so thoroughly screwed that you will wish every day that you did not take finasteride. I went to hell and came back, mentally speaking. Sexual sides are nothing compared to the mental side effects it can have. I experienced both. Sexual sides are not just low libido etc, it includes pain down there several months after quitting. I was lucky to recover after 3 months of stopping. I am just going to let you know I am 24 and I am a strong young guy. My sex drive was through the roof too. I was having sex up to 3-4x a day with my gf. I even masturbated some throughout the day. My sex drive was through the roof.\n\nAfter taking finasteride my sex drive disappeared, I can get a boner easily with stimulation, but I no longer have the feeling to desire sex. It is something I have to think about now. This has affected my relationship with my gf. \n\nHaving sexual drive is such a blessing we do not realize until it is gone. It is what causes chemistry with your partner and desire. If that is gone she will look for it elsewhere with someone who actually can list after her. Just how life works. You could be the most amazing guy but sexual desire is still there for her and if you cannot provide it she will get it from someone else.\n\nED is not just not being able to get a boner, any difference in libido or changes is ED. \n\nBe careful and good luck. Once you take it, you cannot go back, it is permanent. I am in a group in WhatsApp with over 200 men that have PFS and they are all trying everything to no avail.\n\nEdit: measure your balls also, they shrink with finasteride. The bigger your balls the higher your sex drive. I used to have 2.75\u201d long, now they are at 2\u201d barely. People who say it does not affect you are liars. Document everything for future reference. If you see any reduction in size get off it immediately. If I had caught in when they had just shrunk a little. I would not be where I am at. It is better, but it literally takes months to get better. It is debilitating. I have taken it for 2 years and have no side effects whatsoever. The risk of side effects is real but your chances of actually experiencing them are low and the chance that they are permanent are even less likely. There are millions of people using this medication to no problem - coming to a forum to find the small small subset of users who have experienced them is not wise in making a decision. It is not an objective sample size here This is a fair point, but I he is wise for seeking advice here. Most people are approaching the risk calculation with finasteride all wrong. \n\nGetting serious long-term side effects from finasteride is indeed very rare. BUT \u2013\u00a0the point is that the side effects are so life-altering (many suicides have been reported) and there is no way to predict if you will get them (being healthy in every way is no protection). So it can be compared with playing Russian roulette, with the twist that there is an unknown number of bullet chambers. How many chambers would there need to be before you feel like it is worth the risk for dealing with a cosmetic problem? Ok, suicide in an individualized case is incredibly complex. Attributing it directly to a medicine with mechanisms that do not act upon mood regulating compounds is almost impossible. And every time you get in a car you are playing Russian roulette. People get killed in car accidents all the time but the risk is accepted to get where you are going. \"Attributing it directly to medicine that do not act upon mood regulating compounds is almost impossible\".\n\nI think you should do a bit more reading on this. Finasteride blocks 5AR, which is involved in the metabolism of allopregnenolone and THDOC, two neurosteroids that regulate mood in a major way. Allopregnenolone levels is reduced in patients with PTSD and major depression, and allopregnenolone analogues are being trialed for treatment of post-partum depression (brexanolone, SAGE-217) as well. A Google search will tell you a lot more.\n\nSuicides have complex causes, sure - but that is just the most severe symptom of PFS. There are many other mental symptoms that are excruciating and life-altering (I mentioned some above). Establishing causality between finasteride and these symptoms is really hard, but there are strong indications that Merck knew about long-lasting, serious side effects when they performed their own clinical trials. But the trial results were not made public. Reuters got hold of some of the results via the recent propecia lawsuit though -\n\n Thanks to doing my research I knew about the side effects of Fin.  I just had my first panic attack on Friday and knew right away it was from the Fin.  Stopped immediately and have been off ever since.  I was doing .25 mg MWF for 2 months.\n\nI cannot even imagine going through that for a full year, one panic attack was enough to turn me off of this drug for good.  It was a humbling experience, and I am still experiencing the brain fog, a little anxiety, but I am thankful it will get better from here. Yep, experienced my first panic attack on Friday and I believe it was from Fin.  I am know feel empathy for those who suffer with anxiety and depression - this shit is no joke  Have you fully recovered and how long did it take?\n\nEdit: i took .5 four times spaced every other day. Last was Monday gone. Tuesday I got my first ever anxiety attack and the worst anxiety experience I have had. So I immediately stopped. Last night I had some penile discomfort nothing major, just slight uncomfortable sensation, and today woke up with dull testicular pain. Also since Monday I have had dull burn sensations on my nipples. And also today the anxiety has subsided, bit I am getting depressive gloomy feelings. None of the symptoms above is really bad, bit its not something I want to continue with. Praying this all subsides and I can forget all about this finasteride experience. I am getting better, still have minor brain fog.  Anxiety was pretty bad until today.\n\nI am took liveli focus tablet last night and this morning, I have no idea if those helped but I feel that I am more focused today and the brain fog that I was experiencing is not as bad I have no brain fog, i feel this is one of the only sides I have not experienced It is the worst Chances are low... what does that mean? What are the odds? Nobody knows, I am afraid. More research is needed, but you can be sure that Merck is def not going to fund that. \n\nAFAIK, the finasteride leaflet say that about 2% of users get serious side effects. It is a smaller sub-set of those who get long lasting or permanent symptoms.  \n\nSo you are looking at less than 1/100, but probably more than 1/10000 (judging by the membership at sites like propeciahelp). That sounds like really low risk, but considering the fact that it destroys your life should make people think hard before they pop these pills to grow hair. \n\nThink about it \u2013\u00a0would you play Russian roulette with a gun with a 100 chambers? Just for the sake of your appearance?\n\nI doubt that finasteride will be taken off the market soon (too profitable!) so the way forward would be to develop some kind of test that can predict your susceptibility to the side effects. Some mechanisms have been suggested - CAG repeats on the androgen gene, handedness(!), sexual orientation, etc. Not going to happen, I think. Merck does not care\u00a0\u2013 they will happily throw a few hundred thousand people under the bus, if it means they do not have to spend money on proper safety testing. Thanks. My only reservations are with the reference to Merck\u2019s own safety data.\n\n1. Sometimes people refer to studies done on older men (around age 65 taking Proscar for BPH or prostate cancer)\n\n2. Problems with safety reporting including: material number of dropouts who are not counted in adverse effect statistics, and lack of follow-up after discontinuation. See this meta-analysis:\n\nBelknap SM, Aslam I, Kiguradze T, et al. Adverse Event Reporting in Clinical Trials of Finasteride for Androgenic Alopecia: A Meta-analysis. JAMA Dermatol. 2015;151(6):600-606. doi:10.1001/jamadermatol.2015.36\n\n Yes, even the 2% number might be off. And the study groups were not always representative, like you said.\n\nI have also seen safety studies where they simply did not test for the presence of long term effects. Meaning, serious side effects were noted, but the study never followed up with participants after the initial trial period. Exactly. At every step, the incentives for pharma companies are to understate risks of the drugs they are trying to bring to market.\n\nThere are also particular methodological challenges in detecting sexual adverse effects because of the social taboo around sexual topics, and the stigma/shame of men admitting sexual dysfunction. Yes, totally. I should say that I do not think there is a conspiracy to poison people - Merck is just responding to incentives, and the approval process is not set up to detect side effects that has a 0.1-0.01% percent chance of occurring.\n\nBut there is enough evidence now to know that PFS is occurring, so doctors should at the very least make their patients aware of the dangers. There is not any \"black label\" on finasteride either. This is where the failure lies, if you ask me. A citizen petition about finasteride was filed three years ago. It recommended taking finasteride for hair loss off the market or adding a black box warning. As of now, FDA has not responded.\n\nCitizen Petition: \"Request FDA require the immediate removal of Propecia (and generic formulations of finasteride, 1 mg, for androgenic alopecia) from the market\"\n\n\n\nThe pace of publishing on finasteride adverse effects has picked up in the last few years:\n Hah, the FDAs response the petition was pretty funny. Basically \"it is too much work to figure this out\". I had withdrawals with finasteride. I would have a hard time remembering things people told me and have a hard time paying attention to what they are saying in front of me. \nWithdrawal probably lasted over a month. I wonder if this is why I quit my job. I have been off finasteride for over a year, but have had increased anxiety before I had quit. I am now on Prozac to get it under control. \nNote: I have always had anxiety since I was a child - just wondering if the withdrawal made it worse. No. See ( Are you speaking from experience? If so, have you felt any better?  \nI agree completely about the mental side effects being wayyy more worrisome versus the physical ones, so I am on the fence of taking fin...\n\nI am worried that even if I am okay for the first month or so, it could hit me like a brick years down the road or when I decide to stop. How long were you on it? How long did it take for sides to hit? Glad you recovered! Yes, this has been my experience. \n\nI had no experience with any form of mental illness before finasteride... It is not in my family, and I would never had any kind of problem before. I did not really understand what it was, and no empathy for people with those kinds of problems. Now that I have struggled with finasteride-induced side effects for ten years, you could say I have been humbled... I have cycled through a lot of different kinds of mental issues because of finasteride  - anxiety, panic attacks, memory problems, slurring of words, sluggishness (feeling incredibly slow and stupid), anhedonia (lack of emotions and motivation, no appreciation of anything pleasurable), brain fog, being constantly tired, lacking libido, depression, de-realization, I thought I had been brain-damaged and would never be able to hold a job.\n\nThat is tough punishment for taking finasteride for a few days. For a while I thought \"this cannot be happening to me\" and that it was all a bad dream that I would wake up from. Nope. \n\nAfter many years of hard work, and a lot of money spent experimenting with various treatments, I am at a point where I can work full time and maintain social relationships. But I am not the same person anymore, and I have not seen much improvement with sexual symptoms. Erections are OK, but that does not matter much when you have got anhedonia and no libido. \n\nI should say that the chances are low that this will happen to you. Most people have no problems. Some have side effects that go away once you stop fin. The odds are on your side. But it is a difficult risk calculation to make when the potential side effects can be so life-altering. Hey! I was on it for 3 weeks. 1 week after quitting, the sides began hitting. After a month, they peaked, and from then recovery began. Are you struggling?", "Update Yesterday I had 0 libido and 0 erections. I was scared shitless. But today, I had morning wood. I also saw a picture of a hot girl on snapchat and I felt aroused. Also saw a seducing video on youtube and got an erection. Im guessing I had a crash? Because I took it for 5 days and quit because of balls aching. I could have sex without issues during that time. Only 2 weeks later I get hit with the libido and erection side effects. Is this a good sign? I dont really have any other sides besides this. You will be fine. You were me two weeks ago with the same exact sides. It is hard not to focus on it, but try to relax, do other things. You got mornjng wood. It is your mind doing this to you more than the sides at this point. Try to stay off this forum as much as you can, do not read pfs shit and get a normal routine in place. \n\nIf you are like me, night time when you sleep is the hardest to do this. Play some music and any time you start freaking out, this about the fact you got morning wood, you got aroused, and the fact I am saying you actually will be 100% fine. Thanks man :) No problem.

Good looking man appreciate you How long did it take you to fully recover ?", "I hate finasteride I think we all agree on that.

The meds were recommended to him by a well-meaning friend who would been a long-time, happy user. \n\nIt took about 18 months and some truly terrible &amp; terrifying consequences for my guy to stop use after 24 months.

It is not any safer in the end Actually not completely true.\n\nYes, topical finasteride will always go systemic due to its molecular weight. But studies like in one of those mentioned in OP's link, show a significant lower serum DHT compared to scalp DHT at lower dosages of topical finasteride.\n\nIt can be a wise choice to go for the topical route if you are worried about side effects, but have decided to take finasteride anyway.\n\nSorry to hear about your PFS though, hope it will get better for you.", "Hi quick question about arousal and libido.

Has your hair got worse after quitting fin? Nope, had great gains from minox and never had much shedding. This was ruined when I had to quite fin after a month. Currently just using keto minox and derma rolling. Does not seem to be doing much. Shit really sucks when you are barely even 18. Still loosing clumps of hair 4 months later and have very low sex drive with terrible depression. Tried oral minoxidil (prescribed by hair loss specialist) and it worked wonders but completely reset the little bit of recovery I felt from quitting fin (guess it also ranks DHT when that amount is absorbed systematically) so I had to stop that and lost even more gains. Finasteride has more than likely killed the best years of my life. I am just hoping that by the time I am 22-23 my fin sides will be completely gone and I can just accept being bald. Considering looking into the broccoli sprout protocol from tressless, mostly waiting to see anecdotal proof from a few people on the dedicated sub because it seems like BS atm. I have not started this yet in fear it will fuck up my fin sides even more. After going through this nightmare I do not really know how you could give a fuck about your hair.\n\nReally put how un-important hairloss is in perspective. I mean I still care about my looks, I still dress nice and shower and would like to keep my hair healthy even though inside I am recovering Bro I feel you, I was almost recovered and I started using Fluridil which is supposed to be side free, and it fucked me hard. I tried minoxidil ~1 year after quitting fin, but it just caused massive shedding with no sign of abating after 6 months, so I stopped. Also I did not like what it did to the texture of my hair. So my hair is kind of bad right now. I wish I did not care about it so much, but I am pretty insecure. There is no free lunch bro. Sorry to say.\n\nSome just tolerate the sides better. Massage scalp 10 minutes every single day and no shampoo. No regrowth on hairline but the dht itch was gone. I remembered when i consume too much sugary foods/drink my scalp would itch. Fluridil bind to androgen receptor from my understanding and so it did not work like fin. Lucky the binding effect will last maybe a week or so but then you should be back as your hormones should have not been alter by fluridil Hair transplant Hang in there brother. I am 2+ years down since I quit. Took fin for about 5 months and started seeing effects on the 5th month. Low libido and not able to get a full erection. \n\nRight now, some days, rarely I get a. 100 percent, if I am in the mood as well. Else it is at a 75 let us say and I am hoping it will further improve down the line with my food intake and working out are you concerned it will all fall out within a few years without fin? It doesnt fall out, you dont need fin In the exact same boat as you. Had almost recovered from fin when I introduced fluridil since it is apparently free from side effects. Not the case at all, been about 5 months since.", "Finasteride side effects recovery. Please help Hi all. Just wanted to know if you could give me an idea about your experiences with finasteride recovery. I was on 0.25 mg for about 14-18 months daily. I had on and off side effects where they were either there and gone during different stages. The side effects included loss of libido, my erections were only at about 60-80 percent and my ejaculate was often watery. I have been off the drug for exactly 3 months and have improved only slightly. I am still experiencing libido and erectile issues. SOMETIMES whilst practicing nofap for a few days/ weeks I notice improvement, however each day is different and the side effects remain persistent. I do not wake up with morning wood either. \n\nThe doctors indicate that it takes 3-6 months to recover fully so that is positive, others say that it could be in my head - I just struggle to see how psychogenic issues could be the source due to the lack of morning wood. \n\nDoes anyone think that it takes longer than 3-6 months given I was on the drug for close to 18 months?\n\nAny responses/ advice on how to fix and tackle the issues would be greatly appreciated! \n\n* I am a 25 year old healthy male, I do smoke but I exercise regularly and eat relatively well.\n\nThanks Im sorry to say this, but there is no guarantee you will recover in 3-6 months. Many people do recover in that time frame, however. I have been suffering from PFS for three years. I have improved a lot since baseline, but definitely still symptomatic.\n\nThe best way going forward is to live as healthy as possible. You could get your hormones tested for deficiencies and attempt to treat them, but many people report no improvement of symptoms with TRT and some may even feel worse. Unfortunately there is no guarantee of recovery. I have had the same symptoms as you for seven years. \n\nI ageee with P1234\u2019s comment: live as healthy as you can. Try not to let anxiety or depression get the better of you. If possible, redirect your energy into plans and relationships. It is not in your head. The symptoms you report are PFS-type symptoms that appear to be from neuroendocrine changes, and not psychogenic. You can point any doubters, who know how to read science papers, here:\n\nAdverse effects of finasteride: a research bibliography\n\n\nThey could start with the 2020 paper by Traish called \u2018Post-finasteride syndrome: a surmountable problem for clinicians\u2019.\n\nOther authors to look at: Melcangi, Belknap, Zakhem, Kiguradze, Irwig. How are you now mate? I have done a lot of research that has eased my mind, and I feel like I am recovering, probably at 90% right now. I was having awful panic attacks and not able to get an erection some days at all despite porn or any stimulation. It was awful. But, here is what I found out. Finasteride permanently binds with 5 alpha reductase, so once you stop taking it, your body has to make more 5 alpha reductase, which has a half life of 30 days, so even though the medicine is out of your system, after 30 days, you still have only 50% \"unblocked\" 5ar. It may be slower for some people. And even then, your body has to build back up DHT also, which may take even longer. But that seems to be why it does not just stop when you stop the medicine. I tried everything, even CBD, which seemed to make it worse. My erections are as sensitive as they used to be, and I do not get nearly as horny, but I feel better than I did. I am at 40 days right now.", "I was told Finasteride is safe how wrong that was I took Finasteride for 5 months before I realized it was doing damage. I miss my orgasm. What are u doing now? Can the side effects be reversed? No I am really sorry to hear that. I am also dealing with a side effect months after having stopped it. I recommend getting a hormone blood test to see if your estrogen is elevated or if your testosterone is low as a result of the finasteride. It may be reversible if that is the case. Good luck homie My blood exam showed 631 ng/dL testosterone level You cannot get it up or you cannot orgasm? The latter Would you consider it delayed ejaculation? Or are you losing your erection part way through? Both And how long have you been off finasteride? 10 months Have you seen a urologist? Yes I have What has he suggested or recommended? Nothing Maybe find another one? Thanks Also see you are the guy posting memes. Are you a troll? No I am sure your urologist gave up after repeated one word answers. I do not blame him. By the way are you member on Propeciahelp forum? If so let me know I have not heard of it. Testosterone is not the pfoblem with this. We fucked up our androgen receptors so the body cannot use the testosterone properly. Interesting. How do you know finasteride specifically fucks with the androgen receptors and not something else? If you have a source id love to read up more on it and learn. Thanks bro \ud83d\ude4f It is a well known fact drugs like SSRI's, Accutane and Finasteride causes \"Androgen Deprivation Syndrome\".\nAndrogen receptors turn Testosteron into DHT. When that does not happen. You feel weak (without actually having loss of muscle mass), you have no libido (without actually having lower testosterone) etc. Why is it so hard to get a study to prove it? I mean it seems obvious that it happens in some men. I do not think it is common at all but it is such a severe side effect that it probably should be taken off the market.

I hate what I have become.\n\nI am becoming isolated and have been worryingly suicidal the last couple of days. But what does it matter who I talk to anymore. There is never any relief.\n\nIs there still hope?  Sometimes it is a little bit better, but I always crash to baseline over and over again. There is always hope brother\nFocus on the small and good things in life\nAttitude is everything Sorry to hear you are struggling - these side effects are indeed awful and isolating.\n\nIf your cognitive issues are not too bad, I would focus on your own mind - this is what shapes your day to day experience more than what you are doing sexually. One way to improve the mind is through meditation - that really helped me not to go completely crazy, but there are other techniques too.\n\nFocus on what you can control and try to improve those things, whether it is redecorating, eating nicer food, upgrading your career, getting in serious shape, making $$, or learning an instrument.\n\nTry to maintain relationships with people that do not stress you out. Do not worry so much about others and what they may think. You are playing this game on a harder level.\n\nSide note - there is activity on the scientific front happening, and many are confident that we will find a solution in this decade. Donating to those scientific initiatives could bring about solutions sooner. (Either PFSNetwork or the PFS Foundation). I am also suffering from PFS for more than 2 years now, it sucks... However, never lose faith, and do not despair. Good things always come, life is not fair, but we have to live our own lives with what we have got. Hang in there strong, you are not alone. Saw palmetto gave you side effects? I believe so. Hey brother. Over these past two years, would you be able to say that you have improved by any extent at all? Thanks man. Trying to hang in here but it is getting harder and harder. I tried many therapies and medications to treat the depression but how could it work? It is the fact I am basically a castrate that makes me fucking depressed.\n\nI cannot live like this. The only reason I am here is because of family and because maybe I still hope it will get better. But not many who experience genital shrinkage and numbness seem to recover. Fuck this shit &gt;re not alone.1ReplyShareSaveEdit\n\nI have!!!\n\nBack in the day i was in university and i could not even study because of cognitive issues, i was near depression and had no libido nor motivation to do thigns, i remeber i could not have sex with girls and i did not know what was the reason. Two years later, after cutting all medicines (finasteride, minoxidil, etc...) and taking vitamins, i have improved, slowly but surely. There are good months and bad months, there are months where i can feel better and see results such as a little bit of libido and can get a propper erection for some time and there are months where it feels as if a still used finasteride. I know how lonely it can feel, but you have to trust the process, the human body is resielient, meaning that it has  \nthe ability to spring back into its original shape, and this includes the brain. In conclusion, there is light at the end of the tunnel even if right now you do not see none and most importantly, you are not alone. You are not alone in this man, in my case it felt as i was chemically castrated, my left testicle shrank and i was diagnosed with varicose veins because of this drug. My semen went solid and yellow and i had 0 libido, also had so many cognitive syntoms, in conclusion, i had a full depresion, feeling no emotions but anxiety. I complitly understand how you feel, however, i want to let you know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. I have seen some recovery results, there are good months and bad months. After no use of any kind of drug, my testicle hurts less, my semen quality has improved (at least visaully) and i still have some issues with memory but i feel happier. There is ALWAYS hope, i always say to myself that the body is reselient, meaning it has the capacity to go back to its original shape, to some people it takes more time that others, but bro, you have to be strong and hang in there, just imagine how good it will feel when you start to recover, BECAUSE YOU WILL, fuck the noise of people that say that there is no going back, BECAUSE THERE IS, i used to think the same way. In my case there is no magic thing that makes ou recover, i take some general vitamins, meditate and do some sport. But it is your body that will decide when to start recovring, you can only help it being healthy. I hope my message helps you bro, because there is so many good things in living (even though this fucking pill makes you not feel interested in them), once you start recovering it feels that you are being borned again. Hang in there bro, patience is key. Also, id like to tell you that in my case libido and erections have improved, i can have proper sex (also depending on the month), but in conclusion, i have had genital shrinkage and numbness and i have seen exponential results, so do not trust all the negativity you see on the internet, just stay with the positive things and ignore the negative ones. You are amazing, brother, for saying that our loud. I needed this. I went through the same and I never really thought it was Finasteride for the first two years, even though I quit fin before that. It is been almost 4 years now, there are some improvements but not a lot. Until now I have done nothing but take multivitamins and try to workout regularly. I am going to start rotating some herbs every day that I saw on a protocol made by a person named CDsnuts. It involves gathering a lot of herbs and having one each every day for 3 months to even 2 years, but the recovery testimonials are looking great and I am also trying to stay positive about it. \n\nThank you so much once again for replying, if you have any doubts you want to ask you may DM me, I am pary of a whatsapp group with 100+ men who have PFS but a lot of them are slowly recovering/recovered mostly. Thanks so much for this post :) Gives me hope as I continue to fight to recover. Thank you for existing U need therapy I think you have severe mental illness. So you lose all sexual function and more, and then get blamed for being depressed\u2026 real class act.\n\nI have been in therapy for two years. It helps. But no change in symptoms. \n\nGood luck popping your fin pills. Bro u are literally 1/1000000000. Lmao no one gets numb dick from saw palmetto. I genuinely hope things get better for u bro \ud83d\udc4d Well, I did. A lot of fin users do too. It is real.\n\nThank you. I hope so too, but it is not looking good.  How long were you on finasteride for ? When after quitting did you first begin feeling improvements in sexual sides ? And with time has it actually gotten better ? Yeah sure, dm me your whatsapp number and I will ask the guys there (admin) to add you That guy is a fucking loser who obviously has his own issues if he needs to put other ppl down. You are not alone there are thousands of us who are like you. Look at me, I was a top athlete all my life, played hockey, football, baseball and I only took fin for 2 months and did not have any sides on it so I stopped bc I was like nah I do not need my hair it is okay and then I immediately developed symptoms and I have full blown PFS 2 months later still.... so do not listen to these fucking knobs who say it is just in your head. They are miserable pieces of shit :) Same, though I was just on saw palmetto. Very fit, soccer, gym, running\u2026 developed severe symptoms suddenly after 1 year. It is even worse when everyone thinks you are just crazy. So fucking isolating. let those monkeys be\n\nit seems they are all in denial psychosis just to convince themselves \"will never hit me, will never hit me\" and repeating that between each other. They would not be so aggressive if that was not the case. They are insecure at the bottom. As they are anyway. realistically we will not get better in our lifetimes aside from a few that have superhuman recovery abilities. Bullshit Is it because you are scared that pfs might be true, you must come here and ridicule someone who is already suffering beyond anything you could ever imagine?\n\nGo pop your fin pill.", "Has anyone ever experienced an unstable neck from Finasteride? I am one of those rare individuals who has had severe side effects from topical Minoxidl - my story is too long to narrate now in full, but essentially it appears that Minoxidil did something to damage my collagen, or connective tissue, changing the soft tissue all over my body and weakening my muscles. One of the complications of this has been increasing neck instability - to the extent that I am currently being evaluated for cervical cranial instability. Anyway... The reason I post is that I have heard rumours that some people have these same symptoms - skin changes, softening etc. all over the body and instability in joints including the neck. Apparently some users claim to have been almost paralysed by this and had to have operations to fuse their necks. I appreciate this is quite a specific thing to ask about but does anyone know anything about these side effects or users that have suffered from them? How can I track them down? I would like to speak to some of them. Thank you. My body and cognition changed significantly after taking Finasteride. Please watch my video and share.  So your side effects are from Minoxidil not Finasteride? Apparently, yes. I have never taken Finasteride. However, I am posting here because I have heard of, and now read, reports of similar side effects to the ones I am suffering from from Finasteride, as well as Accutane, and want to find out more in the hope of clarifying my prognosis, first, and learning about a possible underlying common mechanism. Jesus. I have just watched your video and am incredibly sorry to hear about what you are going through. I am lucky in some ways, in that I have not had any cognitive problems, however I suffer from muscle weakness and increasing problems with my skin and health - apparently from collagen/connective tissue - so I can sympathise with that. I can also sympathise with being systematically ignored and even laughed at by doctors. It angers me that people like yourself are constantly dismissed and that PFS is so poorly researched. I hope that one day things improve for you. I have the same skin, muscle, and health issues. There is nothing that was not affected besides tinnitus - I did not get that. Please share, comment and like the video. If I can stop just a few men from taking Finasteride, it will be a success", "My PFS Story Late 2018 I made the biggest mistake of my life, to take a drug prescribed to me by my doctor. That drug was Finasteride. I was 22 and my hairline had started to recede, I noticed more hairs than normal in the shower, panicked and hopped on finasteride without giving it much thought or research. I have always been the type of guy with a \"fuck it she will be right\" attitude. I was not even aware of the severity of the side effects or that there was an entire syndrome of permanent  debilitating side effects caused by this drug.\n\n7 weeks into treatment I did not feel quite right. My sex drive was severely diminished and I just felt more lethargic and weaker than usual. I decided to stop the finasteride after doing some research and concluding it was more than likely the finasteride that was contributing to my symptoms. This is when all hell broke loose. \n\nFor the next week or two after quitting I was hyperandrogenic - I felt amazing, I felt like superman, insane sex drive, non stop random erections, great confidence - I wish I could have felt like this permanently, I suppose this is how bodybuilders feel on steroids.  I then experienced a severe crash. Extreme brainfog, debilitating fatigue and lethargy, limp dick, no sex drive - I just wanted to stay home in bed and sleep all day because of how debilitating the fatigue was. My testicles also atrophied severely at this point. I was also experiencing severe amounts of stress and anxiety because of the whole situation. My symptoms were severe and every facet of my life was impacted. It was like a light switch and my life has never been the same. Just writing this post triggers some PTSD in me. Those who have PFS can relate to what I am saying - the first weeks / months after crashing were truly the depths of hell, an experience I would not wish on my worst enemy. \n\nTwo years later I have made amazing progress towards recovery. Many of my severe symptoms are resolved. Recovery is very slow and it takes a lot of patience. However unfortunately I still experience many of the signs of androgen deficiency like fatigue, zero sex drive or libido, testicular atrophy, etc, (despite having good T levels), so I plan to try TRT very soon  to see how I feel with elevated androgen levels. \n\nMy theory is during the hyperandrogenic stage our body is flooded with DHT during what i coin the \"DHT rebound\". The body then overcompensates to the extremely androgenic state by downregulating the HPTA, androgen receptor expression and neurosteroid synthesis. I suspect this induces a state of androgen resistance and consequently we need more testosterone to saturate the receptors and illicit a normal response, hence my driver to experiment with TRT. I also plan to experiment with progesterone and low dose fluxetine for their positive effect on neurosteroids and allopregnanlone. \n\nThe top contributors to my recovery thus far:\n\n1. Eliminating all stress entirely from my life. Easier said than done I know, but stress is the #1 killer. If you are stuck in that wired stressed state it will be impossible to recover period.\n2. Sleep. Your body heals itself while you sleep. Getting good high quality sleep every single night is crucial to recovering. \n3. Echoing the first point, you want to focus on keeping your body calm and relaxed - parasympathetic nervous system. This is the state your body heals in.\n\nSome other tips:\n\n1. Do not look for health in supplements\n2. Practice gratitude and gratefulness regularly \n3. Avoid forums and recovery sites, these are helpful for info but it will only fuel your anxiety and depression\n\nSorry for the mess of a post. I was reading some posts on r/tressless  claiming that PFS is just a delusional disorder and nothing but mental illness. This really offended me, the torture and hell I have been through due to drug induced bodily damage, as I said I would not wish it on my worst enemy. Anyway, it motivated me to share my experience here, I do not want to be attacking people on these forums for sharing a different view than me, but I thought if I could share my experience it may just help someone out or help give someone the information they need to not start finasteride.\n\nIf you are reading this and considering going on finasteride, my message to you is simple. This is the most harmful, debilitating and destructive drugs towards men on the planet. You are playing russian roulette with your health.\n\nStay strong PFSers Yeah hormones are real complicated and everyone needs a different profile to feel normal from what I understand. I do still think since you are young and you are being proactive that you will recover more and more. It is taken me years to feel good, I remember actually not being able to have good erections for a while. That is probably the last thing that is lingered for me, but has drastically improved to the point where I can satisfy my partners again confidentially. I think you dealing with this plus doing the sensible thing to shave or buzz your head will build a very strong future you. Especially since you are only 24, women will begin to get used to the hair loss thing by the time you approach 30. Just keep a good physique. I have gotten just as many women, honestly more after shaving my head. Was also able to get women I normally would not have been able to with a decent head of hair and that is because some really hot women love masculine men. And confidentially rocking a bald heals oozes masculinity. Becomes less important the older you get for sure. But all in all since you have only been dealing with this for 2 years, I think by 5 you will see many more improvements. I know you have read into the science and things have changed inside your body but you still need time. The most convincing recovery stories from the horrific PFS crash I have read usually took more than 2-3 years. Off the top I remember 4-7. So, I believe Thanks for the encouraging words man, I appreciate it. The way I have kept myself sane through this is through my mindset, I am looking at this as an opportunity for growth and development. I will be so much stronger once I overcome this illness, I will be able to appreciate the smaller things in life so much more once recovered, this is an opportunity for change &amp; growth. \n\nAll the best man. Thanks for sharing your story and appreciate the words of encouragement. Glad to hear you are doing much better. Cheers Thank you I appreciate that. You got this man, you have the right mindset and you have already seen massive strides in healing and you see others around you who have healed. Let me know in a year from now how you feel. Deal? I will do man. I will set a reminder to message you \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d Im still not convinced about its existance (Im absolutely not saying this in a delusional arrogant way!) I am currently experiencing very low, depressed mood, aswell with anxiety. I do not have any physical side effects however. There are quite a few stressing factors in my life atm, and i just cannot \"label\" myself with a syndrome that has yet to be proven. I think its unwise for anyone to label himself with a condition that does not nessecarily exist. I do however believe your are sincere about how you feel and wish you the absolute best.  \nWhat are your thoughts on Post-accutane-syndrome, resulting in all the same sides as pfs, yet every dermatologist is willing to prescribe in when severe acne is observed?   \n\n\nKind regard ! It is very easy to dismiss PFS when you do not have it. \n\nPost Accutane Syndrome, PSSD and PFS all share very common similarities. No one knows the direct mechanism of action and more studies need to be done for these conditions to become more widely accepted.\n\nYou could say the same thing about PSSD. PSSD is now a medically recognised condition yet doctors freely prescribe antidepressants to anyone who visits their office. There just needs to be more cases and more research done before these conditions are more widely accepted.\n\nLook up the law suits against Merek and the suicides.", "FDA Side Effects Monitoring System Guys, the number of reports in the FDA system and other organizations is dramatically low. PFS will never be recognized among medical community unless we get up our fucking asses and publish as many reports as possible. We can continue doing bro science but so far based on the number of officially submitted report PFS does not exist. We deal with criminal shit that they have been trying to hide hiding side effects, not publishing warnings and ignoring the reports on adverse reactions.\n\n500 reports on finasteride induced adverse reactions? Really want them to recognize PFS?\n\nReport your sides now  ( \n\n\n\n", "PFS I am worried about the amount of cum/semen I am releasing. Since I masturbate daily, I get worried that the amount is not enough and that I may have PFS. Masturbating more than once a day makes the cum very transparent and watery which also really makes me anxious. I feel the orgasm but there is also this feeling of anxiety with it and so the amount is not enough. I have tried to wait a few days before masturbating and I think that usually increased the amount of cum/semen I produced. It is just very worrying that the amount I am releasing may not be enough and that I may have PFS. Before PFS, if I masturbated more than once daily I would definitely get less ejaculate and it would be more watery. I think this is common. If you do not have any other worries, I do not think you have PFS - just anxious about the situation. Thank you for reaching out. Were you on the drug at the time? Right now? No. Been off 3.5 years and still symptomatic. No I mean when you experienced the watery semen and all that. Yes. Initial side effects is what made me come off. So the less ejaculation and the watery semen were caused by the drug as well, right? Because I have been off for 8 months now and I do not remember experiencing this when I was taking the drug. I took it for 3 weeks and it definitely made my cum feel watery and the orgasms would not be as intense. I think there is a direct co-relation to PFS. It took me about 3-4 weeks to feel normal again but I still think my cum is not the same as it was before. Might have decreased my sperm count.", "First time here Hi all, i am a boy of 22 and i am starting to go bald, i went to a dermatologist who prescribed me the CARETOPIC spray, a drug based on finasteride. After buying it, I read the instruction leaflet and read some really alarming things, I informed myself through some papers and tomorrow, being today Sunday in my time, I will send an email where I ask for more information about the side effects.\n\nThe dermatologist told me that this spray is quite new and does not have the negative effects that the systemic pill had. I would like to ask you, any of you who have post-finasteride syndrome, have you taken it using the spray or the pills? \n\nI used the drug for the first time last night, trusting and not reading the package leaflet, after 30 minutes I went to rinse the part of my head where I had used it, frightened by the effects I have read about. One thing that made me worry is that there were not many experimental studies about it (of the spray version), which is fundamental to obtain solid results, any thought?", "Recovery I am young, between 18-24, took finasteride for a week because I was feeling insecure ab my hair, I was unsure if my hairline was receding, I have always had a wack hairline (I can manage though with long hair) to begin with but figured better safe than sorry. On the 7th day it was harder to \u201cget hard,\u201d I also got concerned after reading more plates more dates discussing how you should have baseline bloodwork for testosterone (which I had), estrogen, and some other thing (I did not have it for the two others), I freaked out and stopped taking fin cold turkey. Now after one week of being off, I have seem to gone back to baseline, woke up with morning wood, got to say, I do not think I will ever go back on that shit, or if I do, it will be a long time before I do.\nI took zinc during my recovery week, the first time I threw up because I just had a large meal and then went straight to working out, the second time I cut the pill and took it split up before eating a meal (this worked)\n\nJust posting this to show you can recover &gt;it will be a long time before I do\n\nYeah do not try it again man. You might not get so lucky again. Yep da meme boi Agreed, many people have used it once and gone back to baseline. Just to try it again and develop full blown PFS... Yeeeeeeeee", "Hormone levels independent from brain changes in anemone fish. Our results demonstrate that the anemonefish brain is capable of actively transforming and reorganizing itself from the male type to the female type long before vitellogenic oocytes appear in the gonads. Fluctuating plasma levels of gonadal hormones do not appear necessary for feminization of the brain, as E2 remained low and consistent as the brain feminized, and 11KT shifted down in both dominant and sub- ordinate fish in association with reduced testicular tissue. It is still possible the gonads provide substrates required for brain feminization, such as testosterone, which is then aromatized in the brain for initiating the neuroanatomical changes. Alternatively, testosterone could be supplied by cells from within the brain (Mensah-Nyagan et al., 1996). Future studies where males are gonadectomized before they are paired together would be able to arbitrate between these possibilities. The conclusion that brain feminization in anemonefish is orchestrated from signals originating from within the brain rather than the gonads is consistent with the dominant hypothesis in mammals that the POA feminizes in absence of gonadal influences (McCarthy and Arnold, 2011). Anemonefish provide a window for discovering the cellular, biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying active femini- zation of the brain in vertebrates. \n\n", "Anyone having success with HCG?

Tried to brush it off thinking maybe it was all in my head so i took the pill one more time and then I realized it was not in my head and that I legit feel different. Have not taken the pill for 4 days and still feel somewhat out of it.. anyone experience this? Do not take anymore worst mistake of my life Yeah I am definitely not what are your sides No libido cannot barely get hard without manual stimulation and it is got good days and bad days but I just quit so hopefully it improves.

Had ringing in my ears and depression and anxiety apparently caused by a deficiency I have fulfilled soon after taking a GABA pill, I will see if it is a continued deficiency I have to continue fulfilling.

Anxiety attack the next day in the evening did a water fast the following day which must of helped as I was able to sleep fine that week then anxiety kicked in again and I have had insomnia for the last two nights I just cannot shut off. Ed has improved slightly in terms of strength and how long it stays up for. Been told when it comes to recoveries after very few pills, best case scenario, can take anywhere between a week and 3 months. I do believe diet contributes to how severe the anxiety attacks can get. My main issue right now is the insomnia and due to covid I cannot speak to a DR although I have heard to avoid sleeping pills incase of dependence Been off it for a week I am at the point where I guess im slightly feeling better I wasnt as horny as I used to be but when I was on it but now my drive is back to normal just waiting on the foggy ness to clear up.. try to chill out man most of the time it can be the anxiety getting to you which causes shit like ED, Insomnia etc.. you are going to be fine. If your anxiety gets too crazy and is fucking with your sleep and the way you function. Try smoking some cannabis (if you can tolerate it well) or have your doctor prescribe you some anti anxiety drug to ease you off (temporarily) until you are sleep is back to normal... Keep us updated bro Do you mind telling me how you reached the owner of the PFS foundation? Hope you overcome this. Just relax dude, hopefully you can have a swift recovery. Sides like this are incredibly rare. Thanks for the advice Bro much appreciated. I am on a water diet and since yesterday and around 8pm I suddenly felt fine to the point where my Ed was the only remaining issue.

Do not really want to go down the weed route but wanted to know if cbd oil could be an option? Thanks again Good shit man I can see you recovering in ASAP. CBD works as well but it might make you feel somewhat \u201chigh\u201d from personal experience.

I had been in a great spot in my life and had no reason to feel this way so I got off the pill. I have been 7 days off the pill and compared to where I was I have seen a marginable improvement in my mental health. Just days ago I was seriously considering suicide and/or withdrawlment from my everyday activities simply because the random anxiety attacks and depressive episodes were just too much to handle. I have had some days where I am visibly worse and some where I am visibly better. But overall I have definetly seen a slight improvement. I am a 19 year old student athlete so for this to be happening to me in the first place is quite embarrassing and hard to accept. That being said though I am looking forward to better days and was wondering if there is anybody out there with a similar experience or anyone who could give me a few suggestions as to how to make the mood swings less intense (supplements,routine, blood test) etc. just looking for a little bit of motivation in this hard time and would love if someone could reach out and share their recovery story, it would give me peace of mind knowing that these episodes are temporary. Thanks. Go get a blood test. Get them to run a hormone panel. Most likely estrogen dominance leading to reduced testosterone and DHT. Appreciate the advice bro. Seems like that is usually the case I had similar episodes, I always thought they were finasteride crashes. I had 3 or 4 spaced a couple weeks apart. Have not had one in months. Hey man hang in there. I started taking finasteride in July and I stopped at the end of august. So only 2 months and I have full blown PFS.

Pregnenolone and progesterone convert to neuroprotective neurosteroids like allopregnenolone and other neurosteroids, via multiple pathways and not all the pathways involve 5-alpha-reductase which finasteride blocks. \n\nCould increasing these neurosteroids via other pathways prevent the cognitive side-effects of finasteride? Has anyone tested this?\n\nI think I am going to test it myself. I have pretty good progesterone a bit higher than top range, but still have sides for 10y. Especially for anxiety, every situation who could seems normal for someone trigger fight and fly response for me. It is like my amygdala is in hyper excitions mode  You mean taking higher dosage of progesterone will solve the anxiety issue? I read that 5-DHP could help. Also take a look at the rise in prolactin", "Help 24M Was on fin for a month 1mg a day before 1 night I started having a weird dick/ groin pain and uncomfortableness very badly, lasted a few days. Been off for about 5 weeks now and libido etc has gotten a lot better, but I still have lost a lot of feeling/ sensitivity in my penis, has this happened to anybody? And did it ever come back to normal ish? Thanks Hopefully ...it' s not permanent since you only took it for a month.  I think you will recover..As for me...i took the pill for 5 years , on and off..and now have permanent ED..low T...loss of sensation to name a few...good luck.. Jesus man\u2026 ya I wanted to give it a shot and thought all the fear monger was bullshit\u2026 but I still have numbness and sensitivity issues in my dick\u2026 everything else is fine including libido etc. this sucks, sides are very real Not really sure who to even see if this does not get better Get your testosterone blood work done.  Could be some issues.  If you are really worried. Are you on trt? yes, but even trt does not fix the numbness...it is a progressive thing with pfs...the older you get the woorse it gets ....I was in my 20's ...now i am in my 40's....and my life sucks... Damn man sorry to hear.. I am 24 and I am starting to get real worried aswell, 1 month of being on this bullshit and it might ruin me Give it some time and relax and dont't google it....if after 2 more months it still lingers...then maybe you should worry...but time is on your side.. Appreciate it thank you man, sorry for what has happened, hair is not worth the sides that some have to deal with\u2026 I know it is wayyyy more than 1-2%, I would guess 10-20% with also a lot of ppl dismissing their symptoms Are you okay I am okay overall, and none of the side effects have persisted besides this one\u2026 hoping it gets better thank you Mitch took Finasteride for 18 days Who is that? What are you talking about ( I am new in with this horror. My love, live and my future already destroyed. Sitting in my chair starring against the wall. The only good aspect, I am 59 and I have lifed a weird but hedonic live. \n\nPlease contact me. I am Exsexgod on Propetia help!", "Potentially very interesting test to determine cause of PFS I personally do not think that the reduction in serum and local DHT levels is the cause of the short time and long term effects people experience on finasteride. I think its more to do with the down stream reduction in certain neurosteroids and other enzymatic pathways (progesterone, allopregnenolone etc. and 3beta-HSD etc.)\n\nOne way that this could be determined is if someone titrated up a dose of exogenous DHT, to maintain the same serum levels of DHT whilst taking finasteride. If this person still suffers sides of anxiety and low libido etc, then clearly reduced system androgenicity isnt the cause of PFS. Interesting. I do not think that anybody is willing to do that. If you research the biologics of panic attacks, depression etc you will come to conclusion that important area\u2019s of the brain such as Hypothalamus and HPA Axis (GABA and neurosteroids) are disrupted. Espc. the Hypothalamus is regulating a lot of things that are strongly linked to PFS symptoms. The original baselines that the HYPO was regulating at first seem to have adapted the new baseline on fin and after fin there is a innatural surge of DHT and possibly T or E. A lot of T is aromatised into estrogen. Must be dis regulating in some way. While the body makes enough of androgens and estrogens, the brain and body no longer work coherent. While the hormones have been chemically altered, the brain was not expecting it. The hormonal proces is extremely delicate and therefore we should have all said no to fucking finasteride. People cant link it all together and just do not know the enzyme is responsible for so many things. In hindsight, the sides makes sense for me. I thank myself, hairloss youtubers (even the two docs from australia) for educating me properly. This drug should be off the fucking market. Problem is DHT is synthesized in specific tissues.\n\nEven if you would take injections of DHT there is evidence that it would not \"get to the right tissues\".\n\nFor example DHT apparently cannot readily cross the blood brain barrier, while T can for example.\n\nSo T goes into the brain, then in specific parts where 5AR is expressed it would turn into DHT. But if you were to inject DHT it probably would not get to those specific parts.\n\nThis is interesting, since studies have shown that T levels are much higher in CSF than in healthy controls, while the opposite is true for DHT. \n\nIt might be because the body tries to use T for androgenic activity when there is a lack of DHT. I agree that the hypothalamus is probably affected. This may be where libido and \u2018visual lust\u2019 originate. Have you looked at Melcangi\u2019s papers? He has studied neurosteroid levels in men with PFS.  \n\n Hey any way to combat the anxiety from pfs? It is destroying me and I am thinking about taking ssris DM Me", "Sign the Petition ", "Is this pfs? I have had hairfall since I was 18 and was prescribed a minoxidil+finasteride solution. After reduction in hairfall I stopped it. Then sometime later again had hairfall and went to another doctor who prescribed minox and oral finasteride. I do not exactly remember how many days I would have taken it coz it is been 3-4 years. While on these meds I came to know about the possible side effects and immediately stopped them. I guess I continued with topical solution for a month or so though. I might have taken finasteride for about 2-3 weeks at max. And I never had any side effects back then. It is been nearly 2.5 years(Jun 2018) since I took it and I am now 23. In jan 2020 that is 1.5 years later to taking that Medicine I started getting side effects which I thought were porn related but even after no fap they did not resolve. Is this what is pfs? I am really scared. People take fin and minoxidil for years and have no problem. I might have taken it on requirement basis(whenever I was losing more hair) and not for long. But never had any side effects while on those meds. How can I get side effects after 1.5 years?? It could very well be PFS. A long time ago I thought I had issues that NoFap could fix, but it was really PFS.\n\nI would check out the Post Finasteride Syndrome forum on the Swole Source message board. And ( which was written by a guy who had PFS and recovered. Be aware that the recovery method takes .5 - 2 years of EXTREMELY STRICT compliance to cure you. If you pick and choose different elements then it may not work, or it may take much, much longer than the above time range. For me this does not sound as PFS at all. Despite the fact that you could develop sides after stopping fin, they usually appear relatively soon, less than 6 months after. You are way way past that mark. Sadly from dosage you cannot really tell anything, there is info about people popping one pill and going through PFS.\n\nThe good news about this is that your problem should be elsewhere and be easier to fix. Good luck brother! I developed ED 1.5 years in, all my side effects before that were harmless. Got PFS 6 months later. I think it is possible.", "Libido Levels Is the idea of Post Finasteride Syndrome that those that still experience side effects never had their DHT levels return to normal or just their libido staying low at the DHT level pre finasteride? No body knows the direct mechanism of Post Finasteride Syndrome. However, the current research points towards androgen receptor dysfunction and neurosteroid imbalances. Most people with PFS have normal / high DHT yet are still symptomatic. Something much more complex is at work here than just androgen deficiency. Correct. No. Otherwise it could be cured with a bioidentical DHT prescription. Push you 5 ar system to recover", "Chances of complete finasteride recovery - I took a 1mg dose of finasteride 4 months ago. Experienced many notorious side effects within 40 minutes. My erections and libido are 40-60% of what they used to be. \n\nI have been on two dates recently that ended in sex and I physically could not even get an erection. \n\nI am devastated. I need your help. Can I fully recover from this? After just one pill? Yes. I noticed the effects after about 40 mins. Mental fog, trouble concentrating, impending sense of dread &amp; then after I stopped, weaker and weaker erections &amp; low libido.  ... and you are STILL feeling these effects, four months later? \n\nWow  ... I am pretty sensitive to meds and have had sensitive reactions. All side effects have passed except for low libido &amp; ED. My libido does seem to be getting better incredibly slowly, but my ED is not. Hope it gets better for you pal. Maybe use L-citrulline 6g/day and/or Cialis 5mg/day to get the blood flowing? Yes, there are other people this has happened to, one who made a video for the PFS Foundation and posts here sometimes. OP actually has less severe symptoms than the other guy, considering they seem to just be sexual and not intense cognitive decline like the other guy And my urologist just gave it to me with no warning. That and tamsulosin. \n\nNo warning. Not indications. Just \u201cHere, take this ... \u201c &gt;can I fully recover from this?\n\nThe hard truth is, we do not know. Sometimes people do recover, sometimes they do not. Sometimes it takes years.\n\nIf all that is affected is your dick and libido, consider yourself lucky. It could be so, so much worse if you had cognitive sides and ahedonia. \n\nI would recommend going to an endocrinology and a urologist. Try some erectile dysfunction medication, it will likely help you achieve erections but it probably will not help your libido issues. \n\n\nGetting your hormones measured might help, but it might not. This far out from finasteride, your hormones are probably back to normal so that probably is not what is causing it. We do not really know WHAT causes PFS, we just have theories. \n\n\nA healthy diet, regular cardio exercise, and lots of water cannot hurt. I would definitely recommend you start seeing a therapist too, but do not get on SSRIs as those can make ED even worse I mean there is tons of warnings on the packaging. But yeah he probably should have told you, there is no way he did not know. It is possible he is never had a PFS patient, it is not common. But it is very real and he might be a shitty doctor who does not believe it exists at all I have been accused of being overly concerned with side effects. So sometimes I just take what they give me. I did not even really look into this much. I am sorry about that. I hope you can one day fully recover Give it more time and try not to stress about it (easier said than done). \n\nIf erections/libido is your only issue, you could try low dose taladafil or viagra to get you over the hump.\n\nDoctors do not have any clue about what is going on, so that is unlikely to help. They will give you a hormone test, perhaps, but that does not help much, unless your hormones are completely out of whack.\n\nAnd yes, you are lucky that you did not get the physical or more severe cognitive side effects. When I first got sick, I hardly had the energy to feed myself! Damn man, that is rough. How long did it take you to recover? I got better, but I did not recover, unfortunately (that is what PFS is). But do not let that scare you! I get the sense that many recover, or at least see significant improvement. Hello Texas! The same story as mine. Urologist gave me a pharma muster package just to try. \n\nBefore in the constitution I den yes, because of a sexual active girlfriend. And he said Ok than better not and than he gives me the package.\n\nI did not check the internet and thought all the sites in the package leaflet are temporarily. Hello Texas! The same story as mine.

I had taken 0.25mg of oral fin twice, but I feel like on the third day I had mild ED. I remember at the time I was thinking \u201cthis was the dumbest mistake of my life\u201d but after it went away in like a week I started to think, \u201cmaybe it was all In my head, it was such a tiny amount of fin no way that could have had that affect.\u201d So I have recently been contemplating trying topical. It is not in your head man. PFS is unfortunately very real. Have a read through this thread, they are talking about topical Dutasteride as a safer alternative. One bloke ran a trial and had zero change in serum DHT levels:\n\n\n Used to use fin. Still have some mild lingering side effects but definitely experienced crazy change in my body, and now 3-4 years later am mostly recovered. Have used different dht inhibitor topicals since and never experienced anything. In my mind I am sure even if there are side effects from topical, it is much less intense or even negligible. This is only my experience. Does topical work? Honestly I do not really know I attribute most of the success with topicals to rogaine. Nizoral is used for this and I am pretty sure it works to some extent. Give it a try I do not think you are going to get PFS from topicals, barely makes sense that you would. Where do you get your topical fin from ? Do you use RU?  Never used that product just natural dht inhibitors. Sorry What are natural DHT inhibitors? Like saw palmetto? There is a lot but yes one of them is saw palmetto. Saw palmetto taken orally also has similar side effects as fin. The hair stops and grows back but the side effects kick in same way. Basically you are changing your hormonal profile to have hair when taken orally. Locally should not do this to you, although I would wager the effectiveness locally is nowhere near the same Studies show that topical fin reduce scalp dht more than oral, so i hope topical will give me some benfits. (using it since 2 weeks) Referring saw palmetto: i take 320mg daily for 2 months, but no change in hair loss. I would say sp does nothing. Als no sides.", "Finasteride (5 Days) Hi everyone! I wanted to talk about my Finasteride experience as it is been extremely early. I want to start with I am going to discontinue use starting tomorrow. Secondly, for those of you who are interested in the pill (As I know I scoured this site before taking it) it is your decision and make sure you learn the side effects, hopefully you will have none if you decide to take it! \n\nMy situation I have experienced 2-3 side effects. Two I am 100% sure off and one I am not too sure off. The two I have experienced is complete lose of libido and watery semen. I have no issues holding an erection or masturbating, no issues erected. The third which I am unsure of is a tingling or odd feeling in my right breast I have checked and see no signs of gyno, or breast enlargement but to be safe I believe this one possible symptom has given me enough to decide not to continue the drug. I will be seeing my dermatologist and my regular gp this month or possible next month depending on scheduling. \n\nBesides those symptoms I have no experienced any cognitive issues or other physical ones. I am telling my side of the issues primarily for others to see how quickly symptoms can arise and also things to look out for. If anybody has any advice or comments feel free to let me know! I hope you all have an amazing day! I forgot to add my age as well. M, 24, 5\u20198, NW 1-2 only recession of hairline issues no scalp hair loss. I only took 3 pills over 3 days, lost my libido right away, but did not have any cognitive sides until about 4-5 weeks later.  \n\nI hope you are in the clear, but if in a few weeks you get brain fog, you will know why. I had no issues until about day 3 honestly. Today is day 5 and I think I will pass on continuing the pill. If I am meant to lose my hair fine. I would rather be bald than lose myself mentally and physically. I will see my doctors soon discuss it with them and see how things go but I believe stopping early is way better than continuing and pushing my body when it clearly is telling me to back off. But thank you for the input now I will know what to be aware of as the weeks progress! How has your journey been off the pill? Other sides you experienced or did your libido increase? I had the brain fog, and depression hit.  It was terrible.  Had the suicidal thoughts, it sucked.  I am sure taking fin during the pandemic was not a good idea, being alone with your own thoughts is scary at times.  \n\nMy libido is slowing getting better, not close to what it was before.  \n\nBtw, I took the pills back in July.   Unfortunately, I got really scared and took tribulus in August.  That led to another crash, then I took N2Generate (which is basically a test booster) in October, and I think that cleared up all of my mental sides.  Libido was great while on it.   But now I am just going to stick with the natural route and see where I am at in a couple of months.  I am a lot happier than I was in August. I am happy you are doing much better than you were months ago! I am concerned about symptoms like yours that you have experienced and I am hoping I do not experience them but I know this was my decision which sucks so getting hit with the bullet really is rough. \n\nI plan on avoiding any drugs to help me I am going to focus on the natural route going forward but I will be seeing my doctor for gyno and any other adverse effects I have experienced. \n\nI am shaving my head tomorrow as well. Caring for my hair is not as important as my physical and mental health. Once it is cut off there is nothing to care for which is the route I am going. Man, if I knew what I know about Fin, I definitely would.not have taken that first pill.  \n\nHuge regret!   I should have done more research.  Lesson learned though.  \n\nAnd I just buzz the top of my head and do \"skin-shave\" (?) On the sides.  The Barber recommended it, and I just went with it.\n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: grammar I had done so much research prior and said to myself I will never know if I do not try. Well I tried and experienced some adverse effects, better to stop now than continue! \n\nI also should taken into account that fact that Merck killed 60K people with arthritis pills so. Big Pharma. \n\nI will take your advice on the hair as well! Thank you! hey like you i only took 3 pills and libido took a hit.\n\nIts been 2 weeks since I quit and libido slowly coming back but im scared...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou said your libido is also coming back , but only after what like 6 months?!? that is insane. how close to pre fin levels are you? Yeah, it is been about 6 months. \n\nThing is, I took tribulus back in August and September, so while on it, my libido was not too bad.  But taking tribulus led to a crash afterwards, then I took another supplement, that while on it I was good, but another crash afterwards. \n\nSo, now Ive been off supplements since late November, and I have had major improvements from where I was since my initial crash in mid(?) August.   I am sure I will be fine within the next couple of months, I am just taking the natural route for now.  \n\nI am definitely not anywhere close to pre-Fin levels.  But like I said, I feel as though taking the supplements led me to \"restart\" the clock.  \n\nAsk me again in 2 months though, hopefully I will have great news for you.", "Penile Numbness Hello guys, thanks for answering my questions that I previously posted..\n\nStill having head of penis numbness, dick shrinks when I smoke pot and causes anxiety, come and going fogginess, ED, the whole nine yards.. took first and only pill on 10/23.\n\nReally scared right now.

I cannot put into words how I feel but I just want to let you know it is reversible. You mentioned MS, PFS is actually similar in the fact that it is most likely an autoimmune illness. Many people including myself noticed feeling cured or a drastic reduction in symptoms after being injected with corticosteroids.\n\nI personally felt totally cured after having an ACTH stimulation test where they injected me with synthetic ACTH. I believe it functions similar in some ways to corticosteroids. Anyways, i felt cured for about a week and then crashed. \n\nThe only issue now is trying to find the right doctor. Many try to blame it on depression and say to see a psychiatrist. I really wish I could have a corticosteroid injection again but it is really difficult I dont think its automine \n\nAutoimmune illnesses do not heal and there are many reported recoveries \n\nBut I do think it is neurological damage", "A hypothesis for the pathology of PSSD/PFS/PAS (TLDR at bottom)\n\nI am going to start this by saying that this is just an uneducated guess from someone with no medical background, just a fellow sufferer who is determined to end our suffering. So, keep in mind that this hypothesis is very likely wrong, but sometimes it is necessary to guess and test things out since the medical industry has no answers for us.\n\nMany of us have tried literally every single supplement on earth to no avail. We have extremely normal lab test results, and when anything is abnormal (vitamin d, testosterone, etc), replacing it seems to do no good. So, why the complete sexual dysfunction, loss of sensitivity, and cognitive problems despite very normal levels of blood biomarkers?\n\nMy hypothesis is that there is some persistent nerve damage and/or altered activity of the autonomic nervous system, specifically regarding the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is what regulates our parasympathetic (rest and digest) system vs our sympathetic (fight or flight) system. I am guessing that our ANS gets stuck in fight or flight mode and cannot heal on its own. The vagus nerve permeates the brain, which could explain cognitive symptoms, as well as reaching all the way down to the gonads, which could explain pain/loss of sensitivity and sexual symptoms.\n\nThis could also explain why such different drugs (ssri's, finasteride, and accutane) could produce such similar symptoms. \n\nSo, what would the approach the solving this be? There is a treatment called tVNS (transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation), which uses electrical stimulation to stimulate the vagus nerve, resulting in improved engagement of the parasympathetic nervous system. The treatment has been proven effective for depression, which many of our symptoms overlap with, and it is currently being investigated for its benefits in long covid and autism (studies can be found with a quick google search).\n\nThere are a few devices currently on the market. GammaCore is a prescription device that stimulates along the neck, but it is very expensive. The Vitality Smartcable is non-prescription and available in the US. Parasym is available without prescription in Europe, and it has been used in some of the covid studies. tVNS Technologies has one too.\n\nNow there are some people doing tVNS using an extremely cheap TENS device you can buy on Amazon. This seems super risky to me, and I have no idea why the medical devices are so much more expensive, but I am guessing it is for some reason. I am not condoning you try this\u2014the best scenario would be to find a practitioner who works with tVNS and get it through them.\n\nAnyways, TLDR: I make a wild guess that PFS/PSSD/PAS is caused by autonomic nervous system imbalance and can be treated with vagus nerve stimulation. Recent work is focusing on three interdependent processes: altered levels of neuroactive steroids, altered dopaminergic signaling and altered brain receptor function.

This is a chemical change in the body. We switched something off and it does not turn back on. \"Not that simple\" You are probably right about that. But, alterations to the nervous system, especially with what I am talking about here, can lead to excess inflammation, which result in many chemical changes in the body. So, everything is really connected, we just need to find a place where a therapeutic intervention will result in improvement. What a great paper! Good find!

Hi everyone, I am new here, but just saw this post about accutane here: (\n\nAnd I have recently wrote a post in tressless about 3aHSD (3 alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), which is the enzyme that gets rid of DHT naturally in our bodies. It is hypothetised that for some reason it is depleted from our scalp leading to an increase in DHT, simply becuase it just not converted anymore.\n\nYou can find more info here: (\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I want to share with you guys, is that accutane is a downregulator of 3aHSD. It simply gets rid of all 3aHSD, and as side effect in accutane use is hair loss. And after reading the above post, I think you guys should give it a try at increasing 3aHSD, because it is methabolites are important, being androstenediol important and just like the use of accutane and finasteride, both decrease androstenediol and other methabolites, and both symptoms are the same. I hope this helps you guys. And how is one supposed to do that, exactly? Sulforophane Supplementation, I purchased a supplement called Broq.

Another great thing would be very gentle penis pumping. U need to wait for a month. Viagra has sides , so better try strong coffee.It worked for me .", "PFS recovery I have honestly dreamed of making a post aboutlike this so many times, and I think it finally happened, I am starting to feel normal again. (I stopped fin in DECEMBER 2020)\n\nMy symptoms were:\n\n-zero libido\n\n-Cold penis/(top half was painful/numb and turned different white.)\n\n-really bad tinnitus (screeching that changed pitch)\n\n-zero male drive. Felt like someone stole my mojo.\n\n-Anxiety/crying and panic attacks.\n\n-severe brain fog (could not multi-task, felt like I was literally retarded.\n\nBasically at the time of posting, nearly all my symptoms are basically gone. Tinnitus is gone, anxiety/panic is gone. I feel my male drive again. Brain fog has mostly subsided. Libido has come back a whole bunch in the last few days, and while my dick is still recovering, it feels way more normal than It did a week ago.\n\nI really did not do anything for my recovery, it all has just come back slowly in the past week. I do not want to get too ahead of myself as I may take another step back, but this week plus of feeling great basically has skyrocketed my morale.\n\nTBH I do not know If i could have gotten this far without the help of this community and the people in it, so from the bottom of my heart, thank you everyone who has helped me out on here. I am glad to hear this bro, keep us updated weekly if possible if your still consistently feeling normal :) Yes I will be sure to keep everyone updated if I progress/regress! So good to hear! &lt;3 Awesome! Hey dm me back if you get the chance, thanks Congrats ! We are all in this together ! UPDATE 1\n\n have regressed somewhat this week, which is disappointing but still if this the \" bad\" times I am pretty fucking excited.\n\nPenile pain has not been noticed in weeks... this was prob the worst symptom.\n\nTinnitus has returned at a less noticeable volume.\n\nLibido and erection quality is much better than before, but still definitely not 100%\n\nBrain fog has not returned for a while as well.\n\nI do get morning wood every so often, so that is encouraging as well.\n\nThe most important part of my recover so far is I can enjoy life again and feel happy which is so encouraging when I could barely get up in the morning.\n\nHopefully my full drive comes back in the coming months. I will update monthly on this post for those interested Please dm me im same with you . 6 months under fin and minoxidol  How many mgs of finasteride were you on. I was thinking to start but now not so sure \ud83e\udd76 I was on 1.25mg for 8 months. \n\nMy libido and sex drive were great the first 7 months until that \"switch\" flipped.\n\nTBH it is not worth it. It is a tiny chance, but my life turned into a horrific nightmare. I can finally start trying to live again.\n\nMy advice is to shave your head and see how you like it. I just did and I think I look pretty good! UPDATE 2:\n\nHave felt pretty good most of the time. Brain fog and tinnitus are very low. Penile pain is not bad anymore. My main concern is my libido and erectile health. I hope I will regain my sexual function as the months go on, or at least most of it.\n\nI have not had the \"hourglass\" effect on my dick in a while, and I think that is a good thing? This also corresponds with the penile pain going away.\n\nI am just glad I feel normal enough to live a mostly normal life going forward, and that gives me hope of getting better with time.\n\nI plan on getting a full hormone panel soon to see where I am at, and I will post the results when I get it. It is been scientifically shown that placebo effect only really lasts about 40 days. After that, if the effect still persists then it is real. I believe, and your experience shows that the side effects will always happen if the dose is high enough. It is because the hormone imbalance gets worse as time goes on.\n       The hair regrowth system that I developed is designed to restore the balance instead of making it worse..While the system is still new, once the old balance is restored you may only need an occasional touch up.. I just talked to another doctor, he said its not worth it. Just Rock the clean bald look. But some other doctors i visit for dermatology recommend it. How long did it take for your symptoms to go away after coming off finasteride. Hi, when you originally developed PFS after coming off fin did your side effects get worse over time? I have been off fin for about 3 weeks now and I have no libido. I only took it for just over a month and stopped as soon as I started getting sides How are you doing could you update us sir ?", "I only used for one month than stopped I do not know if I have any side efects what should I do? I can do masturbate. Get hard and feel. But I used it for one month one year ago and I did not realize any side effect when I using. But after I read how dangerous it is I stopped but what if I have side effects but I do not realize is there test for it?", "Head pain and pressure behind eye I have been off finasteride for about 7 weeks now and was hit with cognitive problems ( memory loss, trouble concentrating) that have persistent. But I notice I have this dull pain in the left center of my head and was wondering if anyone else had this issue.\n\nI am also super sensitive to light and do not see anyone in this forum talking about vision changes. \n\nI am only able to sleep 3-4 hours a night and was wondering if anyone had recommended to fix this (natural or pharm drugs)", "Side effects I started taking fin about 10 months ago, have just started having pain in my right testicle and have stopped all taking of finasteride. Have anyone experienced varicocele as a side effect? If so, is it likely to improve if I stop fin and try to recover?", "People who started minoxidil before finasteride ,did you get sexual sides on minoxidil? Minoxidil is also a 5-ar inhibitor: ( I used to have a very high libido. I have started minoxidil since over 1.5 months and i have recently experienced significantly lower libido. I am considering 0.025% topical fin 1ml eod but i am worried given this is my reaction to minoxidil when its supposed to be a \"soft\" treatment. Used it for 2 wks, ended up with same sides as Fin. It has been 14 mths, all sides are gone except ED. I used topical monoxidil for a year before starting fin, had no side effects. After my fin crash I greatly improved over 4 months and thought I was in the clear but was extremely stupid and still concerned about my hair (I am 18 if that helps you understand) and began taking oral minoxidil as I had no issues with topical. Big big fucking mistake. I am now 4 months into extreme anxiety depression and disassociation. I would not touch minoxidil if you have pfs. It is a 5ar inhibitor and will fuck you up  I still have low libido but sensitivity improved ard 6 mnths after stopping  Yup..100pct topical 0.5 minox. 2 wks, absolutely no Fin at all but got full suite of pfs sides.  Anyone get pain in their testicles from min as well? I used it for 9 years without problems. I am not entirely convinced its proposed 5ari properties are significant.", "anyone else experience anhedonia after stopping finasteride?  I am just over a month after stopping finasteride and crashed after 2 weeks of stopping. I am still dealing with anhedonia (lack of pleasure). I feel very emotionally flat still and am wondering has anyone experienced the same and how long it took to disappear, thanks.", "Possible to Recover Hi guys,\n\nI took finasteride a lot of it based on the hair loss doctor show and also Kevin Mann believing if I had taken the poison just 3x a week MWF I should be okay Boy oh Boy was I wrong. Took the first pill before sleeping on Wednesday felt my penis was not as strong as before but then again I thought it could be Placebo so went ahead and took another pill on the Friday and yeah... I just did not feel right so I said to myself no more. Issue is come Saturday evening random I had this heat wave come on where i was extremely restless and could not sit still. It dawned on me then that all the stories I was told to ignore were true and this drug was poison and not worth the hassle. I am still hanging on to the little ray of hope that as I only took two 1mg pills like Dr Knudsen has said, from the hair loss show, I should be back to my normal self after about 2 weeks or so but the more I read the more scary it gets. Especially considering I took only two pills You should go back to normal. Most people will simply get side effects,  not full blown PFS. Yes, Kevin Mann is wrong. PFS is real, and you can read peer reviewed literature on the wiki about it. \n\nI hope you recover soon! Thanks buddy! Means a lot Of course! Take care and happy bunny day. I am pretty sure side effects are more common than they claim.  I had most of them, it was a disaster. How long did it take you to recover and how long were you using the stuff for? Did. you recover? Hi there,\n\nJust wanted to give an update on my situation.\n\nSince I had what was now I feel was an anxiety attack after taking the pill the next day on Sunday I did a complete water fast and since then from Sunday to about Saturday I was sleeping fine around 6 hours.\n\nHowever on that Saturday night I started to feel the anxiety come over me again and knowing what it was I dealt with it better and certain tricks which can help alievate some of the symptoms from it like chest burn which goes away if I drink a big mug of water but even still the insomnia I could not get rid of and ive not slept at all for the past two nights. For the next 24 hours  I will resume the water fasting with the hope of getting better sleep for the next week like what happened last time. Its frustrating though as I thought I was making good steps forward as the ED feels like it is getting better, I can get erection easier and it holds for slightly longer than it did initially.\n\nI am hoping the water fast does the trick as I feel very weird it is as if my brain is tired but my body is not if that makes sense and was wondering if you knew any remedies in terms of dealing with insomnia as Ive been told its best to stay of sleep meds especially in this period where there is chance of recovery\n\nThanks do you have any history of depression or anxiety in the past? Nothing at all that is why I am stunned this has happened. I did not even know what to call my symptoms it is only when I went online and saw it was anxiety No not yet. Worse if anything\n\nWas seemingly on the mend and felt good for 5 days after the anxiety attack and then got hit with another one where I could not sleep and had this weird anxiety feeling I could not shake although large intake of water did give temporary relief in a way. Jumped on another water diet been on it for 2 days I can atleast sleep like 4 hours which is not great but better than the 0hrs I was getting before. Still debating whether to take supps or wait another 10 weeks to make it 3 months since I last took the pill and then hopefully if all is recovered great! And if not then follow a supp protocol as well as diet and exercise. Hey man, how are you doing now? I have the same issue as you. I did the exact same method of taking the drug. M,W, F 1mg fin. And I only took it 3 times. I had a whole bunch of symptoms such as dull testicular pain, loss of focus, depressed/flat emotions, lack of focus, lack of sexual desire, ED, and believe it or not diarrhea. It started this exact week. I am so scared man. I do not know what to do! I just took it 3 times wtf!!! Thank you, I was about to start fin since my thinking was also \"just quit as soon as something wierd happens\" but no way, I am out! I hope you are better now and also might feel a bit happy since your experience and sharing it helped someone avoid it!\n\nAlso thank you, u/neverneverthere Hey man, my symptoms went away after 2 weeks. In not telling you to try it. But that was my experience. Any updates? I am having the same symptoms as you", "Erectile dysfunction I was reading 3 months about PFS and looking to get solution for my situation, actually I am experiencing that syndrome more than 3 months, I have used DHT blocker tablet made from saw palmetto, I was feeling heart palpitations, anxiety and erectile dysfunction, now recovered from the first two symptoms and still developing erectile dysfunction, I would to hear your suggestions and know how long I wait to come back to normal life, please give me your advice how to deal with this matter. Thanks all", "Asking if anyone else has had this experience It is been 3 months since I have been off of Finasteride. And only now I am I feeling side affects of brain fog and depression. The lower libido is slowly wearing off. But I was wondering if anyone else has had after effects later after stopping for so long. I was taking it for 6 months Yes, it is possible to have side effects from finasteride that last for months, even years. It is also possible to get new side effects after you stop. \n\nBut do not worry too much about that. Try to de-stress, take care of your body, get good sleep (good for testosterone)... there is not much else you can do. Try to avoid risky treatments or supplements \u2013\u00a0it is early for you, so chances are that things will resolve if you give it time. Thank you that makes me feel much better How much were you taking ? I was 1.25 daily and I was depressed as shit and couldn'tnt sleep. I still fucked like a dog but I took it down to 1.25 every 3 days. Been better ever since. I was taking the 1 daily. I was fine for a little while but then I stared losing interest in sex after a while. I did not get the fogginess and depression until after a couple months of stopping 1 full pill or 1mg? 1mg Noticed any hair growth in the 6 months you were taking? Not really sadly. I was still losing it. My hair just felt thicker but no noticeable grow back We are you also taking applying any topical solution? Rogaine ? No I was not applying anything to it MY EXPERIENCE: stop taking it if you feel side effects.\n\nStart using minoxidil 1-2 times a day and use a natural hair growth serum with natural anti-androgens (rosemary, saw palmetto) Lift weights, good sleep, eat clean Any updates ?? So far my sex drive has returned and everything is in working order again thankfully After how many months did libido and sexual function fully return to normal after quitting ?? I am not sure the exact time it cleared my system. If I had to guess I would say 4 to 5 months at least. It could also partially have been me being slightly paranoid that it would not leave my system Were you worried before I am currently 3 months since stopping fin and feel kind of better but libido is still low I should be ok ? I was a little worried before yes but it came back in time. It just takes time is all but everyone is different so I cannot say how long exactly it will take for you exactly. Maybe another month or 2 So libido was gradually getting better but would you say it is what took longest to get better and at 6 months after quitting you were 100%?  Yes I would say it gradually got better over time but it was very slow. It is also possible the mind might be psyching you out cause I feel like that was me around the time it returned", "Topical Finasteride? Has anyone tried topical finasteride and had side effects? People have reported adverse effects from topical finasteride and even a syndrome. It goes into your system from the scalp. I tried it as recently as November of this year and have gotten side effects I am still hopefully praying will resolve. ED, dry skin around eyebrows and forehead, and loss of libido. If you are thinking about doing it - do not. Topical is the same as taking it orally. No but the reason why you are less likely to have sides from the topical version then the oral version is because the most dht gets produced in the liver. So you will be cutting of way less dht and the dht produced in the liver will go in bloodstream to your head. So if you are going to do finasteride I would do it orally I guess otherwise the topical version is not profitable", "Since getting stopping Fin and getting PFS, has your hair loss resumed or does is your hair loss still halted? Trying to figure out what is going on with me. I took finasteride years like 6 years ago for 6 months because I was freaking out about hair loss in college. I did not notice sexual sides on it really but if they were there, they were subtle. It def stopped my hair from falling out though and after 6 months, I was so worried about taking fin long term that I stopped it completely.\n\n The weird part is my hair loss never resumed and 6 years later my hair is exactly the same. Last year I was put on an antidepressant and got PSSD and now I am wondering if my hair loss stopped after stopping fin because it permanently changed my hormones. I had a raging libido in college and after college I think it was reduced a bit. I cannot tell whether it was because that is when my anxiety/depression got way out of hand or if it was because of the Fin. I still had a solid libido though so I never even thought about PFS or anything. It was only until I stopped my antidepressant that my libido went to complete shit.", "Igf + hgh Has anyone ever tried to take igf and/or hgh? Is there any clinical studies on this? No, but I did take a compound that increase growth hormone. Ipramolen or something like that? \nAnyway it did not do fuck all and frankly I do not think hgh would do much to directly help PFS. May help with general well-being but it will not be a cure. If the issue comes from 5ar why not just take it then?\n\n", "How long for finasteride side effects to subside after discontinuing it? I took fin for 8 months, and I recently stopped. I took my last 1mg pill on the 8th of November. I noticed side effects started to occur about a month and a half after I started, so maybe it is possible that side effects will start to go away around a month and a half from when I stopped? I know PFS can last forever, so I am worried. My main symptoms are lack of appetite, tiredness, and sensitive skin. None of these I had before I started fin. A couple of days - infinite.\n\nMost likely within a couple of months. I am at almost a year and I am like 85% back to normal, I want to know why I got sides like what is the reason it is so strange What sides did you have? 8 months? Why would you take it for 6.5 months with sides? \n\nIt will probably br a long ride man. Because my doc said it is not the finasteride so I kept taking it.  Most of them my theory is that finasteride affects us neurologically and the hormonal changes are not what impacts us sexually and cognitively. It is similar to PSSD (SSRI induced sexual sided) as DHT is still in \u201cnormal range\u201d. Some people are just unlucky and susceptible to these neurological effects (me and you), and others arwnt One month", "Has anyone kept developing gyno even after quitting fin? I quit 5 days ago and I feel it has not settled down.\n\nI still feel my nipples sensitive and puffy.\n\nI have not found a lot if info on PFS regarding gyno, I fear they will get a bit worse even if I already quit...\n\nI took fin for 3 weeks, and already had puffy nipples to begin with. How does it feel to be  the 0.26/1000 chance of getting it from Fin?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat are you taking, 5mg? I was taking 1mg, I started actually with 0.5 for around the first week.\n\nWell it definitely felt quite terrible. Perhaps I would try again in the future with 0.25 mg, but for now I do not want to risk it :(\n\nI do not know what to do, because people say to take zinc or aromasin, but for the same reason I am hesitant to put even more weird things in my body. Yes, you can develop gyno even after quitting fin. But since it is only been a few days and gyno is your only issue, it does not look like you have been hit hard by the side effects. Give it a few weeks and see how you feel then. Aromasin can cause shedding. Arimidex would be what you would want if you were to take an AI", "Acceptance is the best way for me to move on in life. I have had PFS since since the start of this year, and seem to have plateau'd in my recovery.\n\nMy current side effects are:\n\n-Zero libido\n\n-Loud tinnitus\n\n-ED\n\n-Penile tissue issues (feels lighter and less dense when flaccid, while also feeling sort of like cartilage? \n\nI do not want to bring anyone down, but at least for me having \"hope\" that I will be normal again one day is not a healthy way to deal with this.\n\nI accept that this is my new life now. And It sucks, because I only took this drug to boost my confidence of my receding hairline after my wife basically stopped talking to me all of a sudden one day. It took me a year to find out she cheated on me. That whole time I kept trying to reconcile things. It was extremely fucked up what she did and it really affected me.\n\nSorry for rambling on, but I think this is the best way for myself to deal with this. And if somehow one day I recover, it will be a welcome surprise.\n\nHopefully those responsible for this drug are held accountable for this, and even more hopefully a cure is found so nobody has to deal with this.\n\nGood luck in your journey guys, hopefully you are well. Stay strong \ud83d\udcaa. Hi, \n\nWelcome to the PFS club :). \n\nPFS is proven to enhance depression, sorry for hearing what happen to you with your wife, it happens exactly the same thing for me when I was on fin 10y ago with my GF. \n\nDid you get in touch with the PFS foundation they have doctors who know about the condition that you can reach out in your geographical zone. It is something recoverable but it takes time and would say that if you recover to 80% of what you were you will be happy. \n\nSince how long are you dealing with sides, do you have a blood test to share? \n\nTo gain time and cut through all the extensive process I would advise you to do a \"Dutch Test Plus\". It is the more accurate map of enzyme activity in your body, it checks a bunch of cascades and see if there is an imbalance and where. it also checks 5ar activity. \n\nIf your sides are only penis wise I am sure you will find a way to cure it. I recover from the penile side after 2 years, now I am able to have libido and bang 2 times a day. Only things I have less pleasure and sensation and also a bit of flaccid smooth penis. \n\nI am sure something is coming soon with all the research into it. Hey, thanks for the kind words.\n\nSadly, I am in Vancouver and no doctors are from PFS foundation are near me.\n\nAll I have done so far is get a blood test with my family doctor.... he said everything looked normal except vitamin D, which from further research seems common for PFS sufferers. What is your vitamin D level? \n\nI would strongly advise you to do a Dutch test it will save you bunch of time. And then find a good online endocrinologist where you can do video call and show your test result. You can pick one of the PFS doc that is in your time zone and send an email to book an online consultation. Hey thanks for the help. Would you recommend the Dutch plus test? Or would the normal one suffice.\n\nAnd I am not sure what the levels were; he told me the results over the phone. It is better to do the Plus one, for the cortisol and free cortisol assessment Thanks. I will get this done soon. \n\nDid you get this test done, and if so did an endo help you out? We are in the same boat stopped fin in December last year and crashed in January, I have same symptoms except tinnitus, also anxiety / depression. You do not mention those ... I cannot see how it is possible to not have depression if you have low libido You are only 7 months in and you have not done any drastic changes to your lifestyle, and are now accepting it? You are still in an early enough window that I would at least try to get my shit together. I am only a few months out and my symptoms are not so bad but if they continue to persist I will hop on the Tmo protocol, I would rather say I tried to fix things at the end of the day. You took it for 7 months right? That is a fairly longtime, fins problem only been out of your system for a few months .. Yeah I do have anxiety/depression, but that is due to the sexual and other side effects. Not really \"caused\" by fin but yeah. I do have those as well.  Only advice I can give you bro, is pray to God. Wish you the best. I think you should see a urologist ASAP. I am experiencing same symptoms as you after taking the drug for 1 month. Been off for 6 weeks now, thought things were getting better but I think I crashed the other day\u2026 I see lots of ppl with libido issues and some ED but not many of what we are experiencing.. numbness, some pain, tip of penis turns white sometimes, not sure wtf is going on but im getting desperate What is tmo protocol ?", "Me when I hear 18-19 year olds have used poison propecia/Finasteride  Can you stop shitposting, and spreading negativity and or irrelevant content? ive seen you repeatedly do this that shit is poison nobody should be takin it", "Having side effects only AFTER stopping fin? \nI took finasteride for 2 months, in that time I honestly probably got hornier and had larger orgasms (way more watery tho). I temporarily quit fin exactly a week ago as I was going off and on anti depressants at that time and just wanted to see how I felt at my base line. 7 days later and im not nearly as horny as I was pre fin and on fin, loads are much smaller too. Do people with fin syndrome experience NO libido or can you still have fin syndrome with just reduced libido. Is it possible my body just has not adapted to the increase in DHT yet or am I screwed? I want to mention that my morning wood has returned (lost it when started fin). PFS has a range of symptoms and a range of severity to them. 1 week is too early to tell, as it can take 6 months to fully regain all of your 5ar enzymes. You may see improvement over the weeks and months ahead. If not, then I would go to the Swole Source message board which explains how to recover from PFS if you have it. &gt; it can take 6 months to fully regain all of your 5ar enzymes.\n\nIs that true ? Yes, but you regain most of them within the first two months. Ah, that might explain why I started feeling much less anxiety approx 2 months after stopping. Most of the hair shedding also started 2 months. Updates ?? I am back on fin. 3 months now - will wait a bit longer to make any call.  The one initial one that I had - not so far, no.\n\nAnd I do suffer from GAD so I do not want to put that on fin. \nSince I started retaking it - I have had very peaceful days and sleep. And also some very anxious days and very disturbed sleep. Not any different from when I stopped fin for 6 months.\n\nNothing so far that I can reliably pin on fin thus far - but will obviously continue to monitor.  I discontinued for 6 months.", "Theory about what is causing Post Finasteride Syndrome Hi Reddit,\n\nThis is my theory about what could be causing Post Finasteride Syndrome (PFS). What is wrong with it/in what ways does not it fit the evidence?\n\nI know people are not quite convinced that PFS exists - if so please ignore this thread.\n\nBest,\n\nEwan\n\n**Step by Step - bullet are evidence/reasoning points**\n\n**1)** Finasteride disrupts normal 5ar function in human body and in activity of 5AR enzyme of microbes in human gut. \n\n**2)** This causes other microbes in gut to thrive and assert themselves in human gut. \n\n* Finasteride caused weird bowel movements.\n* Many PFS suffers improve by modulating diet or fasting.\n\n**3)** New microbes create epigenetic changes in human body to maintain environment in which they live best. Old microbe balance disrupted. \n\n* Gut microbes can create epigenetic changes. \n* Many PFS sufferers report brief improvements which then disappear.\n* Many PFS sufferers report improvements while ill (microbiome is altered) or when taking antibiotics.\n\n**4)** Finasteride removed from body causing sudden resumption to old 5ar enzyme activity. But human body remains epigenetically programmed for lower levels of activity. \n\n* Symptoms disappear for a while before returning with PFS crash. \n* Despite coming off finasteride, I was not fully normal between stopping and PFS onset. Libido was low, I was very angry, very selfish, etc. As though my body could not handle 5ar levels.\n\n**5)** Two week battle in gut between old microbes that are suddenly active once more and the newer established colony. \n\n* My PFS crash set in after eating one unhealthy meal, and were made worse months later after recovering due to eating exactly the same meal again. \n* I stopped finasteride once before then without any PFS crash happening.\n\n**6)** New colony wins due to larger numbers and supportive environment of human body, now epigenetically modified for them.\n\n**7)** Symptoms return full-swing as now old microbe colony is fully suppressed by new colony, without help of finasteride. \n\n* Finasteride would have an effect while taken during the day, but then at night or between doses effect would be lessened, allowing old microbe colony to grow back a little.\n* This would also explain why the symptoms while on finasteride are not exactly the same as PFS symptoms. Because one is due to suppression by finasteride while the other is full gut microbiome change. \n* My experience with the effect of medicines/supplements depends hugely on what I eat with them.\n\n**8)** PFS sets in.\n\n* This would explain why PFS seems like an allergic reaction to the body's hormones. \n* PFS is like an autism of 5ar activity. \n* Would explain why taking things that affect hormones have only short-lived effects.\n* Would explain how symptoms can remain after drug is taken away. I should add: it goes without saying this would explain why it only hits certain people, why the length of time taking finasteride is irrelevant, etc. etc. We do not know if the DNA is methylated before the crash or after, I think that it makes more sense that it is only methylated after. Ok, why is that? It is just my theory that the crash is the methylation occuring. It does not make sense to me that there is a short recovery period after drug cessation if the DNA is already methylated. Interesting take. The paper below shows that rats had a change in their microbiota composition after treatment with Finasteride. I do not know of any studies on human microbiota, however. \n\n\n\n\nI do not claim to know what causes the persistent symptoms, but perhaps the microbiome is somehow involved. Yes, exactly. Though it does not say which is cause or effect. Could it be that the microbiome recovers but the body remains epigenetically changed, meaning the microbiome later crashes, causing the PFS crash symptoms?\n\nWhat would answer this question is - how long does it take for epigenetic changes to happen? Can it be overnight, or must it happen over a few days, weeks or months. It depends on the situation but it is been observed epigenetic changes can occur \"immediately\" or in just a few hours. Ok, interesting. Question then would be why the body undergoes epigenetic change after the drug is withdrawn, whereas it did not while taking the drug. \n\nRegarding your microbiome, have you experienced any changes depending on your diet? The body probably undergoes one epigenetic change while 5AR is inhibited (maybe relating to androgen receptor sensitivity) then once the drug is withdrawn and 5AR is regenerated, it undergoes another, different epigenetic change in response.\n\nI have not noticed any differences in response to my diet. I did try water fasting which I think helped. So there is a good chance my life is essentially ruined forever? Are you an accutane or finasteride user?\n\nThere are easy things you can do that some other sufferers have benefitted from that are worth trying, like water fasts, resistance training, and carnivore diet.\n\nIf you want to try medications people have benefitted from HCG and tamoxifen.\n\nAnd of course some people just recover over time, but it can take years. Thanks for the advice.\n\nI used Finasteride my libido has been destroyed and I can longer experience emotions properly, I have only taken it for four days and been off it for 3 so I guess there is a chance I could recover but I am absolutely terrified this will be permanent.\n\nI have lost everything that I loved in life, I no longer feel any emotion towards my family/dog or any the activities I love doing. I am truly crushed. It takes 3-7 days to regenerate 5AR and most people do not get PFS so I would not worry about it. For some it takes a few weeks or months before they feel normal again. Thanks man. Side effects are slowly going away I think, I am just scared cus I thought if you got PFS symptoms then they are not reversible. Yeah I would echo what anklecel said - wait a while as it is not necessarily PFS - and then if necessary try out fasting, weights and specific diets as these help enormously. Ok interesting idea - what makes you think it is two changes, something specific from your own experience or just seems logical? \n\nAnd how long did you water fast for? Ok interesting idea - what makes you think it is two changes, something specific from your own experience or just seems logical? \n\nAnd how long did you water fast for?  How are you now? Fucked. Singificantly worse. Not seeing any progress in getting better. Seems like a strong baseline has been established. Very interesting points here. What you point out makes sense.", "New fin user So I have been on finasteride for 6 days now. Took 1 pill a day at 1mg each time and I am worried about the side effects after doing more research. I am feeling sort of numb down there and worried that maybe I did damage that is irreversible. I do not want to stop taking them bc I want to save my hair but I also do not want to ruin my life. Am I early enough to have saved myself from irreversible damage? Some guys take just one or two pills and their lives are never the same again. \n\nIf you were getting morning wood before and now you are not, you may want to stop.  If your erections are not as strong as they were before, you may want to stop.  Everybody is different.  There are non-sexual side effects as well.  Brain fog, depression, anxiety.    \n\nFinasteride suppresses a male hormone, so you are going to have side effects.\n\nJust take note of what is going on, if it is concerning to you, then stop.  If you are fine with it, continue taking it.   Recovery usually takes 3-6 months.  Well, that is from I have read on this subreddit.  A lot of information is out there. Some of it is labelled as fear-mongering,  some as valid.  Do not read too much about other people's experiences, just keep track of what is going on with you. I took fin for 2 years and all sides reversed. \n\nThe sides come slow tho so the changes of nocebo are high, this early. Does nocebo mean that it is basically in my head? You made a full recovery from sides as well? Like 100% The opposite of placebo, so yes. And i do not mean it in a bad way bro, i was paranoid at the start as well, which made me experience it too.\n\nGot real sides along the way.\n\nYes im confident all sides 100% reversed. I think i made a post about it once. It did take some time. I know you did not bro I was just trying to understand that term bc I never had heard it before. I feel like I am destined to have side effects along the way so I do not even know if this drug will be for me. It just sucks that this is the only real possibility of stopping yourself from actually going bald. How long after being on the drug did it take for your sides to develop? Yep its a real sad story, if it stresses you at that much of course quit taking it: the stress will have an even worse impact on your hair. Just giving my imput, the horror stories dominate the internet. \n\nTheres no way to really cheer the hairloss situation up. Its just fucked. Trust me when I tell you having healthy sexual function is better than having hair. It is not worth it. What is the reason we all want healthy hair? It is to look good for women and build confidence. Okay you have a healthy head of hair but you cannot even have sex, what is the point? Seems counter productive. \n\nBe careful. If you are already having side effects then I would not keep taking it.  Yes people do recover but some people do not and you do not know which side you will fall into. Be careful with sides, for me they never really went away when taking it. I became use to them and thought the way I was feeling was normal. I took it for 3 years and it kind of sucks when I look back. It is like 3 years wasted just for hair. Not worth it trust me. Did your go away after you went off the drug? Btw thanks for the reply Yes it got gradually better within a year of stopping. I took ten pills and have been fucked up for ten years. Quit now and spare yourself the chance that anything like this might happen to you.\n\nI should say that the odds of this happening is small. In all likelihood you will be OK. But as long as you take fin, you are taking a risk. The long term effects can happen at any dose (0,1mg+) and at any duration (single day, or it can hit you after years of use).\n\nSo stop worrying about your hair and enjoy your health! How have you been fucked up for ten years? \"How\", as in \"how is this biologically happening\"? Or \"how\", as in \"how did it happen\"? Or \"how\", as in \"what symptoms do you have\"? Or \"how\", as in \"I do not believe this is possible\"? Cycle off of it. What do you mean? That is shit is bullshit man how can u take one tablet or 2 and be impotent for the rest of ur life? That is so bs man. Unless they were infertile before they took it and could not get erection anyways. It is very possible. The body does not know how to react to the molecule and completely changes the body chemistry and how it functions forever or temporarily. It is rare but still possible.", "Can I file a lawsuit against the makers of finasteride? Answers?", "Tribulus and Allopregnanolone In July 2020, I took 3 finasteride pills.  1 mg each. \n\nI had all the sides.  Luckily, tribulus helped, but I had a crash a week after stopping it.  \n\nI have decided to take tribulus again, and just not stop.  I have been doing that since early August and felt amazing up until early October   So, I stopped for a week, but got right back on. Idgaf about long term effects, because without it I am definitely not myself and some days cannot even get out of bed.   \n\nI do not even know what tribulus does though. Hahaha sounds stupid I know.  But it does not increase testosterone.   Can anybody provide some info there? \n\nAlso, Allopregnanolone has been shown to be decreased by 95% in mice that had been given finasteride. How do I get this up? I went to a pharmacist and was told I cannot get Allopregnanolone in Canada.  Is this actually true?   \n\nI was reading about progesterone being converted into Allopregnanolone by 5ar.......\n\nI wish I had know more about the importance of 5ar prior to taking finasteride.  So many regrets. There is some evidence that metabolites from tribulus act as an MAOI. That could be what you are feeling.\n\nThe half-life of allopregnanolone is so short that even if it is administered externally the effects will be very short-lived. That is why it is given by continuous IV in hospital when used as a treatment for post-partum depression. From what I have seen the best you can do is supplement its precursors (pregnanolone?) and give the body time to build up natural levels in the CNS. &gt;that metabolites from tribulus act as an MAOI.\n\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) were the first type of antidepressant developed.\n\nThanks, I just learned something.  \n\nSo, should I be contacting my doctor about depression?  \n\nI think I should start keeping a log of when I take tribulus, and when I stop.  Certain days I have unbelievable anxiety, it is something I have only experienced after taking finasteride.   I just do not want to take anymore pharmaceuticals.   Fuck that. It just increases dopamine. In mice it was shown that finasteride lowered dopamine levels in the brain so it could be that you are just temporarily getting back to baseline. In other words, it could be treating just one aspect of PFS.\n\nSome on the propeciahelp forums have made progress by cycling tribulus. Interesting post. I myself took tribulus, and crashed after increasing dose, every time(3 times in total). But the funny part is I crashed \"up\" so after crash was returning to baseline in  a two weeks period and every time  my baseline was better. Really weird. Tribulus increase 5ar sensitivity  I think, at least this is  what doctor told me.  I also now it reduces cortisol. Many people use it to fight depression and find it  helpfull. I myself stick to the part that if tribulus is helping you that is very good  info.  When i hear stories where people take hundreds of  drugs, supplements and nothing is working i get anxious. I had all the sides.  Brain fog, anxiety, no libido, watery semen. \n\nI think some sides went away on their own, or would have gone away with time. \n\nBut the anxiety and libido issues still effected me.  Tribulus has been a life-saver when it comes to those.   Libido came back and I am back to feeling like myself again.  \n\n&gt;It just increases dopamine\n\nYou mean tribulus increases dopamine?   \n\n&gt;Some on the propeciahelp forums have made progress by cycling tribulus.\n\nThat is good to know.  Maybe I should take it with two week breaks here and there.   \n\nWhat is the worst that could happen?  Other than building a tolerance to tribulus? &gt;I myself took tribulus, and crashed after increasing dose, every time(3 times in total).\n\nSo you started tribulus and were fine, but increased the dose and crashed?  Why did you increase the dose?  \n\n&gt;But the funny part is I crashed \"up\" so after crash was returning to baseline in a two weeks period and every time my baseline was better.\n\nThat is awesome!\n\nSo did you intentionally crash?  \n\n&gt;When i hear stories where people take hundreds of drugs, supplements and nothing is working i get anxious.\n\nI was the same.  I actually deleted my Reddit account and stayed off any sites related to finasteride.   I think that really helped. \n\nJust a side note, creatine caused a massive crash for me back in april-june 2021.   And yes it lasted almost 3 full months.  It was terrifying. Here is a thread from someone who had some success with cycling tribulus: (\n\nBut there are many others there for whom it did nothing.\n\nPFS is only very slowly now being recognized as a real medical condition but it is not known what causes it.\n\nBased on what others have reported, if you have only taken 3 pills you have a very good chance at full recovery over time. &gt;Here is a thread from someone who had some success with cycling tribulus: \n\nThanks for sharing this!\n\n&gt;Based on what others have reported, if you have only taken 3 pills you have a very good chance at full recovery over time.\n\n I really hope that is the case.   Because this fuckin sucks dude.   \n\nIf it were not for tribulus I have no idea how I would be able to function. Tribulus increase AR expression in specific parts in (rats) brain. No studies been done on peripheral AR I believe.\n\nWeird you crashed on Creatine, it really helped me (but as I got off I went back to baseline). This disease is truly different in everybody. yeah I increased the dose 3 times and each time I crashed, but not hard. Then i stayed on the same dose and crashed after 2 weeks in August, but recovered very fast  and  since then  i have been feeling much better then before tribulus though i am afraid to cycle it now  :) but I will have to as  you have  to take a break when taking adaptogens. I have to say this \"crash mechanism\" is so bizzare for me.  Some ppl crash once and never recovers and some people crash a few times recover and crash. That is the most bizzare thing. Finasteride syndrome is completely bizarre\n\nIt makes no sense, that is why all of these doctors have been brushing people off.  \n\nI believe the fact that younger men, on the internet are all complaining about the side effects is having an impact.  \n\nI have seen an endocrinologist, had a bunch tests done and he told me \"hormonally, there is nothing wrong with you.\"\n\nIt is like man, gtfoh.   Something is definitely wrong with me.  \n\nTribulus is awesome though, it completely hyped me up.  Workouts are great and mentality has been on point.  \n\nI did switch up brands, and now take on that has 800mg, but feel as though the other brand that was 650mg had a better effect.", "Can i still make a full recovery? I took finasteride for 3 weeks back in march 2020. I am by no means the worst affected by this drug but still it is ruined my life over the past 14months. Will i ever get back to 100%?\n\nNaively i took this drug march of last year, did not really do enough research into what i was possibly putting in to my body. I have been an avid gym goer and amateur soccer play all of my adult life. I am 30 years of age.\nGood general health and no history of mental health issues.\n\nNothing seemed out of place initially, i remember having sex at around the 2 week mark and all was fine.\nThis theory of if you know about the sides you well get them is nonsense, i did hardly any research about possible negative effects yet on the 3rd week i went to masterbate and i basically had a soft noodle in my hands. I stopped taking the drug immediately. \n\nInitially i was concerned, but also positive. I understood it was early days , i would come off it fairly early and had a good chance of recovering.\n\nThe next few months were strange. Rock hard erections during the night, to a point of waking me up, painful almost. Low semen volume and tenderness in the nipple area. Zero libido and interest in anything sexual. Intermittent ED \n\nGradually these strange nocturnal &amp; morning erections stopped. Since them first 3 months i have had only a handful of morning erections &amp; Zero spontaneous erections. Libido is still at an all time low. \n\nPenis atrophy is my biggest concern, this came about at roughly the 3 month mark. A hourglass flaccid shape formed along with purple spider veins along the shaft. Shrinkage along with a turtling/pulsating sensation in the penis constantly, especially when sitting or bending down. Basically the mechanics and look of the penis completely changed within a matter of weeks, even my fianc\u00e9 agreed that it looked and felt differently. Less size both girth and length &amp; much more stimulation required to get an erection. \n\nSo over a year later these symptoms have not improved much. Flaccid penis is hanging a little better this past month and i can gain an erection sufficient enough to have penetrative sex with enough stimulation and the use of Cialis. Thankfully i was already in a long term relationship with a very understanding fianc\u00e9 so that makes it easier than what some people are experiencing. \n\nMy symptoms i am still experiencing correlate so closely with hard flaccid. I suffered many anxious episodes and panic attacks throughout this whole experience but even that has subsided and i feel better since the turn of this year. I just need to get these sexual sides resolved!    \n\nI have been testing my hormones since the 3 month mark. My prolactin level at one point was nearly off the chart, to a point where a possible tumour on the pituitary was suggested. This just shows what the drug is capable of. This eventually dropped and fell back into within the expected levels but it has stayed at the higher end of the limit.\n\nMost recent results:\nTestosterone - normal/mid\nEstrogen - high\nProlcatin - high\nDht - low    \n\nI am hoping and praying things will return back to normal and i can put this shitty experience behind me and move on with my life. \n\nAny help is welcome.\nThanks for reading. \n\nAlso to anyone thinking of using fin, i suggest you read ALL of the experiences people have had with the drug. Many guys over the internet are strong defenders of  fin, and you know what, if they experience zero side effects and they see regrowth, why would not they be ?\nBut not all people have such positive experiences.\nI am not even in the \u2018ban it now\u2019 camp. I just want honesty and transparency about the side effects of this pill. And some form of explanation &amp; recognition about what i have experienced. We are adults, we can make our own choices. However we should know all the implications before making that choice. Likewise. I had ZERO idea about finasteride side effects and ZERO knowledge about Post Finasteride Syndrome. Then one day the side effects hit me like a truck and I have been fucked ever since. It is all nocebo &amp; mental illness according to tressless &amp; Kevin Mann followers... until you develop PFS yourself and you are fucked as well. I wish I knew about this syndrome before hand, I wish I had this knowledge, no one told me, I did not research, my doctor did not say a thing. Sorry I do not have much to recommend for your situation other than addressing hormones, thyroid, neurosteroids, gut microbiome, this is my current focus areas. Daily Tadalafil may also be highly beneficial for your situation. Wish you the best for your recovery and hope you find improvement soon. Appreciated mate. Same to you \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc A great YouTube channel to check out is Health Recovery. Especially his videos on mindset &amp; gratefulness. Jame\u2019s videos have really helped me a lot throughout this journey. Highly recommend. Stay positive, keep pushing forward, you will improve, you will get better. Finasteride is used to help men transition to women and should have never been prescribed for your hair \n\nFinasteride is sometimes used in hormone replacement therapy for transgender women due to its antiandrogenic effects, in combination with a form of estrogen.\n\nA fun fact Yes. \nShocking really that a 10 minute online questionnaire was enough to get my hands on a prescription for this drug. \nFor what was very mild and very early stages of receding/maturing hairline.\nA needless risk and the biggest mistake of my life to date. How long since you stopped fin ? I will be honest I did not love reading this. I have been off for 5 months and I am hoping that I will recover between the 6-12 months mark. My symptoms are similar to yours and I also took it for a short period of time.\n\nI saw a urologist who basically agrees that PFS is real and he is seen several patients with it but does not know what to do given the lack of information on this subject. He advised me to wait and see basically.\n\nMaybe try some herbal supplements. Apparently some people had success with that but not sure how many of them would have recovered anyway with enough time having passed. I have tried some and so far they have been useless. Have you been slowly improving tho? if your testosterone is rising u are otherwise your not recovering u just think u do. DM me if u want to more about my protocols. I am a big fan of the recovery protocol at totalmaleoptimization.com\n\nHe suggests combatting penis atrophy with a penis pump. \nIt is a little embarassing, especially if you live with someone or whatever but I can recommend it. \nIt basically forces blood flow into your penis and growth.\n\nIt is like exercising a muscle at the gym and consistent use will give you the results you are looking for.\n\nI am now healthy enough that I do not need to be here but I will continue to lurk this subreddit so that readers who come here in the future looking for help find the positive reassurance and help they need. Have you had any improvements sexual from the start till now ? 100% this.\n\nI would not have had any improvement if it were not for that procotol. Now I have my life back. (Have not used/needed the pump though as I had no penile atrophy or ED. But I was hit with almost all the other symptoms very hard.) How long for libido to return and would you say it was last to come back fully ? Varies from person to person. The sooner you start and the more disciplined you are, the sooner you will recover.\n\nMy libido is 50% back, meaning I feel strong libido every second day instead of every day. This is above average but below my average. How long has it been since you quit ? A little over nine years.\n\nI got worse for the first seven years until I did the protocol. Would be at 100% if it was not for Covid shutting down my gym etc. What do you recommend most for sexual sides to recover ? The full protocol outlined on TotalMaleOptimization. It is not a \u201cdo x for y symptom,\u201d you just do the full protocol until you are fully recovered. Symptoms will go up and down until you fully recover.  What are your main side effects ? Has libido come back? You are asking the same questions... my man, I gave you the answer you need. It is time to go and do it Hey man any improvements lately? I have the same sides as you, thanks", "Permanent ED from one pill? Hey everyone. About 4 months ago I caved in &amp; took my first &amp; only 1mg pill of finasteride. I felt side effects immediately &amp; threw the rest of the pulls out. \n\nThe side effects continued for a while, &amp; I did not get any real improvement until nearly 3 months in. Now almost all the side effects are basically gone, but my libido has taken a huge hit &amp; my erections are about 60% of what they were. Is this permanent? Long time Libido loss and ED are typical PFS symptoms. On the other hand, often these symptoms disappear with the time. Discuss it on reddit and at the propertia help website too,. Like I do. I am half a year with this shit. Look up more playes more dates article on this you might need the unnatural treatmend It is not permanent if you do something about it.  Otherwise, it will never quite go back to how it was.  Yes, from one pill Propecia help is a cesspool of negativity.  Stay away from that site if you can.  They offer no solutions, just doom and gloom and more problems.  Horrible site.  \n\nThere is no reason you need to be suffering like this. After a decade of helping guys with this condition, there is only one type of treatment that has garnered recoveries........ONE. it is permanent for me...unfortunately...hope you cure 100% It gets better with time Try taking zinc, doing the angion method, horny goat weed, jelqing, kegels, reverse kegels, pretty much start browsing r/gettingbigger, read more plates more dates article on post finasteride syndrome (it is on his website), and I hope you took testosterone/estrogen baselines because you might just have a hormonal imbalance (\nA lot of people here are full of negativity and only fall into self loathing rabbit holes Why bother with fin? Thallium has been known to cause hair loss. There is people who have regrown hair after only \n3 \nmonths by doing thallium detox.\nIt turns out thallium is in gasoline, coal, etc. if thallium is causing your loss, then taking fin is next to useless. IMO the most credible theory regarding the libido problem is that the 5-ar inhibitor interfered with your body's production of allopregnanolone in the brain. The stuff your pushing is not better than propeciahelp. You shit talk the main resource for PFS then hawk your \"total male optimization\" fasting regimen like you actually know something. It is cool that you want to offer people hope but you are not really helping. You cannot stop selling. Cdsredd has something to sell. Propertia Help is close related to the post finasteride foundation. They fund research in this horrible condition. Solution comes after research. Maybe there will be a treatment one day.\n\nPFS is not funny. To life with a cut cock, Anhedonia and Fatuige is a torture. So a PFS website is not a country club. what is your side effect profile You mean someone to help?\n\nHows YOUR health? Find anything that works? Many many other people disagree with that statement.... The recovered ones\n\nAnd I do not push anything.\n\nStay miserable....its your life. Do not try and stop others from having their's\n\nYou will see....I do not know how new you are to this, that place is doing nobody any favors You cannot believe....not sure why.  But I do know you should not talk about something you know nothing about. When you think you are helping you are actually hurting everyone or at least trying to with your message. It is not going to work because it is truth and truth always wins. All you are going to do is cause doubt in people's minds and make themselves suffer that much longer. That is on you. \n\n How do I know this? Because I have been doing this for a decade or so And my message has only gotten louder.. So you can try but you are Wasting your time.  How do you think it is that I have been around so long?\n\n You would be much better off focusing on your own recovery rather than hindering everyone else's. PH is pretty bad...the internet needs more regulation imo...many blogs regulate themselves... Like the askdictors subreddit here, where people ask medical questions and only certified medical professionals are allowed to respond. CDs blog is better but still wish none of it existed and people just listened to doctors. And by doctors I mean the ones with real jobs that see patients in clinics instead of the low life online doctors at websites like keeps and hims that peddleout cancer drugs like finasteride to patients over the internet.  Trust me there is not much tappable financial market in pfs most of us are broke losers. Much easier ways to make way more money out there. He is trying to help people. And there is no way he did not go thru pfs, it is not a disease anyone would be remotely interested in unless they have experienced it personally. I took only 3 pillls and Its been 11 months for me. I have literally recovered from every single side except for ED. Its tortue but i still simply refuse to believe that taking such a low dose can have permanent side effects. I say this because my mental sides recovered as well as libido. ED is just the last missing piece that im waiting for. Theres hope bros. Not exactly sure what you mean, but I experienced essentially all notorious side effects immediately. I stopped after one pill. 4 months in all other sides have gone other than my ED. Will this too go away? I head more plates for dates day they side effects from fin only happens to like 2% of people who take it yet i see it a lot and not sure if I should take it. Evens YouTube Lex little is taking fin and he said he is not balding he just takes it just in case Can you elaborate? What is the evidence for this statement?  it is plain reality, why regulate that? lol the master bro scientist of pfs community? so tell the regimen right here, if you want to help people and not just talk your talk so tell your great cure here and stop the bla bla bla That is what the website for....keep up When your dick, works, I bet the would sound so much better coming out of your mouth.  But it does not, which is why you are on the subreddit.  And instead of being cordial to someone showing you, you are not fucked, you act an ass. I am not telling you shit with your holier then though attitude.  My man....suffer for the rest of your life, a sentence worse then death, imo.  I dont know who you think you are talking too, but any help you would have gotten, is gone.  Have fun never being able to please a woman again......peace.  And if you were smart enough to realize, the whole protocol  is on the site for FREE, dippy. So many posts of people improving Where?\n\nAre you saying it gets better for everyone? Not for everyone but but a lot what is your explosion? what site? where is your cure protocol? want to see it that is all what website? Where are the \u2018many\u2019 posts of people improving?\n\nWhat does \u2018a lot\u2019 mean? He is hawking supplements for commission on a gimmicky site called  yes, pure shitstain\n\nI have screenshot his rage and if someone calls that marketing then feel free.... Give you body proper diet especially cruciferous vegetables and other soluble fibre.  Make sure you are sleeping well, if you have to take ambien or something for awhile then it is not the end of the world.  Then consider hcg, creatine and androgen cycles, preferably DHT based ones.  Peptides helped me a lot as well, as did wellbutrin for depression/anhehdonia\n\nLots of people recover, you just need to keep these things in check Thanks. I have been noticing more recovery, I can actually function relatively normally now, although my drive took a huge hit. When you say lots of people recover do you mean 100%? I am hopeful I will get back what I lost. It sounds like you only have sexual issues, so consider yourself lucky, as strange as that sounds.  If that is the case, I would probably just get on some cycles now, it could straighten you out quicker than expected.  Nothing is guaranteed though What are cycles?", "Have you reported your side effects to the FDA? \n\n( This is not scientific at all, but it kind of explains why i think side effects are massively under reported. Same thing happened with anti depressants(It was discovered in recent years that the side effect rate for sexual dysfunction was as high as 60%, despite being on the market for decades and everyone said the % chance was very low), men are too embarrassed to talk about sexual dysfunction, especially if it is for the sake of saving their hair. I wish men would tell, then they can receive support and contribute to raise of awareness about pfs", "2 Year PFS Sufferer Hey guys, I have been suffering from this terrible disease nearly two years. I took Finasteride for two months and quit taking it in December 2019 when I noticed ED and some aches in my testes. No other symptoms at the time. In the following months, my libido plummeted. No sex drive whatsoever. My penis begin to get smaller. Brain fog overtook me as well. Fast forward nearly two years later, I still have the same side effects. This is miserable. I need help!!  None  One of the comments disappeared and viagra/cialis helps to get it a little hard but very weak erection. Not enough to maintain penetration  Sorry to hear that! \n\nMake sure you report your ongoing side effects to the relevant authorities. (In the US, this would be the FDA -  20 year plus sufferer here..REally nothing you can do about it.  Maybe get on TRT injections for life and take viagra/cialis .. I have tried everything under the sun.  It is permanent my friend...only a miracle can cure us... It is not permanent for everyone. A lot of people do end up recovering, or at least improving considerably. HOpe you do recover 100% man.  I would not put this on my worse enemy..... What is ur age today? How do u live life? Still single? What happened to you? How long you took it for? What are your symptoms? I find it hard to believe that 20 years and nothing improved Yeah..i took it for 5 years on and off during my 20's....symptons include ED, no libido, low TRT, insomnia, constipation.....The ED and the libido makes me want to not live anymore.  I am sure i am not the only one that the symptons haev persisted 20 year plus ...It is permanent for most my friend.  HOw bout you?...are you taking fin? or have symptons? Yes I took it for few weeks. Was hit severely but symptoms gradually improved with few lingering ones from a year ago. This is really disheartening I hope you get better. It is hard for me to accept permanent changes I mean even if it is epigenetics you can still change it. Honestly, if was this far out and nothing improves then I would try harder steroid cycles. Have you considered becoming sort of a bodybuilder and running more than just TRT?\n\nAlso, we just do not know how many have it permanently. We just do not have any follow up studies with large numbers to make a defintive statement but this drug must be one of the most powerful ones. Even severe drug addict more or less recover after few years of being sober. I check the propecia help forum from time to time but a lot of the long term user are not even there from finasteride.  I had shrinkage of penis and retraction, pseudogyno, weight gain around stomach, poo pellets.

Search for total male\nOptimisation and read the forums. Feel free to DM. It is not permanent for most. I am sorry it has not gotten better for you, but telling people that they will not get better and that it is permanent is fucked up. How are u doing? Habe u found anything to cure PFS? What is you age today? How are u today? No cure. Hoping to find one here. What is your age? 21 That is very young age. Did u consult a doctor? What did the doctor say? He does not believe in PFS. Does someone even do some research to find a cure against PFS? I am 35. Still having side effects like u mentioned yours. Tomorrow I go see an urologist. Noone could help me before. No, current research is to find the potential causes and prove existence of the condition to the mainstream or for legal base against lawsuit. And even that is many decades away. No studies are made to try any form. Of treatment. In my opinion current research into the cause is futile. Epigenetic is a very complicated field and even if we know precisely which DNA is involved in the condition it will not help at all. \n\nA better approach would be to go directly for treatments and see patients response but that will not happen either. Pfs group are only interested in victim status not cures. If there was a cure tomorrow I am sure some there would be disappointed because pfs is so tied to their identity and their donation funds. \n\nPeople on pfs forum have completely given up and for them any attempt of treating is shunned by moderators. There are a lot of really ridiculous people there I find.\n\nMy advice to you dude would be to give it some time like a year and reassess but if you do not see improvements then time to be proactive. I personally did not wait that long I am having pfs since 9 years. Pls DM what exactly to do and how to start. I think that is the truth.

I was never like this and I am literally thinking about shooting up testosterone at this point because holy fucking fuck. It is either fixing this within a month or just straight up shooting myself in the head. Who the fuck can live like this? 5 fucking months?

Libido loss. Anxiety. I watched videos on YouTube and read articles online and believed that the likelihood of experiencing symptoms would be low. I decided to take 1 mg EOD instead of the recommended dosage of every day. I took 9 1mg pills over 18 days. Last Thursday I realized I was much more anxious than usual. Thursday was the last time I took a pill. I tropically have a high libido but now it is taking me a long time to get an erection and it is not a strong one. The brain fog is unreal like I have a cloud in my head. Is it possible for these symptoms to go away quickly now that I have stopped? Stop the medicine. And give it time.  You may heal up. But there also a chance you may not.   Everyone is different You will need at least 30 days for your 5AR to regenerate itself. Most likely a little more time even due to fins half-life.\n\nThen it will take a few weeks to a month until your brain re-adapted again.\n\nAfter 3 months you will probably know if your sides will mostly go away or stick with you. How old are you? 30 Give it a month. You will be fine. Do not stress. Take some l-citrulline if you want. Thank you stingerbbell! I noticed the brain fog did not get really bad until I stopped the med. Monday and Tuesday were very tough days, today I feel somewhat better. Anxiety is not as bad as when I was taking the med but still present. Sex drive was actually higher while on the med. I am just trying to eat healthy and get good rest. I will force myself to work out tomorrow even if I am not feeling it. L-citrulline will help your workout too. But it sounds like your body was regulating and snapping back. Probably fine in 2 weeks honestly. Make sure you update! I will man\u2026. For sure. Grateful for your help. How quickly does l-cirtrulline aid erection health? Like 30 mins, and if you take morning and night its even better. It is like a mini viagra. Also helps push more with the workout. Hell yeah I will pick some up Brain fog has gotten better through out the day\u2026 scary stuff. My hair line loosing its strength over the last couple of years means very little in comparison to these symptoms. These sides are no joke. Yeah I am going to switch to topical finasteride and see if I do not get sides. In theory would not the topical still cause sides if it still lowers DHT? Today\u2019s update\u2026 fog is somewhat better, anxiety is not as bad as it was, no morning wood, sex drive is shit, overall drive for getting day to day life stuff done is getting better. Feeling so much better than I was earlier in the week overall, so I am hopeful that I am healing. Huge difference between brain fog yesterday and today. Still somewhat present but definitely getting better. Libido seems to be somewhat on the rise. I can actually look at woman and get excited\u2026 this was not even happening for me just days ago. I seem to be on the mend\u2026 I will never touch this stuff again. Glad to hear!! Update on side effects? Sex drive back, energy back, anxiety back to the norm, no problem getting/maintaining erection during sex  however\u2026.. I think the girth toward the base of the shaft is thinner than before while soft\u2026 maybe a little thinner while erect\u2026. Taking on that hour glass shape that I have seen in the Peytonie\u2019s pics\u2026. Something I never noticed before taking fin. I am thinking the best course of action is to see a urologist Thanks for the update and glad your okay. For that \u201chour glass \u201c penis thing your are mentioning, does it hurt getting erect ?? I took 1 single FIN pill on 10/25 and immediately got full blown sides (skrinkage penis, no libido, fogginess etc) it feels in my pants by the pant imprint that it looks considerably smaller (maybe no blood in penis , libido ?) but it is scary stuff .. Dude\u2026. I did shrink when I was taking it\u2026 in my opinion like a circulation issue? I remember my hands and feet being cold too. You only took one pill? Just stop taking I think you should be fine man Yup obviously when flaccid  it looks wrinkly but I am thinking there is no blood flowing down there.  And i have it is been like 5 days since I took the first and only pill. Can you get an erection?

But after a long month and a half, I have fully recovered. Holy shit that was the scariest thing I have ever gone through in my life. \n\nLesson learned: who cares about hair, our health is more important.\n\nEveryone stay patient and safe. Happy to answer any questions. Glad to hear it! You did recover within the time frame that Merk suggests - some guys have not recovered +120 months after stopping the med. (Literally.)\n\nThere are guys who fully recovered, then lost more hair and panicked and jumped back on finasteride, got side effects again and quit again - but did not spontaneously recover from their sexual sides the second time. So if you ever decide to take finasteride again, understand that you might get long term side effects the second time around. That is a story I have heard numerous times. Gotcha. Yeah I suppose I am lucky- it could have been worse.\n\nAnd if I am certain about one thing, it is that I will NEVER take finasteride again in my life. Never.\n\nEven a 1/100 risk of having side effects is too great of a risk to take - it is simply not worth it.\n\nOverall, lesson learned: going bald is absolutely fine lol. Yeah, six weeks is a slap on the wrist. Just make sure you remember how you feel about finasteride today as you lose more hair. Do not panic and think you can take it a few days per week, or cut the pills in pieces, or use topical fin - just avoid it forever, period.\n\nFor the hair, when you lose enough you can go with a shaved head, shaved head plus micropigmentation, hair system, or a hair transplant (depending on your level of hair loss and age. It is risky to get a hair transplant before age 25, ideally 30+ or 35+ so they know how bald you will ultimately be. Because it will look horrible if you bulk up the missing areas and then lose all your hair behind that.)\n\nI recommend just going with the natural shaved head look, plus working out to build muscles. It is the cheapest option and it still looks good. Amen to that brother Can I ask what you did? To recover? Nothing really it just takes time. I only took the medication for a few weeks so my body was able to regulate itself after a month or so. Also, get good sleep! Gotcha thanks boss. I was on for about 3 months off for 1.5 now so I think I will need a bit more time haha. Any tips on getting more sleep? I am getting a consistent 7 without supplementation but I think an extra hour could help 7 is very solid actually. You will be good in a few more weeks. Maybe more because you took it for a bit longer. But you seem to be on the right track so far. Good luck brother Thanks I appreciate you man. It is always good to hear a success story and have someone to relate to Yeah for sure man. And honestly- I had it really bad too. It is not like I just got soft for a few days- I legit could not get a boner for a month. My dick shriveled up and stayed that way, it was the worst. \n\nBut now I am legit piping girls again and I am fully 100% back to normal in both length and thickness. Lmao sorry for the TMI but I just want to emphasize that it WILL get better over time. No you are fine I appreciate the honesty haha. I did not get super bad sides so I am hoping to make a quick recovery, glad to hear you are back at it too!\n\nI went soft on a chick and knew something was up so its good to hear I will be good soon Haha yep as long as you quit that stuff you will be back soon.

Finasteride is making me have homosexual ideation. I tried Finasteride for 2 weeks, 3 months ago. Before then I was fully attracted to women. Finasteride crashed my libido to literally zero, I had ED and some other sides. I was happy when I started seeing these go away but I have found myself compulsively attracted to men\u2026 and I have NEVER been attracted to men. I cannot even watch Hetro porn anymore cause it makes me feel sick. I have the urge to watch gay porn but I will not let myself.\n\nI am terrified because not only am I in a heterosexual relationship for SEVEN YEARS. I am also a devote catholic and absolutely do not agree with homosexual sin or marriage. I am lost\u2026 I do not know what to do. I have prayed and prayed and prayed and these urges will not go away. Please help\u2026. I have heard this before:  The basics are your Estrogen is through the roof and your neurosteroids have been altered.  \n\nWhat I cannot attest to, is your sexual preference to begin with.  You say you were fully attracted to women, but somewhere deep inside you might have been on the fence, whether you knew it or not.  The push in hormones was all it needed to tip the scales.\n\nRegardless, you simply need to recover to get your \"normal\" state of mind back.  Propecia help is NOT a place you should be hanging around if you want to recover.  You answered that question like a closeted homophobe. I am sorry, I just call them like I see them. I think I have the answer to my question in regards to your case.. And I think everybody reading this knows where I am going with this. Well I guess the Mods did not like your response..... Assuming you are not a troll. I have seen some reports of people's sexual preferences changing after PFS. Go to /r/steroids and you will see all kinds of posts with men craving sex with men. I have nothing to back this up, but I am sure changes in hormones/neurosteroids can change our libido and what we are attracted to. \n\nYour stupid take on gay men and their \"sinful/disgusting\" nature will not be tolerated on here, however. Going forward, cut the homophobic stuff out. We have gay men on this subreddit and everyone is to be respected. You cannot \"pray\" away gay, either. Who you end up loving/being attracted to is no one's business and is not a reason to attack someone. No, I did not like his response. We have gay men on here that deserve respect. His response was exactly like you called it, homophobic.   Are you choosing to be gay, then? Or is it totally out of your control? Why is it that gay conversion therapy is banned? Because you cannot change someone is sexual attractions. I am not going to argue this stupid point anymore. We can discuss PFS, symptom improvement, etc. But this is not going to be a homophobic rant space. I am not gay I just have sexual sinful desires from Finasteride I do not get why this is such a big deal everyone around me in real life feels the same way and I think most of the country does This is not the place for religious debate on sin and sex. Maybe your sexual desire has changed as a result of Finasteride. I think you need to take this up with a sex therapist, because I do not have the answer for you. What you call sinful, other people call loving each other.  Religion has nothing to do with this.  It is the way you are coming at the question.  You are probably just gay and do not want to admit it, or, you want to blame it on the finasteride. Well if you are accepting of that you should understand and accept that I do not want to become a homo. People can do whatever but that is sin, and I am not a sinner. I just want this to be figured out Again, it is NOT sin....maybe in your little black book it is, but that does not translate to REAL life.  That is YOUR story, NOT everyone else's.  \n\nAnd yes, I am accepting of two people (or More)  enjoying each other in whatever consensual way those consenting adults agree on.  If you do not, that is fine, but really, it is none of your business.\n\nWell, bonerless....it sounds like you are gay, and you are struggling with it.  Are you not thinking about dudes in sexual ways? Again I just tried to watch straight guy porn, specifically girl on girl and did not feel anything. This is almost embarassing.  I think I might be wasting my time.\n\nYou did not answer my question, and not feeling anything because fin fucked you up is a perfectly normal reaction.

I ask this because I took 1 mg of finasteride one time. I went back and forth for months deciding in my mind if this was the right move and then recently convinced myself that I was okay with the risks before getting the prescription.\n\nI ended up just taking one mg pill - I quickly realized I was not comfortable with the constant worry long-term and discontinued. I felt fine for a little more than a week and then just recently had some ED issues. I am wondering if theres a typical time frame of how long people have used before developing syptoms? I have to imagine any link to finasteride would probably be a result of an underlying, preexisting condition. \n\nInterested to hear some others perspectives. I do not know of any factors that can predict whether finasteride will lead to sexual symptoms. (In my opinion, until we know those factors and can disqualify people likely to have adverse symptoms, finasteride should not be used for hair loss at all.)\n\nSome people immediately get symptoms from as little as one pill. Others may take finasteride and not get adverse symptoms until years later. \n\nI think you made the right decision by stopping immediately. Most likely the issues you are experiencing will resolve. Just take care of yourself and avoid any other treatments that might complicate matters. thank you for your feedback - appreciate it One other thought that I hope you can weigh in on. As I said, I didnt have any symptoms for a full week after I took the 1 mg pill. I also still have high sex drive, just loss of morning erections last 2 days. I have read that it leaves your system within 7 days, so I am not sure it clinically makes sense that this would occur and would have difficult time attributing it to the one pill - that said, I recognize the risk with even low dosage. I have heard of people having side effects while they are on it, then discontinuing and still having the issues - but idk that I have seen examples of not having symptoms while taking it, and then developing the side effect once it leaves the system. My doctor was very open and straightforward about the risks, but he mentioned he is never heard of such a low dosage causing this - I understand I need to take that with a grain of salt. Would appreciate your insights. thank you Tl;dr: It is plausible that adverse symptoms could continue long after finasteride leaves the system, but doctors miss this because they are stuck on a \"side effects\" model. Rather, finasteride\u2014or withdrawal from it\u2014could damage androgen metabolism such that the effects last after the drug has left the system.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nDoctors and patients alike should know that finasteride is tinkering with a delicate and very important process called **androgen metabolism\\*** which is involved in sexual functioning, skin, hair, muscles and cognitive function.\n\nWhen going on or off finasteride, the changes in 5-AR or DHT levels, or both, could knock androgen metabolism out of order such that even after discontinuation of finasteride, androgen metabolism remains out of order. Maybe it recovers in weeks or months, or maybe not at all. This is what we see: some men recover and some do not. We also see men with symptoms in the above categories related to androgen metabolism: sexual functioning, skin, hair, muscles and cognitive function.\n\nThe scientific basis for post-finasteride syndrome has not been established, but these are the leading hypotheses. In short, finasteride might induce a disorder of androgen metabolism which remains after stopping the drug.\n\nu/omaha_123 I have every hope that you will completely recover from whatever symptoms you are experiencing now. Do not think about this stuff, but I did want to respond to your questions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* Here is background on how finasteride works. An enzyme called 5-alpha reductase (5-AR) converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is DHT that stresses hair follicles and leads to hair loss. What finasteride does is inhibit the 5-AR enzyme so that less DHT is produced. This is why it can slow hair loss. I did not respond to your question about symptoms showing up a week after one pill. I cannot recall hearing another report of exactly that.\n\nA recurring theme in patient reports is that finasteride dosing and what is happening in the body are not necessarily in lockstep. For many (according to forum posts and people I have corresponded with), the situation evolves in the weeks and months after stopping the drug. thank you for all of the information. very helpful. This situation is just giving me a ton of anxiety based on reading a number of other posts. As I said, my doctor told me that it would not medically make sense to not have any symptoms while taking one pill and then to later develop symptoms after its completely out of my system more than a week later. I am hopeful that this can be reversed, or if this is more anxiety related and has nothing to do with the one pill. I have had ED before from either psychological issues or short stints on antidepressents. I just hope the 1 mg did not permanently damage hormones Just came across this:\n\n\n\u201cI only took two doses of 0.25mg and just like this guy five days later I lost sensitivity...\u201d well that is very unsettling", "Dose interruptions For those who have long-term symptoms: did you take finasteride continuously or were there interruptions?\n\n( I took it continuously for 8 months, stopped for a weekend due to not feeling right, then tried mon wed fri for a week (saw it on the hairloss show) then stopped.\n\nSo pretty continuous except at the last week. Were adverse effects worse when you resumed after a break? My hypothesis was that long-term symptoms are especially likely to be triggered by an interruption, then resumption of finasteride. About have the responses indicate an interruption.\n\nSo it \\_may\\_ be a risk factor, but is not a necessary condition. Not really? \n\nPretty much what happened is I felt really off due to fin, decided to try the \"monday, wed, fri\" thing for a week and decided the potential side effects I had were not worth it for hair.\n\nSo I do not really think the last week had any affect on anything because I was feeling like shit beforehand. Yes, same here. I took it for 2 years with now side effects. After a break of almost 5 years I took it again and got severe lasting side effects after one dose.", "Side Effect pertaining to Vision. Hi guys, i have been using Finasteride for almost 2 years, nothing particularly happened on me that causing awareness, but I realised I starts to develop a vision problem a few months after i have started using Finasteride. I can see a cloudy spot in my peripheral vision in a bright environment. But in conjunction to that i had also some complication with my eye. I am not sure is Finasteride causal to this problem or just somehow correlated. Thanks guys I personally have not seen this side effect present itself in Post Finasteride Syndrome, although I would not be surprised, the devastation this drug can cause is wide spread and systemic. You say you had some recent complication with you eye, I would take a guess and say it is more likely to be related to that than the finasteride. The medical term for that is \"floaters\", or \"mouche volante\". Is caused by very slight hardening of the jelly mass in your eyeball causing a shadow to be cast on your retina. I got it when i was 17, and its pretty common apparently. Pretty sure its not finasteride related But the problem is, i went to 2 different eye doctor and they cant find any problem with my eye. And i can tell they are not floaters as they tend to follow my vision rather than random. When i move my eye to the left the blury spot will move to the right vice versa. They appear to be a bright spot rather than a dark spot like a usual floater. Went to 2 eye doc they still can find a diagnosis On this page, search for \u2018macular\u2019, \u2018floppy iris\u2019 and \u2018dry eye\u2019. There are four papers matching these terms. \n\n I have dry eye disease which I definitely believe is related to Fin and has been documented as a side effect. I believe strongly at this point that Fin could have wide spread systemic complications beyond what we allows know. perhaps a mild form of  retinal detachment? You should definitely get this sorted out. I would be very surprised if 5ar inhibition (besides all the other stuff it can cause), would cause this blurry spot in your vision. Thanks for the info, however, I dont find any similar encounter that i have had. Besides, I have recently done my OCT scan and find nothing related to this problem. my eye doctor said no sign of that after looking at my OCT scan. She insist that is some sort of Floaters (probably a bigger chunk) and ask me not to worry about it. But i can tell a different between them and i know its not a floater. Eye problems have been reported in research on post-finasteride patients. This paper is not public but Table 1 has the data.\n\nMelcangi RC, Caruso D, Abbiati F, et al.

Perhaps I should try to stop taking Fin for a few months to see if my vision really recover from the so called \"Floaters\". I will keep you guys update. Anyone can suggest how long should i stop to get it proven? I took fin for 3 days in July.  Had sides so stopped.\n\nAfter about 5 weeks I had the infamous crash, I had the same cloudy spot that you are referring to. \n\nIt is like tunnel vision with cloudiness on the peripherals.  \n\nLasted about a week or so, and then I was fine.  \n\nThis is definitely due to finasteride.  That shit is poison.  I took tribulus around that time and I did not have the eye issue since. You should be fine eventually.  Man, taking Fin was such a mistake for so many of us.  It is very weird that some have no sides, like wtf.   Makes no sense to me. I have no tunnel vision after all, but this Spot that constantly annoying me. I have stopped taking Fin for a week since after taking it for more than a year. I will see what will happen in the next 3 months Androgens, especially DHT is needed for normal eyes. Low DHT due to Finasteride can surely affect the eyes in the long run. Do you have any related published paper on this matter&gt;? I would like to have a better understanding to this.

I am only here because I have been on the fence in regards to taking finasteride for months now, I found etifoxine in a completely unrelated search and wondered if the mechanism of action could prove useful for preventing or even maybe easing symptoms of PFS? Etifoxine has been mentioned in a few fora before, but I have not heard of anybody taking it. It is hard to get in the US, and since doctors do not believe PFS is real, they are probably not going to prescribe it either. Welcome to our world.\n\nYou have better things to do. Go live your life and enjoy a healthy brain - do not risk destroying it with finasteride. Do not take fin, it is poison to your body. Go with topical rogaine and ketoconazole shampoo. If you get side effects you will now have less hair and severely impacted sexual ability, or worse. Repeat, do not take it. It is not worth fucking with your body for a few strands of hair.  PFS reaper &gt; Norwood reaper. Rogaine (minoxidil) and ketoconazole are suspected of causing PFS symptoms too. Best to avoid them as well. You are very positive and encouraging with people that already have pfs but when someone comes on saying they are thinking of taking it you really scare them away ... It seems like your philosophy is to just tell people what you think they need to hear. That is a good plan. Do not take finasteride until there is a credible effective treatment for PFS. Dude pfs is not something you want. I think it can be beaten but let me tell you I suffered over a year and it was the worse hell possible. It wasnt something you can just live thru. I am on month 9. I remember I started smoking at 18 cause I did not believe something like a cigarette could be that addictive , smoked for a year and it took me 3 years to quit. I guess I like learning the hard way and torturing myself . I think that same mentality is part of the reason I took the risk with finasteride. Rogaine cannot cause hormonal changes lol Hmm... If I was just telling them what they needed to hear, does not that mean I should say \"yea, go ahead and take finasteride, if you get side effects, you can just fix it with etifoxine\"?\n\nMy stance is pretty consistent, I would say - \n- the risks of long-lasting or permanent side effects is not worth it for a cosmetic condition - nobody should take finasteride for hair loss.\n- however, if you get side effects, you will likely be OK in a few weeks or months if you quit\n\nIt is possible to believe both of these statements at the same time. \"Minoxidil suppresses AR transactivation and target gene expression\". Still laughing out loud? Sorry for late reply I was in Reddit gulag. The site I found it on ships from US as well as Russia, I have got some en route to me now just to see what it is like as I have sleep issues recently and do not want to use recreational drugs. I have a different source for actual pregnelone too which is supposed to help. I am likely not going to be taking finasteride any time soon but I think I will try it and just quit if I get any symptoms. I will use 0.25mg EOD and take pregnelone or something maybe idk, I hope some research is done into this condition in order to find an effective treatment or better yet a way of ensuring its prevention. I mainly just came here to make sure people here knew of this medicine and its potential benefits as PFS sounds like hell. DM if you want sources Thanks for reporting back!\n\nAlthough there is a lot of internet bro science about why finasteride causes these awful and long-lasting side effects, it is actually not really known how they happen. Neurosteroids probably has something to do with it, but it is unclear where the issue is. It could be a receptor problem, it could be an issue with the amount of hormone, it can be any number of things. Or a combination of things.\n\nThat is why I would be careful when experimenting with compounds like etifoxine. They can easily make you way worse. \n\nAs someone who is struggled with PFS for a long time, it would think it is crazy that you are even considering taking it. And it is even crazier that you are thinking about stacking it with random hormones and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThere are so many ways to improve your health and your life that are safe and supported by science. Do those things instead! Forget about magic pill \"fixes\" to cosmetic problems. You know what looks good? Being healthy! I totally get what you are saying, I have just heard from a lot of people that if you quit as soon as you notice symptoms you can get away with it as long as you just accept maybe you are one of the unlucky people who cannot get away with taking it and do not try it again after a few weeks off. I have heard of so many people using it without issues it is hard to just write off one of the most effective hair-loss treatments without trying it. You will also hear the same people saying that if you notice side effects, you should stay on it, and the symptoms will eventually fade... \ud83d\ude44 These people do not know what they are talking about - people can get messed up from a single pill. An Irish guy I know took 4. I took 10. The side effects can come rapidly and without warning. There is no way to know if you are sensitive to this stuff or not.\n\nTrue, most people seem to get better within a few weeks or months of stopping, but is this really a chance you want to take? You want to risk a chemical lobotomy for hair? Very true. I guess even gambles with good odds seem like a good idea until you are the one that gets shafted. I will stick to trying other things in my protocol, microneedling etc and hopefully this at least halts the norwood reaper's progress lol. I genuinely really hope you start to feel better man, praying for you all and hoping this condition eventually gets the attention and research it needs. Thanks!\n\nYou might want to add on infrared light therapy if you are really gung ho about this hair thing. Bro so it took over a year to recover fully sexually what were your symptoms and longest to go away side effects ? Also anything you did to help recover ??", "Anyones symptoms getting worse after quitting? I quit about 25 days ago and for the first time \u201ccould not get it up\u201d before I was able to with a weak erection but now nothing. Mine did get worse after quitting (a while ago), but they eventually got better. You are definitely not alone in this experience. A quick search through this community and you will find that many stories match your own. Ride it out. You can recover. Best wishes for a fast recovery. \u262e\ufe0f Same experience for me. Just be careful; I had my \"crash\" right about where you are at now. \n\nIf you get really bad mentally just remember it will get better. I promise. Think all those who recovered should put their recovery stories on here and what they did to assist that if they are comfortable doing so. This will help a lot of PFS victims like myself gain hope and improve the mental state. Is the \u201ccrash\u201d. a good sign that all the fin left my body? I will if I recover! I am 3.5 months post fin and while I have recovered mentally, sexually I have not. \n\nI have made a lot of progress though so I am hopeful! I will post when I make a full recovery. I am the same as you. Recovering mentally but sexually seems to be no improvement I have no idea. I am no expert just speaking through my experience.\n\nHonestly I hope you do not go through a crash. Worst 2 weeks of agony of my life BY FAR! Would not wish what I went through on anybody.\n\nHopefully you just slowly recover without having to deal with that shit. \n\nAlso let me know if you need any help or need to talk to someone!  I would say a month now I was feeling nothing while i was on it for 25 days. Now i quit 4 days ago it got better, specially this morning. Not back like 100% but feeling i am getting better. My husband\u2019s experience was very similar. The mental effects began clearing within the first few days, but the sexual sides improved gradually &amp; intermittently. Meaning, there would be small improvements, then small regressions until about the 6 month post Fin timeframe. \nAlso, my guy just ate clean and worked out daily. No other meds, nor supplements. Once the mental stuff clears, it is somewhat easier to have a better outlook, which lessens the stress and gets you moving in a positive direction. It is work, certainly, and it is never an easy recovery, but facing it becomes manageable when you have an outline of possibilities. Best wishes \u262e\ufe0f Thank you! And so true about the mental aspect of it.... a month ago I could barely get out of bed and would cry and have panic attacks all the time. Now that I can actually enjoy life and the summer I feel so much better.\n\nHopefully I am back to normal soon, but at least now I have hope \ud83d\ude42. Are you still able to masturbate? I am wondering if I have pfs or if it is just mental because I have been able to finish myself Yes, but I usually do not feel like it. Yeah seems like me and you are in the same position then. I quit around a month ago as well and have noticed my symptoms getting worse. Well get through this together man. Do you have any mental sides? Like memory issues etc No not that I have noticed. I took fin from jan-mar so not a very long time, which is keeping me hopeful for a speedy recovery. My sides are mainly related to sex and decreased libido but also noticed overall decreased drive. How long were you on? Definitely keep in touch if you find anything that helps. Ive been on it since December 26th or so, and ai quit around March. I took .5mg Daily, had minor sides initially and they slowly got worse until I quit. Yeah I definitely should have quit much earlier than I did but from what I have seen it does not really matter once it hits. I have seen that plenty of people recover in a decent timeframe so heres to a speedy recovery. I have ordered some test boosters from Amazon but I am wondering if I should see a doctor before getting started seems like they do not know much about this tho Check this video out, its a more natural approach to increase test by 20%\n\n Icing my balls huh, seems a bit out there lmao. It seems like different things work for different people, I am going to try tribulus and that but if it does not work I saw a post from another guy who used a different setup on this subreddit. Good luck I thought it was funny too but 20% increase in test proved by blood test is all the convincing I needed. Hey if you know after 6 months he got full sexual function back like his sex drive and all was like it was pre fin and all good now ? So it just takes a while to get back to fully recovered ? How long was your man on it ?", "Post Hair transplant care short term Fin (6 months) which alternatives ? Hi guys,\n\nThis goes out to the folks who had a hair transplant and started Fin *after* the procedure. 40 years age here. As you might know there is a recent really vocal community out there promoting that even if you are contra Fin (i am, never touched it) to at least take it for 6 months post op to shield the new grafts and provide optimal growth / lower the risk of losing grafts. \n\nI think the people advocating for this might have a point although I still miss some wider actual research on this. My surgeon for instance (one of the top reputable &amp; most expensive clinics in the world) clearly said on my question whether to start fin or not now \"if you are not done with family planning yet, do not do it\". He sure also did no actual research on it i guess.\n\nAs said on the other hand I think blocking the new grafts from dht at least until they start a good growing cycle might be a good idea. \n\nI am really torn, and initially thought Fin is mainly a risk for younger folks and for long term usage, but reading here the horror stories of people crashing only after one pill is not cool. (Feel sorry for you and hope you recover soon !!)\n\nNow question to the folks who had a hair transplant. Any other recommendation you can give to shield / protect the new grafts ? Have you stopped Fin after sides and found something harmless to also help a bit ?\n\nI also want to state my gut feeling says me this post op Fin craze might just be Bullshit. Ultimatley no one has a comparison if the grafts would not have survived for them anyways without fin (I mean they took it and will not know what would have happened if they did not, you see my point). I am still afraid to not do the best for my grafts i hope you can relate a bit and I cannot really ask anyone. (hair transplant Forums all say \"take fin Bru...) \n\nThe care all Honestly I would not risk using fin, unless you value hair over sex and well being.\n\nWhen it comes to HT I believe the hair you transplant will be fine without fin, BUT you will keep losing your original hair.\n\nSo let us say you transplant the front, then you do not use fin so your crown will start to bald.\n\nThen you are stuck with hair in the front and nothing behind it.\n\nAlso if you do not have thick hair I would not get a HT, they cannot really put the hair very closely together so people with naturally thin hair (like me) will not get as good of an result.\n\nJust my $0.02. Yes correct the transplanted hair will be dht resistent at least for some time or most of them. I got my Ht already recently, i am aware that Fin will help keep the existing hair but there was not much left where the transplant went so it does not matter. My question was that it is promoted on some Forums to take Fin after the HT for 6 months only to help the transplanted grafts not getting attacked by DHT and eventually losing some grafts during the healing process due to that. \n\nThat is why I am torn whether to do it or not. I would not take fin to preserve existing hair, that is pointless per my view anyways as at some point you need to stop and your native hair then goes anyways I tried to find some study on it and it seems it mainly affects the non transplanted hairs.\n\n\n\nConclusion: For men with androgenetic alopecia, therapy with finasteride 1 mg daily from 4 weeks before until 48 weeks after hair transplant improves scalp hair **surrounding the hair transplant** and increases hair density.\n\n\n\nWhen this \u201cDHT-resistant\u201d hair is transferred during hair transplant surgery, the follicles tend to maintain their DHT-resistant state and do a pretty good job of staying put.\n\n\nBut, just because the transplanted hairs are doing pretty well at resisting the progressive effects of DHT, **it is likely that you still have some amount of native (DHT-sensitive) hairs surrounding the transplant area.**\n\n\nBy helping your body to ramp up growth with the use of Minoxidil, or to keep DHT levels lower with Finasteride, your surrounding **non-transplanted hairs** are better equipped to keep up with your transplanted area. Thanks for looking into it, appreciate. Yes that is my point, and i do not want to take fin based on the Reports in this sub so I was wondering if anyone here got an HT as well, tried Fin after the op and needed to stop because if sides and found something else (or even can comfort me by confirming fin is not really needed after the surgery) Do not do that! PFS us very rare. But if you got It not only your family planning is wasted away, your entire live is fucked up forever. I have had four hair transplants and had to stop taking fin.  I went on a HUGE journey of self discovery and misery and then came full circle finally, only to have to shave my head anyway and now have a MASSIVE scar from ear to ear, plus I am out 40k,  Lol....I did all that to just be bald anyway!  Fucking joke.  I was SO worried about losing my hair that now as punishment for being so vain, I walk around, bald, with a zipper across the back of my skull!  It is comical......tragically comical.\n\nYou are NEVER going to have enough donor hair for proper coverage and once you stop taking fin, you are fucked.\n\nBeen there.......so done that. Sorry to hear and I hope you can find piece. You sure have looked into it but i believe SMP is quite advanced maybe that can help with the scar appearance ? I opted for FUE because of that but no ie how it looks shaved. Take care", "Has anyone gotten pfs from topical fin? Title Yes. Topical finasteride goes systemic, just like the oral form. It is still playing with fire, I had a really bad reaction to it and recovered. Then took one pill of oral and came down with pfs. I am sure the topical played a part in that. Most people go the other way around (pill to topical) because of side effects (topical does have a lower incidence of sides, but it still happens). Is there a reason you thought the oral route would give you less side effects, or did you just want to give it a shot?\n\nEdit: or was the reaction an allergy to the topical compound? The whole story is I took .25 once about a month before I tried the topical and nothing happened, but I got kind of scared from reading everything so I tried the topical about a month later and had a really bad reaction (terrible headache and neurological sides) it went away in about 2 weeks. Then about 4 months ago I decided to try .25 again because my friend hopped on it with no issues. I came down with full blown pfs from it. Damn that is terrible. I do not blame anyone for wanting to try topical, the way some people present it online, you would think it is a miracle with all of the benefits of finasteride but none of the side effects. Here is hoping you make a full recovery. I really appreciate it man! I am still in the infancy of this so I hope I do recover. Yeah not everyone gets sides with fin, but pfs is certainly very real, if anyone wants to try it I would say topical is probably slightly safer as it goes less systemic, but still be aware of the fact that you may come down with persistent sides even after discontinuation.", "How to stop hairloss if finasteride gave me sides I took fin for 12 days and a month later even now im experiencing some sides even if libidos gotten a little better i keep having crashes every few days where i get soft hards, it seemed to have gotten better but recently i started tsking vitamin d wich may have increased my t and threw off my hormonal balance again so that might be why but my hairloss hasnt gotten better i get handfuls of hair everytime i shower id say around 150 every time i shower and its gotten depressing because my hair is absolutely my best quality. Should i wait 2 more months to see if it all went away then go on saw palmetto ? I took it for around 2 months and havnt gotten any side effects Try RU58841 Really hard to get here, currently going to get a derma roller and keto shampoo I would be very careful to ever start fin or saw palmetto again.\n\nThere is a bunch of people who used either once and \"got away\" without PFS. Just to take it a 2nd time and get fucked.\n\nIt seems like stop/starting it multiple times increase the risk tenfold.\n\nYeah it sucks to lose hair, but it sucks even more to lose your sexuality and brain function. Best way to slow down hairloss without serious side effect is upping your estrogen levels/make sure your estrogen in normal range. Estrogen protect hair follicle from dht. This is my experience, I started drink dairy milk everyday, my hair fall decreased from 100 to 20", "Symptom check Hey fellow soldiers, I started fin start of April (April fool was me), did 5 days on/ 2 days off of 1mg for 2 weeks but noticed testicular pain so took another 2 days off then only did 3 x 0.5mg before stopping completely.\n\nFew days afterwards the heavy hitting symptoms came up, this now includes:\n* Shooting / tingling pains all over body\n* Impaired taste and smell\n* Brain fog\n* Testicular pain\n* Disturbed sleep\n* Generally impaired senses \n* ED / no libido / numb todger\n\nBeen feeling these for about a week and a half now, not sure if I had a \"crash\" (yet) but been pretty rough at times.\n\nJust wanted to see if the symptoms were shared by any of you and any tips for these early stages? Im taking some natural supps - like tribulis, magnesium, creatine, vitamin D and CBD oil. What Is the thoughts on supplements? Heard both sides. Been in touch with the Drs and trying to get a hormone blood test soon.\n\nKeep fighting the fight, you are doing great. Testicular pain, ED, no libido, and numb todger were my initial symptoms. Has the testicular pain gone away yet? It only lasted a couple days for me.\n\nI think Vitamin D has helped me. I took fin for almost twenty years and developed symptoms slowly in the past year. I have been off of the poison for three months and this is what I am dealing with:\n- no libido\n- discomfort around my genitals\n- brain fog and general depression \n- bad taste in my mouth\n- wake up like every hour at night\n- light tinnitus\n- general body pain The testicular pain seems to come and go for me, especially arises when I am active. Could just be a one-off but I had a great nights sleep after doing a 24 hour fast and cold water swim yesterday. Might be worth a try. I started cycling again and it is been really bad. Makes me scared I am hurting my prostate now??", "Petition to Merck to fund PFS research There is a petition to Merck (maker of Finasterid) to fund research into the Post Finasteride Syndrome.\n\nSo far, 1.200 or 2.000 people needed have already signed.\n\nI did not see it posted here, so I will post it.\n\n(  I am not trying to be cynical, but I do not think this approach is going to work. Merck would be confessing to their wrongdoing by funding PFS research. That would be a legal and financial loss for them that I believe they will not willingly surrender. I tend to agree, this is asking for a level of corporate social responsibility that almost never happens in the real world. With some political awareness and support. It rises the public awareness of our middle age torture called live.", "What are your opinions on people who dismiss your conditions? Full disclosure, I have not taken any Finasteride. I am 29 years old, slowly losing my hair, and I have mostly come to terms with it and will probably just shave my head so I can avoid any negative side effects from the drug.\n\nThat being said I have done a lot of research into the drug Finasteride and I have noticed that there are a lot of people who say, in reference to people experiencing negative side effects, some variation of \"it is all in your head\", \"you are exaggerating your side effects\", \"you are just a hypchondriac\", etc.\n\nIn particular, this guy  has multiple videos on the subject and in all of them he is basically saying that this is all in your head and even going as far as to say that everyone experincing negative side effects is making them up to get attention and to get free money from suing drug manufacturers.\n\nSo my question to everyone on this forum is what do you think about people who are saying \"this is all in your head\"? Do you think there are people who exaggerate their negative side effects or do you think they are telling the truth? That is a really good question. Thanks a lot for bringing it up. \n\nI experienced different stages in dealing with this problem. First, I believed those people. Many people on Reddit say that ED, libido, and PFS overall are simply symptoms of anxiety and that it is all in our heads. I believed that and told myself I just needed to calm down and everything will go back to normal. \n\nBut it did not go back to normal. After a month I still did not have morning erections, spontaneous erections, or libido. I had physical symptoms too and I was extremely fatigued. I did not feel like myself at all. Prior to this, I was in the best shape of my life. I felt the stark difference between these two states and that is  when I knew it was not in my head.  \n\nNext came the frustration phase. Hearing people say \u201cit is all in my head\u201d made me feel really frustrated, especially when it came from doctors. I knew for a fact it was not in my head, and yet people were denying my own experiences. Really frustrating. \n\nNow, I am onto the next part. I try to show/educate deniers the literature that exists. I try to point out the very similar anecdotal experiences these men suffer. \n\nI also think more people online are aware of PFS, and believe it exists today. The ( mixed with more research coming out seemed to shift online perception of the issue which is comforting.\n\n\nI definitely believe there may be some people online with nocebo effect reactions. People may be even more susceptible to that effect due to the sexual nature of the drug. But I definitely believe people who claim they have PFS. Especially, and by definition, if they suffer for an extended amount of time. Merck pours money into covering up this condition.  They will happily ruin countless lives in order to keep the money flowing in.  It is a great reminder that there are still completely evil people in this world, and they make much more than me and you.  There are sociopaths out there who think nothing of destroying the world to make a quick buck.  If you search PFS on Google, one of the first results says it is all in our heads.  That is their marketing dollars at work.  It is not that hard to use SEO to become top-ranked on Google for a condition few people even know exist.\n\nAs far as individuals who deny it, they are deluded and uninformed.  Many of them are taking Finasteride, and have to convince themselves it does not exist.  There is a reason it is called POST-Finasteride syndrome.  They do not want to think it could possibly happen to them.\n\nYou should be immensely grateful you are only losing your hair.  I honestly did not mind losing my hair that much, but I heard this 'solution' advertised on a podcast and thought it was worth a try.  I did not even look up the side effects or mechanism of action beforehand.  Had I done so, I would have immediately trashed it.  Now I know better than to take pharmaceuticals without deeply researching the REAL effects.  Very rarely are they worth it.", "How long have you had PFS?

I took it for around 9 months, it worked wonders. Like others, I was **obsessed** with my hair, my dad was bald, as was his dad, and mine was falling out rapidly. \n\nI was sex mad around this time too, which I think in part was why I was obsessed with my image.\n\nI stopped taking it after noticing some weight gain and gyno, but didnt think much of it. I returned to it some months later, but ultimately noticed changes with ejaculate volume etc that did not sit right with me so stopped enitrely.\n\nI then went down a massive spiral, Gyno got worse, weight gain, lack of interest in sex,  many many more things. It went on for years, I did not really experience ED, but definitely Libido loss, however I do wonder if that was me not being with the right women at times.\n\nLife carried on, I had multiple tests for testosterone, all I was told were \"normal\" (despite being the very much rock bottom end of normal).\n\nEventually, I forgot about it, and guess I adjusted to who I now was. I do genuinely believe it changed my personality and attitude in some ways for the better. I became focused on careers, more aware of others feelings and many other things, I feel I became more intelligent. I put this down to not being like a dog on heat, but interested in many different subject matters, lots of reading etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did have some more fun, lots of flings and many relationships. I do feel there are some physiological changes that will never go back to normal (shrinkage etc).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, ultimately I find myself now 34 years old, I have a lot less hair now, its almost all gone. I have a fianc\u00e9, a daughter and a second child on the way. I ALWAYS worried if I would be able to conceive after all this, and both my daughter, and this pregnancy were achieved the first month of trying. I know plenty who have never been near fin who struggle to conceive, trying many months etc, so i feel incredibly lucky. I also feel due to the previous mentions of intelligence etc, I find myself in a job earning around \u00a3130k a year. For a guy who is education peaked at one year of college, I feel this is really positive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope this lays hope at the path of those who re struggling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just hope some see this as a hopeful story really. Accepting the changes, having a family God bless you \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb Do you still have ED? Bit of am odd one. Never really had it too bad, but now I do. But it is within what I would say is an acceptable amount for someone my age. The changes you speak of are NOT permanent nor are they normal (shrinkage)  Luckily, you did not get hit with the bad, bad side effects.  Regardless, you can achieve  change in all these areas should you choose.\n\nCongrats on the job. How old are you?  There is no \"acceptable\" amount of ED......even into your golden years.....if you are healthy.  Its the fin, and you can fix it. I think \"acceptable\" depends on the individual. You say it is the fin, but why do other people ever get ED that have never had fin?\n\nMy life is very busy, I work long hours, often stressful but I tolerate that as I am well renumerated for it. \n\nI sleep fewer hours than I should, because I have a young child that wakes early but I do not get to bed until late. \n\nI have virtually zero time in my life for me, I used to run but lately cant even fit that in. My partner works weekends, so I have the parental responsibility at weekends, meaning I do not get to socialise as I once would. \n\nThe ED I experience is often just not \"fullness\" the strength is not always there that once was. But I am no longer 21 years old overflowing with testosterone, so I would expect that to a degree, with my lifestyle the way it is. \nI look at it that this is a snapshot in time, my life will change a lot over the next few years, so I do not sweat it for now. And that being said, if particularly aroused it can be as good as it once was. Genetics my friend, genetics.. And you are right, acceptable  depends on the person but biologically it is not normal.\n\n There is no reason you should not be fully functioning until well into your old age. 'however I do wonder if that was me not being with the right women at times.'\n\nStop it man. It was the fin.\n\nI would rather be a broke hobo with a functioning penis than a millionaire with a shrunken little micro d. You have settled into the role of providers with your wife and daughter (very bad sign I hope PFS doesnt mean you will get female offspring) but aside from them you are living with no real pride or joy. A guy is not complete without his penis. You can make as much money as you but as soon as you sit next to other males you will KNOW you are lacking. You will never truly enjoy wild sex again. Yea no man that sounds like hell for me. I am a selfish guy. I want sex but with PFS we are FORCED into being monks. Being a monk is something noble but not for us because we had no intention of giving up our pleasures but here we are.\n\nYour story would be my personal hell. I dont want to read books like a nerd. I dont want to be a beta male I dont want to work all day and wait for the weekend to ...READ SOME DAMN BOOKS while my wife probably cheats on me. I would trade IQ points to get back my BIG D energy and muscles. This is a fuken horrible life my dude I would rather be in the mountains living as a buddhist monk maybe I will have an ounce of dignity then.\n\nPFS is a terrible life and it is HEAL OR DIE TRYIN'. Truly. No, it was the women. I would start dating them without a loss of libido. Then after the initial excitement wore off, the libido loss would kick in. It is not fin related, that is normal. \n\nYou seem really angry, my advice to you would be to shift focus. You are being consumed by your PFS, which on turn makes it worse. \n\nJust because you do not want to read, or do not enjoy reading, it does not mean it is a low testosterone activity, it means you do not enjoy reading books. \n\nSaying things like Nerd, monks and heal or die tryin, all it screams to me is that you need to grow up before dealing with PFS. Once you reach that milestone, work on what makes you better. It is not a personal attack my dude you have done well accepting your fate but I am telling you the difference between you and me so please do not attack me either for having different goals in life. \n\nIt is not normal to not want to fk chicks. I am telling because I lived my 20s intact with no issues. Even if a chick is giving me a booty call for the 100th time then it is on. That is what real male libido is like which it seems you missed out one. \n\nI am sorry man I just telling it how it is. I would just suicide living your life and I know it. You seem like a strong person so all other power to you living like a beta cuck but that i aint it for me. \n\nBy the way is your second child a female? The gender of my children are entirely irrelevant. A brief look through history will tell you that. Stop being such a dick. \n\nMaybe you were normal in your 20s, but testosterone declines with age anyway. I doubt you have ever been normal with the shit you are spouting. \n\nDo me a favour, fuck off yeah? looks like you been cucking for the vaxx as well. What a pathetic normie life my dude. Sorry you missed out on being a real man with your shrunken equipment but here you are still defending big pharma. \n\nIs your wife craving BBC? do you enjoy recording her with other men? Haha. True colours shine. You do not have PFS mate. You are just a cunt. Always have been and no doubt always will be. \n\nLike I say, fuck off, yeah? reality is hard my dude especially with your little penis\n\nVery sorry for your loss and I hope you find solace in your reddit life while your wife gets some real D lmao Can you just go away now. You have shown your true colours within like 3 posts mate. You are a daft prick, GTFO my post, and go find another person to harass about your non existent condition. I think your story should be a warning about how PFS can turn you into a redditor fat high estrogen CUCK. \n\nBEWARE!\n\nI will find a solution for my fellow PFSers that doesnt include the possibility of becoming like you. And fathering females because your seed is to damaged to have males. You have *literally* no clue how gender is determined, clearly. So your anti-vax, have PFS, and think somehow all females tat exist in this world must have been created by \"inferior men\"? Yep. That sounds totally correct to me. \n\nI am sure women will be queueing up to breed with you with that attitude pal, just like they allegedly used to be. you are way too beta to understand women\n\nwhich is why your wife will be cheating (if she hasnt already)\n\nPFS is carried down to offsprings and likehood of female is higher or beta soyboys like yourself which could be even worse Am I? How is that then? \n\nYour personal attacks are proving what a pathetic individual you are. \n\nHow did females ever exist before fin? You understand there is roughly a 50% chance of either right? \n\nYou have no proof for what you are saying. \n\nJust know this.\n\nI am wealthier, happier and better off generally than you will ever be, you are a sad angry little man. \n\nAlso, of you are hanging around on a PFS site, I will imagine everything you have said about me must be a reflection of yourself. Perhaps that is why you are such an angry little thing. typical redditor always obfuscating\n\nNo one said females didnt exist before \n\nI said PFS increases likelyhood that is how epigenetic changes work\n\nenjoy have daughters you genetic failure.\n\nI am not as far gone as you are believe me if I was I would have gone the monk's way I have a son though? \n\nKind Of proves what shit talking total prick you are, doesnt it. monitor your son very closely especially his penis and pray he doesnt become a soy-boy like his damaged father\n\nI really mean it bro hope your son becomes a real man Monitor my son's penis? Wow. A whole new level of fucking weird. \n\nI have seen your post about roids. Explains it all. They have destroyed your D and made you angry. Bless you poor thing. oh no you saw my post lmao bro you are a tragic redditor\n\nhaving to work 9 to 5 or  more on top of your sad state\n\nguys avoid this tragedy Tragic how? Because I looked at other shit you posted, even though you did EXACTLY THE SAME? You are a special kind of fucked up. \n\nMy life is so much better than yours without roids. \n\nThe roids made your D so small it is basically a clit, and now you are so angry about it. Poor guy. If we can even call you that anymore. who said I did roids you idiot?\n\nI am trying to get a post on the steroid section to treat PFS for sufferers\n\nyou are the one with shrunken genitals like that stop projecting\n\nyour understanding of PFS and steroids in general is pathetic\n\nAnabolic steroids dont shrink genitals lmao such a deluded normie vaxxer So angry. It is the roids. Poor little boy. I feel sorry for how sad and pathetic you are. \n\nI am gunna go spend a day with my family and not be a sad angry little D man like you.", "Want To give ou an update on my recovery Its been almost 4 months, only issue I have now is body hair growing slowly and some of it is growing back (chest, stomach, pubes, armpits). Libido is not what it was pre fin. I do get excited and frequently wake up with wood but lately I havent been noticing it probably because im not awake when it happens. I had time periods where im super excited other times not so much. Porn usually turns me on but some days it does it not. I dont blame all this on fin because I have been super unhealthy. Sleeping bad, eating and drinking junk and not exercising like I used to. Overall, I think im only getting better. Crazy how only 5 pills did this. Are there any guided meditations/affirmations that I can just passively listen to for healing? I am too exhausted to do any \u201cactive\u201d healing work.\nI actually have a recommendation. It is a ( that has just what you are looking for, and i am hopeful that it will help you. How much did you take? it says 5 pills Good luck man! thanks Five 1mg pills? yes 5 every day? yea 1 mg for 5 days", "3 Week update. Hello, I Just wanted to give you guys an update on my case, seems like not a lot of people follow up after the initial freak out. \n\nTo recap, I took finasteride for 19 days, felt my dick getting smaller and had trouble performing and staying hard, cum was watery, and had constant anxiety and headaches. During the first week after dropping the pill, I experienced trouble keeping erections when intimate but managed to get through. My libido was also kind of low but I persisted in getting erections just to keep monitoring my body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe second week was probably the worst, while I did manage to get erections every night and even waking up with boners consistently, I experienced a series of mild to heavy headaches, one actually took me to a doctor's office. Everything came out alright but I did experience some really nasty dizziness, vertigo, and dark nihilistic thoughts, very uncharacteristic of me. During this week I also kept experiencing very watery cum and a decrease in orgasmic sensation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe third week came by and this is when I felt most normal since, considering it is been more than 19 days since I dropped the pill. I feel like my libido has gone back to normal, erections are pretty consistent and have not had a headache or felt dizzy in days, I even started doing some cardio during this week. My cum however still feels and looks watered down, I am hoping I can kick this whole thing out of my system and bring my sperm count up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring these three weeks, I took on a heavy testosterone diet, beets, spinach, eggs, blue cheese, etc. and also worked consistently and hard to keep my boners going. I really hope there are not any long term effects or that this thing will come back to haunt me. I hope everyone can recover here if you have symptoms and I hope they take this horrible pill off the market soon. Glad to hear you are doing better my man I am on 5 weeks now and it is not looking so great symptom wise. Decided to jump on Cdnuts protocol and dedicate myself to getting better Do you feel like any of your effects are placebo? Like is there a chance that you are overthinking and convinced that you have side effects? No, I was really happy and hyped to take the pill and was looking forward to it. I showed symptoms like nausea, anxiety, and poor sexual performance for almost a week and it never occurred to me that it could be related to Finasteride. It also took me about the same time to feel normal again that the time I took the pill for. I absolutely do not recommend it at all. It is  poison. That is unfortunate to hear. Stories like yours are the exact thing stapled to my mind on why I should never try it. But looking at my hairline get worse makes me so depressed... I watched Kevin Mann\u2019s videos and he made me motivated to try finasteride but now its like I know no matter what Im going to feel the effects, even if its placebo effects I Feel you man. i get sad about finding my hairs all over the house but i would never put my body through ever again. I have been on fin for a year and experienced none of what you went though I am sorry you had to go through that. I still preform well in bed (ask my girlfriend, joking I am joking). Took it though my last year of university graduated with a masters in education. My hair looks great and I Still continue to take fin everyday. Everyone is different my guy :) How your situation improved any more since you last posted? I would say im doing great. back to normal. it took a while but I think im fine now. still would not touch that stupid med anyway! I am through with it myself. It is not worth it. I just hope that I recover like you did and have not permanently damaged my body. I only took about 10 or 11 pills. I missed a few doses one weekend. But I am still having these terrible side effects one week out. Oof, sorry to hear my friend. It does seem to take a little longer than one would hope for but Try to stay as positive and busy as you can and make sure to eat healthy and monitor your erections and cum to see how things change from day to day. Stay strong.", "Friendly reminder to all suffering from PFS to report your persistent side effects to the FDA. ", "Burning like sensation and painful erection Hey guys, so here is my story. I took one dose of fin on wednesday which was 0.5mg and the second one on friday which was about 0.2mg. The day after i took my first dose i felt that something was not right about my erections and they were not at 100% force but they were ok. Right after i took a second dose and felt that these sides are not placebo i said to myself that it is not worth and i dont't want to risk my life to save my hair. I immediately quit. This was a seven days ago and I am wondering if sides are more likely to persist or not. Current sides are:\n\n- reduced flaccid size by a bit\n- reduced erection size (they are at 80%)\n- burning sensation inside penis during erection and burning pain somewhere near anus area\n- low libido\n\nAnd there is one thing that bothers me, when i sit for too long especially in a car, this pain near anus is increasing.\n\nSo, has anyone of you recover or had similar sides, especially 3rd one? Thanks for you help. I seriously doubt that 2 doses are going to do anything at all, unless you just had some odd reaction to the drug itself, it is not like you take the pill and your Testosterone instantly drops to terrible levels.    It takes more time than that,  it almost sounds anxiety related since you seem so concerned after two dosages you were obviously thinking about it a lot before you tried the drug.    \n\n\nof course we are not doctors, no harm in checking things out at the doctor if your conditions continue How are your sides today ? Have you recovered?", "The hairloss community needs to be able to have open conversation about PFS that is not taking place right now. Throughout the history of PFS, many with the condition have been accused of being mentally ill, anxious, or hypochondriacs. The word PFS alone brings arguments on all types of forums, including Reddit. It is understandable why, as the condition has not been formally recognized. However, thousands of people online have the same symptom set, and it is ridiculous to deny the plausibility that a drug that inhibits DHT could cause the hypogonadic profile of symptoms commonly seen. \n\nThe first thing that must be admitted on both sides is that the prevalence of PFS is rare. With this stated, fearmongering could and should be pushed aside. The true number it effects is unknown, but due to the high rate of prescription of the drug (75 million in 2019), it would be observed very quickly if it was happening to the majority of people who take the drug. If I had to guess, true long-lasting PFS happens to 1% of users. That is an estimate of a risk, but one that a consumer should keep in mind. \n\nOther drugs that come with similar, but rare risks (like aspirin and Reye's syndrome) are well known and recognized and not fear mongered. Those drugs are talked about openly without argument. I wish that PFS could be talked about similarly. Perhaps further research into the mechanism of the condition could open up a better discussion about it.", "Minoxidil if finasteride gives sides Hey!\n\nI was wondering if I can use minoxidil instead of finasteride after what I think what I had was PFS. \n\nI had PFS symptoms after a half of a pill. \n\n\nThis was about 2 weeks ago and most of symptoms went away 3 days ago How is this pfs? Anecdotal pfs is an incurable change in epigenetics, according to those who believe in it. You had a simple reaction to a drug. All drugs have side effects. They were not persistent. Minoxidil works in a completely different way than finasteride. The side effect profile is very favourable. Around 1 in 100 or less people on minoxidil has some kind of side effects. We cant check if you are that one or part of those 99. I got after a half a pill awful sides.\n\nMicro penis and balls, cognitive impairment , brain fog, constant headache, joint pain, cracking joints, excessive tiredness, insomnia, when fell asleep I woke up 4-5 hours after with heart palpitations and hot chest a few days, watery semen, erectile disfunction,hot flashes a few days after that face swelling, dry eyes, depression, suicide thoughts and anxiety.\n\nAnd more symptoms..\n\nNo I did not read horror stories before, doctor told med that I might get erection problems which solves after quitting the drug which is bullsh*t I took finasteride after 2 pills because I lost all my libido and had ED. The side effects went away after 3-4 days. I have been using minoxidil without side-effects now. I think it is relatively safe for me.\n\nI think it could be different for other people, though. It is not surefire that you will be AOK, but I think taking Minoxidil, even after taking finasteride, is a much safer and less risky choice.\n\nEverything is a gamble when it comes to hair. How much risk are you willing to accept? do you even know what \"Post\" means?  you didnt have pfs symptoms. Pfs are side effects that appear or persist after the us of finasteride. Haha I love these guys to have Post Finasteride Syndrome you have to be in constant pain 24h a day your whole life otherwise IT IS NOT PFS, like you cannot just deevelop lower libido or ed for 6 - 12 months. I never used Fin but used minox for 2 wks. Crashed with all pfs sides. It has been 14 months now, most of the sides are gone except insomnia, very low libido and ED. Not just minor ED but severe one. Maybe minox does not affect everybody but when it does the sides are just as bad as Fin if not worst. I am sorry this happened to you:(\nYou were a really unlucky one.\nHope you maintain an optimistic outlook because positivity works miracles in the medical world.\n\nMinoxidil is not all that risky in general. Probably tens of magnitudes less dangerous than finasteride. But that does not mean the risk is 0. Maybe there is something to learn here, too, OP. Lol, did you even read my text? I tried 1 half pill and I got those symptoms. They were there for 1 and a half week and I might even get a crash (which I god hope not and do not believe because this experience was horrible).\n\nI am not even 100% this seems to come in waves\u2026 Thanks I needed to read just that and sorry for your experience. So I hope it was what you needed to read! Do not take anything of this shit again. Please \ud83d\ude4f save your life. So be so happy that your symptoms are not permanent. U have a monkey tier iq. Finasteride stays in tissue for 5-6 days, post finasteride means finasteride being out of ur body and u still having symptoms. \u2018Coming in waves\u2019 is pathetic, every single male has a fluctuating libido. Jesus Topical? Probablt ok. Oral though? Stay the fuck away from it. It messed me up big time", "I need some comfort in my situation please I took finasteride a few days a week for several months. I had basically no libido while on it along with having ED but pushed through bc i couldnt stand losing my hair. I realized this was no way of life and stopped taking fin to get my sex drive back. Its now been almost 3 weeks and i have zero libido or erection quality. Im genuinely just scared that im stuck like this and theres no one i can go to for help. Do most people recover and how long does it take generally? The 5AR enzyme usually comes back online in 30 days, so you will likely see an improvement after that. \n\nAnecdotally, it seems like the vast majority get better in 1-3 months. That can seem like a lifetime if you have ED and libido issues... but the odds are on your side - try to relax and take care of yourself in the next few weeks. Could be a good opportunity to pick up some new healthy habits! Thanks bro i needed this I find most people recover in the same timespan as the duration that they took the drug. So in your case 'several months'. You will probably be fine, give it time. Take some l-citrulline while you wait about 1-2 months for the fin to leave your body. It is like a mini viagra. get cardio exercise, eat well, sleep well, do not take any supplement, and sure you will be recovered Thanks bro I am sorry this happened \nStay strong Happy cake day, appreciate you calming the nerves of a lot of terrified men who come on this sub. There are a few in here who take a much more pessimistic approach to their advice Thank you beefheap!\n\nThe side effects from finasteride are real and terrifying, but only a small group of unlucky people have side effects that last years. For the rest, I think it is important to keep anxiety in check - it can become a feedback loop that can make symptoms feel worse than they are, and perhaps even prolong them. Hey Jeff, \n\nSorry you are going through this. I, too, hope that you recover. I suggest not taking medications/supplements to try to cure yourself. If I were you, I would play it the natural route and try to recover through healthy eating, light exercise, and relaxation. \n\nIn any event, can you do the community a favor and report your symptoms to the FDA? The link to do so is below: \n\n I took fin for a month, crashed hard and recovered within 3 months. 3 months of hell, but I am luckily back on track. hey, I took only 3 doses of propecia and had severe side effects right away(brainfog, ED, anxiety. I stopped and became better for 1 week. then after 3 weeks I had a huge crash, severe anxiety and brainfog. I am now 3 months off and I am almost normal again but still my penis sensivity is at 65% what was before. Hi this is very similar to my experience where I only took 3 doses. I am at the point that I have only just crashed a couple of days ago! Do you have any advice on what to do in the time waiting to recover? hey, while in recovery I masturbated and had as much sex as possible to look each time if something improves. I was still able to force an erection but as I said my penis was not so sensitive and my libido was much lower. every week me sensitivity and my libido increased. this is only thing I did diffrent. for the brainfog and anxiety it just kind of dissapeared. My libido has not gone down thankfully, the desire is still there so I can try this for sure! It just does not seem to get up as easily, but my orgasms and ejaculations are thankfully the sameness before. I am more worried about the testicle pain and brain fog. I will just hope they go away. Thanks for your reply I appreciate massively relax and wait another month. I was just like you in the same position. you likely be fine because you also only took 3 doses. the ones who get sides and continue for several months to take it are the ones who are fucked Yeah you will be good, majority of people go back to normal Hey it is has been a month! u/Jeff9898\nHow are you now? Almost completely back to normal now\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb  Libido is still a little low but honestly ive never had high libido. Im just thankful to have a working dick lol", "I think I crashed and have PFS :(  \n\nHey guys,\n\nI took saw palmetto (320mg) once and had a bad reaction pretty much the next day. I was hoping to jump on fin at the end of the year.\n\nFull on ED, prostate pain, testical pain, low libido and penis pain.\n\nI recovered after 3 days (no more ED but just testical pain and prostate pain).\n\nNow 3 weeks after i got hit with ED again (but not fully - very light erection - hard flaccid and have to work very hard to maintain it) . I am worried that this was the 'crash' -however i have no mental issues and my libido is relatively ok. However no natural erections and the morning wood is very weak - i still get it but its very faccid.\n\nAny anecdotal stories would be helpful.\n\nTrying to be hopeful. I do not think you can have PFS from a single dose of SP. for ppl on fin it often happen after few months and stay for 3-6 months after and then resolve near baseline. Let some time eat well, take sun and workout a bit not to much There have been reports of symptoms after a single dose of finasteride:\n\n\n\nBoth finasteride and SP inhibit 5-alpha reductase. So it is plausible that a dose of SP could cause problems like the ones in OP. \n\nIt has been a month, so it is too early to say whether this is a syndrome. Metabolically speaking it is really hard to understand how that could be possible Are you speaking about pharmacokinetics? Yes, the half-life of finasteride is about 5-6 hours. But it is possible that the drug is causing some reaction in the body that creates ongoing problems. I had taken a few pills (4 to 5) of SP back in 2017 and it fucked me up real bad. I am still suffering horrendously. I believe it is very much possible that one pill of either finasteride or SP can do alot of damage.", "Miconeedling I recently got off Finasteride due to bad side effects (which thankfully subsided very quickly) and heard that micorneedling is a good way of spurring hair growth.  The Derminator seems to to be the \"go to\" machine.  Heard really great things about it.  Just ordered it off the website ((  List price is $200.

I am going to try foods and products that increase progesterone in the body. I was able to find out and all my side effects are directly related to low progesterone. \nI will keep you posted if I notice I am recovering. Also increase your sulforaphane intake with brocolli sprouts for a few weeks. It will increase the neurosteroids that fin has fucked up. Good luck man. Yes, I have already started taking a supplement that has broccoli extract, garlic, aswaganda and other herbs. thank you \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude4f Great video I have 2x the top reference range of Progesterone still have PFS. This YouTuber has an opinion that post-finasteride syndrome is reversible in all cases. He lards it up with bro science, but in the end it is an opinion.\n\nHe also recommends pre-finasteride \"bloodwork\" on his website and then forwards people to buy expensive blood tests from another business he owns.\n\nThis is bro science, and he has a product to sell.\n\nYour subject line: \"PFS can be treated\" repeats this YouTuber's opinion, but we do not know that this is true. They both use fin though. I think they say that to tell themselves a comforting lie that in case they get pfs they will use their bro biohacking knowledge to get rid of it. Caution: this is a YouTuber, not a doctor. As enticing as it sounds, taking progesterone can make your symptoms worse and is in no way a guaranteed cure. Go to PropeciaHelp and search users' experience with progesterone for more information. Insightful comment. I think this may also be true of older male doctors who take the drug for BPH. Yes, you may be right, at the next crash I will go for progesterone tests. Because I have all the syndromes of a low progesterone: low testosterone, high thyroid, soft muscles, etc. Can you elaborate? From my experience, we fit the profiles of many \"hypo\" conditions such as hypothyroid, hypogonadism, and even progesterone as you said. Many times, our blood work comes back normal. Frustrating. Bro science. He is literally a fucking chemist lmao Yes, I will elaborate. Ashwaganda has a great anti-stress property, it is good because it helps you think clearly. It relaxes you and helps you sleep. I also take a supplement with omega 3 for the heart and for the beneficial properties that fish oil brings on the brain, memory, etc. Garlic extract is very good for the sexual organs, increases sperm quality and makes you more potent. I take broccoli and green vegetable extract because it restarts the receptors in the brain. Moreover, they are very good for inflammation in the body, immunity.Something that should not be missing from the diet are vitamins zinc, magnesium and B complex that stimulate your testosterone, and have an important antiestrogenic effect. It relaxes you and helps in protein synthesis. Following the information we have gathered, finasteride affects cortisol, progesterone. For cortisol I recommend reducing caffeine and energy. L-Citrullin, Argiline may work for progesterone. Gaba receptors in the brain are not stimulated effectively so we have anxiety, it will seem strange what I say and controversial. On weekends you can try to drink a little alcohol and smoke something green are studies that show that alcohol and cannabis directly target gaba receptors. Do not combine them. I am not a doctor and I am going through pfs but we have to be optimistic and the only way we can help ourselves is to stay informed.\nYou should look for fasting on the net and what it means and implement it in your routine and lifestyle. It will help you. Thank you very much for the clarification.\n\nFinasteride is definitely a poison and its use to treat baldness should be forbidden. I had a thyroid test 2 months ago because I knew I had problems with finasteride. I was fixed at the limit at the interval set by the laboratory, I then realized that T4 is increased in my blood. But the doctor does not give you advice until you die ... Pretty sure Derek is not a chemist. This thread suggests he was a business/marketing major:\n\n(\n\nIf you mean Leo, he is not a chemist. Majored in \"science\". Worked as a researcher in the field of decision science:\n\n(\n\nWhere do you see that either of these guys is a chemist? Alcohol act directly on GABA-A receptors and it is counterproductive.\n\nFin did not change or GABA-A receptors. But rather different positive allosteric modulators.\n\nStimulating GABA-A will only make it downregulate, that is why the body use allosteric modulators instead.\n\nBasically they bind to specific regions near the GABA receptor and change it is potency. But they do not directly bind to the receptor site.\n\nAlcohol on the other hand bind directly to the receptor. That is why chronic intake of alcohol actually will ruin your GABA receptor and give you more anxiety. &gt;Progesterone \n\nI supplemented Progesterone, it did not do shit. PFS is not that simple because of the hormonal and neurosteroids interference", "Finasteride - use or not? So I am a 19 M and I got diagnosed with androgenic alopecia. My temples are fine but my hair is diffuse thinning on top. I got minoxidil prescribed but that does not stop the process. I really want to start finasteride but I am well aware of the sides it may have and I take those very seriously. My plan is to do some bloodwork and find out my testosterone levels and consult an urologist. I then think I will be able to determine wether finasteride will work for me or not. Should I do this and proceed? What do you guys think? It is basically a roll of the dice. You have good odds you will not get sides, but you still can. It just depends how lucky you are. Just know that there have been cases where people get sides 6-10+ years down the line. You could very well be completely fine for a decade. You would have your hair and everything, but then you get sides out of nowhere and suddenly after 10 years of being worry free you have life altering sides that no doctor can reverse. This scenario is very unlikely. VERY unlikely. But never 0%. You do you. There is no way to know in advance if you will get adverse effects.\n\nSee  Well I mean I think it is pretty obvious that those who did get side effects in these trials probably were not ideal candidates. I think bloodwork should determine that right? That is true and something to keep in mind however I have the feeling that this is the case with so many medication. There will be always a percentage who will have severe side effects of any kind of drug. However I take this seriously but when you look at these trials and tests surely those who got side effects were not ideal candidates. I think bloodwork would determine that? Because when you cut of your dht eventually testosterone will replace that but that will be way less of impact to your hair. Anyways if you are low on testosterone I think it is pretty safe to say that you will get sides since you are going to need testosterone to fill that dht \u201cgap\u201d. If I was to have good/high testosterone levels I do not see why I would get sides if I keep enough testosterone. Anyways I am still thinking about it and informing myself as much as I can to make an well thought choice. Thanks for your input man! Your welcome. But I can see you are trying to fool yourself into believing it cannot happen to you. Good luck though. No I am not trying to fool myself, I am really on the fence because of these potential side effects. I have been reading articles and posts and stuff for weeks now. I am just trying to really find out if there is a way to determine if I do not get these side effects but I understand that is not simple and maybe there is just no guarantee. It is a really tough choice and I think it will take much time before I will made my choice. Thank you very much, for you aswel man! I do not know which trials you are referring to. Clinical trials have not been well designed to detect a syndrome that develops after stopping the drug. \n\nWhat exact \u201cbloodwork\u201d measures are going to determine likelihood of adverse effects? I am not aware of any guidelines on this. For those who do have adverse effects, there is no known biomarker in blood tests. I took finasteride at 19 and I still have side effects almost a year later after only 3 weeks of use. Yes. I was scared at first but have had no side effects at all. you can try with  0.25 per day or something like that, and be aware of sides There is no correlation between test levels and possible side effects.  I was on Finasteride for five years and started getting sides.  Got my test levels checked and they were mid 700s.  I stopped Finasteride and thankfully within a few weeks I was back to normal (actually better than normal).  At the end of the day it is a roll of the dice. Bad idea. You need DHT badly.\nOnly take if you have tried to commit suicide from MPB and failed. And even then its not worth it. There is no way to know in advance. Sorry. Your health or hormone levels do not predict whether you will be affected. Anyone who says otherwise is just speculating. There is been a study possibly implicating the SRD5A2 gene, but it is too early to know anything for sure. ((  \n\n\nLike you said, all medications come with risks. But with most medications, the risks are usually in balance with with the benefits. Chemotherapy can have horrible and long-lasting side effects, but they might save you from dying of cancer. Take the drug or face certain death. That seems like a reasonable risk tradeoff. Finasteride, on the other hand, can have horrible and long lasting side effects, but all you get is the chance that you might keep some of your hair for a little longer.\n\nSo what are you standing to gain? Medium probability that you will keep some hair. What are you standing to lose? Non-zero probability of having your mental and sexual health ruined forever. \n\nBut, like u/NotNecessarilyNamed said \u2013\u00a0you do you. I am 17 and have post finasteride syndrome. I can tell you right now, be content with what you have been given by God. Trying to change it may become your biggest regret. I could never recommend finasteride to another person after what is happened to me. The potential for devastating life changing symptoms is just not worth it to keep your hair. Unfortunately this was only something I realized once it happened to me. \n\nAlso, do not fool yourself into thinking the only ones who get side effects were \"bad candidates.\" I was 20, healthy, active, lifted weights 4x a week, and had no indication of hormonal imbalances. Hello guys first off, thanks for all of your comments! I really appreciate that you people took the time to comment. \n\nI have come to an conclusion after 2 months of researching and reminiscing that I will not be taking finasteride. Even if I were not to get sides I do not want to mess with my hormones. \n\nWith that being said the other day I have stumbled upon an interesting study conducted on a big group with topical finasteride. At the end there is an indication of an amount of topical finasteride that would be sufficient for hair loss and that would cause no side effects in male because it suppresses scalp DHT and with minimal effect on serum DHT. I will link it down below but I would like your guys opinion about this. \n\n  ( Hey OP - I took propecia for 12 years, starting at 18, ending at 30. I still have hair 9 months after stopping. There ARE side effects. I go through waves of not wanting to have sex at all. I also had mental fog intermittently for 12 years. When I stopped, the crash was hard.

I would recommend that you quit taking it. People also can crash years after taking it. Definitely do not stop taking it. I would wait longer, there is no way to correlate that with finasteride yet.

But if we cannot detect any biological abnormality, would not that precisely make it more likely a psychological thing?

Could i have pfs Saw palmetto is a 5-AR inhibitor* like finasteride, although it is derived from a plant. There have been reports of PFS from taking saw palmetto.\n\nAs for Clomid, I do not know why you were on it or why libido went down. Doctors have tried prescribing Clomid to treat PFS but I do not recall anyone reporting that it worked. \n\n* 5-alpha reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) Low libido is a common symptom of PFS so could it be a result of saw palmetto rather than Clomid?", "MD Rachel Rubin Tweets about frequently seeing Post Finasteride Syndrome and its challenging treatment. ", "Quit fin after 3 years...  \n\nSides were gradual perhaps started around 1 year mark but I kept taking it because it worked (0.5 mg once a day). To accelerate results at around 2.5 year mark I started taking 1mg daily and then dialed back to 1mg 3x a week. Sides accelerated and I just had to quit. Sides experienced were mainly lack of sensation/numbness (down there) and low libido. I had the usual loss of morning wood pretty early on and watery-ness which seem rather common and did not think much of it.\n\nI am now 2 months off fin but sides are still there. Morning wood, however, came back with a vengeance (Almost painful in morning lol). I actually had a period a few weeks after quitting where things were significantly better with numbness and libido for about a week, but things just tanked again and I am back to where I was prior to stopping Fin. Still numb with lack of sensation + low libido. I assume my sides are due to buildup of Fin (As per hair loss show channel) and this improvement and sudden tanking again is due to general disruption of my endocrine system. Has this happened to anyone? I do not really believe in PFS and hope things will get back to normal by waiting it out.\n\nCall me crazy but I plan to restart it at some point again given how late my sides showed up and try again at a much lower dose, maybe 0.5 mg 3x a week to at least maintain. Anecdotally, it seems that multiple stops and starts of finasteride, and/or irregular or spaced dosing, may be associated with persistent adverse effects. See points here: finasterideinfo.org/for-patients \"I do not really believe in PFS\"\n\nYou refuse to believe the thousands of thousands of anecdotes of persisting / permanent side effects reported on many different forums across the internet. Merek (the manufacturer) themselves knew of the potential for persistent side effects after the drug discontinuation, yet decided to keep it quite and keep this knowledge internal as to not negatively impact sales of the drug. Money talks. I will never understand this mentality. It is just pure ignorance and confirmation bias.\n\nWhat you are describing is a very common presentation of Post Finasteride Syndrome and has been reported by sufferers many many times before. It is quite common for individuals to cease the drug, experience 2-3 weeks of normality, this resolution of symptoms is short lived followed by a crash / worsening of symptoms (happened to me also).\n\nYour plan to use finasteride again is absolutely crazy and you seriously run the risk of damaging yourself further.\n\nThe best thing you can do is live the healthiest life possible, reduce stress, sleep 8-9 hrs per night, do not overexert yourself, etc, etc, etc, and give it time. If your lucky you will bounce back and this will all be like a distant nightmare. Not everyone is so lucky, and you can find many many stories if you expand your horizon. I am the wife of a sufferer with similar symptoms to yours. He is, like yourself, a PFS denier, but we are still trying to pick up the pieces of our relationship and put it back together. Like you, his symptoms were very gradual, probably started around the 1yr mark, and he quit around the 2yr mark.\n\nHe is post Fin 14 months. By 4-6 months off, he really had returned to PreFin baseline, however, the muscle atrophy and damage to our lives is a completely separate rebuilding process. Not pretty. Heartbreaking in more ways that one. After, perhaps ruining a 20yr marriage and marring an enviable bodybuilder physique w/a defibrillator/pacemaker, my husband is very lucky to be a recovery story. (Although I cannot yet say that our story will end pleasantly.)\n\nUnlike you, his hair growth was not impressive, and worse, he was not cognizant of symptoms, failing to recognize nor analyze (even still).\n\nI suppose the fact that is most interesting is how easily, it seems, you are dealing with these major losses. These are human functions and pleasures that are sorely missed, points of pride at times, and a large part of a healthy relationship &amp; life. It is certainly great that you are not stressing out about it! Good that you are not falling apart. It is clear where you fall in the \u201chair vs. ED\u201d debate.\n\nI must caution you with regards to playing with Fin again. Perhaps you have not truly experienced to worst-lucky you, however you are not in the clear. Wait til you are fully clean, clear, and have truly returned to full health. I hope you can know the success of full recovery, because the alternative is not nice. Only then can you really know if you really want to temp fate with Fin ever again. \nAll best. Appreciate the advice.  I do not doubt the stories online. I am going off the recommendations of The Hair Loss Show, which recommends giving time to let the fin wash out of your system.  (  I will definitely wait to see what happens. In the decades they have been doing it, they have never seen a case of sides that did not eventually resolve after cessation of fin (neither has my derm).\n\nDid you eventually recover and how long did it take? My recommendation: do not take Finasteride again. You are already going through symptoms off the drug (albeit improving). Taking the drug again could trigger worsening of the symptoms you have and make them chronic. &gt; In the decades they have been doing it, they have never seen a case of sides that did not eventually resolve after cessation of fin (neither has my derm).\n\nYeah, that is a common belief. My doctor was skeptical when I told him I still had side effects after 1+ year; he said finasteride fully leaves the system within 1-2 weeks. I then had to see two different urologists, who checked my hormone levels and shrugged the whole thing off after the results came back normal, before I found one who takes me seriously and wants to run some specialized tests. Here is some research you can show your doctors \u2014 particularly the JAAD review finding persistent/irreversible adverse effects in 11 of 14 studies. \n\n Yeah, I showed them stuff like that when they were initially skeptical - they did not dismiss the research but said that there was nothing they could do \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Taurine for solving PFS?

I have spent thousands on this issue, none of the natural supplements had a lasting or noticeable impact for me, and that could be because I am over 60. Previously used cialis and viagra for 20 years, 1mg daily of finasteride for 14 months killed any benefit obtained from either. I will also add that I continue weekly testosterone therapy (which does not solve the problem either), and take 5 mg of cialis daily. The cialis eliminated pelvic floor and perineum pain, and helps with blood flow. It does not provide an erection worthy of penetration. My issue was an instant, dead dick out of the blue. I should have known fin was horrific when my semen turned into water. The shit is poison it is not worth a few strands of hair.

We are you on Cialis concurrently with fin?\n\nAnd how is your penis sensitivity?\n\nI basically cannot feel my penis at all, so even with trimix I would not be able to enjoy sex. It went from dead to improved in about 9 months. Yes was on cialis with fin and it was working, suddenly it stopped helping, so I stopped the cialis at the time figuring it was a lost cause. That only made matters worse, that is where the pelvic floor pain started. I went back on daily cialis and it helped quite a bit with sensitivity-I could manipulate and get my penis harder, but not full. When it did get near full, I would get to the brink of ejaculating with a soft penis-beyond fucked up and annoying, I have never been that bad. Here is the thing about Trimix: my penis re-learned the sensation of pleasure, but starting at the penis while having sex and bringing the pleasure signal to the brain, instead of the other way around as we as men are used to our whole lives. You will enjoy sex on Trimix, plus you can keep going after you ejaculate, an added bonus. It actually helps to de-sensitize your penis in a good way, because the good sensations gradually return, albeit not 100% I will take this over total depression and feelings of worthlessness any day.

Like you consume finasteride, then what? Binds to dht? How does it specifically bind to dht?\n\nWould like to know exactly how it works and what chemicals is it composed of. Look under Mechanism of finasteride here:\n\n Finasteride is a 5a-reductase inhibitor. It reduces the activity of 5ar by about 70%. 5ar is an enzyme responsible for the conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This is the primary mechanism of action via which finasteride ameliorates androgenic alopecia (hair loss). Additionally, 5ar is responsible for the conversion of progesterone into 3a-dihydroprogesterone, then subsequently 3a-dihydroprogesterone to allopregnanolone. \n\nAllopregnanolone is a neurosteroid that allosterically modulates GABA-a receptors in the brain. As an agonist, allopregnanolone activates GABA-a. GABA is the brain\u2019s chief inhibitory neurotransmitter, and is implicated in various neuronal functions. It is responsible for feelings of calmness; an endogenous \u201cdowner\u201d. Dysfunction of GABAergic pathways is involved in a variety of psychological/physiological  disorders; namely anxiety/depressive disorders, and epilepsy. This is hypothesized to be the pathophysiology behind the neurological side effects experienced by many of those with PFS; dysfunction of the central nervous system. \n\nFurthermore, 5ar is involved in the synthesis of various other neurosteroids (tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone is another notable one) that are centrally active and appear to demonstrate the same sedative, anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), and antidepressive effects as allopregnanolone. Interestingly, some of these neurosteroids have been demonstrated to have neurogenic properties. That is, they facilitate neuroplasticity by inducing the formation of new pathways. This is likely a compounding factor in the psychological distress experienced by PFS sufferers; decreased neuroplasticity is implicated in a multitude of neurological disorders, and I would imagine it is a factor in the brain fog that many people report during use and following cessation of finasteride. \n\ntldr; finasteride is a 5ar inhibitor, and reduces the conversion of testosterone to DHT. It also reduces the synthesis of various neurosteroids involved in cognition.\n\nedit: spelling. A squared plus D squared = your dick is dead \n\nIn layman\u2019s terms of course The worst part is you just typed more than most doctors know about the subject Sorry; I am new here and my question might be stupid but I will give it a go anyway. \n\nUsing all that information, why cannot we just supplement or somehow increase the levels of said neurosteroids? If we know all the effects of finasteride, down to the individual neurosteroids that it affects, surely we could just supplement or find a way to increase all of the neurosteroids that finasteride has affected? Would not that work? Would our bodies become used to it, so we would need more and more in the future to get the same results? If not, then I would not mind taking something every day for the rest of my life if I know that it will get rid of PFS. \n\nAgain, sorry for the silly question, but I was just wondering as we all would do anything to find a cure.", "PFS Network study update Hello,\n\nMy name is Mitch and I am one of the co-founders of PFS Network, a charity advancing understanding and awareness of Post-Finasteride Syndrome.

I was on finasteride 1 mg for almost two years, I had some days where I would miss, but in January 2020, I stopped, because I was having a lot of numbness through my body.   However, about 2 weeks after stopping I had my first ever panic attack and now have panic disorder.  I am not sure if this was caused by stopping the finasteride or just my own stress.  Has anyone experienced anything similar? In 2019 panic attack from finasteride was reported 36 times to the FDA\u2019s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). See screenshot from an analysis of 2019 reports:\n\n Yeah sort of. My heart would beat rapidly and I would get nervous as hell in public.

I am not entirely sure if it caused by stopping finasteride, but I do think it played a part in developing the panic attacks. Mine happened 2 weeks after stopping and happened multiple times. It is definitely related to your body rebalancing off the drug. I am 5 weeks off now and my body seems to have recovered in full.

Regular exercise and fish oil helped me alot. Yeah, I had very similar panic attack episodes, went to the ER just like you, and they found nothing.  This was my first cases of anxiety related issues.  I have been on my antidepressant now for 4 months.  I going to give it maybe another month to stabilize, then taper off, as the side effects from my antidepressant really suck.  Luckily it is the lowest dose. But yeah, I do think finasteride played a part in this. Also, have lost lots of hair since stopping the fin, which does not help my confidence.  But I am just taking a day at a time, trying to get my mental health in order first, then worry about all the superficial things that bother me.  Hope you also find success in recovering from stopping fin! Yup, probably endocrine related anxiety induced by finasteride. I saw a psychiatrist, cardiologist and the derm. Only the psychiatrist pointed out he suspected an endocrine issue and I put 2 and 2 together and realized it had to be finasteride. The derm mentioned one of the listed side effects is depression which is already a sign that this drug has an effect the brain. Wish you all the best my dude! It is fin. Have u gotten better?", "Lingering Finasteride Side Effects after one pill - Hey everybody. So I avoided taking finasteride for years but I finally caved in a little over a month ago. I only took one pill of 1MG &amp; after 40 minutes I felt what I can only describe as an intense mental fog and lack of clarity. It felt a bit like the beginning stages of a depressive episode. Shortly afterwards I noticed the most infamous side effect. It was more difficult to get and maintain erections. \n\nI had been told by numerous medical professionals that it is completely safe &amp; that 99% of the people who have it experience 0 side effects &amp; that if you experience side effects once you stop the medication you will completely go back to normal. Well, it is been over 40 days &amp; while the mental fog has mostly lifted &amp; my mental acuity is back to more or less normal, my ED is still the same. My erections are still there but only at 60-70% of what they used to be and my libido in general absolutely took a hit. I am not imagining it. \n\nMy question for those of you who have experience with recovery from these symptoms or finasteride in general is, do you think this could be permanent? Should I be concerned? \n\nMy own doctor said he thinks I will be back to 100% within a month and although I do trust his judgement, I somehow get the feeling he may be wrong. \n\nWhat do you think? Good thing you only took one pill...You should be okay..I took fin for 5 yrs on and off..and i got permanent  ED....CAnt feel a thing.  If yours dont get better within 2 months, just take viagra..... I am so sorry man. That is terrible. You did not deserve that shit for just taking an FDA approved medication. Do you think I have a shot at a full recovery within the next month or so? Give it some more time at least 3 -  6 months (even up to a year) before jumping to the conclusion that you have permanent effects. Try and relax while doing something that is meaningful to you. Do not panic and check every forum posts and stories 24/7. You will most likely recover. Get some rest and have proper sleep. If things do not improve or worsen, contact one of these (\n\nEdit: Do you feel like things are slightly improving? day by day? yeah...you should be okay...but every one is different.  Try not to think about it too much. I greatly appreciate this man, thank you. Tbh, I do get the sense that things may very slowly be improving but I am not entirely sure. Np! if you realize that you are improving even slightly, that is usually a good sign from what I have read from people that recovered 70%+. things tend to improve slightly day by day as time goes on. Just be patient and try not to worry too much. It seems that most people that have long term sides have a \"crash\" around a month after they stop fin.\n\nIf this did not happen to you, I would say your chance of recovery is really good. Like Willx said, try not to panic and read forums and just live your life as normal. This is encouraging, just a bit worried at the moment. I will do my best to focus on my life &amp; take my attention off of this. Thank you again. Thank you. I will try to do my best to take my mind off of it &amp; hope for the best. That is very good to hear. I did not really experience that so I am hopeful I will make a full recovery. I learned my lesson. I will never again take a non essential medication.  I took fin for 3 weeks. Quit a week or two ago at that 3 week mark due to sexual libido going to hell. Still not feeling much in the way of recovery. Maybe a little. Did you get the side effect once you are off? Or once you noticed something bad then you took off? Or side effects were following you all the way? I first noticed the side effects 40 minutes after taking my only 1MG dose. They only started to dissipate within 2 weeks of stopping, and now 44 days after stopping I am still experiencing loss of libido &amp; trouble getting &amp; maintaining erections. I am hoping with some time I will make a full recovery. Do you think it is likely I will? As someone who is at the 44 day mark, I would highly suggest giving it a bit more time. I only started to feel a little better at around that time as well. I got side effects throughout...during, after I quit, and so forth...It is permanent for me unfortunately...but I took it for about 5 years on and off.... You will be fine, I took 5 and similar thing happened to me and around the 2 month mark I saw major improvement. I think the majority of people who have permanent sides have taken it for a long time Yeah if you notice improvements, from there it goes on until youre 100%, no worries bro I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this... thank you. Are you 100% now? Idk man, coz I am also in similar situation more or less. Got 0.625 mg thrice a week for three weeks then stopped. In the 3rd week my libido decreased from 70% to further 50%. I stopped and it increased from 50% to 70% during a month off. I am hopeful about me and you tho because we did not take so much. Its really hard to tell because I did not I pay too much attention to this stuff before fin but once your recovered its hard to compare. I want to say maybe 80%-90%?, not really sure. Give it 3 months and stay OFF anything fin related your just going to get more anxious. You will be okay trust me. Hit me up if you need any reassurance. Thank you! I really appreciate that. I definitely will. \u2764\ufe0f How old are you? Hey man. Just wanted to give you an update. I know how scary this situation can be.  So I am about 10 or so days away from my 2 month mark. Only now, just in the last few days is there no doubt in my mind that I am improving &amp; improving much faster than I thought I would. I would actually say I am already near 100%. Libido is almost completely back, my erection issue is waaaayyyyy better. Almost entirely back to normal. Just wanted to give you some hope! If I can improve you can as well! Thank god. My erection quality was excellent yesterday but orgasms and sensation are still dulled somewhat. I think it may be coming back. Thanks for the update! Helps mentally! I guess we can go bald together? Hey everyone. I wanted to give an update &amp; ask for more counsel from those of you with experience. I felt that I was improving at around the 3 month mark, but it is now over 4 months &amp; I still feel as if I am only about 70% of what I was pre fin. I am barely able to have sex once a night. Before fin I could go three or 4 times a night without a second thought. It is making me feel quite sad.", "Finasteride, minoxidil, biotin, quit nicotine So I have been taking 5mg of fin for 8 months along with minoxidil. I recently started taking biotin and quit vaping as-well. Since i started biotin and quit vaping my hairs are more rich in color and feel fuller. Now i have not felt any side effects of fin as of right now but I understand that it can still happen. I quit vaping because of my health obviously and because there are some studies connecting nicotine and hair-loss. Maybe not for everyone but some people and I believe I am one of them.

Not me, but the are plenty of stories of people who did. Thing is, they usually do not hang out in these kinds of spaces. No Was on finasteride for 7 months. Been off finasteride 1 month. ED and libido significantly better after gradual improvement. ED was moderate to severe at times. Had no libido. It is been up and down along the way, no pun intended. Waiting to see if I get the infamous \u201ccrash\u201d. Will never take this crap again. I think I have. Message me if you need someone to talk to. Took me 3-4 months.

Eventually i would have glimpses of pre finasteride state and with time i gradually improved. Morning wood returned and i just feel like my hormones have balanced  I took finasteride and minoxidil for a few months.

No desire for sex etc. If I somehow managed to get an erection and ejaculate it was like piss water. \nI stopped immediately and it took me a slow road of 3 years to recover. I would say I am 90% there now.

Kind Of similar to you Thanks for sharing. Glad to hear you improved :) Hope you are doing well and do not feel alone in this. Roughly 2 months! I would say i am pretty much fully recovered bro. Hope you are doing well. All in all took 5 months Thanks for the response, I think I recovered as well just a day or two after I posted my comment. However, I noticed varicocele. I might have had it before but now it is way bigger after using fin. Thanks bro my situation is VERY similar to yours. I also have glimpses of being recovered but nope, overall its getting much better. Put this behind you and live life. How long were you on fin before quitting? Thanks for the post. Gives everyone hope. No problem. I remember feeling the desperation of wanting to return to normal, and felt it is only right to share my experience. I was on finasteride for approximately 4 months. Changing dosages from 0.25 mg eod to 0.5 ed or 1 mg eod. All of this out of desperation to tolerate side effects, but my body never adjusted. I just got my blood work to see how the pill affected me, as i also got blood work prior to taking it. I will keep you updated! Hey everyone, after receiving blood work i thought i should detail that my e2 was on the high range of normal (33 on a range of 10-40) and prolactin was HIGH. This is 5 months post drug, and compared to my baseline blood work seems that i experienced estrogen related side effects. Even though i feel much better, there is still more that can be improved and i am glad the blood work shows what changed and i now have a method of attack. Thanks for the update! Are you still feeling recovered or wanting to to address some issues still? I know it can be up and down but as long as there are ups \ud83d\udc4f So you get horny and have no issues with having sex anymore now ? I think i have the same issue. Did you see a doctor for this? ", "January 2020: Post-finasteride syndrome: a surmountable challenge for clinicians ", "Finasteride worsen Hi all,\n\nI am a bit confused as to why in some post that I am ready that PFS symptoms worsen rather than get better. Surely the longer it is been the better your body recovers as the fin leaves your body. \n\nI am around 3 weeks without fin and the sexual sides seem to be becoming more prominent. Can you give examples of exactly what is worse? The whole concept of Post Finasteride Syndrome is it not getting better over time. The body cannot always heal itself from finasferide Yes, understood although it does not make logical sense as it is meant to leave your body over time. Sexual sides. Weaker erections and close to no volume when ejaculating I hope you recover, and you may well recover after 3-6 months.\n\nSome men do report having additional new issues that arise after stopping finasteride. This *may* be because after the DHT inhibition of finasteride stops, DHT level goes up and the body tries to adapt. Have you recovered ? Or ever faced PFS? I  have persistent adverse effects since stopping finasteride in 2013. \n\nBut you only stopped a few weeks ago. I suggest taking good care of yourself, getting exercise and sleep, and avoiding supplements or unnecessary medications. You may well recover completely and I hope you do. My thoughts go out to you brother. That is horrible. 8 years is a long time. What sides do you have ? How long did you take fin and what is your age if you do not mind me asking. Did you make any recovery at all? That is what all the doctors who do not understand PFS say.\n\nFinasteride can cause changes that are not reversed when you stop taking it, that is the bottom line. Just like how if you punch me, and then stop punching me, the damage is still done even though you stopped punching me.  After stopping finasteride my hormones crashed from the increase in dht and it seemed like my estrogen was heightened while my testosterone was low. This happened two weeks after quitting and persisted for a week. Then it seems like my body started to reach equilibrium as i feel much better now and would say i am 80% recovered. I have taken zinc and DIM as well as creatine to aid the recovery. Keep ur head up, do not lose hope Some of those who quit finasteride cold turkey experience the dreaded post finasteride crash in the following 1-3 weeks. This is likely because their endocrine systems are \u201coverloaded\u201d by the sudden spike in DHT levels, which essentially \u201cbreaks\u201d the endocrine system\u2019s negative feedback loop that monitors hormone levels. This thread:  details the importance of weaning off this drug to allow the body to gradually readjust to normal DHT levels. I am not saying that everyone experiences an endocrine crash upon discontinuing use. However, if you are planning on quitting, it would be wise to follow this protocol. Can you just confirm how long you took finasteride for? How old you are ? Would you suggest staying away from this druf I guess you would suggest not even trying this right? You mean to people who have never taken finasteride? I think the risk of permanent sexual dysfunction, which has been established in the literature, is not worth the potential benefit, which is cosmetic. If you have not started already then yes 100% however everyone reacts to it differently. Your body might take it better / worse than others. It is a gamble Approximately 4 months, 0.25 mg eod, also posted the hair growth it gave me. So i am in no means against the use of finasteride, it just happened to not be tolerated by my body. I am 21 male I am 21 too and took it for 4 months at 1mg and gave me amazing results but came off it and it has killed my libido and cannot even get an erection Still? My recommendation is to see an endocrinologist. I suffered every sexual side but even throughout taking it there would be days where it was not as bad. Hopefully you recover bro you are really young Have you recovered ? Better and better everyday. Id say i am about 80%, still have loss of sensation and low ejaculate volume. But erections are back to strength and morning wood is back. I crashed 2 weeks after quitting then started recovering after a week of crashing Can you just confirm what you are doing for recovery? I workout everyday, take zinc dim and creatine to support a healthy environment for testosterone and estrogen. Thanks bro, going to give those a try but leave creatine out of it Oh fuck I already quit cold turkey about a month ago. Is this saying that the crash is not pfs tho? And I will naturally start to recover as my body reaches an equilibrium? Hard to tell. Some recover after the crash, some get worse. Currently have tingling all over my body so cannot feel my lips or hands. Gotcha, well sorry to hear that. Here is to hoping you recover quick! How are you coping with recovery/ PFS Eh it is going. Had a rough day like two days ago but I am feeling better now and it is just a time game from here which is good I think. How about you? I can understand why you might think that the longer the drug has been out of your body, the more your body should be recovering - that is how it would work with most drugs. Sadly, if it is the case that finasteride causes irreversible changes in androgen receptors throughout the body - which is entirely possible - then stopping the drug would not be expected to result in improvement; indeed, for reasons not fully clear, the symptoms may worsen. The hypothesis I have heard is that when testosterone cannot be utilized, it is converted to estrogen - which, of course, can cause a host of undesirable effects in the male body, such that those with PFS being treated with testosterone may find their symptoms worsen, rather than improve. I have not used testosterone I would suggest not trying it. There is currently no way to know who may be genetically susceptible to this syndrome. Until we have a way of determining this, it is just not worth the risk. I have seen this syndrome devastate lives. There is things all of us do not like about our appearance, but would not it be better to tackle that and learn to develop a stronger sense of self, regardless of whether you lose your hair or not? Thanks mate and that is a great comment. What have you heard or seen personally from finasteride?  What is your beliefs or approach to it?\n\nThoughts on min? That may well be, and that might be a good thing - a doctor prescribing testosterone for PFS likely does not have an understanding of the condition, since it is not a problem of testosterone production, bur rather, function.  \n\n\nEven if you have not taken prescribed testosterone, your body continues to produce testosterone naturally, with the hormone being made in both the testes and the adrenal glands. The latter glands produce a relatively small amount of testosterone compared with the testes, but it is important bc this is where women get the small amount of testosterone in their bodies from.  \n\n\nSo even if you are not taking \"extra\" testosterone, your body continue to produce it in physiologic (normal) amounts. And if the effects of the finasteride persist (which may be what happens in PFS), then the testosterone cannot be converted (or is only partially converted) by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase into the more usable dihydrotestosterone (DHT). My understanding is that unconverted testosterone will then be converted by the enzyme aromatase to estradiol (the main estrogen in the human body).  \n\n\nIf I have got the science skewed here in any way, please feel free to comment and correct!

I am currently 27 years old, but took finasteride when I was about 23. \nMy hairline was not overly strong even in my early 20\u2019s but I was not noticing any hair loss. I workout and decided to try some steroids, I had heard they can make you go bald but I thought I can try them and if I lose any hair il stop straight away. I took test400 for about 4 weeks but stopped because it was making me feel like shit. I would say a few months after that I noticed lots of hair shedding. I was horrified so I looked online for any solution. I came across finasteride, I read reviews and most of them seemed positive. I did see some negative ones but I thought that it would not happen to me and was with the shot if I got to keep my hair. I went to the doctors and got it prescribed. I took it for about 3 months and at first everything was fine. But then my libido dropped dramatically and it took a lot of work for myself to get an erection, and my sperm looked more like urine. I stopped taking it and it got worse. I could not get an erection no matter what I did. I could do watch porn and still not even a twitch. It felt like my penis was no longer part of my body. I was so depressed I did not want to speak to any girls. I would say around 2 months passed and it got slightly better, I could get a semi but nothing I could actually perform with. It slowly got better. I would say it was around 8-12 months before I could get an erection with the use of viagra but even then I felt like I was only working with 70% of my \u201cpotential\u201d. I started seeing a girl but was worried to tell her about my problem so what I would do is I would secretly take viagra if I felt like I was going to have sex with her. I bought a cockring for \u00a32 from Ann Summers and found that helped keeping the thickness and gave me more confidence. \nAfter a while I told her and she understood. Over the next 12 months my morning erections got stronger and more frequent. And maintaining an erection during sex without viagra was easier although sometimes it would fail. \nI am now 27 and for the past 12 months atleast I have no issues with sex, I have a good libido (not as high after before but I am putting some of that down to age) and I do not need viagra or a ring. \nI was worried I had done permanent damage but I think taking viagra and getting your penis used to having the blood flowing helped. I also did male kegels which are easy to research on YouTube. \nFor anyone going through this, you are not alone. We are all brothers in this together. \nIf anyone has any questions just ask. Was the libido the only issue? Did you have any other sides? I have said the side effects I had was weak erections/not able to get an erecting at all. Watery sperm and low/non existent libido. But all side effects got progressively less and less and now I do not have any So how long did it take for you to get that libido(always horny feeling back and no issues with erections all in all? My libido came back before I was able to keep the etections on my own. I would say around 2 years. What did your flaccid penis feel/look like while having pfs? Did it feel numb and hurt? Any visual differences (length, colour)\n\nThanks and glad you recovered! And that includes libido retuning back to normal ? It did not hurt but it was noticeable smaller flaccid , almost as if it was very cold temperature. No colour change just seemed like less blood was flowing there naturally Yes my libido is fine now. It fluctuates but I think that is normal for anyone. I am not super horny all day everyday but other factors account for that like being tired from work or stress etc. But I have sex at least 3 times a week with my gf Before fin were you horny all day everyday ? Did you take any recovery supplements during the time you suffered? Nothing for recovery. Only viagra to help erections and did male kegels Reading this I have a couple questions. Do you think it is possible that having sex with your GF is part of your recovery? I notice after I have sex things seem to work better, higher libido and stronger erections. Also, I feel like having sex 3 times a week would help your self confidence , what do you think? Both beneficial in many ways. Yes 100%! Once you start having sex and feeling more like a sexual person then you start seeing/thinking about sex in a positive way which boosts your libido which then in turn boosts your erections My libido is all over the place but my erections are very weak... Did you do keegles while flaccid? Yes kegels while flaccid, I have pain in penis, hard flaccid. Does it go away? Hi man, I took fin for just over a month and only used 13mg in total (I started at 0.5mg/day and dropped down to 0.25mg/day). Im obviously more sensitive to it than others because even at the lower dose I got sides after a week or two. Ejaculation and erections were far less powerful and pleasurable, but surprisingly my libido actually felt like it increased. Anyway, the side effects concerned me so I stopped taking it about 2-3 weeks ago and ever since then I have noticed an extreme decrease in libido. I can go a whole week without busting a nut and still not feel horny. Might have to try going for a world record nofap streak xD. I tried jacking off a few days ago and there was very little sensation and climax was muted as hell, it was as if the pleasure chemicals just were not being released in my brain like they usually would. I wanted to ask you if your PFS symptoms got worse as time went on or better?   My symptoms as they are now are manageable, having a low libido in someways is even a good thing as I can focus more on being productive, but I am just worried things could get worse Hi bro, it will all get better as more time passes. Each month will be better then the last, you were on a relatively low dose but it could still take 12-18 months to fully recover. You are side effects do not sound as severe as mine. They might get worse and sort of peak but then will improve after that. Any questions send me a direct message I did not experience that myself. But I would imagine it will be better just give it time Hello sir how long did it take for all sexual sides ED/libido and sensitivity if you had those symptoms to fully resolve ?", "My topical finasteride ointment to avoid side effects I diluted 2.5mg of Finasteride in a 250ml Propylene Glycol/Vegetable glycerin solution. This means it is 0.001% Fin. Minoxidil solution also uses Propylene glycol, the same liquids are used for vaping and finasteride is soluble in propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin from my research. \n\nI noticed hair regrowth and no noticeable side effects. I am using about 2ml everyday, so that is about 50ml a month. This means that the max fin amount I would get is 2.5mg in 5 months or about 0.01mg a day (if all of it even gets absorbed.). \n\nSince I apply this to my scalp, instead of taking it orally and diluting fid throughout all of my body and all of my skin, I actually noticed regrowth. My goal is to stop my hair loss from getting worse and I think it is good enough for that. You have no idea if its going systemic unless you get blood tests. This is some moronic stuff because even with a steep dose inhibition curve of Finasteride I doubt .01mg of FIN would be adequate for maintenance for any good length of time. Also, if it is going systemic and lowering you DHT (which you would not know without blood tests) then you are just wasting your time and energy. First of all, it is working for me, not just for maintenance - I am seeing hair regrowth, I have been doing this for a couple of months. There are multiple studies showing finasteride dose curve. Max DHT reduction from my dose should be 10% (if it was ingested), so it is perfectly sane to assume my dht is affected even less\n\n\n\n Do you think the result you had cannot be attribute only to minoxidil? did you see some improvement with your treatment pre topical fin? There is no minoxidil in my solution I just mentioned it because I got the idea to use vg/pg from it So you just start topical fin? Do you get sides from oral FIN?\n\nAgain you do not know if its going systemic idk why you would not just get blood tests done. Who knows what your scalp DHT is which is truly going to tell if this is an effective method. I am not saying it cannot work I just highly doubt it will be very effective or even worth it.\n\nEdit: Do not get me wrong I like that your trying out different stuff/interested. I just am not sure of the efficacy Yes, I got horrible sides from Oral fin, It ruined my libido (even memory and thinking) for more than a year, I slowly recovered. Looking bald really really does not suit my head, so that is why I kept experimenting with it with this terrible drug. Also Maca helps me the most.\n\nThis is not something I came up with, I just drastically lowered the dosage. Studies often uses doses which are too high because they want to prove something works. \n\nI do not have any stock in fin lol\n\n\n\nEven 0.01mg lowers dht by 10% if taken orally, this proves how potent finasteride really is and I do not know why it' surprising it works topically. 2-3 months ago, seeing small regrowth (I do not care it is small, but if some hair is regrowing, I assume I will stop getting balder which is my main objective) Just take Breezula. I do not have PFS but am considering trying FIN. I have never heard of someone taking a year to recover because 5ar should return to baseline after a couple months at the most. It prob mentally fucked with you that led to a longer recovery road. There are other options than FIN, CB being the best/safest option\n\nI have a feeling your dose is so weak you would rather just use a topical AA like CB that does not have sides lol", "Cognitive sides I took fin for about 3 months and started getting headaches and brain fog. I am now off for about 5 days and still getting bad headaches in the top/back of my head. These headaches are not effected at all by any medication and is always there and i am starting to get really worried about long term mental effects. Has anyone else experienced this and any advice? Thanks. And to add some more info, I had no sexual sides but now just this headache that does not go away. I also felt a little more depressed and had much more anxiety on the pill which have gotten a little better. I am so scared though that this headache/ brain fog or whatever it is will not go away. It actually makes enjoying life so much harder when my head is pounding 24/7. Long term persistent brain fog checking in. Can you describe what this brain fog feels like to you? Mine does not really effect learning or memory or even attention span but is definitely there as this like dull headache feeling. Yes, very different. For me it is as it is described. Things are foggy, it feels like I have tunnel vision. Sounds are dampened, lights seem brighter. \n\nIt results in learning, memory, and attention issues. I am not as witty or sharp as I used to be. I am much more prone to anxious streaks and even anxiety attacks. Compared to how I used to live it is been incredibly frustrating and frankly it is been going on for five years. I would like to get off this wild ride now. Sorry to hear that and thanks for sharing. I hope you find a way to ease the brain fog and anxiety man. Hopefully mine goes away but we will see I guess. Yes, it is come down significantly for sure, but I find I have a severe case of depersonalisation/derealization that is permanent these days. I too hope it goes away eventually but I am not holding my breath.\n\nI have managed to live a relatively successful life since PFS kicked in 5 years ago, having graduated school, found jobs, been promoted, getting engaged etc... so not all is lost, but it is like living life with a large unscratchable itch That is good to hear, I am in college now and have suffered from depression and anxiety before fin and part of that was due to hair loss but now I am even more depressed and anxious knowing I might have this permanent cognitive side and hair loss. If it does not go away I am worried it will drive me crazy but since I just got off it I still have a little hope. Yeah, sounds like it is pretty minor, have you tried to take an NSAID or anything like that? Yes have tried advil, excedrin, and tylonal which all have done nothing to help the headache. And now that you mentioned derealization/ depersonalization and looking up the sides I think that is what closely resembles what I am feeling. My brain feels \u201cwrapped in cotton\u201d or whatever and also feel light headed a lot. Thanks for responding by the way it has already made me feel a little better talking it out with someone.", "Potential long time side affects from short usage? I have taken one packet worth of 1mg over the course of July/August, I experienced symptoms of PFS after only the second dosage but decided to finish the packet then stop. What are the chances that I have developed long term affects? Or will I not know until after a few months? One month is actually a long time (a packet of prescribed Finasteride should last you a month) Especially if you kept taking after getting sides and you were on 1mg which is a high dose. \n\nI do not know how long your sides will last. There is no way to tell. Hopefully they are reversible. Hopefully they are, I have seen online that recovery times are anywhere from 1 - 5 years, I have no problem with erections with porn and I frequently take Vitamin D and zinc supplements After 7 months recovery takes much longer 7 months til I know if I have PFS? If you take for seven months your side effects will take years to reverse I have only taken for 1 month so I assume 1 year? I know people who took one pill and have been arrested for years Okay, so it is just a rough rule of thumb I only took it for a month pal 5AR activity should return to normal in 30 days. It can take a lot longer for your symptoms to go away, though. The norm seems to be 1-6 months.\n\nIf you are still sick after that, you are probably in it for the long haul. This is what people consider to be \"real\" PFS. Does not matter. People can get fucked up from a single dose of fin. Thank you what is your experience with the drug ? I took finasteride 1mg daily for 20 days back in March this year, stopped because of side effects, and am still experiencing a decrease in libido 6 months later. \nBefore finasteride I would get erections just from mere sexual thoughts. Right now I really have to look at porn to get an acceptable erection and am noticing a decrease in desire to date women. \nActually roaming these forums right now with the exact same question as yours hoping to find out if these side effects will fade with time. Same here man, no desire to date women, and I can only get an erection from porn and sometimes from sexual thoughts. I do not know how long it will be before things return to normal. \n\nI have read 1 - 2 years but I do not really want to wait that long at all Yeah I guess we will have to sit it out. Stay positive. I have had PFS for nine years, so I have had time to read the scientific literature, I am addition to countless forum posts from desperate people. If u have no problem with erection with porn what is the problem? I do not get morning wood, I have no desire to date anyone, when I do ejaculate the volume is a lot lower and it is very thin. I could get horny from mere sexual thoughts but even now that is difficult It is a long list. \n\nThe worst ones are anhedonia, no libido, genital numbness (erections are OK for some reason), globus sensations, persistent fatigue, and poor memory. I also had really bad brain fog, but I managed to improve that. Also have many other things that do not impact my life as much, such as really dry skin.\n\nI took ten pills total in 2010. Shit, that is terrible That is horrible man But over time you have noticed that your symptoms are getting better? u/ruman456 / u/InconsiderableSingle\n\nFeels good to have the suffering recognized. \n\nIt is really hard to explain to others how dreadful PFS really is, since a lot of the symptoms are invisible (except for the rapid aging - lol).\n\nWhat can one compare it to? I used to say that it is a mix of castration and lobotomy.  \n\nOr perhaps being really hung over and in benzo-withdrawal, with some post-partum depression thrown in for good measure. Well, I was dating a girl March this year when I started taking Finasteride. I noticed my libido evidently went down considering I did not get horny in the morning anymore, after having sex the evening before. And just less horny in general. \nBefore taking finasteride I used to always feel horny the next morning before we jumped out of bed. Then I quit finasteride after +-20 1mg pills and stopped dating the girl. At that point I thought no harm had been done because I \"only\" took 1mg a day for just 20 days. \nThat is also when I started a Nofap streak of about 6 weeks which went remarkably easy. Started watching porn again because I felt I had lost all my libido and wanted to check if it was still there. \nAfter that, about 5 weeks ago I went out one time with a gorgeous girl but did not feel physical attraction at all. Have not felt the need to date since.\nAbout 1.5 weeks ago I had this realisation that the disconnection between my brain and genitals might be due to lasting side effects of finasteride. And now I am in this weird situation where I masturbate every +-2 days sort of to check if everything's still working. I can only get an erection from physically masturbating. Sexual thoughts have no effect at all. \n So to answer your question I doubt whether things have become better.. I am sorry man Have you done anything like TRT? I am sorry man, have you tried TRT? Nope, will only consider if I notice my actual level of happiness is affected. Actually feeling ok right now so we will see. \nHave you? Not tried anything like TRT, I wonna get in the gym, if my anxiety does not bring be too far down I have tried T, but it made me feel really weird after just a few injections. I might try it again and just power through.\n\nHave also tried hCG, danazol, HGH, pregnenolone and progesterone. I am sorry man, have you tried lifting? Mostly doing body weight stuff in quarantine. Went to the gym 4x/week before.\n\nExercise is one of the few things that help a little.", "Youtube's giga incel Kevin Mann strikes again...

I stopped taking it so maybe I could be a grandfather.", "Finasteride So I took 1mg tablet of fina and experienced some sides early on such as slight loss in libido and not being able to keep my erection up (although if I am in the middle of sex it tends to be fine) I want to know if anyone knows if I will be fine once it drains from my system and how long does it usually take? From reading peoples experiences it usually lasts for as long as they took the drug, so in your case, expect it to be back to normal in 3 days. However, this group is oriented around the finasteridesyndrome, which, once you get it, will immediately know it, and then it is not so clear how long you will be haunted by sides... My guess is you will be fine in a couple of days. I took 1mg for 5 days (Jan 1 - Jan 5 2021) and had similar side effects, loss of libido, water semen, tenderness in breast and erection issues but when I got hard it was fine it was just getting erect that could take time. When I stopped taking finasteride the side effects went away in maybe a week or two I honestly do not remember when it went away because I just felt back to my usual self again. My entire body and cognition changed greatly after taking Finasteride and still has not resolved.  How long did you take it for Has anyone had this from taking just 2-3mg a week instead of 1mg a day? Just do not take the shit I took 1 pill. I am in the same exact situation , idk if I should continue taking it or stop, ive read a post saying that its because your body is still adjusting to the drug. In my opinion, whatever you think is best you should do, but my rationale was this, would I rather see side effects hurt me mentally and physically so I could enjoy hair for a small amount of time, or would I rather be healthy, perform properly, and feel mentally fit and bald. I will take the latter any day. I will get hair transplant surgery in the future, it is expensive but it solves my crisis while keeping my health and mentality safe. I agree partly , its just that even transplant does not fix the problem", "Where did you get Finasteride from? \n\n( Essentialclinic. \n\nI got no warning of potential side-effects from either the site or pharmacy.\n\n Everything I read online said that if you get sides, they will go away upon cessation of the drug.\n\nWould have never tried it if they put the chance of permanent side-effects somewhere.

I wish I could find something in full for you. use sci hub use sci hub", "How the NFT hype is offering an opportunity to solve the Post-Finasteride Syndrome **Who am I?** \n\nHi, I am Simon, a medical professional who is dealing with PFS symptoms since late 2017. You can story on Spotify: ( and follow me on Twitter: ( \n\nWhen one of my friends in Germany, Thorben, committed suicide in 2018 after taking finasteride, I did not know that the insomnia and emotional numbness I was newly experiencing was most likely from the finasteride I was still taking at the time. When I started tapering finasteride in early 2019 my life started to fall apart. I developed the full spectrum of debilitating PFS symptoms that made my life being hell. Every day. I eventually managed to achieve a partial recovery after 3 years. In 2020 I founded together with other PFS patients and family members the charitable PFS Research Association e.V.. The goal of the association is to accelerate PFS research.   \n**Who is the \u201cPFS Research Association\u201d?** \n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nThe Association (  is a charitable, patient-organised PFS organisation based in Europe. We all have PFS and see that there is more we can do than just sitting at home and complaining about our symptoms. If you are in Europe you can also become a member or volunteer with us from any location in the world. If you have ideas, it is the place where they are welcome. Together we can do more than just waiting that does not come without our combined action.\n\n**Why do we exist?** \n\n* Because we are registered in Europe we are able to apply to **governmental and European research grants** that the PFS Foundation cannot access. \n* To give **tax benefits** to German donors.\n\n**Why else do we exist?** \n\n* To try **new ways of fundraising**: crowdfunding campaigns, applying to other foundations such as Movember, calling possible private donors, applying for court money. \n* To build a **PFS Research Council** consisting of the best PFS and Finasteride researchers and researchers of other fields such as epigenetics, genetics, neuroscience, andrology etc.. The combined power of a council could help to make smarter research decisions and developing a 3-5 years research plan, building a consortium that makes us more attractive to governmental and foundational donors. \n* Building a **patient registry** with finasteride users, PFS victims and healthy hair loss controls. This registry will help to make it possible to upload and evaluate huge medical data and create homogenous research cohorts that can easily be recruited for human studies. This is very attractive to researchers and brings PFS to the next level. It could also help to prove that finasteride is the cause for PFS, bring light to the incidence of PFS and improve the chances of recompensation. \n* Build a **biobank system**. Tissue donation of suicides can help to solve PFS. creating a global network of biobanks and donors who are willing to give their bodies to PFS research after death by accidents and suicides will make it easier to understand PFS \n* Creating a **volunteer network**. The PFS community has tremendous unused work power that could accelerate awareness, and public fundraising campaign and lead to a faster solution of PFS. The foundation does a good job but has not tried a patient-centred approach of making use of the community yet. More people equals more could be done. We want to be a charity that is organised and run by the community, not by a single person or just a few individuals. Therefore we are open to members and volunteers.   \n\n\n**What are NFTs and why should the PFS community care a lot about them?**  \nNFTs, also called Non-Fungible Tokens is digital art running on the blockchain.   \nAuctions of NFTs have recently resulted in crazily high payouts. To give some examples: \n\n**#1: 69 million USD for a JPEG \"Everydays - The First 5000 Days\"** by( \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**#2: $7,5 million USD for CryptoPunk #3100**, purchased on March 11\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**#3: 6,6 million USD for Beeple\u2019s \u201cOcean Front\u201d** which was auctioned for charity on the 23rd of March 2021\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n**#4**: **2,9 million USD for Jack Dorsey\u2019s tweet \u201cjust setting up my twttr,\u201d** was sold on march 9th 2021 and donated for charity \n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why NFTs for PFS and why now?** \n\n\ud83d\udcf7  \nBecause the current NFT wave might be a hype. Some NFTs have brought millions. The total market cap was 430 billion USD last month. Charities are just starting to jump on the bandwagon. \n\nIf we are early it still will be something special. This will it make easy to get press coverage which could lead to a global PFS art campaign and numerous bidders pushing up the price. If we are early artists and market places will be more willing to cooperate with us as the media coverage brings them publicity and new customers.   \nThe crypto/NFT bubble could burst at any time. In the next wave, it will be more difficult to involve media, collaborators and get the same crazy prices as in March 2021. \n\n**How could NFTs be used to raise money for PFS and find a cure?**\n\nWhen I saw Beeple's NFT being sold for 69 million dollars we saw an opportunity for using NFTs for charitable purposes. \n\nWe need a lot of money to cure PFS. More than the community could bring up. There are two realistic ways to raise up to 10 million USD on a 1-years time horizon: \n\n* A charitable business \n* A global campaign with the potential to go viral \n* An art auction at the level of Beeple\u2019s \u201cocean front\u201d \n\nA charitable business needs possibly years to be built and scale up to the income that we need to cure PFS. \n\nSo let us look at a viral campaign or a huge auction. \n\nWhat does it need for a charitable campaign to become viral? \n\nIt needs to be about \n\n* Kids\n* Animals \n* Something funny \n* A funny challenge \n\nSorry guys, kids and animals are out. So let us look at the fun stuff. \n\n**Funny challenge #1: ALS Ice Bucket Challenge**\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nThere have been a few nonprofits in the past that have raised a few million dollars with funny campaigns e.g. ALS Association, 220 million with the Ice bucket challenge,   \n**Funny challenge #2: Movember Mustache Challenge**\n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nMovember 1 billion for men's health (prostate cancer, mental health, suicide prevention) with your Mustache Challenge: (  \nBy the way, the PFS Research Association could be a could fit for Movember, but we need a good \u201ccommercial video\u201d. **Maybe you can help us with that. Hint ;)**\n\n**Fun thing #3: The Wallstreet bets** \n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**\n\nA few weeks ago there was a GameStop stock bet that went viral on Reddit. Sponsoring a gorilla on the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund website costs between $60 and $150. For that one-time donation, you get a video of the gorilla in action.\n\n(\n\nThe campaign has raised more than $300,000 in less than a week. (\n\nIf you look at the examples above, the ALS ice bucket challenge, the Movember moustache challenge and the Wall Street bet are all fun and incentivizing.  \n\n**Now how could that be translated to PFS?** \n\n**#1 Fun:** \n\nPost-Finasteride Syndrome is often not taken seriously by the media and is associated with impotence. A symbol for erectile dysfunction is often a hanging banana. I thought maybe we could initiate a self-ironical \"**Sad Banana Challenge\"** \\- (Sad Banana = Erectile Dysfunction).\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nIf you google \"Sad banana\" a lot of funny memes come up: \n\n(\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nSo, what if we linked the NFT hype with the idea of a fun \"sad banana art memes challenge\"\n\nor another fun theme?\n\nWhat if we cooperated with an NFT marketplace to organize a huge, huge worldwide campaign where people could upload \"sad banana\" memes/art and they auctioned them off for a good cause!!!  \n\n\nWhat if we partnered with a renowned NFT artist to auction his art for a charitable purpose?\n\n**#2 Incentive:** \n\nPart of the money could go as an incentive to the artist (%) and part to us as a non-profit organization (%).\n\nArtists could maybe donate their profit directly if they wanted to. \n\n**Now is the time** \n\nIt is not too late. Most charities have not yet discovered the NFT opportunity, but we have to be fast. \n\nThis could bring in thousands of dollars for research or at least worldwide media coverage for PFS. Both money and awareness is something we urgently need.   \n\n\nWith more money in hands, more research can take place, with research we can bring cure closer to PFS. \n\nWe need you all. Please help us to make this project a reality!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet us get this done together! Together we can achieve more. \n\nBest wishes \n\n**\ud83d\udcf7**  \nSimon Breidert\n\n*Physician and Chairperson of the*\n\n*PFS Research Association e.

It is starting to sound like tapering off the fin and not taking it daily / regularly enough that is causing the issue. I did not have any sides either until I started to taper off Appreciate all of this Simon! Keep it up man!! Not necessarily. I stopped cold turkey and developed full blown PFS. Had 2-3 weeks of normality / hyperandrogenicity after stopping, then crashed severely. Amazing stuff!! Sorry to hear bro.\n\nCan I just ask how old you are, how long did you take fin for?

Hey everyone, I am 24 years old and was taking fin for the past 8months everyday. I can see the interest for sex is going down and no erection or morning hard on.

Sending him there will pointlessly freak him out. In almost all cases side effects reverse after quitting. For now, be healthy, avoid alcohol, and try not to stress about it. You will be fine. Come back in a few months if things have not improved. Thanks, sure I will be back with an update. Did your sides get gradually worse or boom limp dick? Limp dick Wow, so I was on for 4 months and lost morning wood instantly. I quit for a month and hard ons came back. Then switched to 1mg 3 times a week and so far I still have morning wood after 2 months. I also take l-citrulline which helps with workouts and erection stength. I just stopped taking fin 2 days back, should see if i can get hard like normal. I started taking L-arginine and ginseng. All i can have is hope to get back to normal. You will probably be fine. The difference for me was that while limp it was literally lifeless. Felt like loose skin. Then when things started coming back I realized the difference. I started feeling like it was always at least 10% full and  not just hanging there. it was permanent on my end....wish you luck man Man that is so messed up you dont deserve it.

It is used as a topical medication and is applied to the scalp. Sure if you are willing to lose the ability to lust after girls and be a lameo. No way it is that bad, do you have alternatives? It is a dice roll Any alternatives? Start with Ketoconazole and minoxidil. Some say topical dutasteride is safer, the larger molecule does not go systemic like it does with finasteride, however DYOR, I would not risk it personally. Saw Palmetto is not safe either. PFS is very real man, stay safe. Do not Why do you think so? I took it and my life has not been good ever since You can still get sides on .25mg. Taking it less frequently will not save you either. Did it in my late 30's early 40's.  It took about 18 months for the side effects to show and ten years later I am not 100% sure they have worn off.  \n\nIt worked, I had better hair, but there is no way hair is more important than sex, which is the main side effect and for someone with good mental health I had some alarming, unexplained suicidal thoughts during that time. \n\nThere is no way I would allow one of my sons to take that drug or any of the others - be a cool dude with a shaved head, spend that headspace time, your emotional energy and those worries about your hair on something that makes you happy.  \n\nBy the time you are my age, science will have fixed it and you will have a full head of hair again - but you probably will not feel like you need it. Agree 100% This is a subreddit for people who have persistent side effects from Finasteride. You will not find anyone here who will say \u201cyes.\u201d \n\nLong term side effects aside, you are still developing. Now is not the time to deplete your body of hormones. An alternative perspective here.\n\nA lot of the focus on these forms is on actual side effects resulting from drug use. These can be debilitating but are (most likely) relatively rare- at most 1% of finasteride users will experience PFS, for which the severity varies. Most studies suggest it is a lot lower than that.\n\nThat said, the *mental* impact of imagined side effects, or simply the worry that real side effects can occur, is going to be a source of stress in your life. If you are on a forum like this, it is unlikely that finasteride will save you any stress compared to just shaving it off, which is not only safer but also cheaper.\n\nLosing hair sucks, and is stressful. But many men are going through hair loss. Being bald, whilst not ideal, really is not the end of the world. You have control over your hair if you shave it, or if you would like to hold off on that front you can try different styles, volumisers etc etc to prolong your hair until you feel confident enough to rock a bald skull.\n\nAs a 19 year old with hair loss, it really is a losing battle. You are going to be bald- at 25, at 30, at 35 or at 40, it is going to happen. Spare yourself the stress, money and potential health risks of finasteride. Do it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f i regret that i have not started earlier Saw palmetto? Oh, come on. It does nothing remarkable for hair loss. I can add you to a WhatsApp group with over 100 pfs sufferers trying to reverse the effects from it. Was that your only side effect? Did you have any issues with ED? Not ED specifically, but increasingly hard to reach the critical point.  It all seems great at the start, more staying power, etc (I have seen that mentioned b4 on this sub) and then you miss a few, and you think weel that is ok and then it gets worse and when you connect the dots, you suddenly realise you need to get off it ASAP - and pray things return to what they were - like I said ten years later, I am not 100% sure everything is back to where it would have been if I had not taken it.  \n\nI would strongly advise an older man did not do it, but someone pre-relationship, pre-kids, pre-family? Holy shit, please, please do not risk it. Appreciate hearing your perspective, but it is honestly hard to know what to believe when you read about people's purported side effects on the Internet.\n\nYour libido is not going to be the same it was ten years ago, with or without fin. Hey, I completely agree, that is why I said I am not 100% sure it is back to normal - because I do not have a baseline. Similarly with mental health.\n\nThe sexual effect at the time, though, was definite and definitely not ageing - too short a time span, with no other health issues. \n\nI understand what you mean about the web, I am a lurker, not a poster and I cannot remember why I found this sub - I started following it because I am interested in if there is a legal challenge or if it gets pulled.   \n\nWhen I saw a 19 y/o was thinking about going on it, though, I had to comment. I guarantee you will regret it!!!! Is your sex drive still good ? Do not take it. \n\nFinasteride is an evil medicine and can really change your life negatively.\n\nEven if you do not feel any side effects, you probably will be damaged in some way since it can affect many parts of your body.\n\nIf transwomen use it to change their gender, how can this drug be safe for men?\n\nThis shit should be banned and the \"scientists\" who approved it should be in jail.\n\nI wish I never took it. Finasteride is one of the drugs used by transwomen during their transition.\n\nDo you really thing this shit is safe for men?\n\nYou can use minoxidil and get a transplant if you get bald.\n\nStay away from this shit.", "How to report your Finasteride side-effects to FDA  ", "What sort of people are more susceptible to get sides from fin? Obviously SOME people get sides from fin. Has there been any research on why those people are more susceptible to get them? Or has there been any posts where this is discussed and people mentioned a few commonalities between people who got side effects? No because 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors are the most effective medication against alopecia and dermatologist prescribe it vastly. To condemn it will mean 1. admitting to previous mistreatment and (therefore make them susceptible to lawsuits) 2. Lacking a substitute treatment beyond minoxidil and nutrition supplements. That means there is no incentive for any researchers or dermatologist to research the negative effects of finasteride, it kills the billion dollar industry. No funding, no research. Alright. Makes sense. How about on forums? Im sure some people got together and tried to figure out what they had in common. *Potential* risk factors:\n* Length of time on finasteride (but some people get long-term symptoms after one dose)\n* Previous exposure to finasteride, dutasteride, saw palmetto, SSRI/SNRIs or isotretinoin (Accutane)\n* Stopping and restarting finasteride one or more times; irregular dosing or changes in dose\n* Predisposition to, or diagnosis of, depression, bipolar disorder, an anxiety disorder or OCD (this does *not* mean the syndrome is purely psychological)\n* Characteristics (anecdotally): high libido; sensitive temperament\n* Being younger (e.g., 18-22 vs 30-35)\n\nCauci and colleagues explored whether certain polymorphisms of androgen receptor could be a risk factor but the findings were mixed and inconclusive:\n\n There is propeciahelp.com but I do not think there is any consensus.

We can recover if the medical community comes up with a cure Yes, many of us also have lasting side effects like you. It has been called \"Post Finasteride Syndrome\" because you quit Finasteride but still suffer from side effects. It is starting to become more recognized, but there is still much progress to be made in order to accept it as an actual condition. The mechanism of PFS has not been discovered, either.   \n\nPlease report your side effects to the doctor who prescribed you Finasteride and to the FDA. We need patients to ring the alarm and get the public informed about what is going on. Do not be surprised if your doctor completely disagrees with you or just thinks it is all in your head. Many doctors are still misinformed about the condition or have never heard of it. Feel free to print off some published research from the Wiki and hand it to your doctor to have more evidence in your hands.  \n\nIn the mean time, live as healthy and cleanly as you can. Avoid 5AR inhibitors. Take care of yourself mentally and physically. We have a real disease we are dealing with, and we should all take care of ourselves and one another. Any natural supplements you recommend? None, really. I take Vitamin D 5,000 IU a couple times per week and a multivitamin a few days per week. Some people, myself included, feel worse on zinc so I tend to avoid a lot of zinc, which is in multivitamins. That is why I only take multivitamins a few days per week. I wish I could offer you a true and tried supplement, but some people just get worse with supplementation. Its our duty to complain to the FDA and make everyone aware. Do not lose hope. Get a good naturopath, do a comprehensive hormone panel that includes pregnenolone/testosterone/estrogen/other hormones in those pathways, get yourself as healthy as you can including figuring out any gut issues you might have. Look into HCG injections under a naturopaths supervision. Its the hormone your pituitary gland normally produces to signal testosterone production. If your T is extremely low, HCG will stimulate T production and possibly jumpstart the pathway for after you are off it.

Can I ask how many months it took you to recover from pfs? I do not really want to say I ever had it, because my side effects were so temporary. I can say though i took it orally for like a month or two and it took me maybe 3 months to totally recover and get back to normal. I did not even really believe or think about true side effects so it was not a mental thing\u2014 though I think being in a good mindset helps. But yeah, I was not f\u2019d for 3 months but i definitely felt like things were different and I wasnt 100% especially in the sexual department.\nOnly made the conenction long after that maybe finasteride was a culprit.\n\nWhen i tried it topically, my side effects were not nearly as bad, but still there. Again I was on it for maybe two months but this time it took maybe a week to get back to normal. I was still able to function normally throughout but I was definitely impaired in my opinion. I did take some tongkat ali but i honestly think that did not even do anything but who knows.\n\nI would not say I had PFS but lingering side effects. But yeah, they went away pretty quickly. Hope that helps you. Thanks.  I am 2 months in, seeing improvements. Did you ever get any type of sensitivity/ numbness/\nalmost throbbing mild pain issues sometimes in your dick/ groin area? And if so did it ever return to normal ish? Thanks Hmmm. Numbness, maybe a little but not really? Definitely never pain. I am 100% normal now. (Or whatever is normal for me, we are all different i guess.)\n\nMy issue though was I did not feel like when i was doin it that my member was 100% more like 80 or less and a couple times when I would finish, it would feel like not pleasurable at all, which was extremely disconcerting. Gotcha thanks, was on 1mg everyday for a month, been off for about 6 weeks now, still having some issues. Thought it was getting better but we will see idk, hopefully it gets better. Thanks You might have lingering issues for a while but it will probably always be getting better over the next month i bet. You figure you got to let ur body get back to normal just like u hdda give time for the medicine to do something to begin with. \nYou will be okay. Appreciate the encouraging words To answer your question, my hair loss resumed after stopping Finasteride (took 1mg 3x per week for 6 months), but the side effects did not go away. I am a PFS sufferer for 9 months to date. No improvements in sexual sides ? No, unfortunately. It actually seems like it is gotten worse due to prolonged inactivity. ", "My recovery protocol &amp; advice I left this comment on someone else\u2019s thread, thought I would make a post to share what I have learnt trying to recover from PFS over the past 2 yrs.\n\n How I am tackling PFS is via the following.\n\n1. Any permanent changes done by finasteride can only logically be due to epigenetic changes. By utilising our use of HDAC inhibitors we can make it easier for our epigenetics to change to reflect our present environment. HDAC inhibitors  I am including in my regiment include; chamomile tea, cold potatoes, garlic, sulforaphane, celery, cacoa, NAC, lithium. \n2. I do believe PFS Induces a degree of androgen receptor resistance / insensitivity. Therefore we may require more testosterone to overcome the resistance and elicit the same effect. Furthermore, androgen receptors upregulate when exposed to exogenous testosterone. They say the primary benefit of steroids is the upregulation of androgen receptors and not the actual serum concentration of hormones themselves. I personally have started TRT at 250mg/wk, and may increase to 500mg/wk to upregulate the receptors before dropping down to a more therapeutic dose.\n3. Neurosteroids. Particularly Allopregnanolone is suspected to be deficient in PFSers. The first point of call to repair neurosteroidgenesis should be an extended run of HCG. Other things that can increase Allopregnanolone are Progesterone supplementation and low dose SSRI, I am using fluoxetine at 1.25mg/d, with great success to help improve my GABAergenic signalling.\n4. Gut microbiome. Finasteride destroys the gut microbiome. Probiotics and eating a diet rich in a wide diversity of plant based fibres is key to building a rich gut microbiota. One particular species of bacteria suspected to be deficient in PFS is a species that produces the SCFA Butyrate. Butyrate is a strong HDAC inhibitor so a deficiency in Butyrate will make it harder for the body to reverse epigenetic changes. I personally consume cold potatoes daily to ensure I am getting enough butyrate.\n5. A PDE5 inhibitor like daily cialis can be particularly important to repair penis size, function and sensitivity. Start at 5mg per day and increase to 10mg if required.\n\nPFS is very complicated and multifaceted. I do not claim to have all the answers but this is what I am doing personally to recover.\n\nPlease do not copy me. Our bodies are very sensitive, what I am doing may be fine for me, but it could cause you to have a severe crash. Always do your own research and due dillagance.\n\nOpen to feedback from the community, thanks Interesting stuff here.\n\nHaving recovered I think you have got some really good info and some of it definitely crosses over with the various methods that I tried. To address some of what you said:\n\n1. I do not know at all enough about HDAC and this was not something that I saw looked at in the community at the time. That said, I use chamomile extensively - particularly early on.\n2. Though I agree that PFS absolutely induces androgen resistance/insensitivity I have never seen anyone have good results from TRT whilst recovery. Particularly as it pertains to sexual function. I do not disagree that in theory a very low dose could work in providing a positive feedback loop that slowly raises baseline function over time I think that this is an extremely risky step to take as baseline sensitivity is so low that the risk of shutdown and increased aromatase conversion is just too great. From what I have seen I do not think that increasing T is the way to go. I think it is more beneficial and safer to concentrate on increasing the metabolites of 5AR which create a positive feedback loop to that enzyme. \n3. Completely agreed, from what I have seen allopregnanolone (ALLO) and GABA production are severely disrupted and this leads to the multitude of mental issues that PFS's suffers go through. I do not have experience with Lithium so I absolutely hesitate in recommending it but I have tried a variety of supplements that help in this regard including 5a-DHP to help create a feedback loop to ALLO. All in all however I have never found a supplement work as well as a consistent routine of exercise, social interaction, meditation, cold water therapy and breathe work. I never tried HCG.\n4. Agreed on all counts, if anyone doubts the role that a healthy diet and gut plays in overall health and wellbeing at this stage they are well behind the science. That said I went gluten free for well over a year in my recovery and when I went back on I did not notice any negative effects so I suspect that sensitivities really do vary from person to person. I do however thing that people should get as much fermented food, probiotics and green veg as they can and actively avoid overly processed food and granulated sugar.\n5. If someone is suffering from complete ED and they cannot get an erection at all then it is vital that they get blood flow into it in order to prevent permanent damage or Peyronie's disease. I would even advise a penis pump is PDE5 inhibitors do not work.\n\nAs most people have seen on this sub I got better by using CDNut's protocol and I think that it addresses most of the aspects that you touch on here and more - either indirectly or directly. I think that you are on the right path and I think that recovery is absolutely achievable for most everyone. Feel free to hit me up for chat or continue the conversation here if you like. The more info out there and shared the better. Thank you so much for the feedback and for sharing your experience man, really great write up you have here.\n\nVery happy to hear you have recovered. Would you say you are at 100% recovered now? Fantastic stuff and really great motivation for people like me going through recovery.\n\nRegarding TRT, for me, I am 2 years into my recovery. Initially I was severely testosterone deficient after my initial crash, with T levels less than 200ng/dl. Through a impeccable diet, lifestyle, stress management &amp; sleep regiment, I was able to recover that naturally to where I am today at 900-1100 ng/dl. However I still exhibit all the classic signs of testosterone deficiency, feeling weak, lethargic, poor strength &amp; stamina, zero libido or sex drive, complete loss of morning &amp; spontaneous erections. Free T is at the very very high end of the range, same with DHT. This is what has lead me to experiment with TRT. I am going in with the full understanding that this could be a lifelong commitment. I want to get my Free T up to 30, 40, 50 ng/dl and see how I feel, if I feel better, I am staying on TRT for life. This is a last resort option, I have already tried everything to fix these issues via the natural route &amp; with supplementation, if there is something out there like TRT that can help me I want to try it. I am sick of feeling lethargic and fatigued.\n\nI would only advise very low dose Lithium Orotate which is no where near the strength commonly used in Psychiatry. I have seen people with extreme PSSD recover after Lithium supplementation.\n\nRegarding mental trauma. What I went through and experienced due to PFS will without a doubt be the most horrific and traumatic event I will ever experience in my entire life. To experience something so terrible at such a young age, I was only 22, it no doubt has scarred me mentally. Just thinking back to the first couple of months after the crash triggers some PTSD in me. For me, I do not dwell on the negatives, I do not dwell on what I lost or where I could be now if I never took finasteride. My mindset has always been that this is an opportunity for growth and development, I will be such a stronger person once I get through this, I will be able to appreciate the smaller things in life so much more once recovered. I will always chose to be positive and chose to be grateful for what I do have in my life. If you have any other suggestions to help overcome the PTSD please do share.\n\nI personally think CDNuts is a scam. Selling 20 different supplements that have to bought through his source. Sounds extremely dodgy to me. But interested to hear your experience nonetheless.\n\nAll the best mate, and thanks again for taking the time I am glad to hear how you are approaching this mentally. Yeah it is a slog and so draining having to deal with it daily. I honestly think that although it left it is scars that it made me a stronger person all in all. The reason I still involve myself at times is because I promised myself that I would help other go through what I did should I ever get better and I did. In the early days of my crash I would visit the PH forums and there was just case after case of despondent men who never got better and people actually taking their own lives over this. If I can help one person not do that and get better then I see that there is nothing better I can really do with my life.\n\nI would consider myself 100% recovered now yes. It is been 4 years since my initial crash and I have not really had any libido issues at all in well over a year. In fact my libido can be a distraction at times and erections come very easily. The whole ordeal did leave me with tinnitus and visual snow and it is unlikely that these will ever go away however I live with them easily and rarely think on it. I also dealt with some lingering anxiety and disassociation issues for roughly a year after recovery and until I sought professional help in the form of therapy and read the book Full Catastrophe Living.\n\nTo address your last point about CDNuts and to give my experience. I was part of his SwoleSource community for 2 years. He never once asked me for money or told me that only the site that he was affiliated would work in terms of the herbs. He obviously spent some amount of his time replying to my posts and that of the other members. I never once bought any of the supplements or herbs that he recommended from his site and he never chastised me in any way for sourcing my own. He would often be open in talking about various supplements that he had tried and that had and had not worked for him. I do think that he can rub people the wrong way at times and I doubt that I would have been in his social circle had we met IRL in any non PFS related setting. But that said I 100% contribute my recovery to him and his protocol and it was only when I was doing it and his herb rotation consistently that I saw results and eventually got to a stage where I could say that I was fully recovered. Again, I bought exactly no herbs from his recommended site and never have. I am not saying that his protocol is the only way to get better by any means, but I am an advocate for it as it helped me in my time of need.\n\nIf you have not seen a return of libido in two years whilst all your other ducks seem to be in order (diet, lifestyle, etc) as whilst in that community I never saw anyone fully do the protocol and not see serious gains in that department. I realise what that comes across like and I fully understand your reservations as I doubt I would have jumped in so whole heartedly had I not been so desperate. But I can attest that it worked for me and that I was in communication often with other that it worked for also.\n\nHappy to chat here or elsewhere if you have more questions. I also considering opening a discord server for people to talk about PFS, it is symptoms and the various ways they are attempting recovery if there is enough will for it. Thank you man. Yeah still absolutely zero libido, I have zero interest in sex and I could honestly go for months on end without feeling the urge or need to fap. I have no idea how I will be able to have any sort of relationship given I am practically a castrated monk. Fingers crossed the TRT works and thanks for sharing your experience with the CDnuts protocol, maybe it will be something I try in the future. All the best and keen to keep in touch", "Update after 8 weeks off fin Hey, so i will give a little update for my symptoms. Im nearly 2 months off fin and im experiencing little to no improvements.. im feeling desperate at the moment. I have ed and my erect size is at most 50-60% of my pre fin size. Flaccid size is way thinner and shorter. My scrotum/prostate burns about 75% all the time. Because of these sides i developed a terrible anxiety.  I really dont know what to do now and some bad thoughts come to my mind. If you can help me or give me some advice i would be very grateful. All of this because of 0.5+0.25mg of fin... Ok so first things first, the recommended wait time is 3-6 months for side effects to resolve, so no need to panic yet, in fact, stress and anxiety is the most prominent cause of ED, so that could be causing some of your issues, not all but probably some.  Also, talk to your doctor and get bloodwork done, you may have low testosterone or DHT or high estrogen or prolactin.  Lastly, do not be afraid to try a bit of viagra or cialis, I know it is not an optimal solution but it may give you confidence to know you can have a full erection again, even if it is with some help.  Good luck Im trying to stay positive but constant pain near scrotum/prostate is unbearable. Tried yesterday 25 mg sildenafil and it didnt work. Talk to the doc and get blood work done. You need to schedule stuff throughout your day to keep your mind off this stuff. If you get panicked all day you will not recover because your body will not recover to baseline. Also, go post in Tressless and let those morons know what happens when you take FIN. They will not belive me. I did my blood work yesterday and i am waiting for the results. Is the shrinkage even reversible? Shrinkage is a myth. I do not have PFS I just looked into it a lot. Listen man, if you keep going on the forums and freaking yourself out you will not be able to have your body be in a healthy state to recover. I know its hard but I suggest you do it for your future health. Lastly, please go their and just give them a PSA. I have read a ton about PFS and its just said its not talked about enough Shrinkage is a myth. So how can you explain that my dick girth is like a half of pre fin? You do not have PFS but you believe shrinkage is a myth. Based on what do you claim that? Do not you feel this particular thread is not the right place for your denialism?\n\nNewsflash, PFS and its horrendous symptoms are not psychogenic and therefore they are not caused by \"going on the forums and freaking yourself out\". \n\nYou advise the user to go post on Tressless but I think you are the one who belongs there. I had prostate pain as well, clearers up after a few months. Consider a prostate exam as it may be inflamed I completely believe in PFS. Your dick does not shrink it just gets smaller due to lack of stimulation. If you were to pop Cialis daily to achieve a full erection it would maintain normal size. If it atrophies due to lack of use it will look like it looses size like any other muscle. I 100% believe in PFS and I am dissuaded to start FIN after my research Took sildenafil yesterday and 0 reaction Tons of PFS sufferers get erections of ED pills. I am not sure man. I am learning more and more about this, I am sorry it happened to you. I believe you need to be aroused to get an erectoin on Cialis. I would get a full hormonal profile done with high sensitivity testing as a start. I did and I am waiting for the results Let us hope its a hormonal problem and not true PFS Alt, ast (liver) - seemed normal but my tsh went from pre Fin 2.8 to 0.9 post fin. Waiting for the rest I am not sure the significance of that man. What did the doc say Waiting for all the results just relax for now. Not much you can do Myth a fuck! a week after stopping finasteride my penis became half the girth! completely atrophied and I have been in this condition for 5 years. Before finasteride I had monstrous erections. Myth a fuck! a week after stopping finasteride my penis became half the girth! completely atrophied and I have been in this condition for 5 years. Before finasteride I had monstrous erections.", "Side effects or just nervous? When I took finasteride I used to get a weird tinteling in my fingers and toes. I quit 3 months ago without problems. Then a few weeks ago I took some finasteride again for a week. Now I quit again and I have the same tingling as when I took finasteride. Now it is nonstop but that has happened since I could not get my dick hard when I was with a girl a few days ago. I am afraid that might has to do with quiting finasteride too, though it has happened before. Does it sound like post finasteride syndrom or am I just freaking out too much? Wait about three to six months. You may well recover. In the meantime, take good care of yourself, get sleep, eat well and avoid supplements and unnecessary medications. I have had tingling for weeks too in my hands and lips. Glad I finally found someone else who has tingling, except my story is a bit different.  I was on 1mg daily for 10+ years using generic India pills from AllDayChemist.  Four months ago I switched to a US prescription with my doc because I could get a 90-day supply for the same pricing using GoodRx, if you can believe it.  I went through a 90-day supply and then started to cut them in half to reduce the dose to 0.5mg, and I started getting full-body tingling which I still have right now.  \n\nNow, is this because I cut my dose in half after 10+ years of my body being used to 1mg?  Could it be such a hormonal change to cause that?", "Is PFS practically just low Androgen receptors? If PFS is pretty much low androgen receptors then I may have a solution to fix this. What do people think? is ED, no libido, fatigue, brain  fog all symptoms of low androgen receptors or is there more to it Well, what is the solution? Yes I am all ears I read that high dose of L-carnitine could raise AR. The opposite has actually been shown. Androgen receptor density was compared in the foreskin between PFS patients and controls. It was shown that PFS patients had a higher androgen receptor count than controls. \n\n( It is not known. How I am tackling PFS is via the following.\n\n1. Any permanent changes done by finasteride can only logically be due to epigenetic changes. By utilising our use of HDAC inhibitors we can make it easier for our epigenetics to change to reflect our present environment. HDAC inhibitors  I am including in my regiment include; chamomile tea, cold potatoes, garlic, sulforaphane, celery, cacoa, NAC, lithium.\n2. I do believe PFS Induces a degree of androgen receptor resistance / insensitivity. Therefore we may require more testosterone to overcome the resistance and elicit the same effect. Furthermore, androgen receptors upregulate when exposed to exogenous testosterone. They say the primary benefit of steroids is the upregulation of androgen receptors and not the actual serum concentration of hormones themselves. I personally have started TRT at 250mg/wk, and may increase to 500mg/wk to upregulate the receptors before dropping down to a more therapeutic dose.\n3. Neurosteroids. Particularly Allopregnanolone is suspected to be deficient in PFSers. The first point of call to repair neurosteroidgenesis should be an extended run of HCG. Other things that can increase Allopregnanolone are Progesterone supplementation and low dose SSRI, I am using fluoxetine at 1.25mg/d, with great success to help improve my GABAergenic signalling.\n4. Gut microbiome. Finasteride destroys the gut microbiome. Probiotics and eating a diet rich in a wide diversity of plant based fibres is key to building a rich gut microbiota. One particular species of bacteria suspected to be deficient in PFS is a species that produces the SCFA Butyrate. Butyrate is a strong HDAC inhibitor so a deficiency in Butyrate will make it harder for the body to reverse epigenetic changes. I personally consume cold potatoes daily to ensure I am getting enough butyrate.\n5. A PDE5 inhibitor like daily cialis can be particularly important to repair penis size and function. 5mg per day cialis should do the trick.\n\nPFS is very complicated and multifaceted. I do not claim to have all the answers but this is what I am doing personally to recover. 4000mg of L-carnitine. This had proven to increase testostrone receptors 4000mg of L-carnitine will boost your AR yes this is exactly what I read. 4000-4500mg I ordered a bottle online it should be soon What other foods have SCFA Butyrate other then cold potatos? Also are you saying I should taking cialis? is that safe? I just started taking citrulline a little more than a week ago.  I was already feeling pretty good. I took 3 pills back in July, took a few supplement that I believe set back my recovery, but was feeling good again starting in January.  New Year, New me?  Hahaha. \n\nI will check out L-carnitine soon. Luckily, there are quite a few supplement shops around my place. \n\nIs it 4000mg at a time? I believe oats are good. Anything with resistant starch and fermentable fibre. I cannot guarantee anything I am telling you here is safe man. All of our situations are so different so you need to do the research yourself first man IMO it is likely a mixture of lowered receptors and insensitivity, much lower 5AR activity and a multitude of effected neurosteriod pathways. Simply raising androgens extraneously has never worked for anyone as their baseline of what their body now \"thinks\" is normal is much lower. It is the raising of that baseline that is the key. you seem knowledgeable, is gingko biloba an SSRI? &gt;Also what does citrulline do?\n\nSupposedly helps with the libido. I feel as though it is been working. How did you come to the amount of 4000mg?\n\nIve looked into it, and most serving sizes seem to be 500-1000 mg, do you think that is not sufficient? No. Studies consistently show androgen receptor upregulation, meaning the density/amount of receptors increased. Not downregulation, which is what you are implying. As a general rule of thumb, you upregulate receptors (of any kind) by antagonizing them and downregulate them by agonizing them. 5 alpha reductase inhibitors antagonize the androgen receptors. DHT agonizes them. The recommended amount of 500mg isnt absorbed as much. There is a video on YouTube that talks about this, only about 20% or so of L carnatine gets absorbed in the gut so you are not getting 500mg, you are getting 100mg. If you take a higher dose then you will get increased benifits.\n\nLook up \"more plates more dates\" l carnatine he  is very knowledgeable and talks about this well. Thank you for the response. \n\nI will check out more plates more dates He doesnt have it in the title but should be the first video if you type l carnatine more plates more dates Thanks, I found one where he talks about it being safer to take if you slam garlic as well.\n\nIs that the one? There are actually a couple, I found that one today as well but remember it is not a sure thing that TMEOs cause cancer. I think I will start eating half a clove once I start 3000mg of L carnatine", "Gyno from anti androgen- Ru58841 Hello. I got gyno from ru58841( confirmed by a doctor, never had gyno before, everytime i apply the ru58841 i feel a pain in my nipples so i know it is because of the Ru). So i am looking for solution. My options are : 1. microdose raloxifene every day i guess? Looking for cheap ralox that ship to israel without any success.\n2. Surgery- but i wonder if the lump should come back if i will keep using the ru58841.\n3. Change ru58841 supplier- I have tried that- bought ru58841 from purity prod and the nipples definitely started to recover, but the hair looked not as good as the ru58841 from anagen( the one who gave me the gyno lumps) which made me doubt purity prod\u2019s powder purity.. (ironic). Hope to get advice here on which route should i take.", "Is there a way to recover? I am a 27yr male, I exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.\n\nI noticed very mild thinning/receding and thought it would be wise to start finasteride when I was 25. I figured starting early would save more of my hair in the long run. I started taking finasteride in February 2019 and stopped taking it around the end of October 2019, so about 9 months. I did notice the benefits, my hair began to seem healthier and fuller, BUT I decided to stop taking it because the longer I was on it the more my libido decreased and the more trouble I had with getting and maintaining erections. Before taking it and even several months into taking it I would jerk off 1-2 times a day with my normal volume of ejaculate.\n\nMy libido has ebbed and flowed since stopping fin, but over time it is continued to decrease overall especially in the last year. It is now July 2021 and I have almost no libido at all and my semen volume is almost nothing. I went from ejaculating about 1 tablespoon on average to barely 1/4 of a teaspoon. I can get hard with stimulation and I can reach climax, but I do not get spontaneous erections anymore. I mostly worried about my loss of libido and decreased semen volume. \n\nFor those with Finasteride Syndrome does this sound at all like your experience? Could this be something else unrelated to my previous use of finasteride? Is there anything I can do to get back to how I was before, or any tips on increasing libido and semen volume?\n\nThank you for any help! Yea. It is fin u fortunately.  Some recover.  Most do not.   Check your testosterone levels.  You may need that plus viagra.  You exhibit my own symptoms. I cannot get any erections even through manual stimulation.  Nor can I get hard to a naked girl in front of me.  Shit sucks This is not true at all. Stop jerking it to porn and reboot your brain. Did it get better awhile after stop taking it? And did you notice a crash after that You mighty consider trying out Creatine (5g/day).\n\nFor me it slightly improved libido, but it had a big positive effect on my semen volume and texture. Took me about 3-4 weeks to see the effects.\n\nIt works by up regulating 5AR (among others).\n\nBe wary though if you still care about your hair, for me it accelerated my hair loss, something that had pretty much halted even after I quit fin.  I think more people than 1%-2% get sides but most do recover, maybe the 1%-2% or maybe a little higher than that have it permanent unfortunately. Before finasteride I was horny all the time, I would regularly jerk off and cum once or twice a day. After I stopped it took a few months before I felt like my libido was starting to come back, but it is never been as strong as before and it fluctuates a lot. Overtime it is gradually decreased to barely any sex drive at all. \n\nSo it has not really been a crash. Maybe this will make it clearer:\n\nPre-Fin = high libido, large (normal) semen volume  \n\\ Fin for 9 months = no libido, normal semen volume  \nImmediately \\ Post Fin = no libido, normal semen volume  \n\\ = libido returned but only low to average, normal semen volume  \n\\ = libido fluctuates a lot, noticed semen volume slowly decreasing  \n\\ = low libido that fluctuates, semen volume continued to decrease  \n\\ = very low libido (almost nonexistent), almost no semen at all yep..you exhibit same thing as me....to this day...it is been about 20 years since i stopped fin, and my semen volum and libido sucks..I thought it would recover, but it has not .....I tried TRT, viagra and all kinds of semen volume pills...They never can get you to that pre fin level or feeling...what have you tried? Does it help with getting back to normal It did for me. But it is not an instant cure of anything. I still have a lot of issues but Creatine has diminished a lot of them.\n\nI now do not feel like shit every day, my sleep is improved a lot, I wake up with boners most morning and my sperm is \"normal\".\n\nBut it did not do shit with my penile sensitivity and I started to lose a lot of hair again (did not lose any hair after I quit fin). hell yeah, if youve improved this much then im sure your going to be normal soon I hope so. It is been almost 2 years since I quit and I did not do anything for the first 1.5 years or so more than trying to have an healthy lifestyle.\n\nAnd some stuff improved rapidly short after ceasing fin, some did not improve at all for me until I started Creatine. \n\nMost notably my sleep, it is so nice to be able to sleep 7-9 hours again. how long were you on it for? 9-10 months. How are sexual sides effects still have Ed and no libido or has it gradually improved ? So erections and libido is back to normal now and what creatine do you use ? No, it is not back to normal. But it is much, much better. More noticeable on erection quality, than libido who remains quite low.\n\nI use normal Creatine monohydrate, 5g/day either in the morning or after a workout. Anything else you do to help yourself get over the side effects ? Yeah a few things. Nothing I do is a cure, but it is really helpful to have some quality of life. \n\n1. Very gently use of a penis pump - fixed my slight narrowed base of penis and gave me morning wood again.\n\n2. L-theanine 400mg + low dose magnesium glysinate + low dose melatonin - this let me sleep through the night without waking up.\n\n3. Light excersie every day, either lift weight or cardio - gives me energy if I am feeling down.\n\nI have not had much success with improving my penile sensitivity as of yet sadly. Can you get erection with sexual thoughts or seeing sexy things ? Not very easy with sexual thought, but being in sexy situation yes.", "Step by step methods to a recovery  Guys, the guy in the first picture took finasteride for YEARS and had super bad side effects. He became obsessive with recovery and he found out the way to feel better step by step. And the guy in the other two photos (completely different guy) also recovered through his own steps which are quite similar. The point is recovery is very possible if we work hard enough for it. It is all inflammation that is preventing our thyroid and adrenals to work correctly. People who recover naturally in 3-6 months do so because we are all SUPPOSED to. Our body is working naturally to go back to homeostasis, that is the law of homeostasis. What is holding us back is inflammation I just do not like he is putting hormones before diet and basic nutrients. He is not bro. He is advocating removing inflammation as the very first step. And also, there is a guy who is an autodidact (super smart guy) who studied the hell out of PFS because he got it himself and he himself recovered. He set up a website with 5 articles describing the cause and everything but it got taken down, however it can be access from the old archived websites from waybackmachine. How can we best tackle inflammation? Just saw the other slides. I know we can over come this and our body\u2019s want to heal. We just need to support the process the best we can. Please look at my other post on this forum I myself have had really good success with tackling the gut. Studies show significant disruptions to the gut microbiome in PFS patients, and a lot of people respond  well to it anecdotally. \n\nHowever, be very wary of anyone who says they know what PFS is and what the uniform way to treat it across everyone  - at best the research has a few tentative hypotheses of the cause ranging from androgen receptor downregulation to prolactin receptor issues. \n\nUntil we know what the problem actually , we should avoid definitively  saying what the appropriate course of action consists of across all people. I completely understand what you are saying and I am not saying i found the root cause or anything. It is just when I look at people who recovered, whether it be from Propeciahelp, other forums or from my own personal circle, it has all been a pattern of controlling excitatory/inflammatory responses (stress, general inflammation, diet) while simultaneously increasing androgen levels (exercise, herbs, diet) which put the body in the optimal position to do it is job of rebalancing these hormones Yeah fair enough I agree with that - I had a look and think his suggestions are all sensible.", "Just maybe looking for some reassurance I feel kind of strange posting here, but I am just kind of hoping for some reassurance because I am not handling my current situation very well at all. I generally think people post too much TMI in these but am going to try anyway. Tressless does not give a flying fuck and even though there are 30 threads on side effects every day, mine get ignored or deleted.\n\nI am 31, and took fin 1mg/day for 49 days, then quit. I had taken fin 10 years ago at 21 for maybe 2 weeks, but quit because I did not like what it was doing to my libido, and felt like my mental clarity was not all there. I was back to normal in a week or less after quitting. I decided to try it again this year because I began thinking my hair was taking another hit as the years have gone by, and kind of thought my body could tolerate the drug a bit better now that my hormones have calmed down more. \n\nWell, I was fine for the first month this time on fin. No sexual side effects, no mental side effects. Felt great and felt like maybe I could keep my hair, too. I just popped the pill and thought nothing of it. Well, the last 19 days of being on the drug, sexual side effects slowly creeped up on me. Morning erections went away first, then libido started waning. After that my ability to maintain an erection waned and I needed very specific stimulation and a lot of concentration to obtain and maintain a decent erection to either masturbate or have sex. Then started having some gyno symptoms, which I tried to brush off as chafing from the gym. Three cases of full blown ED during three consecutive sexual encounters is what put me over. I did not take my next fin dose and have not ever since. Talked to my doctor agreed this was the best course of action.\n\nIt is been 18 days since my last dose, and I think I am slowly recovering. The gyno symptoms went first, then erection quality improved a tiny bit, that is if I wait several days between sex acts (which can be difficult when you have someone else with a sexual appetite living with you as well). I still need to concentrate very hard to keep half of an erection and perform very specific acts to be able to finish (what kills my boner is when it is rubbery/half chub and it bends mid sex act. It hurts and pisses me off and breaks my concentration.) Like, it went from stimulating my penis to absolutely needing to stimulate my brain without any sort of interruption or distraction to be able to remotely enjoy it. Same thing happens if I try to masturbate (though I rarely do so, because the desire just is not there). I am thinking some of this is psychological, because instead of it being \u201csomething I just do\u201d, it turned into \u201csomething I need to worry about\u201d. \n\nMorning erections have began to return somewhat within the last couple days, but are still not what they once were.\n\nI am a very active individual, lifting weights and doing intense cardio 4-5 days a week. I eat healthily and do not smoke or do drugs. Drink sparingly. I already took vitamin D, Zinc/Magnesium/B6, and citrulline supplements to enhance my workouts and workout recovery before fin. And if you ever look into it, that cocktail should technically be jet fuel for your dick, as well. Does not seem to be helping me now, though.\n\ntl;dr, healthy individual, all symptoms dissipated except fucking ED, which is super frustrating when you have a lady friend who wants to jump your bones. Cannot tell how much is physical and how much is mental. Curious as to whether any other fairly short term users (&lt;2 months) have sprung back to baseline after their symptoms lasted for more than a couple weeks. It is wild how much finasteride has ruined my life. There is no way to not sound overly dramatic because it sounds like some sort of dystopic science fiction work. I took fin for 3 weeks in mid 2017. I had side effects so I stopped. A week later i restarted(like a moron) and the side effects were  exponentially more noticeable. I quit the second round after less than a week. \n\nNearly exactly two weeks later, I woke up with a what can only be described as a total body shutdown. Lifeless dick, indescribable panic and anxiety, and a cognitive deficiency that made me barely able to recognize my own mother\u2019s voice while I was in tears. \n\nFast forward over three years. I have improved in certain areas very obviously. My cognitive function has improved dramatically. My sexual function is, however, unfortunately completely fucked. \n\nI am forced to take daily cialis which has its own set of scary possible side effects, but without it I would certainly not be here today. Not only for the improved sexual function but also to help combat Peyronie\u2019s disease which I was so lucky to inherit nearly 3 months after cessation of finasteride. \n\nMy testosterone went from high 500\u2019s at 26 to just under 350 at age 29. I am about to turn 30 this year and have tried desperately to not off myself. \n\nHonestly it is a fucking nightmare to even write this. I do not even know why I am bothering. It is such a controversial drug that many swear by. Millions take it with apparent little to no side effects yet for certain people, it will decimate your health. \n\nFurthermore, this sub seems to be pretty dead so despite some seemingly obvious hypochondriacs, propecia help is by far the best resource for what some of us are going through. u/throwitawaynow1719 \\- Most likely you will return to baseline again in a month or two. That is the most common.\n\nLong lasting (or permanent) side effects are rare, but know you know what they feel like. If you recover,\u00a0go live your life and never touch finasteride again. Life is so much more than hair. Sorry to hear this all happened to you man. It sounds truly awful. Doctors should not be allowed to prescribe this drug without making the patients have their baseline hormone levels tested and signing a legal waiver that they went through the possible side effects very explicitly and made sure the patient understands them fully, including stuff like Peyronie\u2019s. \n\nHowever I struggle with propeciahelp. It seems like 75% of the people there are blaming everything on propecia but then go on to feather in that they are also on SSRIs, have some other mental illness, are diabetic, overweight, generally live very unhealthy lifestyles, masturbate 10 times a day, etc. Finding stories on there that seem realistic and helpful is like a needle in a haystack most of the time. I always feel for the guys that are obviously having real issues being on or coming off this drug, but the number of hypochondriacs on that site seems very high. Thanks for the reply. I think I have been slowly improving each day since posting this. I am pretty sure some of it was psychological, but definitely not all of it. Maybe it was just a bit cathartic getting it all off my chest and not constantly thinking about it, maybe not. I do not know. I have been telling myself it is my lifestyle, vitamin D, and making sure I get enough sleep, but that is just to keep me from obsessing. \n\nTMI, but I was able to successfully have sex twice in one day a couple days ago. It was not the best quality, but after a couple weeks of zero performance and feeling like a failure, I was blown away that it even happened once, let alone twice in a day. I was expecting a multiple day refractory period like in the past. I am feeling hopeful.\n\nI know I will never go out of my way to recommend fin to anyone I care about. Wish I could be one of the ones to take it for 10 years with no ill effects, but here we are. Good to hear!\n\nI think you dodged a bullet. \n\nRemember: do not get tempted to try finasteride again. You might be so lucky the next time. You do not want to end up in the hole, like u/treeboyz and myself. Thanks! And no way. Already got burned twice 10 years apart on fin and got lucky both times. Tbh, my hair has not changed a hell of a lot in that time, just receded a bit more and maybe thinned out a tiny bit. Not that noticeable. It is not aggressive loss, apparently. I am approaching the age where a little bit of recession can look normal and even good on a guy, so I am coming to terms with it. So this stuff will never come near my body again. \n\nIf Breezula becomes a real thing and other guys respond to it well with no side effects, maybe it will be worth a try if I care enough by the time it comes out. But I do not want to do another 5ar inhibitor ever again. Thanks for the kind words. Sorry you are in a similar situation. I would not wish it on my worst enemy. \n\nAlso, I could not agree more with what you said about PH. Certainly being on other medications/being overweight/smoker ect and then complaining about your health is ridiculous. If you are in good shape, eat well, and other otherwise healthy, then it becomes concerning. \n\nHowever, there are quite a few guys that seem like the real deal. It seems like most of the unfortunate bastards who have dealt with this over a decade rarely post, any likely only visit to hope to see some advancements in studies and or treatments. So a lot of what you see feels like the rambling of raging hypochondriacs with medical conditions completely unrelated to PFS. Knowing who is the real deal is something I struggle with. Though if I had not written off all of them as overdramatic and hypochondriacs I would not and I would not be in this situation. And that might be true for others as well. What were your gyno symptoms?\n\nHow long after you stopped taking fin did they disappear?\n\nI stopped taking it 5 days ago and I still feel them sensible, and erect. We need to get this to the media. I feel messed up, cold genitals, insomnia, anxiety, depression Erectile Dysfunction etc. Merk has no respond for the mess they have made and they should be hold accountable. FDA has to pursue Merk and all accutane,finasteride and Dutasteride. Please spread the voice to the media please!! Nips felt like they were burning, like they got chafed by a rough shirt, 24/7 to the point where I had to tape them to prevent them from bothering me. It was the first thing to go, about 10 days after I quit. It is been in the media quite a bit. It is no longer the hot topic though since Merck put warnings on the medication.", "Please lend a helping hand.

I am at about 4 months since having quit.\n\nDuring the time on Fin, I experienced continued weight gain which always perplexed me, because I was always active and had good diet. I gained about 25 lbs so far.\n\nAnyone have similar experience like this? If so, did it get better after getting off finasteride?", "Think I Found The Cure To PFS! (No Products) Hey guys. Long story short. In 2018 I was on antidepressants (Sertraline). I stopped taking them and months later I read about NoFap and apparently it had a lot of benefits so I tried it. Worst mistake of my life. Within days, I had uncontrollable weight gain and hair loss (Telogen Effluvium). I had the hair loss and weight gain from the SSRI but it stopped months before and then when I started doing NoFap I had it again and still had it this year.\n\nA year later, I tried NoFap again because I was so miserable and desperate to feel normal again and I saw that people said you need to do NoFap longer to feel all the benefits. Big mistake. I started having erectile dysfunction, penis shrinkage, my penis felt really sensitive all the time, loss of libido and depression.\n\nSSRI's and NoFap affect androgen receptor sensitivity.  NoFap increases it considerably and so I believe NoFap caused my PFS. You might find that hard to believe but I have read on this forum that people with PFS have Androgen Overexpression and that is what NoFap does.\n\nI could not take all these symptoms and reading online, I was convinced I had Prostate Enlargement. I had all the tests at the hospital and they could not find anything. Thinking I had prostate problems I took Saw Palmetto capsules and started having suicidal ideation and I really wanted to kill myself. I even posted on my Facebook about wanting to kill myself and I have never done that before.\n\nI researched about Saw Palmetto and I saw many posts saying it ruined their life. I saw on a post on Reddit saying it caused something called PFS and when I searched about PFS and I saw all the symptoms everything started to fit and I realised I had PFS. I already had it before I took the Saw Palmetto, but that made me feel suicidal and added to all my other PFS symptoms I got from NoFap\n\nI have been researching for over a year about how to cure this and I have spent so much money on products that did not work. I was going to buy Resveratrol after reading about PFS and DNA Methylation and HDAC Inhibitors. I saw a post saying a member on this forum, Matt, killed himself after using Resveratrol and with me feeling so suicidal I did not care. I bought it from the store and even exceeded the dose and it did not help me at all. In fact it made me feel worse.\n\nSSRI's also affect DNA Methylation and androgen receptors so when I did NoFap, my androgen receptors were already affected by the SSRI's and I made them even more sensitive with the NoFap and that is why I got PFS.\n\nAfter I got PFS, I tried the antidepressant, Citalopram. I used that in 2015 for a few months but could not take the side effects. Sertraline was the SSRI that I have been using for years and that is the one I used before I tried NoFap. I was put on Citalopram again for the first time in 5 years and it was like it cured my PFS! I was absolutely shocked. I stopped taking the Citalopram however because again, I could not take the side effects but after I stopped taking it my PFS symptoms came back so I started taking the Citalopram again and it did not work.\n\nNow on to what I think the cure for PFS is. Last week I searched for 'Citalopram PFS' and saw a post from someone else saying the same thing I said. That they stopped having PFS symptoms when they took Citalopram and it stopped working for them when they tried it again but it was then that I realised that androgen receptors in the brain have a lot to do with PFS\n\nAnd since my problems started because of NoFap making my androgen receptors really sensitive, I think I searched 'PFS masturbation' and I came across this post. \n\n\nThis guy said he had PFS for 4 months and started masturbating 3-5 times a day in January and over a few months, he said he was 85-90% recovered and his post was in 2013.\n\nI knew that masturbation decreases androgen receptors but I have been doing some research and I am absolutely shocked at what I have discovered about ejaculating 4 times a day and it is effect on androgen receptor sensitivity!\n\n\n\nMethods\nThe effect of four consecutive ejaculations was investigated by determining levels of (i) testosterone in serum by solid phase RIA, (ii) androgen receptors at the ventral prostate with Western Blots, and (iii) androgen receptors-mRNA with RT-PCR. Data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA followed by a post hoc application of Dunnett's test if required.\n\nResults\nThe constant execution of sexual behavior did not produce any change in the weight of the ventral prostate. Serum testosterone increased after the second ejaculation, and remained elevated even after four ejaculations. The androgen receptor at the ventral prostate was higher after the first to third ejaculations, but returned suddenly to baseline levels after the fourth ejaculation. The level of mRNA increased after the first ejaculation, continued to increase after the second, and reached the highest peak after the third ejaculation; however, it returned suddenly to baseline levels after the fourth ejaculation.\n\nConclusion\nFour consecutive ejaculations by sexually experienced male rats had important effects on the physiological responses of the ventral prostate. Fast responses were induced as a result of sexual behavior that involved an increase and decrease in androgen receptors after one and four ejaculations, respectively. However, a progressive response was observed in the elevation of mRNA for androgen receptors, which also showed a fast decrease after four ejaculations. All of these changes with the prostate gland occurred in the presence of a sustained elevation of testosterone in the serum that started after two ejaculations. A consideration of these fast-induced changes suggests that the nerve supply plays a key role in prostate physiology during the sexual behavior of male rats.\n\n\nMale sexual behavior is regulated by limbic areas like the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), the nucleus accumbens (nAcc) and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). Neurons in these brain areas are rich in androgen receptors (AR) and express FOS-immunoreactivity in response to mating. In many species sexual satiation, a state of sexual behavior inhibition, is attained after multiple ejaculations. The mechanisms underlying sexual satiation are largely unknown. In this study we show that sexual activity reduces androgen receptor immunoreactivity (AR-ir) in some of the brain areas associated with the control of male sexual behavior, but not in others. Thus, one ejaculation reduced the AR-ir in the MPN and nAcc, but not in the BST and VMN. Copulation to satiation, on the other hand, reduced AR-ir in the MPN, nAcc and VMN, and not in the BST. The AR-ir reduction observed in the MPN of sexually satiated rats was drastic when compared to that of animals ejaculating once. Serum androgen levels did not vary after one ejaculation or copulation to exhaustion. These data reveal that sexual activity reduces AR in specific brain areas and suggest the possibility that such a reduction underlies the sexual inhibition that characterizes sexual satiety.\nThe AR is expressed in severa1 tissues, such as the prostate  and brain . I t is documented that in the male rat brain  as well as in the brain o f other species such as the Syrian hamster , Brazilian opossum , ...\n... A previous study found that precisely 24 h after sexual satiety there was a drastic reduction in AR density (ARd) in a very circumscribed anterior part of the MPOA, nucleus accumbens and VMH, whereas there was no such change in the BST. Such ARd reductions did not seem to depend upon the levels of circulating androgens, since they were unmodified at this interval . These results suggest that sexual behavior reduces ARd in certain brain regions. ...\n... On this basis, in the present study we evaluated whether the recovery of sexual behavior at different intervals after sexual satiety (48 h, 72 h, and 7 days) concurred with changes in ARd in severa1 brain areas: the media1 part of the media1 preoptic nucleus (MPOM, a specific area of the anterior MPOA), the MPOA (considered in al1 its anteroposterior extension), the BST (media1 division, posteromedial and posterointermediate), the VMH (dorsomedial and central parts); the MeA (anterodorsal, anteroventral and posteroventral parts), and the LSV (lateral septal nucleus, ventral part). These brain areas were selected because of: (a) their clear role in the mediation of rat sexual behavior ; (b) modifications in ARd 24 h after sexual satiety , and (c) changes in neurona1 activity (reflected as variations in c-Fos-ir) related to sexual behavior in general, and specifically to sexual satiety . In addition, since ARd importantly depends upon androgen circulating levels, we measured the serum levels of testosterone in control and sexually satiated males sacrificed 48 h, 72 h or 7 days after sexual satiety. ...\n\nResearch into the effects of sexual satiety in rats suggests neuronal plasticity in the circuits regulating male sexual behavior and changes in testosterone sensitivity. This state of sexual satiety and lack of interest in females is associated with reduced AR expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), VMH, lateral septum, MeA and especially in the mPOA . AR densities recover to previous levels as libido returns and this dynamic variation in gonadal steroid sensitivity means that receptor expression in the sexual brain network varies with sexual function in males. ...\n\n\n\nA study was completed in Mexico on male rats on the effects of ejaculation on androgen and estrogen receptors in the body. What they found was that after one or two ejaculations in a small time frame increased androgen receptor activity in their bodies, but after three or four rapid ejaculations caused a major drop in androgen receptor activity, lending credence to a \u201csexual exhaustion\u201d hypothesis. The hypothesis is that after ejaculating many times in rapid succession, the body sees no need to further care for sexual hormones because as far as the brain is concerned something should be pregnant by now and there is no need to keep the body on high sexual alert. Once sexual exhaustion is reached the rats no longer used testosterone as efficiency as it could be used, as the receptors for testosterone have closed up shop for the time being.\n\nYesss! I really believe ejaculating 4 times a day seems to be the cure for PFS!!!! On this site, everyone talks about androgen overexpression being the cause of PFS and I think there absolutely right! I have rarely seen anyone post about being able to do this but as you can see from the articles, it can be done and all it takes is ejaculating 4 times a day!\n\nNow the guy who posted about recovering using masturbation. He said he did 3-5 times a day for months. However as you see from the articles, the third ejaculation actually increases androgen expression more than once or twice so I think that is why it took that guy so many months to recover. You need to masturbate FOUR times a day to cure androgen overexpression. Not once, not twice, not three times, not five times. FOUR TIMES!!! I think if he did it 4 times a day he would have recovered sooner and I think he hindered his recovery by masturbating 3 times a day.\n\nNow with me, I started doing this 2 days ago and I feel amazing!! I do not feel suicidal anymore! My depression has lifted and I feel like I have everything to live for! My penis is not as sensitive anymore too. However I have only been doing this for 2 days. I think I will be fully recovered soon. \n\nAlso, members dealing with erectile dysfunction and penis shrinkage. I started taking Curcurmin capsules earlier this year and that is the only thing that worked for my erectile dysfunction and penis shrinkage. Curcurmin is the main ingredient in Tumeric. I did take Tumeric capsules but they had no effect on me, so I bought Curcurmin capsules and that worked instantly for those symptoms. It did not cure them though, just improved them and I need to take Curcurmin because if I do not I cannot masturbate 4 times a day because of erectile dysfunction and penis shrinkage\n\nI had to make this post because I know how debilitating PFS can be and hopefully I can save a lot of lives. It is really amazing that this thing can be cured so easily and with no product. I must have spent thousands on products when all the time I did not need them.\n\nI will not be posting on this forum much because I feel so much better and I think I will have recovered completely very soon but I will be checking in from time to time to see if other people will have cured themselves using this and of course if I am fully recovered I will let you all know\n\nI am so grateful to God! Allahu Akbar! God is good! I am so grateful and I feel so blessed.\n\nI have been praying every day since this started and I think I am on the road to recovery and I really believe I have found the cure to this nightmare. It might be a horrible disease but God is good all the time and there is nothing he cannot do! \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

NoFap increases androgen receptor sensitivity. I have seen that posted a lot. I wish I never did it. If I did not take the antidepressants then I probably would have been able to do Nofap with no problems but SSRI\u2019s affect androgen receptors in the brain and then doing Nofap which increases androgen receptor sensitivity considerable. That was a big mistake But should masturbation be done 4 consecutive times or within 24 hours?  In a nutshell, filling up with saws will we return to having very strong and lasting erections as before taking finasteride?  Will the penis and testicles return to pre-finasteride size?  Will the libido return?  Well ... I think it is irreversible damage, now my cock has been dead for 7 years due to finasteride. It should be consecutive but I cannot do that so I do 2 and then few hours later I will do it 2 more times \n\nAlso when I took Curcurmin my penis and testicle size returned to their original size which was shocking. Curcurmin is a hdac and DNA methylation inhibitor and they downregulate androgen receptors so it makes sense that it worked for me Are you still there after 4 days? Or have you passed out from extenuation? \n\nJokes aside, I will be following this post, very interesting idea. Lmaoo I am still here. It is been a week and one day since I started and I feel so much better. I am experimenting with this currently. I see some minor improvements over two days. I did nofap for a week and it triggered a second finasteride crash 2 months after I quit fin. Hey there! How are the improvements coming along? Do you still do it 4 times a day? Hey there! How are the improvements coming along? Do you still do it 4 times a day? Hey brother! I am going to ask the same question to you, apologies. But how are the improvements coming along? Do you still do it 4 times a day? Do you have PFS though? Or you just have normal functioning levels in brain and just follow no fap? Less, but 2 or 3 consistently. 4 times is a lot. Did it first week 4 times. That helped me going. Please check your PM brother. Would be a huge help. Thank you But you dont have ed how is your recovery going ?", "Fighting sexual sides Dht helps create the process of creating nitric oxide. Less nitric oxide, less erections. Less erections, less chance to recover because if you do not use it you basically lose it.\n\nMy advice\n\nL arginine is very cheap and helps a ton, I have been getting night time erections and cumming usually around twice a day with it.\n\nFresh Garlic has an ingredient that converts L arginine to nitric oxide but be careful I love spicy food but that shit gets hot as hell. I recommend up to 4 cloves a day.\n\nWithout it I have noticed my dick feels cold like it used to only when I had the flu or something\n\nJelqing\n\nLube up/cock ring up and take your index/pointer finger and thumb and form an okay sign. Slowly move up the lubed shaft. This will encourage blood flow to engorge your Jimmy as much as you are able but do not sweat if you cannot get it 100% at first.\n\nThis is not a sprint it is a marathon\nTry to achieve nightly erections again\nMake a journal, try to sustain an hour of prolonged blood flow to your Jimmy a day at least\n\nAlso VERY IMPORTANT\nStress, depression, anxiety all promote an unhealthy abundance of estrogen in your body. If you cannot help stressing eat a bag of broccoli a day I am not kidding. The dim in it helps to balance healthy estrogen and has made a significant difference to me. Dim pills I would be very careful with as I think they are more of an estrogen promoter but natural broccoli has much less and other substances that just promote very good health and balance of hormones\n\nGet some sun vitamin d, caffeine, and creatine, and sprints/heavy lifting all promote testosterone/dht production which means more nitric oxide and better erections. This is about compounding interest of boosts of testosterone over time, naturally. The way that will not stop your friggin balls from making testosterone because your doctor put you on trt. Also the extra healthy cardiovascular system will help too.\n\nSexual therapy\n\nSTOP associating sex with negative ANYTHING\nyou got to rise above the trauma of feeling like you are losing your dick and how scary these sides can be and enjoy sex/porn/women like you used to. This might be the hardest part for some people but again it is a process. I have found grounding myself by noticing things around me I can touch, hear, feel, smell and then rating my anxiety level and repeating. The level literally goes down and down and realizing it is going down really benefits your anxiety level. Cialis from an online Pharma works out to like two bucks for a 25MG pill. Take a half pill a day and your set. It will cost you less than all those supplements and it guaranteed to work.\n\n(also lowered my heart rate and blood pressure) L arginine is natural it is in protein shakes and stuff and it was like 3 or 5 bucks at Walmart for 50-100 pills. Appreciate your experience with your pills though I have been curious about those. I have used Arginine before, it is fine stuff. 99% of sups do not have any noticeable affect on me.\n\nI alsoget Cold Sores from time to time  (so much that I take prescription meds to reduce frequency).

In most cases these things resolve themselves You are still very early since quitting and you do not seem to have had a crash or severe side effects. Almost all people who get PFS go through an intense 'crashing' period which is much more volatile than you describe here; complete loss of libido, insomnia, inability to achieve erection, etc . I highly doubt you have PFS and I would say you will be completely fine soon within a couple of months. Eat and live healthily to help yourself along - and do not take fin again. Sorry you are going through the stuff you are going through. Of course low libido and ED is cause for concern. It is our manhood, after all. Do not take any more Finasteride.

Because that is what I did and I had no side effects. 8 months later I had PFS and had the worst 2 months of my life.\n\nLuckily I have started to recover now. It is been 31 hours since first dose and I feel a lot better now. Still just a little bit of brain fog but slowly fading. And trust me I will absolutely not do it again. I had already come to terms with my hair loss anyway it is just that my brother had gotten on it and he was fine so I figured hell the genetics got to be close right? Apparently that is not how it works lol. Best wishes for continued successful &amp; complete recovery! It is appalling how these side effects can be SO severe in some, and have zero adverse effects on others...be done with this poison. Best of luck! Good call. Enjoy your life! brain and dick/balls over hair lol. Could you tell a bit about those 2 horrific months, what you experienced, and what the alleged recovery, you now experience entails? Thanks alot Please take it from someone who had their life ruined by this drug in 2012... please see an endocrinologist immediately to test your hormone levels - it can cause permanent damage after one single dose. You need to ween off this drug very carefully. Search post finasteride syndrome. Just repeating.. ween off, do not go cold turkey or you will crash your endocrine system even worse. Sure! \n\nHonestly the first month was not terrible... only had zero libido and could not get hard. There were probably 2 days in that span where I could get hard and felt \"normal\".\n\nThe next two weeks were ABSOLUTE HELL. This is when the mental and physical pain started.\n\nThe mental pain was a state I had never experienced before. Lets make a hypothetical scenario... Imagine you get a call from the hospital that your wife is in the hospital. Imagine the state of worry/concern you are in while driving to the hospital. This is what it felt like for two weeks, but for absolutely no reason. Your mind does not let you relax or have enjoyment.\n\nIn addition to that horrible state of anxiety/terror, my I could not think properly... It was like my IQ was halved. I could not understand anything properly, or even do basic math without problems. \n\nAnd then the physical pain... It was located like... deep in my genitals. Like I had been castrated and there was this permanent numbing pain. Made it hard to sleep or really do anything.\n\n I have NEVER had ANY thoughts of suicide or pain, but during those 2 weeks, I told myself if this happened for any more that a few more months, I would have to kill myself. It was fucking scary.\n\nBut then one day I felt better.... it was nice! but then I would feel worse the next day. But I kept feeling better on the good days, and not as bad on the bad days. .(\n\nSo my recovery just happened gradually... what was important to me in hindsight was to remove ALL stress. Zero work or worry, as well as sleep. Sleep was the one time I actually felt normal, and gave me a change to reset and deal with the next day.\n\nIf you have any other questions, I would be happy to help in any way. Did you quit cold turkey? And what were your side effects? I have read that weening off may make no difference not that you are wrong I am sure you know a hell of a lot more about it than I do. I did call my doctor and they told me not to take it again although they may not have a bunch of knowledge into this specific matter themselves. Wow, thanks alot. I must say; my experience is very similar, only; my ED only lasted for about 3 days, but the state of anxiety/terror lasted for about a month, and is now gradually decreasing. I can also totally relate to how you describe the feeling of worry (wife in hospital example), as well as only really coming to rest when laying in bed.. Thank god i am a great sleeper.   \nWould you say you are now fully recovered? I am doing better but im not like i used to be. What i also experience is some sort of weird mental state, in which you sort of 'live in your head', not really 100% experiencing what is going on around you, either physically and emotionally, some sort of state of derealisation. Do you experience this? Would be great to get into contact with you. &gt;  What i also experience is some sort of weird mental state, in which you sort of 'live in your head', not really 100% experiencing what is going on around you, either physically and emotionally, some sort of state of derealisation. Do you experience this? \n\nYes! I forgot to mention this! When  I looked in the mirror, I just saw some terrified guy. It did not even feel like it was my body. Freaky shit.\n\nI do think I am fully recovered though. I do not feel any discomfort, my thinking has come back to normal and I get get hard and be turned on again. Only thing is I feel I have slight tinnitus that I did not have before? It was really bad in the peak of my struggle though.\n\nAnd yes, my state of anxiety came and went. When I finally got a break, I felt like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins when they were drinking beer on the top of the prison in Shawshank Redemption haha. It was such a great, much needed relief. Hopefully it fully goes away for you as well soon! \n\nHow long have you had PFS?

I feel so sorry for you guys having to go through all this bs that you probably were not even aware of before taking this stuff. I see fin recommended everywhere. You hear people mention ed is a temporary side that will go away with time. I have never heard anyone mention some of the shit on this sub before it blew my mind. I want to thank whoever contributes to this sub. Your stories have probably saved me from dealing with what some of you guys are struggling with. Thanks for coming here to write this!\n\nI think people are pretty aware of the sexual side effects by now, but more people are recognizing that there are cognitive and physical symptoms as well, and there is also a chance that they will last for a long time (possibly indefinitely). \n\nHopefully you gained some new appreciation for your health! If corpus cavernosum becomes fully fibrotic /collagen based, I guess reversal is pretty much impossible right, even if dht comes back to the tissues?  All of my mental sides seem to be stemming from the fact that as a 30yr old man I have a fibrotic penis that does not function like it did before. Seems like something you should make your own post about this. Not many people will see this because it is a comment underneath a relatively unrelated post.\n\nEdit: words You and me, brother. Imma look like a hatless garden gnome when I go bald, but I am embracing it with open arms. Better than side effects any day. Eh, I am not getting sides from topical fin. Too soon to say if it is working. Fyi do not let this sub control your decision. Its very rare, and pretty obvious its rare when subs like tresless will downvkte you into oblivion saying you are making up side effects\n\nBut I got sides and had to stop within 2 weeks. Back to normal now though. I recommend trying topical fin and bail if you notice symptoms\n\nMine were so clear cut that I knew it was not mental so I would not worry about psychicing yourself out. I wish for the devil \ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08\ud83d\ude08 I had informed myself about this ugly drug before taking it. I just believe in the package leaflet that ED can persist after quitting and I fool and Ideot thought ok it can remain for two weeks after quitting. There was no advice that ED can persist for years in some cases lifelong. \n\nWhy \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I did not read all the horrostories about PFS and Finasteride???!! Now I have PFS for half a year. It is like a surreal night mare. I cannot believe that I am that. From a vital best ager to an 90 year old man making his testament and going under supervisors control. A fibrotic penis as a 30yo man. It is unbelievable that all these drugs are free available in the internet. Finasteride, Minoxidil, all the hormones, saw palmetto.... with our any warning \u26a0\ufe0f label about the endocrine effects. There are thousands of young men damaged by these drugs. And they are still on the market without a warning label. Even if it is rare, you must acknowledge that there is a possibility of this happening to you. I am sure most people addicted to opioids were told that side effects and dependency were rare. I would rather plan for worst case scenario rather than best case scenario. \n\nI do agree that going with topical fin would be the way to go if you are concerned mainly about sides. Yes, but I have never heard of someone getting lifelong sides for taking the drug for a few weeks. \n\nReal pfs takes time to develop, and in cases I have read about, develops after continued use of fin even after sides have begun\n\nBut I recommend talking to a doctor about the sides, preferably one that works with hair restoration. \n\nThis subs only goal is to deter anyone and everyone no matter what. You can easily take a fraction of the normal dose for a set period of time to find out if you will get any sides then stop right away. Do not give up hope. You are not risking your life/quality of life permanently by testing the waters. And this sub will shun you if say you will try it Yeah I agree. Taking less than 1mg/day and then stopping if any sides pop up is what I would do. Going To try to find a doctor that deals with hair loss and go from there. Yeah I recommend .25 honestly \n\nAfter a few weeks of no sides, move up to .33\n\nThen .5\n\nI would not go to a full mg until at least a year of no sides IMO Do not do it man , I beg you. I would literally go bald than take this drug. Holy sh*t, I just started topical fin last week 1ml every other night. Thought my mind was settled about this... then I stumble onto this /r and starting to wonder if I should just stop. I had two HT procedures but was kind of thin wanted to supplement it with the topical fin believing that since it is topical and not taken orally that I would be safer.

From what i can tell these issues might have peaked on the second day. Have had suicidal thoughts for every day but obviously I know it is way too early to judge if my symptoms are going to last so I will endure at least a year in this state before revisiting. I had goals in life was pretty ambitious and held an arrogant opinion about people with emotional problems (and even this community) which now haunts me. But the last four days changed everything. I broke and all I am hoping and asking for now is that my mental function returns to an extend so I can at least have meaningful relationships and support my siblings and parents by being a cashcow instead of being a burden on everyones mind and draw down their happy and fulfilled lifes with me. The best thing i can do if this goes on is to avoid showing my pain and suffering to anyone I truly care about. If I recover I will be less selfish and more appreciative of the things I have. Maybe study biochemistry instead of economics, so i can contribute to avoiding unnecessary suffering in other people (just 21y/o so still a lot of time for that).\n\nI have read some comments under people's posts in similar situations that I should just give it time and I am still at the start of it all, but i feel like my symptoms are quite severe and similar to many peoples symptoms who actually never recovered.\n\nNot really a believer but pray for me. I will pray for you. You will if you stop taking it. Might take a year. Hi friend, in the same boat as you. Luckily some of my symptoms have recovered or atleast have gotten better.

Is it possible to experience this level of side effects from only taking 1.25mg of finasteride in total? I feel like this is surely just psychological/anxiety related at this point. It is been about 3 weeks since I took the drug and still have trouble getting and maintaining an erection, can only get like 70% erect at best. I noticed a drop in libido a couple days PRIOR to taking the drug so I feel like it must be psychological, but the issues with erections only started during sex on the day that I took the second dose and have persisted since. Dude, look at your diet, hormones, etc...assuming it is not psychological that could all have much greater impact than 3 days of a low dose of any medication. Yes, it is possible. It could also be psychological - experiencing hair loss is stressful in itself and could cause this. However, as others have mentioned, others have gotten side effects from only one dose.

It worked well for my hair , balding spot gone after like 6 months. BUT I began to lose all interest in my wife sexually whilst on it basically was no longer attracted to her at all zero interest. Thought maybe was just me getting older. But in the back of my mind I was thinking this is the finasteride. I could watch porn and still get off but over time I noticed my wein was smaller, shorter, thinner and no more morning boners. Then eventually it was like I had literally nothing between my legs. No feeling there at all, proper numnuts. Never getting turned on. And it got progressively worse. I took a 20mg cialis and still couldnt get it up where previously I would be more than sorted for an entire weekend of  banging. At that point I thought fuck it I need to cut down this crap. Maybe if I come off it a little itll help. Nothing. Then I thought this is b.s. I need to try stopping completely. Maybe 5 days later I noticed a difference. Now a week and a half later I feel back to my old self perhaps better. I am so happy and relieved that I dont give a shit about losing my hair. Ok so I am older but I would say to the younger lads worried about losing their hair. Dont get in your head about it. Accept it and level up. Fuck it shave it all off.

It can still go systemic, but less of a chance. Morning wood is my test on whether I am getting sexual sides from this or not. I was taking the pill every day and noticed the sides. Now I take 3x and they have gone away. Waiting on my topical to go back to every day. Well I have hair (for now) and I have not had a sex life in 7 years lol It really is a terrible choice. I chose hair and now after 4.5 years on fin I still have my hair but I am basically asexual and hardly get an erection. I guess the side effects crept up on me gradually over time. Yet I still do not want to quit because it feels like losing my hair would be even worse than this\u2026 but it does not feel good well, choosing the pill is the cheapest route, but it is not worth it to have a dead dick.  if i had known, i prob would just do a couple hair transplants and just have a sex life too.. Simply do not do it. For some, the side effects are severe and seemingly permanent. You will not know until you take it, and by then, it is too late. You are playing Russian roulette with your life.

You may have ruined your system, but only time can tell so try to relax as scary as this is. This is hopefully just transitive for you. \n\nI realized it was full blown PFS about six months in. This was when I realized all my labs were perfect, I still felt terrible, and many other men had the exact same story and experience as me. thank you. I will keep on the lookout. Do you rely on some sort of therapy for your psyche for this? I should have to be honest! But I am a poor graduate student and did not have health insurance for a while so that was not an option. I am honestly coping okay for now. Maybe in the future I would be open to talking to someone professional about this. I have only told my girlfriend cause she was kind of impacted by my sexual performance (and she does not even know the entire picture) and my dad (who also does not know the entire picture). \n\nIt is hard to keep it in my head sometimes. I wish I could tell my best guy friends, but I am too embarrassed. When we are all at the club or out for drinks, it is crazy how different our libidos are. Obviously, attractive women are nearby and they are all like \"wow she is so hot, I am going to ask her out, etc etc.\" I do not have a high libido, but I used to, and now I do not feel those emotions at all anymore which is sad for me. That is when I realize how much I have changed as a result of all of this. Thank you for sharing. I honestly felt that lack of libido this weekend and did not even think of putting two and two together. I have never felt like that before so I did not know how to assess it.  I did not want to text girls or even watch porn which is really unusual behavior for me. Just thought, nah maybe I am just satisfied for once. I had two chances to stop taking it but kept at it for another two days. At this point, I am counting instances like that. \n\nI totally understand the embarrassment and the guilt. I am keeping my fingers crossed and trying to relax for now. Thank you though. Keep in touch. You really do not know how much libido shapes your behavior until you lose libido. It is something I took for granted, sadly. \n\nGood luck to you! Keep in touch as well. Hi, how did you felt today? I have tooked 3.25mg within a week, and dropped three days ago after experiencing sides. I am trying to get rid of it as naturally as possible, been drinking a lot of water and eating nothing but food that stimulates testosterone such as green veggies, beef, eggs, garlic, onion, etc. \n\nI feel physically better today, I am in a whole better mood all around after being very depressed yesterday. \n\nI did manage to get intimate with the girl I am seeing last night, I kept it up for a good time but could not cum and ultimately got soft again. My dick felt very limp and tired after sex. I fell asleep and got some sort of a fever last nite, woke up sweating a couple of times, probably my body rejecting this thrash. I woke up with a boner which was very alleviating and today I have managed to get two additional erections, still no climax though. \n\nAlthough I feel way better and I am being optimistic about it I am still monitoring for symptoms very closely. Hope you feel better soon, this thing is seriously freaky as hell Great, is good to know that, hope you keep improving man. Hi, how are you feeling now? I took this for 12 days, missed a few days due to a trip, but started getting some anxiety, not sure where it was from but decided to google \"finasteride anxiety\" and came upon PFS, which is totally scary. So I just flushed my entire bottle down the toilet. But wanted to see how you were feeling now seeing how this post is a month old? Hey my friend. I am feeling great. The first 2-3 weeks after i stopped taking it were absolutely the worst. the anxiety, the lack of focus, the depressing thoughts, all of that are things that I never quite understood when people would talk about them until I went through them. I think from what I hear from other people, this is a normal thing to go through after you stop taking it. The most stressful part was the loss of libido, underperformance and \"watered down\" semen. That definitely fucked with my mind but fortunately I have been able to get back to my usual in the past weeks. Wake up with normal morning boners and was able to perform well in bed the last time I saw my lady friend. One thing that still worries me is the sperm count. My cum still feels very watery and what do you know that also influences the sensation of your orgasms, weak cum just does not feel as good as fully thick cum. This pill is a very serious thing that should be taken off the shelves and illegal to market. the side effects are seriously fucked up, it is practically chemical castration. I think you are on the right track to flush it down the toilet. Be as relaxed about it as you can the next few weeks, monitor your body, eat healthy, drink tons of water to get it out of your system and talk to  someone you trust. All of those things helped me but it did take just about as long as i took it to get back to normal. One thing I can tell you for sure is I DO NOT STRESS ABOUT LOSING MY HAIR ANYMORE. If this is the alternative, then so be it. Hope this helps. Take care. Thank you for sharing, happy to hear that you are feeling great. It is been a few days for me being off of it, only took it for 12 days, and the only issue I feel like I am having is anxiety.

Pre-press. doi:10.3233/JRS-210023\n\n(\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nBACKGROUND: A set of enduring conditions have been reported in the literature involving persistent sexual dysfunction after discontinuation of serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors and isotretinoin.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To develop diagnostic criteria for post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD), persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) following serotonin reuptake inhibitors, post-finasteride syndrome (PFS) and post-retinoid sexual dysfunction (PRSD).\n\nMETHODS: The original draft was designed using data from two published case series (Hogan et\u00a0al., 2014 and Healy et\u00a0al., 2018), which represent the largest public collections of data on these enduring conditions. It was further developed with the involvement of a multidisciplinary panel of experts.\n\nRESULTS: A set of criteria were agreed upon for each of the above conditions. Features of PSSD, PFS and PRSD commonly include decreased genital and orgasmic sensation, decreased sexual desire and erectile dysfunction. Ancillary non-sexual symptoms vary depending on the specific condition but can include emotional blunting and cognitive impairment. PGAD presents with an almost mirror image of unwanted sensations of genital arousal or irritability in the absence of sexual desire. A new term, post-SSRI asexuality, is introduced to describe a dampening of sexual interest and pleasure resulting from a pre-natal or pre-teen exposure to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These criteria will help in both clinical and research settings. As with all criteria, they will likely need modification in the light of developments. This is good. We need a way to clinically identify someone with these conditions. Criteria:\n\nNecessary\n\n(1) Prior treatment with a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor.\n\n(2) Enduring sexual dysfunction after stopping treatment.\n\nAdditional\n\n(3) Enduring reduction or loss of sexual desire.\n\n(4) Enduring erectile dysfunction.\n\n(5) Enduring reduction in genital and orgasmic sensation.\n\n(6) The problem is present for \u22653 months after stopping treatment.\n\nThere should be\n\n(7) No evidence of pre-drug sexual dysfunction that matches the current profile.\n\n(8) No current medical conditions that could account for the symptoms.\n\n(9) No current medication or substance misuse that could account for the symptoms.\n\n(10) No other prior medication that could account for the symptoms.\n\nA number of related features may stem from finasteride without being diagnostic for PFS:\n\ngynecomastia\n\naltered seminal quantity and quality.\n\nAdditional finasteride effects that can occur independently of any sexual difficulties but may also accompany sexual problems include:\n\ncognitive impairment\n\ndepression\n\nsuicidality.\n\nThere is some evidence for penile curvature or other penile effects in men with PFS, but it is not clear if this was present prior to treatment or has resulted since. Alterations in neuroactive steroid levels, methylation of 5 alpha-reductase type 2 in cerebrospinal fluid, and gut microbiota population have also been found in PFS patients. But again, it is not clear whether these were present before treatment.", "Depression and lack of motivation Hey\n\nI started to feel really anhedonic I cannot enjoy anything in life I do not want to talk to anyone \n\nI am losing my friends \n\n\nMemory loss is another issue\n\n\nI have been though a lot lately \n\nBut I try to be positive \n\n\nI am afraid the symptoms from fin.. anyone experienced similar feelings?", "tressles discriminates against users that report side effects from Finasteride and other drugs?

Users have hairloss problems. It is a very serious problem for young men. tressless users know the potential sides, they are well informed about all the PFS and side effect studies.\n\nThey do not want to be remembered. They do not want to discuss it.\n\nAnd who does, comes under attack. \nSo no one reports his problems anymore. And no one who wants to start is informed anymore. Yeah absolutely. A friend of mine used minoxidil for a year, he had bloated face skin ageing any and I guess full set of sides. I asked him number of times did he has any other sides? Sexual, mentall? What did he respond? \u201cNo, minox is safe\u201d!. And after a year he told me that he has reduced libido, ed, watery semen and other sides incl sleep disturbances and joint pain! It took him a year to recognise the issue, and I guess he saw a lot of doctors that did not help him  Yes, there are so much absolutely true \"horror\" stories about Finasterid in the net, that now many hairloss clients use Minoxidil or saw palmetto or topical Finasterid as save. \n\nThey get not informed about persisting sideeffekts of Minoxidil and Saw palmetto. And even the horrible reports from PFS victims are transferred to nocebo stories of mental ill freaks. Yep, same to Accutane. It is strange since there are definitely same extreme issues with some SSRI cases, vaccines and antibiotics.\n\n**On askapatient Worst Rated Drugs 2020.**\n\n**They just fuck people rather than cure.**\n\nShould we expect the shills to register new accounts and start arguing in subreddits that it is not true and all in the head?(\n\n**Rating\t Drug\t                           Treatment**\n\n**1.25\tALLEGRA (Sanofi Aventis)\tallergies**\n\n**1.24\tERYTHROMYCIN (generic)\tantibiotic**\n\n**1.20\tREGLAN (ANI)\tnausea; migraine**\n\n**1.13\tCIPRO (Bayer)\t antibiotic**\n\n**1.12\tPRILOSEC (AstraZeneca)\tacid reflux; GERD**\n\n**Minoxidil rating 1.6**\n\n**Finasteride 2.3** \n\n&gt;sideeffekts\n\n\nOh, hello exsexgods alternate account What ? Users on that subreddit have always discredited people with PFS. In my five years with PFS, I have seen a change for the better with more people \"believing\" us. It also helps that there are more publications out there that have supporting evidence for PFS. \n\nI think it is best not to engage with them, to be honest. If we create a \"them vs. us\" it is only going to continue to make them think we are crazy, and it will not do anything to make them change their minds. If they do not believe us, that is their prerogative. They can choose to ignore scientific studies and the thousands of reports from individuals. \n\nWith that said, I think most /r/tressless users believe that a drug that removes DHT, a powerful androgenic hormone, can indeed cause symptoms that mimic hypogonadism. I post on Tressless from time to time and I usually get upvoted. It is all about keeping calm and not posting in affect.\n\nOne must acknowledge that many people do not get PFS and Fin actually help them keep their hair \"scot free\". Reddit is a very nice and very active plattform. Hairloss vs PFS the first exhausted by baldness and the latter destroyed by PFS symptoms. \n\nBut it is not correct if users are hounted until they are suspended. I completely agree. True, but it is irritating that the other extreme do not hold themselves to the same standard. Statements like \"PFS is not real, no studies show it\" _will_ get upvoted.

Basically I was in a ton of pain for days, dick shriveled up and then my libido and dick sensitivity was absolute trash for a while\u2026also was still in some mild pain from day to day up until recently. Had bad anxiety for a couple weeks after the incident and coming off the drug but I do not have any lasting mental effects atm.

I am in a similar position to you in that I am 25 and took 0.5mg of Fin daily for one month in June/July. I had the same with not getting as hard on the drug as usual but fortunately did not experience any other sexual sides and have been fine in the dick department since coming off. \n\nI have however had more mental sides than you, with pretty severe brain fog which caused me to stop taking the drug. My brain fog is probably 60-70% better and I am noticing small improvements month by month, just hoping I can get back to feeling as sharp as I did pre-fin. \n\nHave you considered taking any supplements? I have heard people have success with Diindolylmethane to metabolise higher estrogen levels\n\nI hope your recovery continues man.", "Started 3 weeks ago, quit today (19y.o) I started taking Finasteride 1mg about 3 weeks ago and had no side effects other than anxiety for the first hour or so after starting and a ball ache occasionally for the next few days. After that everything was going well and my sex drive and erections were strong,  but just a couple days ago I started to notice that I had no interest in sex. I tried masturbating to see if everything was good down there and it was like I lost a lot of feeling which I thought was pretty odd and I noticed my erection was weaker than usual. I did not think much of it because I thought it could have been because I was tired or stressed from work. It was not until I had sex the next day when I realized something was seriously wrong. I was able to achieve a strong erection, but I still could not feel the full sensation. I was able to maintain it for about 3 minutes into sex until all of a sudden I completely lost interest as well as my erection. The same thing happened the next day and that is when I decided to call it quits.\n\nI will give an update in the coming days on how things are going.\n\nAny suggestions or other treatments that will not mess with my hormones? (Already using minoxidil twice daily) I do not know any good treatments for hair loss that will not mess with your hormones.\n\nJust be wary of minoxidil, it is side effects are quite scary just like Fin.\n\nBefore I took Fin I also used Minoxidil but it did not do much for me, so I started Fin. Really bad choice of me.\n\nIt did help with hairloss but was devastating in many other areas.\n\nIf I knew then what I know now I would not have used either and just shaved my hair.\n\nI do understand how you feel though, and it is a very rough thought to be bald... I am not an expert in the area so forgive me if I am wrong but would not a hair implant be better then? Thing is if you spend thousands on a transplant your pretty much screwed and have to take finasteride for as long as you want to keep your hair, the hair behind the transplant will continue to thin and fall out. I cannot imagine how many guys that got transplants and are now screwed with taking fin and enduring the side effects because they cannot afford to lose their hair, very sad. After a 1 week after stopping fin. it seems like sides have faded away for the most part. Let us hope they never come back again.", "Ssris? Hey guys my anxiety had gotten to a point that it interferes with my daily life so i was prescribed ssri lexapro. What are your guy\u2019s thoughts on the matter? Okay to take a low dose 5mg? Idk what to do and im scared of ssris. I jumped head first into taking fin without fear of consequences and side effects. I dont want to do the same for an ssri. Avoid at all cost. Ur reasoning? SSRIs seem to be causing the same side effects as finasteride - it is even speculated that the mechanism is similar. So yes, avoid if you can. Dude people suffer from same syndrome post SSRI if not arguably worse It will worsen your symptoms, do not do it Try wellbutrin instead. Read this:\n\n\n\nAnd check r/PSSD Hmm what if i dont have any ed or libido issues. Still dont rec ssri? Hmm okay what if ed and libido arent an issue?? And just anxiety Worsen anxiety? I dont have ed or libido issues Let me know bro Man do you want to risk it with a longer list of potentially long term damage. Who sold on you SSRI? Do not tell me you are watching Leo Longevity lol. I would always suggest the natural route to start man how about some THC to calm you down? Or some low dose mushrooms? Or lion's mane? Or other neurotopic supplements like huperzine, alpha GPC, tyrosine. See man that is our problem we jump too quickly into strong pharma products Dude chill the fuck out we are all suffering here its not surprising that we are jumping on solutions to our problems. We are all in this together and it does not hurt to support each other through positive comments LOL\nEdit: weed is illegal in my country and most of the supplements u listed are not available either. Funny how you think someone didnt research natural remedies first before jumping to an ssri ssri for all you know could be the last resort that someone really does not want to use. That is why pharma is bad they provide accessible products that they know people will buy and use Big pharma is the reason we are in this mess. Maybe do some meditation and let your body heal naturally bro there is no quick fix I am sorry. With SSRI you will be back here in a year from now with longer list of problems I guarantee Yes, sexual problems can also be caused, if you want to free yourself from anxiety you need to stop watching porn and masturbating LMAO i never watch porn or masturbate You have panic attacks or social anxiety? Last panic attack was two months ago. But suffering from a lot of anticipatory anxiety and a bit of agoraphobia? I guess? Cant really go to far from home Than exercise, try to bulk up, eat healthy, sleep well and you will see a lot of improvements Worried finasteride permanently damaged 5ar enzyme and that is causing low allopregnanolone which is known to have anxiolytic (anti anxiety) and antidepressant properties. Which is why im constantly anxious. Idk man i eat healthy and i try to cardio everyday No it has not, its way more complicated than that, maybe try to go for long walks without listening to music, that is what I do almost everyday to lose weight, but I also find very calming for the mind Aghh this sucks brother. We can do it but it seems like forever I do not have PFS, never tried finasteride, I have anhedonia from using lexapro for 1 mouth, I cant feel the same emotions that I used to feel before, like love, nostalgia, excitement, euphoria... That is why I am telling you to stay away from that stuff. The only thing that I feel almost the same as before trying lexapro is social anxiety, the actual thing that I was trying to cure, so it is obviously not worth trying What dosage were u brother? I was prescribed 5mg I started slowly, from 1 mg to 10 in 3 week, than last week I took 10 and fast tapered in 4 days Whyd u quit so suddenly? Sides? Yes, sexual mostly, they resolved after stopping, but I was left with anhedonia, it is been more than a year now I also have sleep problems Shit bro go over to a lexapro discussion page they might have more Answers. Perhaps look into low dose fluoxetine?\n\nI mean, it is your body - there are many ways to relieve anxiety that does not involve risking long lasting or permanent side effects... True but this isnt your everyday anxiety LOL i guess  u would not understand if you dont experience it firsthand the exact type of anxiety i have It is hard to compare those kinds of experiences, but I have been through panic attacks so bad I had to just curl up in a fetal position for hours... And that is on top of the constant, low-level anxiety.\n\nThe good thing is that I feel a lot better now. Took a few years though. What did you do to get better brother? How long u take fin? I definitely acknowledge PSSD but just wanted to offer a differing experience/opinion here. I was taking 10-20 mg Lexapro for almost 10 years before I ever touched finasteride, and I never had any sexual side effects with it. \n\nWhen I got PFS, I was hit with several (mild) sexual symptoms but none of the psychological or cognitive ones. I sometimes wonder if Lexapro was helping me as a buffer against the depression and anxiety that people often get on finasteride. This. I can see why lexapro helped. It raises allopregnanolone levels which likely buffers against psychological sides. Did you stop finasteride? If so, how long ago did u stop? Here is a post about it -  Yes, 18 months ago. How u doin now", "Finasteride ED - 22 years of Age I started losing my hair around 20 and ended up starting finasteride around the time I turned 21. I was on it for around 3 months, and noticed brain fog, a flat feeling and erectile dysfunction/lower libido. Thankfully, when I stopped taking the medication due to the psychological side effects (a couple weeks after noticing symptoms) the brain fog and flat feeling completely subsided. I was, however, left with ED. It slightly improved a few months after stopping, and I did actually notice my sex drive increased. It got to the point when I could masturbate at about a 50% erection, and I could ejaculate. It would often reach near 100% stiffness just before finishing, but I could never really sustain it. When I stopped masturbating for a while and when I was properly sexually aroused (girls would send nudes etc) I could get pretty close to 100% stiffness, but it was pretty rare. It is been around 7-8 months since stopping finasteride, and I am still experienced these (slightly improved) erectile dysfunction effects. I have been very reluctant to do anything with girls as I am quite scared I will not be able to get it up, even with viagra. I do have anxiety and I find the nocebo quite difficult to overcome due to worrying, and have experienced it on other medications. One such medication was minoxidil, which I stopped after a couple months as I started to feel worried about my breathing/ heart health, and have had instances where the nocebo is clearly having an impact (Id apply it and within 10 seconds I would be manually breathing, and worrying why my chest felt a bit tighter), but I cannot really work out if it is just nocebo, actually side effects, or a combo of both. I did and currently still masturbate quite a lot, 1-2 times a day average. I also got some viagra from one of those online doctors, but I am still quite scared to try it in case it does not work and I will then worry I will never be able to have sex again. Overall, I am doing pretty well mentally about it, but It still definitely troubles me that I cant have sex like I used to, and I am quite ashamed. I am wondering if anyone had any experiences with similar side effects, and how you overcame/treated them and how long it took. If I could honestly only get hard with medication again it would suck a bit but honestly would not be too bad if I could guarantee it would work (as I said, I am quite scared to try the meds in case they do not). What can I/should I do? Is there a way past this or to change my outlook so I am not as concerned with it? You are way too in your head rn. Honestly, it sounds like the Fin definitely impacted your sexual function, but I would be shocked if your dick does not feel 100% on Cialis or viagra. At least in terms of erection quality \n\nRelax, try some daily Cialis if your doc will give it to you and see how it goes I would try the usual - lower your stress, eat healthy, get good sleep. I have found that endurance exercise helps with erection quality.

Adverse effects consist in variable sign and symptoms, the most common being represented by mental troubles (reduced feeling of life pleasure or emotions, depression), physical impairments (loss of muscle tone and/or mass) and sexual complains (loss of libido and sexual potency). An increasing number of studies identify and describe even a post-finasteride syndrome (persistent adverse affects three months or more after finasteride cessation) or new adverse effects including but not limited at the skin level or oral cavity (marginal periodontium).\nWe intend to present in this study several oral adverse effects encountered during finasteride administration, represented by mild and moderate signs which generally responded to topical procedures without to require the stop of the drug administration. New studies on large samples will further document the existing relation between the described oral adverse effects and the implied pathophysiological mechanisms. For this moment, we are taking into account as possible mechanisms- a direct action of finasteride administration, possible indirect consequences due to hormonal interferences, or coexisting factors with finasteride administration that were not detected.", "Finasteride Side Effects after one dose Hello,\n\nI am a 20 year old main who was researching Finasteride for a while due to my heavily receding hairline.

I got 'hard flaccid' using saw palmetto. My erections were somewhat hard seated and would turn flaccid as soon as i got up. Could not get an erection standing up. Had prostate pain well. This was being off saw palmetto for 7 weeks.\n\nNow after getting on amino acids (L- cartinate and L-arginine) for a week, i get pretty hard on erections while seated and can maintain them while standing. I could also get erections while standing up. My problem is will my gains go away if i stop with amino acids? I also got them from using it for 2 weeks and w0 days later im doing pretty good just that they cime and go from time to time what was the dosage of these aminos? How often do you take them? You are doing better now? How long have you been off fin? Well i have been on it for 2 weeks and today is the 21st day since quitting and my libido is fully back along with my mood  my lnly issue is hard flacid wich  cokes and goes every 3 days anf atays for like 2 but its gotten better and better eah time, what ive beeb doing id taking vitamin d and getting lots of sleep and sunlight along with daily lofting and a dairy protein heavy diet but the thing that helped me the most is knowing that you can cure this condition my injecting proviron/testosterone as moreplatesmoredates said on his website and that has given me huge relief because i domt have to think about wether ill be impotent for.the rest of my life constantly keep moving forward breh started with 2000mg/day for each amino once per day. \n\nCompletely resolved my orgasm issues (didnt feel anything before, now back to norml) and reduced my prostate pain issues to almost none.\n\nAdding few more aminos soon (L-glycine and BCAAs and EAAs). I have read multiple stories where people have completely reversed their PFS from just aminos on propeciahelp. How is it working out for you mate? With the amino acids", "When did all the symptoms most notably start to improve? Curious to know what the average improvement time is here for let us say 80% recovery.\n\n( ED improved in a week. The rest of the symptoms were 30-40 days. I thought I recovered around less than a month after quiting,  but then i crashed.\n\nI thought I recovered around 6 month but then I crashed .\n\n9 month now and I am experiencing a prolonged 3 month crash. I am at my worst.\n\nI also visited a doctor (neurologist) for the first time. Told me fina cannot be responsible for what are you experiencing and I might have depression. Prescribed me meds pretty low dose of SNIRS which is the second day I am taking them. I know about PSSD but I am really desperate right now so it may help. What sides do you still have? Test your progesterone and allopregnenalone. Would people here agree that time of usage correlates with time of cessation? All the \"funny\" sexual ones. But at that point I cannot differentiate between sexual and mental sides. I mean I have so much anxiety and depression with no sleep that in that state I am sure no one could ever think of sex and function. I would like to hear from the members of 6 to 12 months and 2 years. What was their experience with the recovery. Did it came in waves of crashes and mini recoveries? Did the recovery came naturally? Please give us some info. This sub has 426 members \ud83d\ude4f please tell us your story. And what will that do for him? Usage how long taken? Rule out if this is the issue. Those two steroid hormones are most important in the brain and fin lowers it drastically. Could mean treatment Fin does not lower progesterone, if anything it raises it. 4 months Please if its possible, those who recovered after 1 or 2 plus year, describe your experiences. Give faith to other sufferers you have been there. Depends but in general yeah. I think the younger you start taking fin + the dose (drug burden on the system) + amount of time = increased chances of developing lasting PFS, the duration of PFS seems to vary but one thing I have noticed on myself and others is that when you start stop it, it seems to exacerbate the situation and might make things harder to recover and possibly more permanent. My Story, I took finasteride 1.25mg everyday from 19 years old to 23 years old. The first few months after starting the treatment I remember having terrible sexual side effects but i pushed through and tolerated them because at the time, giving up on my hair was not an option no matter how bad the side effects were. Kept taking it for about 3 years and got used to the side effects. As time went on, i started noticing weird things happening to me but never put it down to finasteride because i was in denial and could not afford to stop it. It started with no more morning wood, then weaker erections that worsened as time went on, then lower mood and energy, brain fog and concentration issues that progressed into a  feeling of emptiness and  like nothing had meaning anymore, went to family funerals and one of my best friend dying from cancer funeral and felt absolutely nothing. It felt like something chemical was OFF in me but could not put it down to finasteride (I remember telling myself: \"Side effects are only 2% so what are the chances it could be the fin\") and kept taking it. Tried many different diets exercise regimes and supplements to fix myself but nothing helped/worked.\n\nWhen I was about 22 almost 23 I took a month off the fin by accident because i needed to renew my prescription. In that month i member feeling so much better, slept like a baby, had so much more energy and drive for life, felt like a young man again. Morning wood came back and that primal instinct to chase girls came back, i felt ecstatic. 6 months later i felt even better but my hair was falling out like hell. I somehow convinced myself that i would give the finasteride another shot but at lower doses/frequency/ topical (Big mistake!). went back on fin on and off and experimenting from 23yo to 24yo. It seemed like the side effects hit even harder than the first time I used it and every time i tried lowering the dose/ frequency. Also side effects kicked in sooner/harder and lasted longer after stopping. I was not worried too much about permanent side effects because i did not know anything about PFS or permanent side effects so i was positive that things would go back to normal. Now here i am almost a year later and while i feel much better than i was when i was on finasteride i still have lingering side effects that i do not know if they will ever go away. Mainly weaker erections and the other common PFS symptoms are still present and somewhat improving so i stay positive and move on in my life. Wow what a journey, hair loss is truly one heck of journey, in the end nobody cares, wish someone would have told that earlier, we live and learn. It lowers pregnenalone. Pregnenalone is converted into DHEA and progesterone. In my understanding prolactin is raised. Im not a doc. Explain me. Did you stop immediately or taper off? Fin block the 5AR pathway of Prog leading to higher levels of Prog.\n\nIt does the same with T, as consistently higher T levels have been shown in CSF of PFS sufferers. \n\nI am not even sure it lowers Preg. I think I have read there is a raise of Preg.\n\n\n", "Curing Finasteride Syndrome Hey guys, I found these articles that talk about the finasteride syndrome and what seems to cause it.\n\n(\n\nHe also has a video on youtube, for those who prefer that format.\n\nIn a really short summary: People who suffer from finasteride syndrome have lower levels of progesterone and inexistent levels of allopregnanolone. The allopregnanolone is due to the finasteride blocking some of the 5-alpha reductase type 1 that makes the conversion of progesterone into allopregnanolone. For the low progesterone doses, I do not really know the cause of it.\n\nSo a way to counteract this is by taking a low dose of progesterone. \n\nThis is really experimental and I am trying to figure out the best way to approach this, anyone has ever tried it or has any experience with it? what gets me is that this dude takes fin himself yet knows all these things it does to your brain I think this is more a protocol on how do prevent side effects while taking it The only thing he mentions about treating POST fin syndrome is work on developing better neuroplasticity - which is why meditation, activities, things to get your mind changing and working in different ways ... are a common denominator in recoveries In the studies, it was found that these neurosteroids levels were still low in people with the post finasteride syndrome, but I do not know if it will help or not. But they thought that the low levels of neurosteroids was the cause. But once again, I have no idea if it helps or what are the side effects of taking low doses of progesterone in men. This Leo guy is peak bro science. \n\nPeople with PFS has hormone levels all over the map - there is no consistent pattern. Some abnormalities in CSF concentrations of hormones have been found, but it is not as simple as you described.  Post Finasterid Syndrom us an epigenetic disorder after blocking 5 alpha reductase. 3800 genes are altered in their expression. The only causal therapy is reset the key genes and key mechanisms. It is unfortunate that people still do not understand the causes and cure for this syndrome..... It is really not difficult. Me and my group of men have been fixing it for years There is a pattern (in the unmethylated PFS group).\n\nBut it is not relevant to the symptoms.\n\nWhat is scary is the low E2 and high T found in unmethylated PFS patients.\n\nT = 11 fold increase. \nE2 = 20 fold decrease.\n\nThis is really, really scary. Especially the low E2, as E2 is super important to protect the brain, and especially dopaminergic neurons. I think the most important factor in recovery is time I took pregnenolone 50 mg a day for a month and it just caused me ed so what is that That Is true, although i must add; People in general have hormone levels all over the map, so in essence, theres nothing wrong with pfs sufferers hormone levels. whatever is causing it, its not hormones Hell refer you to his website total male optimization ... I have been doing it with a fair amount of cheating for about month ... And I have felt better Serious question: if you understand PFS and know how to treat it, why are scientists and universities still trying to figure it out? Do they refuse to look into your cure/treatment? Www.totalmaleoptimization.com Bc....pharmaceutical companies How about the PFS foundation? I know you have been called a fraud on the forum because of the stuff you are selling (not saying you are) but if you are so confident about the recoveries for so many years, why would not they look into that? Because his protocol is an insane endeavour of torturous detoxification methods such as fasting, 21 HERBS ROTATION (!!!!) from his sponsor of course, Pumping your D (good luck when it is shrunken to nothingness) and other things combined. You cannot have a job and do that protocol. Most PFSer are broke desperate people and the ones who have money seem to have never entered a gym in their lives have no dedication. We need a middle ground but nothing is there. \n\nBy the way, people on his forum HAVE NOT recovered. They are brainwashed into thinking they are making progress but only a small handful have truly declared themselves the recovered. THe rest have logs that span YEARS yes YEARS sacrificing everything to the protocol with no real recovery. CDsnut uses typical scammy tactics like saying OH well you didnt follow the protocol 100% otherwise you would be heal. But I will tell you this even the most dedicated bodybuilders cant follow that shit He is a pathological liar and mentally ill drug addict. I would not trust a word he says and he definitely has no clue how to fix PFS And this my friend, is why you will never recover and spend the rest of your life like a monk.\n\n There is no middle ground. If you knew what you were dealing with you would understand that period but again, just another week minded individual going along with the masses How many recoveries have they racked up so far? Good luck with that guy.. You are just like every other time deck and Harry who gets hit with sides finds the propecia trolls bashing me And jumps on the bandwagon. But the ultimate is ignorant is talking about something you have you have no clue what you are talking about.. Hey Hey, it is your life, or lack thereof I have recoveries from all over the world from all different IP addresses from completely separate times completely organically I have nothing to hide but you keep saying what fit your narrative and see how your life turns out. bro I truly believe you have deluded yourself into thinking this works. In reality it is probably those Andro crap cycles you blast all the time that is probably why you recovered at the cost of your hair. Please miss me with all that preachy work ethic talk dawg I am twice your size in muscles With a Dick that does not work. Sounds fun!\n\n I have been dealing with you my whole life.. So what makes you think the protocol does not work? What is your experiences? What is your 1st hand knowledge  of my protocol?\n\n So let me guess you are one of the people that think all of the recoveries are fake even though they come from all over the world and different IP addresses at all different times from times? I just want to know where your mindset is\n\n Have fun living a life of misery my man because that is what you are caught out for\n\n At the cost of my hair? You still care about your hair? It really has turned you into a woman vain and delicate\n\n You are just mad because I can satisfy a woman and you  cannot. Believe me I have been there, done that period I understand why why are mad. But you are really should not bite the hand that feeds you nah man I like my hair not doing stupid andro cycle known to eat up hair follicles. Many have recovered without your torture protocol. \n\nWhat you do is you psychologically coerce your members into thinking they got recovered because any other talk about the reality is shunned. Having read a lot of the logs there it seems most have in fact NOT RECOVERED. Go read the guy 'HULK' for example. After years and years of trying your garbage he did not improve. Other logs have people exploring other options already like PELVIC THERAPY lmao.  Other ones are even more sad with people going on downturn every month never healing and NEEDING A BUDDY CHECK. man this is so pathetic. Just tell everyone to cycle Andro why do you bother them with all that other garbage. Trust me I have read many of that garnbage. Show me a genuine log link none exist. You and your crew of recovered all did anabolic steroids that is the reality just tell people that. I might have to go down that road luckily my hair fall is not like yours where even with hair transplants your hair is too weak, 1) Hulk is pretty much recovered. Just has sexual sides left. \n2) Pelvic Therapy is an addition to the protocol, not a replacement. \n3) What the hell is wrong with a buddy check? Turnover is pretty much recovered now\u2026 Are you CDs sock account?\n\nHULK is recovered EXCEPT SEXUAL SIDES HAHAHA\n\nthen I am recovered too and so are most people LMAO Boy you are a peach are not you. And you obviously have no clue what you are talking about Just a typical sufferer sufferer who does not have what it takes to get well no actual retort just empty words from the cult leader lmao Nothing to actually retort?? Everything you are saying is completely false false and it is actually sad please sad how you believe these things thanks that are as far from the truth as possible. Yup. Just another idiot. I almost fully recovered after 2 months, and now Im worse than baseline 6 months after quitting fin How long u take it? 4 months .5mg daily Social media influencers can get traffic and engagement from talking about finasteride side effects. I have seen no evidence from this person. He also has something to sell. **Caveat emptor.** The thing is in this sphere it is full of cult and scam artists. Even this guy tmo writes in his intro he is dark triad entrepreneur personality. He straight up tells people reading the site that he is of that nature. Of course, if you did not follow protocol 100% like full time athlete then you will not recover. It is cult mentality there in the other direction...

Fin takes months to work so I do not really see the point of using it 1 month.\n\nRisk/reward is not good at all. There are no studies on this yet, as far as I am aware, but if you are vulnerable to 5ARIs (which has nothing to do with your overall health), a single pill can make you sick.\n\nFor me it took 10 pills. This is like asking us if you should play Russian roulette Gods, how I wish to be in your place right now. I only took saw palmetto and got completely destroyed. \n\nDo not you dare take it. Man, sorry to hear that. But what are the alternatives? Minoxidil? One pill did it for me. Tread lightly! Are u sick? What effect had finasterid to you? What happened? What side effects do u hae right now? Here is a post about it. \n\nYou have better things to do than spending years to regain your sanity with esoteric diets, supplements, and hormones. (And being gaslit by doctors!)\n\nEnjoy your health and life your life! Forget about finasteride! I am affected too. I wish I had never used finasterid. How is your love life? Are u in a relationship? Impotence, deformed numb genitals, zero libido... for almost 2 years now. It ruined my life. It is poison. Do topical rogaine and use ketoconazole 2% shampoo and be done with it. Save your dick and your manhood. See, 5aR enzymes are not circulating in the blood in any significant amounts, they are found in tissues (especially the scalp and prostate). \n\nFinasteride binds irreversibly to these enzymes.\n\nThe half-life of these enzymes depends on the type, but is in the range 14-28 days. \n\nTherefore Fin clears the bloodstream after a day or so, but remains bound to these enzymes in the tissues for weeks.\n\nThat means even after one dose your DHT gets suppressed for weeks after the dose even if you do not take any further doses.\n\nSo if you show side effects after one dose you cannot just quit because it takes 5AR weeks to recover. Sexually I am doing ok, but relationships are hard when you do not feel anything. What is ur age Do u believe one day there is a cure against PFS?

It might take many more years, but I believe that we will know how to treat PFS is within 10-15 years... The pace of biotechnology seems to be accelerating, so perhaps it will be earlier. Yes That would be amazing. But in 10 years I would be 45.. :(\nI am young now. I wanne date. I wanne have sex. I wanne enjoy life. Why do u still use fin when it has these side effects? I feel the same, man. One day we will get there! Sorry for bothering. I hsne a million questions. What is your age? Do I feel lonely sometimes and what are u doing in that case? Does your family know u suffer from PFS? Because they do not go away when I stop and my head shape is so deformed I want to keep my hair at all cost What is ur age? Did u consult a doctor yet? What does the doctor advice you to do? Hop on steroid cycles bro Lol are you an idiot? Get off and heal damn people are stupid what is the point of your stupid looks of you do not have a D What do u mean There already is. You have to mess with your androgen receptors in the other direction Why does not my doctor help me with it? Can u post some more Infos about that? Pfs has nothing to do with the enzymes that get restored. It is androgen receptors and neurosteroids. Do not go to a doctor. At best he will give you Cialis very very very few understand hormones. Try herbal test booster cycles of at least 3 weeks. Come off one week. Repeat until androgen receptors change again which might take time. If herbals are not enough then you need steroid cycle like high test, proviron or anavar. Pretty much you need to be a bodybuilder How do u know all that, habe u tried that? Did u suffer from PFS? I suffered immediately from gyno and other symptoms\nSexual crash came months later and my penile tissues were wrecked. Went from big D to not feeling anything except retraction.\nI fully healed it with many cycles of herbal supplements. If it did not heal I was going to hop on real steroids. The goals is to push your androgen receptors the other direction. I did not suffer from the neurosteroids issues beyond anxiety about my dick so some people might need additional therapies Where can I find someone helping me? I am Real not familiar with all that stuff Do you workout? I used to workout. Never had the feeling it would help. Why It helps change your androgen receptors along with the supplement dude Finasteride changed your epigenetics if you do not push them hard in the oeher direction they will not change. But they are changeable a lot of things will change affect them just like finasteride did. You need a plan. For me I was already a gym rat and knew of all the supplements. People really need to experiment more as being stuck living life with no D just is not worth it OK thank you. What does D mean in your last sentence? What is your age? And where van I find more Infos about pushing epigenetics in the other direction?\n\nThank u for now... Maybe now I am a bit more helped with my catastrophic situation Dick\nAnd I am 34\nI do not know you can message me with questions I guess\nI pretty much read every single post on multiple forums about this If 5ar, which creates dht, gets destroyed the androgen receptor sensitivity gets upregulated to compensate for the missing dht. If 5ar finally gets back up after a couple of weeks the over sensitive androgen receptors gets shocked by the increasing dht and get silenced and stay silenced.\n\nI think that could be the reason some predispositioned people develop dht. Perhaps the ones with low dht in the first place are more susceptible. All we know is the androgen receptors are affected. The rest is your speculation. Also, you do not know if they stay silenced some heal. Also many reports of guys exhibiting high DHT being impacted all the same. Stop making wild assertions dawg It is all just speculation because nobody really knows anything about pfs. Am I not allowed to post a theory? \n\nI really think the mechanism is as follows :\n\nAnti-androgenic action at the cell level causes an upregulation of the AR and induces epigenetic processes which keep AR-overexpression persistent\n\nOverexpression of AR and ARG\u2019s (Androgen Responsive Genes) causes negative regulatory response, thereby silencing signals\n\nWithdrawl of substance causes increase of AR activation, thereby exacerbating processes described in previous step. This is what we would call the \u201ccrash\u201d\n\nAR remains in persistent state of overexpression, whereby further increases of androgenic action worsen the symptoms, while antiandrogenic influence will at least transiently improve the condition. Just DM me. Am I not allowed to criticize your theory?\n\nLast paragraph is a generalization. Many healed by increasing androgens in the short term by cycling steroids. Some used anti-androgen and crashed completely (some committed suicide) Of course you are.\n\nThe actual purpose of my comment was to put an emphasis on the fact that even if the OP just wanted to try finasteride for a month it could still harm him badly. For me all it took was one pill.\n\nThe concept I mentioned in my first comment that the half-life of the SRD5A2 is ~31 days, explaining the irreversible action of finasteride on SRD5A2, is a fact.\n\nSo after you take one pill you have to deal with the side effects much longer than the couple of hours finasteride stays in your system so the chance the body takes permanent damage is much higher.\n\nYou are right that my further comments are speculation, but backed up by multiple studies like this for example:\n\n\n\nIn any case, I do not want to argue with you I just want the OP to make an informed decision. I would give anything to be in his position again and have chosen not to take the drug 7 years ago. What does that study show its behind a wall. I am well aware of the recent studies showing androgen receptors and epigenetic damage. I dont want to argue by you are making a lot of generalization when we have very little data \n\nHave you tried anabolic steroids in short bursts? &gt;What does that study show its behind a wall.\n\nThe abstract is not behind a wall. \n\n&gt;I am well aware of the recent studies showing androgen receptors and epigenetic damage. I dont want to argue by you are making a lot of generalization when we have very little data \n\nI think you are making a lot of generalization when you say: \n\n&gt;Many healed by increasing androgens in the short term by cycling steroids.\n\nShow me some studies that support this claim. Where does this information come from? \n\n&gt;Have you tried anabolic steroids in short bursts?\n\nNo, I have not tried that because the general consensus is that it makes people worse. Has it worked for you? Dude the study does not tell me anything tell me what point am I supposed to see there. \n\nAnd do not flip this on me. You have provided nothing but anecdotes and I have responded with counter anecdotes. We both know there are zero studies on treating this.\n\nBut to answer your question: yes I have recovered and many other did in a whatsapp group. You cannot get worse than living with no dick dude. I cycled herbal androgen boosting supplements combined with intense workouts (I am a bodybuilder). Some people had to use anabolic steroids because herbs were not strong enough.\n\nBy the way general concessus is based on what? Ppforum? We even have someone here compile the spreadsheet of TRT results and it showed that many improved but that treatment gets shunned over there. not saying its a good fix but just to show that there is an incentive to be pessimistic there. Most of the long term posters there are not even PFS they are PSSD or PAS.\nSo I have no clue who passed any concessus about what works and what does not.\n\nThe only thing that makes sense is to push your androgen receptors and epigenetics the opposite way fin did. You realize even working out can change AR. Even taking supplements like Carnitine and creatine changes them albeit I do not think those are enough to counter PFS. You need stronger herbs and/or androgenic steroids So you say TRT is the cure? Case closed? If it is that easy what is all the hassle about?\n\nPerhaps there are different types of pfs. Those with 'just' ED and libido problems and those like me with a lot of neurological symptoms. \n\nI for my part feel much worse the day after doing heavy squats for example. So I always thought increasing testosterone/DHT is counterproductive for me. \n\nBut you got me l thinking, perhaps I will try TRT since nothing else really did anything the last 7 years... No I did not say that like you I do not really know the answer but some people reported improvement on TRT only to be dismissed on ppforum. \n\nMy own theory (and the one  from whatsapp group I was in) is that you need short cycle of being on androgenic cycle then you can just hop off. Rinse repeat like a bodybuilder until you change your AR. Some guys needed higher dosage of anabolic. \n\nThat is what I did with herbs and it took over a year for me to get back my penis function which I can tell you man it was gone shrunken retracting. And I did get worse libido and retractions when working out and on cycle (not much worse than my pathetic baseline really) but it is months after that I healed which seems to align with how other people felt in my group.\n\nKeep in mind i was only on 3 weeks topical fin. I had gyno nipple itch and burning balls and skin autoimmune trigger. Those two went away after stopping. My libido was fine in fact as high as ever until I crashed 2 months later when I woke up with shrivelled shrunken penis that does not hang and I lived with that for over a year. You have to try man trust me I kept trying but mostly working out and some supplements were key. I had anxiety but it was due to my penis not much impact on my sleep or anything too overwhelming. So I do not know maybe some guys have neurosteroids impact on top of AR which needs to be fixed separately but honestly even if I had that my main worry would be my penis. I would not wish it on any man to live his life without one its torture Anyway, happy for your recovery, man! Perhaps it could work for me too...\n\nThis shit sucks.\n\nHave a nice day\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb Doing heavy squats only increase T to a negligible amount (15% for an hour IIRC).\n\nTo put it into perspective in the morning your T is substantially higher than in the evening. Do you feel substantially worse in the first half of the day, and then feel better and better?\n\nBut heavy exercise is very taxing on the body in general, it is an acute stress after all. \n\nNow the increase in AR we have seen is interesting and needs more studies, but there is one study who showed that the higher the AR the less severe symptoms. \n\nWhat we really need is a study that looks at 5AR activity / androgen amount in the tissue with the increased amount of AR. Hm, I generally do not feel better or worse in the morning. But as I mentioned after doing squats my brain fog is really bad for a couple of days. Yes I hear you and I know it is a fact for many people that they suffer from exercise intolerance. \n\nI have it to some degree, so I changed my training routine so I can still train and feel good.\n\nDoing exercise will for example give you a local inflammation, and systemic raise of the cytokine IL-6. After that the body needs to repair itself. Something that is impaired in many of us (and was shown in the recent Baylor study).\n\nBut what I wanted to highlight is that people are to \"hung up\" on the overexpressed AR as a sole cause for PFS. And they try to connect everything they do that makes them feel worse to androgens.\n\nBut as in my example, your T is highest in the morning and the slowly sink throughout the day. But I do not see many people say they feel worse in the morning.\n\nWe have 2 studies so far showing overexpression of AR in penile skin. Which is a great lead and I hope we will get more research going to understand how much of an impact it has.\n\nOne easy study could be to check AR expression in penile tissue from asymptomatic Finasteride users.\n\nOr if it would be possible to check AR expression + local DHT / androgen activity of PFS patients and controls.\n\nSadly in the last studies they did not check local DHT (if it is even possible). So they had it in the discussion they could not draw any conclusions. Thanks for taking your time writing that down! Very interesting indeed.\n\nWould you mind to elaborate on how you adapted your training regime? No problems I hope it made any sense \ud83d\ude05.\n\nYeah sure, it is not very complicated.\n\nMy conclusion from the data we have on PFS is that our ability to \"regenerate\" or our protein synthesis has diminished.\n\nThis include our soft tissue, muscles and bones (as shown in Baylor study). And also some rat studies who show that Finsteride can dull the mTOR pathway.\n\nmTOR is one of the main \"anabolic\" pathways, which is activated when you consume X amount of proteins. Maximum stimulation is ~30g of proteins every 3 hours or so.\n\nSo what I have done is that I train less, but more often. You do not actually need that much activity to maximize growth and this way I get as little breakdown and inflammation as possible.\n\nI recently read a study that to maximize strengthening of soft tissue, all you need is 10 mins of stimulation every 6 hours.\n\nI have been weight training since I was 14, so much like you when I went back to the gym after I developed PFS I did to much, to fast and ended up feeling like shit. Also I feel like rather than build myself up, my body deteriorated.\n\nI had to cut back from doing 60 min cardio sessions to only 30. I started with 3 times a week and kept track on my heart rate, keeping it below 130 BPM. \n\nThen I very slowly ramped it back up over many months, always listening to my body and cut back if I felt I overdid it. Today I can do 30 min 5 times a week. Lately I even felt I can do 45 min sometimes. Also I tolerate up to 150 BPM now. \n\nWith weights I did the same. Cut the weight and sets with half. I use way more machines to save my joints etc than I used to do. I also try to not do to many muscle groups in one session. \n\nObviously it is kind of rough not being able to workout as hard as before. But on the other hand I do not get fatigued and I can still see progress and that is better for both my physical and mental health. These days I feel extra energy instead, especially after cardio.\n\nMany people get muscle wasting with PFS, and one part is the disease itself. But many of us also stop moving around as much, and that will only add fuel to the fire. So my belief is that everyone need to find some kind of exercise they tolerate, even if it is only a 5 min walk to begin with.\n\nSorry for the wall of text. I hope it made some sense.\n\nTl;dr if you cannot do heavy squats, maybe a few sets of leg kick would work better. Thanks, man! Really appreciate it.\n\nSounds like a good idea to train less but more often. I will certainly try that.\n\nWould you say you are cured or do you still have symptoms ? It will not work anyways , .at least i can fantasize about a normal life instead of being completely bald and impotent. My head shape is extremely deformed in a rare way.my skull is not normal I still have symptoms. But most I can work around and my insomnia is gone which was the worst symptom for me to endure. \n\nBut the sexual issues I have not had much success with yet. Only some success with my erections. But basically zero feeling in my penis and low / non existent libido.\n\nEven if my dick will not work I can still enjoy life though. It would be great with sex, but even without it there is plenty of stuff to enjoy. People want to be damaged I dont have a choice . I have an extremely deformed skull , I am short and have  a pectus excavatum and scoliosis. Plus oeyronies disease. Nothing is normal on my body . And hair loss is just the Supreme nail on the coffin Who are you trying to look good for then? Dude fin does more than just ruin your sex life guys here have terrible mental side effects. I do not think you understand what you are doing maybe you reading too much tressless but trust me as you get older looks stop mattering For me , for my own fantasy of a better life , I already have mental side effect , I got a lisp and slow thought process , and more anxiety and depression Fuck I just took half a pill .5 mg once should I stop taking this? I am reading horrible things about it Me too. Saw Palmetto is a poison. Me2 - a Time tunnel and I would throw Finasterid out of the window. I would have s great future. Now I m bedridden. Saw palmetto is the devil itself because all think it s a natural compound and it is harmless. So your enjoy self harming. I took the first pill in a psychotic disorder state too", "Does everyone who uses fin goes through PFS?  No, but I think there are many underreported cases. No, PFS is quite rare. okay okay thanks man \nI have not noticed any major side effects from fin and I have been using it for more than 6 months\nUs it possible that I will get them? Less likely, but I have read people complaining about getting sides after longer than 6 months.

PFS sufferer here, if i had to do it again..i would get a hair transplant if i was balding before taking that poison.. Pfs includes a number of side effects such as erectile dysfunction I decided to stop after two weeks. I do not care if the risk is 1% or less than 1% or whatever it is. There is still a risk. Why would you take it? tell us more about your symptoms Erectile dysfunction. Zero Libido. For years now. No doctor could help me. It is a total nightmare! It is complete ED all the time ? Problem is that PFS sufferers do not report to the same platform.

I really do not know if I have pfs since it as been more then 3months since I stopped the drug, but If I get erections and libido is  high sometimes  and does it mean I do not have it? Bro if you get PFS you will 100% know it right away. I am my case I was pretty much bedridden for 6 months and going to work was horrific.\n\nI think you are just being paranoid.

I got little to no side effects from it, especially sides brought on by hormonal changes. I was on it for around a year. Now, I am wondering since I already have experience with a 5ar inhibitor (accutane) that it should be safe to take fin because I had no side effects from the accutane. \n\nThoughts?  I cannot even read that article it gives me so much anxiety Accutane is not (as far as we know) a 5-AR inhibitor. It is an analogue of vitamin A. \n\nHowever some people get symptoms similar to post-finasteride syndrome after Accutane (post-Accutane syndrome). Anecdotally, it seems if you have taken multiple drugs, like SSRIs, Accutane and then finasteride, it may increase the risk of PFS. Interrupting the medication or changing dose or frequency may also be a risk factor. \n\nThe one sure-fire way to avoid PFS is to never take finasteride.

I was at the top of my program in pre-med then 1 month into finasteride I got hit with brain fog and my memory was shot .

That  probably has nothing to do with it Vit. C has nothing to do with your crash.  Unless you were taking flavonoids from Saw Palmetto, you are experiencing the effects of finasteride.

Hey guys, \n\nTook Finasteride October 2017-March 2020, then switched to Dutasteride. Took Dutasteride for 1 year without any problems, then in March this year I started noticing a sharp decline in libido. It is very very low most of the time and borderline non existent sometimes. This is not really normal for me as I am a 24 year old otherwise healthy male. My sex drive is usually pretty high. I have been waiting for it to recover, and sometimes it is not that bad, but overall my libido is never near where it used to be. I have been trying not to panic, and I do not really have any other symptoms, (depression, but this is typical for me already) is this PFS? If so will I recover? \n\nWould greatly appreciate anyone\u2019s thoughts or insight on this, particularly if you took Dutasteride. Dut has a 6 month half life in your tissue, so expect things to get better within that timeframe. you can start to be concerned if things have not improved at that point. (Sorry in advance for the long reply)\nI (22M) was pretty much in the same boat as you man\u2026 took finasteride for 3 years and dutasteride 5mg twice a week for close to 2 years. I have been off all finasteride and dutasteride for 1 year this coming august. \n\nI stopped due to minor side effects such as decreased libido, weaker erections and weaker/watery ejaculate. I also found myself to be less tolerable of small inconveniences, tired and always moody (I was never diagnosed with having depression, therefore I will not say I was depressed). Everything still worked concerning sexual function, but never felt or worked the same as it once did. \n\nI can confirm that since stopping, certain factors and areas have since begun to rectify themselves such as my ejaculate volume has returned to what I believe as normal, I am happier\u2026 but sometimes I still struggle to maintain a decent erection and definitely have a lower libido.\n\nRecovery around PFS varies for different people, it can persist with some people for months to years\u2026 I am always open for a chat to help ease your mind or if you want someone to talk to about it. Keep your head held high, a positive mind set and forward thinking approach is the first key to recovery, it is easy to self diagnose and jump to conclusions therefore forcing you to think negatively. Ones mental psych and own thoughts contribute greatly to sexual performance and sexual drive. Yes, agree with this - I think it is important not to get lost in a cycle of catastrophizing thoughts. The side effects are frightening, but worrying about them non stop will cause your body even more stress. this 6 months half life. This means it will take years before most is washed out if true. Does not that by definition mean most will be washed out after 6 months?  Yeah correct. Bad wording from me. I mean \"all\" not most.", "Took this for 12 days, missed a couple days over the weekend because of a trip, but started getting anxiety. Any insight is helpful! I just started taking this about a week and a half ago through forhims. I was taking it every single night, but over this last weekend I did not take any with me as I was on a trip with a couple of friends. I do not know if it was the drinking, or the lack of sleep, but I had some anxiety one night, and decided to google \"finaseteride anxiety\" and discovered PFS which has been very scary, and anxiety inducing as well. I hope that I did not do too much damage to my system on this for 12 days. I have not had any other symptoms, if this is not TMI I will share that I have actually been a lot more hornier than usual, and have had more erections since being on it, which I thought was random because of the apparent side effects that I first read about. Thank you for any insight! It does not sound like you got PFS from your dose, but the anxiety and lowered libido are totally possible side effects of Finasteride. DHT is one of the hormones responsible for libido, so if you lower it, you may obviously lose some or lots of libido on top of erection issues. \n\nIn addition, DHT gets metabolized to neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone which are responsible for activating GABA receptors - the main neurotransmitter responsible for calmness. So if less of the neurosteroids are available, you may feel anxious as well. \n\nIf you are worried about the drug, for sure come off of it. Definitely worried and flushed the remainder of my prescription last night after reading this. I had 78/90 pills left and did not think the risks were worth it. I feel fine today, maybe a little cloudy but I am naturally an over thinker anyway, so I am going to see how I feel over the next couple of weeks. Happy to have this place and discovered what PFS is, whether or not I do have it. Good call! Personally, hair is not worth the health risk. Take care and hope everything goes well. I am glad you threw it away. Anecdotally, stopping and restarting may be a contributing factor to some men getting PFS. You will probably be fine though. Go in good health!", "My experience with finasteride I started finasteride back in early 2019. Used it for almost two years. It is now been five months since my last pill.\n\nI did experience a gradual onset of sides. Just like changes to the hair, they were subtle. \n\nMy sides (subjectively):\nReduced libido (mild)\nLower erection quality (mild)\nReduced sensitivity glans (moderate)\nReduced motivation, less feelings, more flat. This side was both positive and negative. I work as a lawyer and less feelings actually made it easier to do my job on a regular basis. It is strange. However, I started to loose interest for more complex cases, music and my overall creativity was reduced. \nI also felt a bit more fatigued. I had a similar feeling while taking accutane. \nI also got dry eyes. \n\n\nMy sides objectively:\nReduced body hair.\n\nSo I decided it quit the medication. I stopped cold turkey. \n\nInitially I felt fine. Morning erections returned within a month. Mood also seemed to improve. Then, 6-8 weeks after discontinuation my penis \u201cstopped working\u201d. I was not able to get it full erect and it felt like rubber. After one week I started experiencing pain on the right side of my penis. It went on for a few weeks. During that time, a small bulge and bend was developed on the right side of my penis. I went to an urologist. He had no good explanation. He was able the identify the bulge. It was not plaque, so it could not be peyronie\u2019s. The intense pain and numbness lasted for a few more weeks. Now, almost three months later my penis \u201cworks\u201d. Erections are mostly good but it still feels more numb compared to what it was like during treatment. \n\nI can somewhat cope with the sexual sides. However, my quality of sleep and overall energy levels have changed. \n\nI feel tired and fatigued all the time. It makes it hard to function in a demanding job. I just feel sick, like having the flu. \n\nI do not know what to do. I do not even know if my symptoms are related to finasteride. How much did you take regularly? 1mg Ed My experience is very similar. Took 1mg daily for 14 months. I knew something was up with this shit almost immediately, as the semen was like water and orgasms were not as satisfying. I dealt with it because I was maintaining my precious hair. Completely out of the blue one night, while attempting to have sex with my wife, my penis became flaccid and lacked feeling. My brain did not convert my sexual desires into a hard penis. I was stunned, and made it worse by trying force myself to get hard on-we all know how that turns out. I have been off about 4 months. I too have a weird pain in my penis, like an itch you cannot scratch. I do get morning erections, but not as frequently. My doctor says that is a good sign, that it at least shows the plumbing still works, but not the electric-in his words. Cialis and viagra do not fix the libido  which is still hampered. I do feel the twinge when I see my wife naked, but it is greatly reduced. Masturbating is a chore, a shit-ton of work just to get hard, and then immediately ejaculate the second that happens-WTF?\n\nI recently went to my urologist, and he said it should not be a problem because I am on testosterone therapy, injecting 100ml weekly for about 5 years-it was great but the finasteride fucked that up. There was a battle in my body: testosterone increasing dht and finasteride decreasing it. I maintained a low estradiol number by taking anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor. Anyway back to the urologist, I think he was puzzled, and thought I might have slight scar tissue in the top of my penis just behind the head-that is where the \u201citch\u201d is so he thinks it might be Peyronie\u2019s disease which I think is a bullshit diagnosis since I do not have a bend in my penis. To make matters worse, I was on 5mg of Cialis daily. This also did not help once finasteride was in the picture. His suggestion was to stop taking it daily and save it for sex, and to increase the dose to 20 mg. I have to go back in 6 weeks for a follow up. At this point if things do not improve he will inject my penis with a drug that creates an erection, and then he does a Doppler or sonogram-type scan to check for circulation issues-it sounds horrific but I will do it. \n\nThere is one thing I tried that worked, almost too well, and that was to inject 30ml of the peptide PT-141 (into the fat on my stomach) about 3 hours prior to sex. You get a hard on with no stimulation, and it is raging. You also regain sexual desire, and get super horny and feel like a man again. The downside is you will have a boner all night, almost to the point of pain. It does work the next day too, slightly less intense but still good. The other issue is your face gets red like a tomato for the first few hours. \n\nThat is my story. I hope it helps someone. I will post again after the next visit to the urologist in case anyone is interested. Good luck to all you guys, finasteride is poison and should be a banned substance.

Please be supportive, please do not bash me. But I have done a ton of research about this.

In castrated and adrenalectomized rats, treatment with 5\u03b1-DHT for 7 days restored erectile function to levels similar to that of control animals . Other studies demonstrated that 5\u03b1-DHT treatment in castrated rats improved the erectile response to electrical field stimulation (EFS) . Castration in male rats eliminates noncontact erections and this response was restored by 5\u03b1-DHT implantation . Noncontact erections in animals are thought to be similar to human psychogenic erections . Reduced erectile response and reflex erections were observed in castrated animals  and treatment of castrated animals with T or 5\u03b1-DHT restored the number of erectile responses and reflex erections. However, only 5\u03b1-DHT restored erectile responses and reflex erections, when animals were treated with daily injections of the 5\u03b1-R inhibitor MK-434 (1 mg/kg) together with T or 5\u03b1-DHT . These findings suggest that 5\u03b1-DHT plays a key physiological role in erectile physiology in the animal model and 5\u03b1-RIs treatment are likely to produce sexual adverse effect on the erectile response.\n\nYou guys this could be a huge fxcking slice of the pie.

I can almost barely never get hard unless but contact but I am focusing all of my energy into getting sight and other stimuli to cause semi spontaneous erections and it is been working to an extent and is completely cured when I take nitric oxide either in blended handfuls of spinach or concentrate pills.\n\nTo reverse methylation, it is all about the half life of the methylated dna, b6 and b12, you can look it up a bunch of b vitamins help with proper regulation.\n\nThe scary part is the tissue shrinkage which you all need to keep alive as long as possible for the hope to restore function. Fin shrinks the prostate through cellular death through withholding vital hormones. At most it shrinks it like 20%. So just think about that as your maximum prefin threshold lowering. I have not researched much on enlarging a prostate it happens to all men as they age so idk get older or something dxmn. I believe nitric oxide is part of the problem, but not the entire picture. For example, low libido is probably not be explained by low nitrous oxide. \n\nBelow is an article showing that the 5AR2 enzyme has altered methylation in cerebrospinal fluid in PFS patients. So yes, methylation of genes is a part of the problem as you mentioned. \n\n( I agree with you that the risks of finasteride are not worth it. I personally think that no man should take it for hair loss because the risks are not worth the potential benefits.\n\nIt is interesting that you mention nitric oxide because today I read this paper about COVID-19:\n\n&gt;Finally, the US FDA has recently granted expanded emergency use access for nitric oxide as a treatment for COVID-19. The use of nitric oxide was demonstrated to inhibit androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer. \n\nThe text is not public but the citation is below \\. A hypothesis is that persistent adverse effects of finasteride (PFS) result from impaired androgen receptor (AR) activity. So it is curious that nitric oxide, which apparently also inhibits AR activity \u2014 would help.\n\nThe methylation hypothesis is still being explored. We do not know the pathophysiology of PFS today. Since you are now off finasteride, but only very recently, may I suggest not obsessing about the research right now and just take good care of your health for 3-6 months.

No the watery semen stops after a while. I went through that process.i have taken this since October of last year. And my results up to now is great. Honestly the earlier you start the better the results. I would not worry too much about watery semen since it is a side effect that goes away after a while.everyone who takes this drug goes through the phase. Hope this helps. Feel free to ask questions. And the morning woods?", "Cognitive Effects Recovery Timeline? I took fin for about a year and stopped \\~5 weeks ago from sides I believe were from finasteride. I had stopped once during that year to determine if what I was feeling was related to the drug and I started to feel better so went back on at a lower dose.  I never really had any of the infamous sexual affects but felt a worsening \"brain fog\" as people describe it and eventually could not take it anymore as Im required to study long hours everyday as a medical student.  It got much worse the 1st week or 2 after discontinuing but has gotten a lot better since. Now I seem to be feeling more back to \"normal\" everyday but still not quite myself. I just wanted to ask anybody who thinks they dealt with a similar side effect how long it took to go away completely and about anything they found helpful? It seems like it is different for everyone, but if you do recover, you may find it lifts after 3\u20136 months following discontinuation. Following How you doin now? Still struggling. Some days I think im finally feel like im cured, but then some days like today im so \u201cfogged\u201d i feel like a zombie. I guess I am doing better but its been over 5 months since I touched a pill, jus want to feel normal again. Getting close to 6 months, really hope I can feel better. I do slightly every month I think but I also have these periods of \u201ccrashing\u201d Exercising or yoga may help. Have you tried those? Yea, ive been into working out my whole life.

Ive been in hell recently only Bc I think I re aggravated my issue last week which made shit a hell hole for me recently but I believe I was getting better. But basically I believe finasteride inadvertently gave me what is called \u201chard flaccid\u201d. Essentially Bc I was jacking off one too many times while my dick was half hard aka very limp Bc of this drug and i damaged/ strained muscles in my pelvis area, hence the penis pain, numbness disorders etc slight curvature. I encourage everyone who may have these symptoms to look into hard flaccid and look for romero post on it as he cured himself. I will post the link if I have it. GL and lmk. I went to er Saturday and did piss test and ultra sound. Everything came back 100% ok. Blood flow is great and no structural damage or anything, also no infections.

", "Gut microbiota theory: How I finally cured my PSSD  \"I\" here refers to /u/lastround360, not me Wrote a response (\n\nTLDR \u2013\u00a0gut issues are probably not the cause of PFS, but more of a downstream effect of it. At the same time, fixing undiagnosed gut issues are probably going to give you a big boost, since the gut is so central to your overall health. Tbh, I do not believe there is just one kind of PFS. I think this drug fucks with the body in so many potential ways that we are actually dealing with a variety of different syndromes stemming from finasteride usage. Because of this, what works for some will never work for others.\n\n(Just my opinion based on a reading of many different accounts of this disorder) We saw the cag repetitions in the androgen receptor gene was the link to what kind of side effects people experienced right? IE people with 24 CAG repetitions shared similar pfs subset of symptom, and people with 22 repetitions, etc.. Did you hear about this concept before?\n\nI do agree this is like an amalgamation of syndromes... For example I got hard flaccid, insomnia, tinnitus, brutal ED, loss of decisiveness in my actions, no more oily skin or earwax leading to dryness. I did not hear about that, I am curious to see the source. ", "Sleep issues Hi all, \n\nI was on the drug for a few weeks and had not done my due diligence about the side effects. After learning of them I decided to stop using the drug. About two weeks after cessation my sleep quality has taken a massive dive. Vivid dreams and shallow sleep, I wake up feeling incredibly groggy every morning, rarely feeling refreshed. Fortunately that is the extent of my symptoms. I am about 6 weeks off the drug and I was wondering if anyone has dealt with something similar and seen it resolve over time. Yeah i was having issues with that as well. It is improved dramatically. Glad to hear it. You are getting a full night\u2019s restful sleep these days? Free your mind. Do not think about it. When you are constantly thinking about syndroms it will come automatically. Yes I also had sleep problems the first weeks after the crash. But they stopped a couple of weeks after. I think it is estrogen related.", "ED caused by finasteride is in every situation?  I started taking finasteride but I am not in a relationship right now, so I cannot really tell if I have ED or not. But I get hard without a problem just by looking at porn, even when I really do not want to masturbate (tested that because I kind of feel that my libido lowered). What do you guys think? When you have ED is in every situation? Generally there is ED along with either symptoms if the side effects are persistent, but everyone is different, if you cannot think of another reason why your libido might be lower, you can always try tapering off and waiting a few weeks to see if it goes back up for comparison. I do not have a problem with my current libido, to be honest, I still feel the need to have sexual stimulation every one or two days. I am just afraid of being surprised by ED. A common thing is to lose sensitivity/sensation in your, you know. If it is still sensitive and you have libido, it does not sound like PFS (assuming you do not have other non-sexual symptoms). Pfs is when u lose it for life man everyone here is scared and stuff. If u experience slight decrease in libido it is normal and u can control it with other factors, increasing zinc, exercises including weight lifting body weight training increasing blood flow", "Finasteride Side Effect on Ocular Hi all,\n\nI have had blurred vision that has had no findings from 3 Optometries in my region. I did OCT twice to reinstate the claim of another doc that she has no finding on my eyes. According to my docs, my retina and optic nerves are all in good condition and it should not have any abnormalities. I start to recall when does this happen and what kind of drugs I have myself associate with at that point of time. And I did find out that it was Finasteride.\n\nTo those who are not familiar with Finasteride, it is a drug prescribed to suppress DHT production in your body therefore safe guarding your hair from baldness. I have been using Finasteride for a year before the symptoms of blurred vision and unusual floaters activity in my eyes. It stars to develop this issue after 6 months from the start of Finasteride prescription.\n\n(Personally i do not have any sexual side effects other than blurred vision)\n\nAge: 26 Male , Dosage: 0.5mg / day , Duration: a year\n\nI quit using Finasteride last month and have my eye vision recovered, but the unusual floaters activity still persists, although it has significantly reduced. I did try to reduce the dosage to 0.25mg / day 2 days ago, same, my blurred vision returned.\n\nA similar study has also been done, ( I am writing this to share my personal experience on this drug and hope to create awareness. Some people suffer the similar vision problem might not know what has happened and have no clue.\n\nA bigger sample space has to be done, so far a relevant study of Finasteride to Ocular side effect is inadequete.  Hope some expert might take some initiative regarding to this matter. I hope you will recover. There are 5AR type 2 receptors in your eye, and finasteride blocks those. This probably explains the symptoms.\n\nI hope the side effects go away for you! So you mean, 5AR is actually required for a normal eye function? Here is some research on finasteride and eye conditions:\n\n(\n\nA recent paper reported on macular abnormalities. Animal research has used finasteride to induce dry eye.\n\nI analyzed adverse events from FDA FAERS. Criteria: men 18\u201340 not taking other drugs or products, and using finasteride for hair loss only. Time period: 2012\u20132020. These eye events were reported to FDA:\n\n      14 Dry Eye \n   2 Eye Swelling \n   2 Eye Pain \n   2 Eye Disorder \n\nThis is a very small fraction of the data set (2.6% of cases included one of these adverse events), but the data is also not a perfect reflection of people's actual experience. I also experience this after discontinuation of the drug. I must admit it feels terrible. On the drug I had it, but now it persists. 6 weeks after taking my last pill. It is getting a little bit better, but still not where it was before. I experience stuttering or delay...  \nAnything to fix this? Shutting of light? I experienced light flickering I got high prolactin levels due to finasteride. It can cause vision problems among other things.\n\nMy Prolactin is still double the upper range, even though I have been off fin for almost 2 years by now.\n\nMight be good to get your levels tested. For OPTIMAL eye function, probably. If it was needed for baseline eye function, then thousands of finasteride users would be blind.\n\nTotally agree that more research needs to be done on the effects of 5AR inhibitors on specific cell types. This is not good, could be something that is not a cause for major concern but you should visit an ophthalmologist.", "Has anyone here recovered 100% fully recovered from SPECIFICALLY penis SENSETIVITY and erection quality sides? Really freaking out and its doing me no good, im hoping any other guys here can share their success stories.  \n\n\nSo I took a total of 3.5mg of Fin and stopped as soon as I noticed sides.\n\nIve been almost 3 weeks off fin now and most of the \"usual\" sides are gone. Mental clarity and energy levels are pretty good HOWEVER libido is not back to 100% pre fin whatsoever.\n\nSpecifically **my most annoying, worst (IMO) side effect, penis desensitivity.** It is still only about 50% of what it used to be. This side effect is really really bothering me. In addition , i am unable to get random easy erections (used to get them all the time), and whenever i do have an erection of any means, its short lasting.   \nI should point out, my general libido has relatively improved compared to my initial crash but still no where near the raw amount I got naturally pre Fin. Still get urges but certainly not as strong\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those wondering , yes, I did get a blood test. 600ng/dl normal test, 162 pmol/L Very high estrogen (looking to fix this as it could be a cause), Iron low, everything else normal.

A guy who recovered fully in 2012 laid out what he had done in 2013 and has been helping guys recover since then.\n\nThe guy used the name \u201cCDsnuts\u201d and had totally numb genitals with zero sensitivity and zero ability to feel orgasms or get erections, and he has been 100% recovered since 2012.\n\nExpect it to take 1 - 2 years if you dedicate yourself to extremely strict compliance with the protocol, or 5+ years if you are not strict about it. what is this protocol? It is listed on the website \n\nIt involves many different things, it is not one or two sentences that could be posted in a Reddit comment. Tongkat ali is great for libido and testosterone. This video talks about it  I give the guy credit. Its a very detailed comprehensive list of multiple different ways and means to increase your overall T, mood, energy, sleep etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever the issue is its too general and too many things to do overall a long period of time. I know i got to be patient but was kind of looking for the best immediate / short term fixes to my specific fin sides.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough I will still get in the habit doing all/most of the things he mentioned Which things do you think you will skip?\n\nPersonally I have not heard of any quick fixes for this unless you are still in the initial 6 month window of quitting where you might make a full recovery gradually over those 6 months. There are no immediate fixes for PFS. I did this protocol and got better, but penis sensitivity and libido were the slowest symptom to resolve themselves. The reason it is so general is because you got to fix everything in order to fix anything in a way. I have a chat going with others doing the protocol if you want in PM me. Hey man how long did libido and sensitivity take to fully come back after quitting and what should I do to help recover please ?? I would say I was fully recovered after about 18 months but after about 7-8 I was living a normal sex life. That was doing CDNuts protocol. Libido takes the longest to come back and along with mental side effects can be the hardest to fix. I can add you to the group chat if you want.

What dosage will you use?\n\nI am very interested in your trial because I have been thinking about doing it myself but have not had the time / money as of yet.\n\nGood luck!! Idk yet, I am still researching and figuring it out as of now. thx!! The most common regime is intramuscular injections of 5 ml once daily, when it is used for congitive improvement for example.   \nIt would be definitely interesting to read your update on the sensations after the treament. Yeah some people do 5ml once daily for a month or so and then use smaller maintenance doses weekly (2ml 2-3 per week). I ordered the 2ml ampoules, so I will try 2ml 3-4 times per week to start with as it can cause brain fog due to neurogenesis and I cannot afford to experiment with too much brain fog as I work full time on the week. If I do not see enough effects I will try the 5ml ampoules. I read someone at raypeat forum mentioning that he reverse his pfs problems with cere.I make my research  last month about cere,looks promising,they key behind the success is the neurotrophic factors,i cannot figure out the way neurosteroids and brain neurons interact each other,but from my little understanding is that hormones have anti inflammatory action,cere via neurons repair bring some kind of homeostasis to neurons.I am eager to hear your testimony after you run the first cycle.Beware the form of cere must come in form of  intramuscular injection not nasal spray,nasal spray have a lot of side effects. Yeah Cerebro increases BDNF which increases brain plasticity. Increasing brain plasticity reduces symptoms of anxiety, depression and can help with memory issues caused by finasteride.

Reading posts about positive outcomes has been a boon to my mood. Hoping to continue that chain of positivity.\n\n\\---\n\n**Short history:**\n\nI started taking 1mg fin everyday, starting on 27th Sept 2020. Started seeing mental side effects like anxiety and depression after \\~2months. Chalked it all up to relocation during COVID/winter blues. Got severe depression, brain fog, memory-loss, appetite-loss, and fatigue in Feb 2021. Was able to get and maintain erections but it felt hollow. Doctors said it is not because of fin and gave me anti-depressants ( of course :( ).  \n\n\nGave up on fin on 15th March 2021, did not take anti-depressants, and buzzed my hair.  \n\n\n**Journey of recovery :**\n\nI started  taking care of my body in simple ways - ways that have already been covered by numerous posts in this group. Regardless, I will mention what worked for me:\n\n1. Vitamins A, B(s), and D3 - dosage decreased with time\n2. Smoothie everyday - whole bunch of fruits, milk, oats, flax/chia seed, peanut butter\n3. Increased intake of fruits and veggies in general to balance micro-nutrients\n4. Cannot emphasize enough on how instrumental **exercise** has been to my mental and physical recovery. I started light-med cardio every alternate day after I stopped fin. I do some weight training as well, However, I feel cardio is more effective in improving my mood and increasing my appetite. \n5. No fin :)\n\nI am not a doctor so whatever I said about recovery - please consult someone more knowledgeable about what regimen would be optimal.\n\nSymptoms improved in April-May. Had a mild recurrence of depression/brain fog/fatigue in June, which passed in a week. Pushed myself to maintain my routine through that week.\n\n**Current status:**\n\nAlmost fully recovered :D\n\nMentally at a very good place. Just have occasional brain fogs when the work stress is high. Body is in a better shape. Morning wood almost everyday. Erections also feel more \"alive\".\n\n\\---\n\nTo end, I have just one advice: YOU need to take steps to take care of yourself. A pill may have messed up your mind/body, but no one other than you can take necessary action to mitigate the damage done. You can find help/support/motivation here or from your family/friends. Leverage that to start your journey in the right direction.\n\nApologies for the wordy post. Positive posts boosted my mental health a lot. For people in the same boat as me, I hope this post helps you.   \nAlso, thanks to all who pinged me. I appreciate it a lot. Glad you are doing well. Glad you are doing better! You story sounds similar to the situation I am in rn. I started Fin, did not notice anything the first month, and then my stomach started hurting in the mornings. I would not be hungry like I used to be, so it is interesting you mentioned appetite loss. I am going to post a larger thread of all of my symptoms, as well as where I am at currently. I 2nd the cardio. Seems to be crucial for my mental health, but not much for my penis/sexual symptoms as of yet. So it basically proves that pfs is a complete anecdote? If you had epigenetic changes in ur body, no amount of fruit or vegies in a span of few months would revert those, biologically impossible. Thank you for providing more evidence, even if n=1, very helpful how much has your erections improved? are you back to 100% pre fin levels?\n\n(this is my last remaining side effect after 1 year of quitting fin)", "I told a friend of PFS.

For 5 or 6 days now my junk has just stopped.. its as if its asleep or dead .. what is surprising is that this just happened overnight almost and now i cant do anything but think about it.\nFor anyone who has had these symptoms did you notice a gradual or instant onset and was it the same for the recovery? \n\nIts like one day i went asleep and woke up a different man. Give it three to six months. Some men see recovery in this timeframe. Wishing you a full recovery.\n\nI am not a doctor (but doctors do not understand the syndrome either!). Try to avoid stress (really hard to do when you are worried about your junk not working, I know), get good sleep, and eat as healthy as you can. Consider dropping caffeine and alcohol for a while. Nonstop porn viewing is not great for relaxation, so take some time off that too.\n\nLike the other poster said, you will probably be fine in 1-3 months. I have had the same thing this week..I took it twice in one day I believe by accident..the next day my junk was limp while mistreating went limp and semen came out clumpy..after stopping the drug for 3 days..symptoms have all gotten way worse..totally limp..no energy..sore joints and muscles..sore nipples..I do not believe this..with all these symptoms im almost certain it will turn to pfs..because it just happened all in one day and it was the day I mightve took 2 milligrams..also libido is getting worse no feeling whatsoever at this point..I really do not know what to do..or if there is anything I could do to prevent this from being a lifetime problem because if it is ill probably just off myself over time All we can do is keep the faith. If its any comfort i was able to use Viagra to have sex since then but was never truly confident it was the best erection of that it would last - the mental struggle once you have taken a blow like this is difficult to overcome.\n\nMy symptoms are that my junk is dead. Its like an elastic band is attached to my body and just dangling there. Seeing hot women i can appreciate a nice ass or figure and whereas before id have felt something mentally in terms of their attractiveness now its just like looking at an inanimate object.. i think its like chemical castration.. \n\nWe can only hope that, given time, things will improve but, like you, given the sudden onset of symptoms and not really seeing many recovery stories from out positions then its going to be a bumpy ride.\n\nKeep the faith and fingers crossed! Just an update on things - about day 8-9. I have been able to get an erection one night with Viagra  (i took 75mg). The next morning had some weak morning wood..\nLater that day i was able to get an erection for oral with my gf at about 70-80% and enough to ejaculate without any Viagra.. but it would not have lasted or been good enough for sex. I am also not as horny in general which is frustrating but i am feeling better that at this stage there are still workable solutions to a sex life .. not ideal but at this stage i will take what i can get.

Has anyone tried it and reacted in a bad way? I am really skeptical when anyone says they got PFS from SP. The thing about finasteride is its completely synthetic - the only place finasteride exists in the universe is in the pills that Merck made ... so there is absolutely no way our bodies have any knowledge about how to deal with the substance because it is so alien. I am not an expert on SP but it is a supplement that has natural sources and is not made in a lab ... I have to believe our bodies can handle any naturally sourced material much better. But since you have takin Fin in the past, that might complicate things ... so do not try it would be my advice. Like finasteride and dutasteride, saw palmetto has been used to treat prostate conditions. See: (\n\nIt may act as a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (same mechanism as finasteride).\n\nThis paper calls saw palmetto (or *Serenoa repens*) a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor:\n\n( I think the danger is that people pop supplements as needed, this could throw you are system out of wack, you do not want 5ar going up and down, up and down, that will throw you out of wack. But fin is a different animal it is made by satan, it crosses the blood brain barrier and turns you into a hellish version of yourself. There are lots of anecdotal reports of PFS from saw palmetto. Yes - there are many many reports of people developing PFS from saw palmetto It is in your head. It is strange to develop PFS from SP. Perhaps hit the gym and lift some weights. It will make a difference to your mental state There have been reports of SP causing PFS. It is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor.

I do not think so crosses the blood brain barrier ... Correct me if I am wrong ... And that is the big problem with fin *anectodal reports You should not be so surprised.  Saw palmetto is a natural 5ar enzyme.  Everyone is genetics are a bit different in how they respond.  Plenty of guys on Swole that are their for saw Palmetto .  That is an incomplete  statement.....there are plants in nature where if you eat the wrong leave, you DIE.

The first few months after starting the treatment I remember  having terrible sexual side effects but i pushed through and tolerated  them because at the time, giving up on my hair was not an option no  matter how bad the side effects were. Kept taking it for about 3 years  and got used to the side effects. As time went on, i started noticing  weird things happening to me but never put it down to finasteride  because i was in denial and could not afford to stop it. It started with  no more morning wood, then weaker erections that worsened as time went  on, then lower mood and energy, brain fog and concentration issues that  progressed into a  feeling of emptiness and  like nothing had meaning  anymore, went to family funerals and one of my best friend dying from  cancer funeral and felt absolutely nothing. It felt like something  chemical was OFF in me but could not put it down to finasteride (I  remember telling myself: \"Side effects are only 2% so what are the  chances it could be the fin\") and kept taking it. Tried many different  diets exercise regimes and supplements to fix myself but nothing  helped/worked.\n\nWhen I was about 22  almost 23 I took a month off the fin by accident because i needed to  renew my prescription. In that month i member feeling so much better,  slept like a baby, had so much more energy and drive for life, felt like  a young man again. Morning wood came back and that primal instinct to  chase girls came back, i felt ecstatic. 6 months later i felt even  better but my hair was falling out like hell. I somehow convinced myself  that i would give the finasteride another shot but at lower  doses/frequency/ topical (Big mistake!). went back on fin on and off and  experimenting from 23yo to 24yo. It seemed like the side effects hit  even harder than the first time I used it and every time i tried  lowering the dose/ frequency. Also side effects kicked in sooner/harder  and lasted longer after stopping. I was not worried too much about  permanent side effects because i did not know anything about PFS or  permanent side effects so i was positive that things would go back to  normal. Now here i am almost a year later and while i feel much better  than i was when i was on finasteride i still have lingering side effects  that i do not know if they will ever go away. Mainly weaker erections  and the other common PFS symptoms are still present and somewhat  improving so i stay positive and move on in my life. Wow what a journey,  hair loss is truly one heck of journey, in the end nobody cares, wish  someone would have told that earlier, we live and learn. Hello, thanks alot for sharing. This is highly valuable. As you say that you have improved alot after your second finasteride side effect episode, Where would you say you are now mentally?   \nIm asking because i can totally relate with the low mood, energy, emptyness and lethargy. How do you feel psychologically and mentally, and how would you compare that with your 'second crash'?   \nAlso, did you supplement anything? And, given that finasteride is now no longer an option, to what extend is hair loss still bothering you now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks alot! I feel much better mentally and energy wise (prob close to 100%), motivation and drive also feel pretty good (maybe 70%), sexually/ libido (\\~60%).  Thing is, recovery is not as linear as I would wish it would be, like the first time i stopped it. Sometimes things get worse or better but in general i feel much better. Yes I do take supplements that help, made a ( about it if you are interested. For the hair loss, yeah of course it still sucks, but i do not dwell on it anymore, I joke about it with people and my friends(do not take myself too seriously about it anymore), i still get fancy haircuts once a month and use minoxidil. After going through what i went through there is no way in hell this stuff is even close to worth it for me. (TMI I also started watching some old RSD (Real Social Dynamics) stuff and getting back in the dating game, really good stuff if you are interested, really helped me get over the \"going bald = game over with girls\" BS.)\n\nEdit: Still open to try a hair system if it ends up looking really bad buzzed/shaved, but for the meanwhile i do not care about my diffuse thinning balding haircut + beard. I also dress better and take better care of my hygiene. Two really important things when meeting women just so you know. :) Why was topical fin a big mistake? Did you still get sides and were they as bad as oral sides ? Was not just topical fin exclusively that was a big mistake, it was the whole starting and stopping cold turkey and experimenting that fucked me up bad. It is like my body could not handle it anymore. I can identify with the anecdote about the funeral. I have had similar experiences of going to funerals and feeling nothing. Very strange and distressing. How can you measure your libido? How can you evaluate your baseline? The sexual desire and potency differs massively between ages 19 and 24, with or without finasteride. Of you use the time when you quit as a baseline, it is also stupid, because you free teatosterone jumped back up and obviously you got a surge of sexual desire. It is absolutely possible to get reduction of libido on the drug, but your explanation and evaluation of lastling side effects is completely unteliable and anecdotal. Well my libido now is WAY better than what it was when in my early 20s on fin. I have more libido and desire now than when I was 19, it is laughable how bad my libido was on fin. Yeah you are right it is completely subjective and you cannot really measure it. It is not just the libido it is also erectile dysfunction and neurological sides that are also better now. U did not fully understand what I said. The sides that you experienced while on finasteride are fully possible and I believe every single person who says they had lower libido while taking fin. However, when you say you recovered 60% after a year of the drug being out of the body, that is completely anecdotal. 60% of what? Of your libido before finasteride? If that is how you measure, then it is severely flawed. Even if you never took finasteride, you would never have the same libido as the one u had at 19, unless u juice or were severely obese/ill while 19. Sorry if I was not clear enough , I meant overall sexual function, libido rn is pretty good but like \nwhen you factor erection quality and other stuff in the sexual department I am roughly estimating what I would consider about 60% recovered overall compared to the first time I stopped it and recovered almost to what I would consider 100% after 6 months of stopping. My baseline is the recovery I had when I stopped for 6 months, the first time I stopped it when I was 23yo. Look dude might be the free T spike or other things and yes this is anecdotal, I am just happy this stuff is out of me and I feel better as time goes on. I relate to your story since we seem to be the same age.\n\nI only used Fin one period though (9-10 months) but other than that your story match pretty much with mine.\n\nI would be wary of the Minox though, it does work as an anti androgen much like Fin. Many people get similar sides from Minox as others get from Fin.", "Well done guys, congratulations. Hope this will speed up the development of treatment  Why do you think it will speed up the development of a treatment? I hope they will force Merck to run new clinical trials and to do a research of what does finasteride damages and why the body is not able to recover after withdrawal", "Can this help solve PFS?? ", "Weird feel down there It is been roughly 7 months since I took my last pill of finasteride. I battled with many many sides ever since. Glad i am somewhat functional now again. I was wondering if someone else has the same persistent sides and if they got better over time. My libido is much lower than before, my dick does not erect as fast how it used to be and the skin of my dick feels weird, like stretchy rubber or something. Anybody also experienced this?", "Pfs like symptoms return 6 months after quitting?!? I used fin for about 9 months.

Are you on any other hair loss treatments? How long has this second wave of sides last so far? I am currently on nothing. It is been going for a few weeks. Nothing really crazy. \nI can masturbate and reach climax but my erection will just fade during sex.\nRecently it started during masturbation once and that kind of freaked me out.\n\nIt does not feel as intense symptom-wise but it is definitely disturbing.

Quit a month ago and still experiencing some side effects About 3 months ( Did you have issues with libido ?", "Felt Anxious and Depressed after 2-3 weeks on Finastride Hey guys, posting this here as I had a serious side effect from use short-term use of Finastride.  \n\n\nLong story short, I got an offer from Keeps about a month ago to try their program for 50% off. While I have pretty serious hair recession, I honestly had learned to live with it and keep my hair cut short. Anyway, since I got the 50% off offer, I figured I would give it a shot for 3-6 months to see what happened.\n\nWell, what happened was that after about 2-3 weeks of use, I suddenly got these serious mental side effects. \n\nThe past  week or so I have been having bouts of mild anxiety and feeling quite depressed for no reason. I could not figure out what the hell was causing it, as my life is going quite well, and I am happy and  not overly stressed about anything. Still, I could not shake it for about 3 days or so.  \n\n\nOne day just as I was about to pop the next Finastride pill, I suddenly wondered if it could be the medication. I google 'does finasteride cause depression' and low and behold found several articles about it, including this one:\n\n(  \n\n\nAs soon as I read these studies, I decided to stop. It took a day or so for the mood to shift, but now, after not consuming for 2 days I  feel a lot better. I am convinced finastride is what caused the feelings of anxiety and depression. It literally came out of nowhere. \n\nI messaged the Keeps doctors to let them know I am done with the drug. I will go bald if I have to... I am not living life feeling like shit. Estrogen dominance. Go get a blood test and find out what levels are like. Most likely you will need to take some aromatise inhibitors. The online clinics are fucking cancer. I am  glad you have recovered though! Yeah man, Finasteride pretty heavily reduces neurosteroids in the brain, an important one being allopregnanlone, which has both anti-anxiety and anti-depressant qualities. Glad to hear you feel better now. Look more into Post Finasteride Syndrome, sometimes people are not so lucky and these effects are permanent. Definitely avoid hairloss drugs and 5ar inhibitors (even natural ones like saw palmetto) in the future. Trust me, health is infinitely times more important than hair. Best wishes Thanks man! It is crazy how they just prescribed it without so much as a warning! Estrogen dominance or not I am not touching that shit again! Yep 100% agree. I am just \u2018lucky\u2019 it happened after only 3 weeks so I could stop. I am already feeling much better on the 3rd day so know this was the cause. Here is a study that just came out:\n\nRisk of Depression Associated With Finasteride Treatment. Pompili M, Magistri C, Maddalena S, Mellini C, Persechino S, Baldessarini RJ.

Many people have made themselves worse by manipulating hormones and trying random supplements. Your endocrine system is in a fragile state - get good sleep, de-stress, eat well, and do moderate exercise, and you should be out of it soon. Thank you! Yes that is the plan :) I am not going to be adding any other drugs into my system. Just good old normal healthy lifestyle like you suggested. Crazy huh? I had no idea this was a risk before starting. So glad it happened quickly and I am already getting out of it. I am not going to read anyone else's post here but I stopped 5mg daily Easter Sunday for my prostate issue along with a daily of cials that I kept taking, I got so depressed the last few weeks by Easter I could barely leave my house and I am an outgoing man. I would rather them go up my penis with a baseball bat and ream me out than take that again. ALSO forgot the  emotional stuff that goes with this drug. Day 4 for me off it Hoping you feel better soon man! I am already feeling much less down after three days off the 1mg Finasteride. I have been exercising and getting some sun each day and spending time with friends and family to keep spirits up. Hope you feel better and please reach out to me via DM if you need someone to talk to \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb People have fucked themselves up with AIs too.

My skin is usually pretty good, I have a good skincare regimen but now it is terrible. My face has not been this bad since high school and nothing is working it just keeps getting worse. Does anyone have any solutions other than stopping it? Stop taking it and flush the rest of your supply . Enjoy your life. Fin ruined my skin, gave me awful hormonal acne and my blood tests showed it raised my estrogen levels a lot Finasteride made my skin extremely dry and have accelerated all aging signs on my face. Not a day goes by where I do not regret taking it. Just stop it.. Stop taking it Benzyl peroxide cream and a good facial moisturizer should help with the skin issues. maybe dont flush into water please, try drop off at a pharmacy or hospital saying its chemical waste and to dispose of it safely Then logically you should adopt a good skin care routine to mitigate damage.

Has anyone with brain fog or cognitive side effects tried using Magnesium  L-threonate? Thinking about trying it out bc things just are not getting better and seems like this supplement may restore cognitive functions One supplement is unlikely to do much on its own. But as part of a regimen of good sleep, exercise, and varied \"real food\" nutrition, it can give you an extra edge.\n\nI would also look into non-pharmaceutical interventions that are used for people with brain injuries, like football players - \n\nPersonally, I had success combatting brain fog using water fasting and a methylation protocol. (6S-5-MTHF, B12, sam-e, potassium, TMG).\n\nThere is a supplement called nitric balance which can help with vascular brain health -  - I felt like it helped a bit. Ok thanks I will take a look My experience, if you are feeling relatively fine throughout the day and you are like oh, I wish I just had a little more motivation, a little more focus then it is okay to add supps/noots.\n\nIf you are like I feel very fatigued, I feel brain fog most  of the day and such, your answer is not on these. You will probably just get frustrated and waste your money. Fix your diet and check your hormones. Wait for a month and check again. When you get to the stage above, add in supps.\n\n\n\n Some doctors recommend supplementing 2000 mg of Magnesium to combat depression. That is great, until I realised that Magnesium L-Threonate is more effective in penetrating the BBB (Blood, Brain, Barrier). This was measured through Magnesium levels in the cerebral spinal fluid.

I also workout 6 days a week and maintain a very healthy diet so I do not think that is the issue. At this point I am just desperate and want to try something new for 2weeks-month to see if there is any benefit Do you feel it helped you significantly? And do you have pfs symptoms? Keep in mind \"Normal hormone levels\" is relative.\n\nKeep in mind \"healthy diet\" is even more relative.\n\nSure, you still need to get shit done, and soon. Use whatever (healthy) noots/supps you need to get through. Just do not forget you still very likely have a root cause to fix. Been there and I tell you there are not no supplement that will change what you are describing sustainably. You are 100% right. Just frustrating when cognitive abilities are significantly lower with no clear picture of the root cause or solution while having to deal with things like school on a daily basis. Feel you man, good luck on your journey! Appreciate it Try potentially focusing on gut related health.

Long story short, I took Saw palmetto topically once for 4 hours and next day full ED, testicular pain, prostate pain, loss of libido and extreme pain while urinating.\n\nI have severe ups and downs in the last 4 weeks and tap on wood my ED has recovered fully. I get full erections in the morning and night and whenever iam keen. My testicle pain has gone away but i still have pain while ejaculating (not as bad as before) and urinating. and still issues sitting down (my bum hurts-i suspect due to prostate issues).\n\nI have checked my testosterone and its risen quite a bit (from 23.8 ng/mol on week 1 to 34.7 ng/mol on week 5).\n\nNow I do have pain on chest, specifically burning sensation. I think this is due to high oestrogen caused by High testosterone aromatizing to estrogen(potential gyno) (although my estradiol isnt very high 110pmol/L (&lt;200pmol/L)).\n\nI have few questions for you guys and before that I really want to thank earth-like planet, for providing reassurance and calming me down when i was having bit of a panic attack with the symptoms.\n\nThe questions are:\n\n1. My hair fall has stopped, i suspect my DHT has not recovered?\n2. My body is making large amount of testosterone to account for loss of DHT and so there is a large possibility of an endocrine crash coming my way?\n3. How do I get my DHT restarted? Does this mean its failed forever?\n\nThanks again team.   For me before my crash, I felt this strange feeling of forced shock all the time.

I took two weeks worth of finasteride around three months ago. During the second week I lost my ability to sleep, had basically water as semen, testicular pain, and was having severe anxiety. I quit taking it immediately. Things got worse for a few weeks and I lost my ability to get erect, there was no connection between my mind and my genitals, and there was chronic pain in my penis shaft. \n\nAll these symptoms lasted for a few months, but luckily I regained my erections after about a month. The insomnia got worse, and I am medicated for it now with the antidepressant/seep aid trazodone. \n\nI cannot rest and it is ruining me. I sleep only 4-5 hours a night every night now and it is very light not and not restful. I used to feel like shit if I got only 6. I am in grad school and can barely function. I cannot live like this. I have been getting panic attacks, extreme depressive episodes and am now dealing with constant consuming thoughts of suicide. I am slow, forgetful, tired, depressed, and anxious now. \n\nStrangely my mind has been getting worse as the sexual side effects have gotten better. I was a personal trainer so I eat healthy, supplement, and exercise well. I do not know what more I can do. I am pretty lost and need some advice. I cannot believe this drug is legal. Wishing you the best. Things are going to get better, it is just a matter of time I was were you were 18 months ago and I can tell you it will get better the body just needs time to recalibrate as your hormones have been scrambled from this nasty drug\u2026. I would suggest getting some blood work done to check your estrogen, total T and free testosterone and also prolactin and SHBG please stay strong, we have to believe it is going to get better You are already on the Finasterid Syndrom subreddit. But functional sexuality you have a good chance to improve with the other sides. You should go to an endicronologist to get your estrogen levels checked fin tends to fuck up that equilibrium wich is what tends to cause the problems and if that is fine go check outdereks article on how to treat it the unnatural way Dereks article is crap and not backed by any science. \n\nI have perfect hormone values and \"ratios\", still PFS. sorry to hear....\n\nI hope you can get better\n\nYou should post your story in r/tressless to warn young kids that are brainwashed by the risk denying finasteride cult  It got better for me around 8-9 months.\n\nTough through it man. It will get better.  I know how horrific it feels to never be calm and always be in a state of panic; but it slowly gets better in waves.\n\nPM me if you ever need to talk about it. Almost my errections are getting harder and I am getting regular morning wood plus the brain and dick connection is coming back Damn really ? What did your estrogen come oit as ? And did you try progesterone ? I myself am experiencing pfs right now its been a month and my libido seems to be either fully normal or wavering along with the soft hard problem Holy shit.\n\nI have taken 12 tablets - these side effects sound fucking serious.\n\nI have notice my sleep has been really bad as you mention since I started. Think I will be stopping this treatment. 22 pg/mL and it was a sensitive method. My T was 650 ng/dL so very close to the 5% ratio he is taking about. \n\nNo I did not try progesterone because my value is already high normal. Maybe you should look more into the progesterone thing and your est seems a little on the low side what are your sides and have you ever tough of roiding ?  Yeah agree my E2 is borderline low. And I have noticed doing stuff that lowers it make me worse.\n\nNo.1 side is 99.9% loss of penis sensitivity and severe insomnia. \n\nBut I also have anhedonia, loss of libido, lost my wit, some muscle wasting, less sweating, almost non-existent earwax, fat/weight gain, cannot get a pump at the gym and a few other symptoms.\n\n\"Good things\" is that my hair stopped falling out and I have 0 anxiety, while before I could get slight anxiety before meeting a new person etc. Now nothing, but I do not really enjoy other people (or anything) anymore. So while it is nice, I do not put it into a lot of use.\n\nI have though about trying to mess with my hormones, but it is a shot in the dark. It is likely PFS is on the receptor level and we have no way to test for it.\n\nAlso I am reluctant to inject myself with underground steroids and it is not very easy to get pharma grade in Europe.\n\nEdit: and skin changes (wrinkly + loose skin). If i ware younid give steroids a chance maube the ammount of test you can naturally prodice isnt enough to do anything to your desensitized receptors, another thing you could do is give tribulus a shot i heard that increases receptor size but only certain brands work ive heard about it om the peopecia help forum, another thing would be to try to live as healthy as possible i myself am cirrently doong int fasting ans lifting 3 times a week and i think that plays a good part in recovering since it boosts insulin health and many other hormones, while not as much as i could its better than nothing ans i think i have improoved since when i first quit, i stoll get soft hards but my libido seems to be back to normal and i even got moening wood today the only problem is crashing every few days wich lasts 4 days max, what other things have you tried ? I took Dustasteride for only a week and it gave me all the mental and sexual sides within 2 weeks of stopping it\u2026. The improvements starting happening for me around the 8-12 month mark after stopping Yup likely you will be fine in fin, but the small chance of these horrible sides is not worth it just for something is as small as hairloss.  Libido has returned and I am definetly way better than I was Thank you all for the support, really glad we have forums to connect on like this. Really helps to know others have experienced the same side effects.  I was really low when I posted it. Having a better day today, thank the lord for antidepressants. I am going to keep everyone posted on my recovery timeframe, or how I learn to cope. Hopefully it helps some of you at some point. Thanks man for the response. Interesting that you have not fully recovered sexually. I have been focusing on getting a lot of fat in my diet, eggs, butter, extra virgin olive oil, coconut\u2026 basically all the ones shown to increase testosterone. Also take l-carnitine-l-tartrate to protect and up-regulate testosterone receptors, along with methylated b vitamins. I cannot say for sure, but maybe that played a role in my sexual function returning. Thanks man, hopefully I will have a good recovery story in a few months. Glad you are feeling better. I have been taking all the good fats too and that has helped, how many mgs of L cartinate are you taking ? 2 grams, only the l-tartrate form has been shown to improve androgen receptors. Also a comment on the methylated B vitamins. My reasoning for taking them is to support my body\u2019s methylation processes, hopefully triggering proper epigenetic re-adaptations to an androgenic environment. Do you take just the 2mg daily of l cartinate ? How do you feel on it ? Yes 2 grams daily. When I started it my dick pain improved. I think it may have helped with erections. Any side effects from taking it ? None. Cool will try that out Hey man, I did topical dutasteride, 1mg on scalp for 2 weeks total exposure was 2mg and I stopped using it. I was on trt and still my erection was fully 0% stiff, as in I had a floppy orgasm. This was in May, and I am still to this day experiencjng hard flaccids, long flaccids, disconnected genitals from my mind, weak erections. My symptoms initially started as prostatitis,  burning urine, perenium pain, penile pain, urine issues... Most of those are gone except for weak stream, ED and loss of mind penis connection. Also I have the overextended long flaccids which feel very tight inside and uncomfortable. Did you have these symptoms as well, and what have you done to feel some recovery? I almost forget what my old penis feels like, but I know it was not dulled like this.. I cannot feel my erections like before they used to pulse and throb and be pleasurable, and could poke through my jeans.. Now I do not feel any of that and can barely move silk shorts, that is how weak my erection /rigidity mechanics are now....\n\nDoes it get better man? I am trying everything to get better, eating healthy, cardio, pelvic floor stretches, sleeping... Supplements.. I. Desperate, will try hcg since some have been helped by it. What did you do, or is time the only answer?\n\nThank you man Hey bud what supplements are you taking ? Lately trying to fix dopamine disregulation, so bromantane, royal jelly. Also cistanche, tongkat ali.. Cialis 5mg, citrulline... I do not really feel anything moving the needle though, ED persists. It is like the tissue in my penis is damaged from the dut... Does not inflate or get rigid like it used to before dut or the blood flow is not being increased enough For me it was a time thing, I have been having daily doses of Vitamin b, c, d and 15mg zinc at night also lifting weights helps boost the testosterone\u2026. You could try taking 2g L cartinine Tartare at night to upregulate the androgen receptors which will help the testosterone receptors\u2026. I am getting regular woods (random and morning) plus the brain dick connection is back the only thing missing from 100% recovery is constient hard errections Ok good to hear. I do take 2-3g l-carnitine per day now. I heard this syndrome fucked our androgen receptor in the body so do you think it can be repaired with this?\n\nDid you have painful and weak erections at the peak of your pfs symptoms? I have weak morning erections that I can bend half way easily.. No rigidity. Its like an engorged long flaccid penis.. Did you experience those symptoms?\n It is good to hear you are doing a lot better now, I hope to be where you are soon. I pray my penile rigidity can recover. Yeah l cartinate is perfect for up regulation of the androgen receptors\u2026 never had painful errections but weak errections at the peak of PFS. My errections now I would only be able to fold a quarter if that\u2026. Sexual side effects are the last thing to come back online from PFS\u2026 some people can recover anywhere from 4 weeks to 2-3 years but the human body has a way of healing unfortunately it is a marathon not a sprint Not sure what your test levels are like but I def would run some bloods. Some people with PFS will advise to sit and wait but if I were you I would look at treatments ASAP. It is all fun and games sitting waiting for improvements until you start looking like Frankenstein Beep. Boop. I am a robot.\nHere is a copy of \n\n###(\n\nWas I a good bot? | ( | ( I am getting blood work tomorrow. I suspect my androgen profile is fine because my sex drive has recovered. Pretty sure it is my neurosteroid levels or receptors. I went to a psychiatrist for my sleep and she said she sees bad reactions and brain damage from supposedly safe drugs all the time. They did a full psychological evaluation and believe that this was drug induced. \n\nMany drugs are considered safe until the day they are not. Good plan. How long were you on Fin? Fuck off", "Minoxidil and saw palmetto Hi everyone.\nI have been taking minoxidil and saw palmetto. I started taking saw palmetto and no adverse side affects. This week I used 5% minoxidil twice and I am experiencing vomiting, no energy, anxiety and overall feel not myself.\n\nDoes minoxidil cause the same side affects as finasteride (PFS)?\n\nOr is this just completely a nocebo affect?\n\nThanks  I think I can agree with this, I have been going through a rough time with a lot of things. \n\nCould saw palmetto be making me worse or not?  I can get erections no problem it is just my mental state is not the best after using saw palmetto and minoxidil Used saw palmetto for years but I am not convinced that do much help. I think it is just a popular belief. Started using finasteride for couple of couple of weeks and not experiencing any sides worth mentioning. As you mention I am also going through a rough patch and loosing hair is contributing to that fact greatly. So, decided to bite the dust and taking fin. I have decided to knock taking finasteride on the head as at the moment it would not be good for my mental health. \n\nDid saw palmetto affect you mentally or any other side affects when taking it? Not really. And do not I think saw palmetto does much of a help in this regard. So you think that it is a nocebo affect from thinking saw palmetto is linked to PFS? Yes. Just do not even think about it. Focus onto other things. Ok thanks for your input, how is the finasteride going for you? It is been couple of weeks only; so, there is not much say. It takes at least 3 months to see anything noticeable. Are you experiencing any negative side affects after the two weeks? No Saw palmetto is a 5-AR inhibitor which is the same mechanism as finasteride. There have been reports of PFS-like conditions from Saw Palmetto. \n\nSaw palmetto and finasteride both inhibit the enzyme that converts T to dihydrotestosterone.  \n\nThere have also been reports of PFS-like symptoms from people who used minoxidil, which is not described as a 5-AR inhibitor. Seems strange because I did not have any sexual sides from saw palmetto, it is soon as I used the minoxidil I felt like vomiting and this week I have been drenched in aniexty. Now I am not sure if I am if it is the nocebo effect that is making me ill or I am actually ill from doing the saw palmetto Who knows, could be an interaction between saw palmetto and minoxidil. What you are experiencing does not sound like nocebo to me. I would see a doctor who is open-minded and informed. I have been having awful anxiety since Sunday night, have not eaten and have not slept. Each day is getting worse. I taken saw over a month ago with zero sides until I taken minoxidil the second time round  The stories with finasteride seem to frequently involve exposures to different medications, or interruptions / changes in dose. \n\nSorry to hear things are getting worse. See a doctor ASAP. I am just at the point weather this is real or I am making myself really ill for overthinking Keep this in mind if the doctor says it is \u201cin your head.\u201d Just because you are experiencing psychological/cognitive/sleep difficulties does not mean the *cause* is psychological. There is ample evidence that finasteride affects the brain and causes neuropsychiatric symptoms. Have you been on finasteride/saw palmetto before?  Depression, anxiety, insomnia \u2014 all associated with 5-AR inhibitors. It is hard to pick through the research but see one of the recent papers by Irwig.   Yes. Finasteride. How long for and have you had any side affects? I took it for about six years. I stopped in 2013 when I got sexual adverse effects. I suddenly had no feeling in my genitals and lost my sex drive. I then had a \"crash\" period with an alarming series of symptoms including anhedonia. Before all this I would had a very strong and healthy sexuality for my whole life (never gave it a moment's thought).\n\nThe sexual symptoms remain to this day.\n\nI do not see them as side effects because the drug has not been in my system for seven years. They are **harms** caused by the drug, and withdrawal from it. Patient reports of harms from minoxidil:\n\n I did not have any ED with either of them, I got ED from my SSRIs I am currently on.

I am starting to think finastride is giving me panic attacks. I have put on weight, I used to once be in the army and boxed all my life but I have let myself go over the past few years and so the one night when I thought I was having a heart attack I never blamed finastride. This heart attack like feeling has happened multiple times and as I am sitting here writing this I feel like my chest is burning. I went into hospital barely being able to gasp for air and felt like my arm was dead, my old man had a heart attack at my age and so I was literally expecting it any second\u2026 hours went by and I had several scans done and the doctors came back and looked at me very confused\u2026 \u2018there is nothing wrong with your heart\u2019 they said whilst I am literally feeing like my whole hearts being pressed up against a burning grill! \u2018We think you have had a panic attack\u2019 well I could not quite take what they said to heart at first but it is been dawning on me since that this may be the case. I sexually cannot get as hard as a once could and certainly do not last as long but it is not to the point that my sexual interests have faded or that I cannot get errect (ish). My mood has been more toxic I have become a lot lazier and I am starting to wonder if this may all be finastride as non of this was an issue prior. You left out the most important detail - are you still taking finasteride? And if you are not taking it - how long since you quit? It is possible. Fin gave me severe anxiety, luckily it went away some time after I quit.\n\nBut lucky me many other symptoms did not go away. I will say there is a good chance. Someone close to me ended up having severe side effects from finasteride, but they started with some mild sexual sides and panic attacks at night. He later had a severe concussion while taking the fin, and between the two his side effects progressed into severe anxiety including agoraphobia, much more severe sexual sides, weight gain, depression and mood issues. He would work out like a beast and barely gain muscle or lose weight. Meds helped him a little mentally, but they seemed to cause more of the same problems.\n\nBased on his experience and current recovery, I would recommend testing your hormones levels. He had low T, high estrogen, high cortisol and low pregnenolone, and I think some other things were out of whack too. That is how we figured out something was really wrong with his hormones and it was causing all his issues. Good news is he is seen significant recovery of all sides since then. This makes sense. Finasteride blocks hormones like Allopregnanolone, that are protective against concussions and other brain stressors.\n\nWhat hormonal interventions did your friend do to recover? Many people albeit a small percentage experience severe side effects from finasteride. See an endocrinologist or HRT specialist and get blood tests, especially for the hormones  mentioned. He tried TRT initially. It worked well for the most part but gave him heart pain so he stopped pretty quick b/c of heart attack risk and assumed long term dependence. \n\nWhat seemed to work was short term HGC injections, supplemental pregnanelone, vitamin D, a clean diet and less drinking, lots of exercise, some other supplements (I think a good multivitamin, NAC, quercetin, macuna and some others) and time. He worked with a naturopath for a long time and this was not all done at once. His hormone levels were monitored through regular blood tests. He also found out he is allergic to gluten and cut it out. \n\nThis was interesting, he supplemented high dose vitamin D for months but still tested extremely low and had to get a 100,000 iu injection to get his levels up. The entire process is still ongoing and very much two steps forward, one step back. However I would say he is in an excellent place compared to before. Interesting! Thanks! All the best to you on your journey!", "how long you take fin vs. length of recovery: what is the consensus? I know that a shorter time tends to indicate a swifter recovery. I took fin for a week and have not recovered fully after 9 weeks. Does such a disproportionate recovery time indicate permanent sides (mine are strictly of the sexual variety)? I have definitely improved but my last noticeable improvement was probably after a month after quitting fin and since then things have lingered with minor fluctuations. What do you gather from this? There is no correlation in my opinion. Some people take finasteride for 10 years then develop severe PFS. Some only take 1 pill and develop PFS. I have lurked on these forums for long enough to have seen it all. IMO Yes they do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am in similar boat, I took only 3mg of Fin and got hit hard. I am 3.5 months post Fin now.  Since the intial crash, I consistently noticed subtle and minor improvement in all areas mental AND physical . Of course there was periods where things plateued but overall it was linear progress. \n\nNow I ONLY have ED as my last remaining symptom. Within the past week tho ive seen consistent improvement on that as well Thank God\n\nThe fact of the matter is, the longer you take Fin, the more accumulates in your body/brain and the harsher side effects you will experience. I have read many accounts, it seems like anyone taking it for a month or more usually gets hit quite hard. Where as people who only took it for couple weeks max or like in my case, only 3 doses, seem to benefit from increased recovery speed. I took it for apprx. 6 months and I stopped it for about 5 months now. I still have not recovered.  Zero libido, no erection, watery semen, anxiety,  depression,  vivid \ndreams. Any idea when I would see the full recovery?", "Really concerned. This is forever, is not it? Used topical compounded finasteride prescribed by my dermatologist maybe 10-11 total days spread out over 3 weeks back in May (5 months ago). Noted some weak erections then, did masturbate during this timeframe to see if I still could, noted some burning/scrotal pains, decided to stop because I did not like these side effects.\n\nSince then, had difficulty sustaining erections, penile changes/curve, inability to sustain erections, curve, looks smaller when erect and when not erect, intermittent testicle/scrotal pains.\n\nHad some improvement with cialis 5 mg one time to where I was pretty close to fully erect as before, masturbated once a day for a few days to see how long it would last, saw endocrine and urology who do not think PFS is real but still have to check labs for hypogonadism and ultrasound for other stuff but have not done yet because I had such a good response to cialis that one time, but did not want to take it all the time. No more testicle/scrotal pains during this timeframe.  Ran, ate healthy, cut out all other supplements, have not masturbated since that dose of Cialis (but that was almost normal about a month ago!) \n\nStarted Wellbutrin to see if it would help with libido/mood and see if this was all actually depression-related and not from medication for the past 10 days. 2 days ago had scrotal/testicle pains again overnight for the first time in months.\n\nNow cannot get hard at ALL even with Cialis and definitely looks even smaller here in September. Thinking about stopping the Wellbutrin to hope to get back to the old baseline but penis looks smaller and more curve/Peyronie's.\n\nWhat the fuck is going on, I am starting to think me/my dick are not going to get better.  I do not know that there are any effective treatments at all for these symptoms.\n\nWhat the fuck did I do to myself. Well we cannot say if it is forever or not.\n\nBut there is certainly things you can do. I would start with a good brand of Ubiquinol (reduced Q10).\n\nThis is often used by people with peyronie's to halt it is progression. I had the same pain you had, and got a curve in my penis. Ubiquinol stopped it from regressing, but of course I still have the slight bend. But no pain.\n\nI would also advice you to go get that ultrasound to see what is going on.\n\nDid you only have penis / libido issues at first which gave you a depression or did you get down due to fin? (Talk to with your urologists before trying)\nI am doing water pumping 3 times per week 5-10min) to help with erections. It is been a month now and I have had great success with reversing the sensitivity loss and can maintain an erection for longer. Still have the libido issues, brain frog, anxiety and depression but they are improving as time passes. Might be worth looking into. I am surprised they offered you ultrasound so easily... So many times I went to urologists here in Canada they take one look at my shrivelled shrunken penis and say yep it is normal lol maybe they will check test level Bro did you see Dr Keith Jarvi in Toronto? No I do not think but I did go to mount Sinai I think. I must have seen 3 in person and talked to 2 over the phone. They were all beyond useless I knew much more than they did. Only one of them acknowledged that finasteride causes damage. The rest were surprised. Anyways, I asked what else can they do for me aside from prescribing Cialis and they all had nothing. Endocrinologists were even worse. I am sure if I had done ultrasound my penis would have shown some sort of collagen problem/fibrosis. \n\nI went to a private clinic that does HRT they gave me HCG and clomid which I did not want to use. He recognizes PFS and can prescribe hormones. Why do not you want to use HCG &amp; clomid? if you do not mind me asking. I looked up clomid side effects and got scared. My HCG came guess from which manufacturer.... Merck. I did not want to touch it lol. I chose the natural way and I am doing better now. If things had taken a bad turn I would rather jump on a real cycle of androgenic steroids not some PCT stuff that still messes hormones without much upside. I did read joekool healing on HCG but there are many negatives too That is interesting, I just looked up the link between peyronie\u2019s and low testosterone. I had never heard about that before but there is at least 5 studies suggesting a link. Have you heard of Restore X? I was considering that to reverse my peyronies. DHT is essential for penile integrity, so it is a no brainer that low T (and thus DHT) is involved in the pathology of Peyronie's.\n\nTreatment with finsteride has shown (in rats) to thin the tunica albuginea, decrease the weight of corpus cavernosa and change the layup of collagen fibers into a more chaotic manner. \n\nNo humans studies done because we cannot chop off penises of people. \n\nI have not heard about Restore X but I searched it. I do not know how it would affect a post fin penis to be honest.\n\nIn my opinion our penises have become more fragile so it needs to be handled with much care.\n\nIf you are in the US you might want to look up \"topical Verapamil\". It is not invasive and  had some impressive results in a few studies. \n\nI would also use a vacuum pump, but use only very low pressure (use one with a vacuum bell). That is exactly what I experienced\nOver a year of fighting this\nSeemed like my penis could not hang it was always shrivelled cold and retracted. When I bend over it turtle inside. It was absolutely shocking to see a micropenis look after having a big one my whole life. It also lost about an inch erect.\n\nI am so thankful I was able to beat that hell. How did you end up beating it? I think I am going through the same Workout, some herbs and time. Mine last over a year of torment. It was absolute hell. But my penis is normal now. Thanks How is your situation bow? Is it any better?

So I took it for about 2-2.5 months. During this time inexperienced side effects within a day or two and messed with the dosage to see if they would subside. First I took 1mg everyday, then 1mg every other day, then tried half mg, but the side effects did not subside. \n\nEventually I continued experiencing nipple pain and one time I experienced pain when I ejaculated. I decided to quit then.\n\nWhile I took it I experienced the following side effects:\n\n-\tNo more morning wood\n-\tFelt more depressed\n-\tPuffy nipples and occasional pain or tingling\n-\tTesticular ache \n-\tWeak orgasm (reduces force and pleasure)\n-\tMy penis and scrotum often seemed shrunken or like it had bad blood flow.\n-\tAt first, an increase in libido\n-\tNo more spontaneous erections\n\nWhen I quit the medication, I notice an improvement in my orgasm, morning wood, mood, etc. however, 6 months after quitting I experienced a crash.\n\nI had many sleep disturbances, an increase in anxiety, erection issues, and my puffy nipples remained. At this point I had a couple of times where I could not get hard when I tried to masturbate so I went to the doc.\n\nHe just put me on Cialis to \u201cget me over the hump\u201d in case it was stress or psychological. It worked but I only had a few pills. However, once I took the 3 pills I had all my issues seemed gone. I had high libido, spontaneous boners and I felt 100% for about a month. And then I randomly got erection problems again\n\nThis point I went to two Urologists. I live in a big city in the US and these two were the top Urologist in the city from my research. One specifically focused on Andrology\n\nBoth told me PFS is not something the medical community agrees on, but anecdotally they do see young men come in and complain about their sexual function after taking Fin.\n\nThey did more blood work, ultra sound on my penis to check for abnormalities, sensitivity test, etc. fortunately everything they tested was normal, however, I was still symptomatic. They basically put me on Cialis 5mg daily for 3 months. Then they told me switch to 5mg every other day and eventually 2.5mg every other day before quitting entirely.\n\nThe Andrologist suggested I take an Aromatase Inhibitor for the mild Gyno I got (puffy nipples) and also said I could try Clomid to restart my endocrine system. I decided not to because I was seeing improvements and I was afraid to further mess with my hormones.\n\nWhat I will say is this, I am not 100% and I may never get there. My libido is still lower most days, and my morning wood is infrequent now, but I am pretty close to 100%. I am not sure how much Cialis helped or if it was just natural, but I believe it did help train my body and get closer to my natural state.\n\nI really recommend you guys go to the doc if you are experiencing issues and take Cialis for a while. It is not a cure but I believe it does have benefits as well as helping to relieve stress and anxiety. It also seems like many posters on here never seek any time of treatment. \n\nMy theory:\n\nWhen I got blood work everything was in range but some things were on the low side. \n\n-\tTotal T was 453ng/dl range 250-1100\n-\tfree T 59.5 pg/ml range 35-155\n-\te2 37 pg/ml first test range &lt;=39 pg/ml and 26 pg/ml 2nd test range &lt;= 32 pg/ml \n-\tFSH 2.9 miu/ml range 1.6-8 2nd test 1.2 miu/ml range 1.3-19.3 \n-\tLH 1.6 miu/ml range 1.5-9.3 2nd test 2.9 miu/ml range 1.2-9\n-\tprolactin 8.7 ng/ml range 2.6-13.1\n-\tSHBG 31 nmol/L range 10-50\n\nI did not get my DHT tested but I suspect it is much lower. Prior to Fin I started to get intense scalp itch where my hair was thinning, read this is called DHT scalp. After fin, I have no scalp itch. I think my intracellular levels of DHT are low.\n\nI think I have borderline low total and free T for my age (29, 5\u20197\u201d 155lbs). And I think much of my sexual function was supported by DHT. Then Fin probably crashes my DHT and raised both my T and e2. However, I think the Androgen/estrogen ratio was thrown off when this happened and heightened e2 caused some of my problems, like the gyno. \n\nNow I have just been eating and sleeping better and trying to hit the weights to improve as much as I can naturally. I may try an AI or serm like Clomid, but I am not sure yet.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to share my experience, I thought my post would be more focused than it turned out. But hopefully this info or my experience is in someway helpful to the readers here!! Thanks for posting this.  \n\nSo, it took about a year to get back to normal, that is better than what a lot.of people experience. \n\nI took three pills of FIN back in July, and I am still in disbelief at how it effected me.  Luckily, my sides are completely gone now, other than a lower libido.   I believe I am in the same boat as you, that my DHT levels must have supported my sexual function.  \n\nI took a product called N2Generate, I think it is similar to clomid, I feel as though that really helped me.  Still not 100% though.  Luckily, I had blood work done before I took FIN, so will get blood work done again soon.  \n\nMy morning wood just started coming back in the last couple of weeks, it is not daily, but it is coming back.  So, I am very optimistic.  Back in August and September I was a mess.  \n\nThere is hope! Unfortunately I do not have any pre Fin bloodwork. Can you update me on any major differences between your pre and post fin labs?\n\nThe thing that sucks is labs only tell us about hormones flowing through our body and not what is actually happening within the cells.\n\nFor what it is worth, part of the reason I believe nuked DHT is a big cause of these issues is because the change in scalp itch I have (probably less dht in those cells now) and another person I spoke with told me Trans scrotal testosterone cream saved them. Scrotum skin has a higher amount of 5 alpha reductase in it, so higher DHT conversion made him feel better Hey, I will definitely update you on my lab work.  I am just waiting to make sure that N2Generate is completely out of my system, I want to wait maybe another week or so.  \n\nTrans scrotal testosterone cream?  I have never heard of that, and that is to increase DHT?\n\nEdit: I just looked up scrotal testosterone cream, that seems pretty cool.  I may have to look more into that.   Thanks for mentioning it. He was on TRT therapy as he was a bit older than me. But basically his testosterone came in the form of a cream that he puts on his nuts. Puts the T on his nuts which has more 5ar so it upped his DHT too. I do not want to do TRT cause my age but I just thought it was interesting That definitely is interesting.  Thanks for mentioning it.", "Libido trouble, PFS ? Hi, 26 male here, under fin for 6 month and stopped 3 weeks ago because feeling anxious and a decreasing libido ( but still able to masturbate and finish ).\n\nI was feeling anxious but at the same time I have some important exam so it may be the cause rather than fin. \n\nBut the libido issue... It is weird... : I did'nt have morning erection anymore, and I needed more extreme and exotic fantasies to have a boner without erection. A few day after quitting fin, morning erection came back but then since this week It disappeared again and I experience a decrease of my libido again, my fantasies do not work anymore.\n\nSo, what do you think guys ? Is this could be related to PFS ? Or is this psychologic ? \n\nI am asking because it may be a psychologic cause and I want to push aside PFS to be sure Damn so sorry, that sounds like pfs I took Finasteride 5 months and I stopped using it 6months ago. My orgasm has not yet returned. I am sort of in the same situation. I had the same thing, its 100% from fin. I can have an orgasm if I masturbate. I do not cause I want to try a nofap, but normally after 2-3 day I am suppose to be able to easily have an erection by thought, that is what make me realize that something was wrong.\n\nI hope it will get better for you Thank you It does sound like the effects are form finasteride, however you only stopped taking it three weeks ago. I would not worry for now, just get enough sleep, eat well and try to exercise. Chances are it will pass. It might just take a bit of time. In 6 months your erection will be back I promise Very likely the Finasteride that did this to you man. I would be doing your best to minimise stress as much as possible, living the healthiest lifestyle, sleeping 8-9 hrs per night, quality diet, avoiding drugs and alcohol, etc. You want to put your body in the best position possible to recover and bounce back from this. The majority of people do recover within 3 months, so set your mind on that and do everything in your power to help your body recover :) How many milligrams? Watch out for a crash in the coming days. If you mentally start falling apart, just tough through it it will get better. \n\nBut hopefully you do not get it. Keep your chin up it slowly gets better I would not call it PFS yet. It is only been three weeks. No doubt that the symptoms are from finasteride though. Thanks man, I will try to eat healthy food, bu I am not sure I will manage to avoid stress and sleep better caus I also have important exam in June \\^\\^ Thanks ! Stress is the #1 killer.\nImplement stress management into your daily routine. Meditation, deep breathing, walking in nature, etc, etc. I cannot emphasise enough how important stress reduction is.\nBest of luck friend, I hope you get better soon I think the \" crash \" already happen, and like I said upper, I am very stressed about a lot of things so I think I maybe will not see any change before my problems disappear, but thanks ! 1mg/day the first 3 months, then I was concerned about an eventual \" brainfog \" so I reduced to 0,5 mg/day for 3 months I would not start taking fin again if I were you, it is just not worth it.\n\nWith that said, you do not have PFS - yet. There is also a very high chance that after quitting fin you make a full recovery. Remember, loss of libido and anxiety are known side effects from fin. PFS has not been acknowledged yet though. The difference is PFS are side effects that last indefinitely after quitting the medication.\n\nMost people in your position will make a full recovery in \\~weeks to months after stopping. I would highly suggest stopping now so things do not get worse.\n\nKeep a positive mindset and a healthy lifestyle. There are lots of good suggestions in this thread, do not take them lightly! Thanks man, it reassures me !\n\nI do not plan to take fin again but I do not wan't to be bald so soon. I guess I am going to start saving money for transplant...\n\nI am going to introduce some sports, some meditation and try to eat more healthy. How long for your libido to fully come back to normal ? Has your libido fully returned and how long it take ? This is the definition of it\u201d Libido refers to sexual desire, or the emotion and mental energy related to sex. Another term for it is \u201csex drive.\u201d And I have lots of it It is not 100 % After over 6 months It hasnt come back to normal How long since you quit ? So even after 6 months not fully 100%? And did you notice gradual improvement? There is small improvement after each month that passes. over a month Okay so how much percentage would you say your back to normal now ? Okok give it time I would say 95-98 % for sure And this happened after 6 months of quitting ? Do you have faith it will be 100% soon ? After 6 months my erections have improved a lot and I have faith in 6 more months it will be even better Could you DM me i have some questions Yea You experience post finasteride crash, like a lot of people they get better upon stopping it and then everything take the downhill and beat you hard. I would advice to not panic but go for a complete Dutch test plus, it expensive but worth the money to measure activity of your 5ar but also all the cascade of enzyme and metabolite related to androgen. It is the best test to find out what is fuck up. I just order one now and have PFS for 10y, hopefully recovered to 80% since years 2. Hi Chartsharing, i have heard about this test and i am part of a community where few people did it.\n\nThe problem is that even though we get a lot of details in the result, doctor does not have the knowledge to fix it back.\n\nHow did you do in your side? Doctors are not always the perfect answer for that. In some forum you can share your result with people who recovered and see which treatment they do and how it will impact your current situation (Pubmed is here to find how to stimulate or inhibit a specific enzyme).  If I am quitting fin. What can i take instead for my hair? Little update : I have morning erection again ! Hey I am really glad to hear that! I have not had my random/morning erections return without stimulation and it is been about a month and a half since I quit. Could you let me know what you have been doing to recover and what you think is helping? How long were you on fin for and are you fully recovered now? Bro what is difference between libido and orgasm? Libido is like do you want to jerk of and have sex, orgasm is the pleasure. I have 100% of the 1st one but 10% of the second. Fuck Finasteride  What had helped you mainly recover and did you not improve at all until 2 years ago ?  What is the 20% recovery missing that has not fixed up ? Also is sexual function and libido fully back ? ", "Anyone here has no pleasure when orgasm?

Maybe just give it time as you took it for a while. Bro Im sorry that sucks. I watched a Finasteride video on youtube and the Doctor said there was a study with 24 men. \n\nThey used finasteride for 6 months. The 12 men in the non placebo group had 30-40% reduction in receptors in there foreskin. \n\nGiven the fact that you used it for 24 months im not sure how many receptors you lost or how to get them back. Can you share your blood test? Do you have high prolactine? I am not sure orgasm and fore skin receptor are related. I would have been more related to numbness Send me a link to this Finasteride video on YouTube Plot twist : it does not exist Eh most guys in the US do not have a foreskin and can still feel orgasms plenty well so I am not sure this is related to this exact issue", "Dr Will Powers PFS Protocol Dr Will Powers is a quite well known doctor here on Reddit who helps transgender patients (who regularly receive finasteride). I stumbled across his protocol for PFS and thought it might be useful to share. \n\nThe protocol:\nRectal and oral progesterone \nEffexor \nFluvoxamine \nPregnenolone \nDHEAS \nMidazolam Anyone have experience with this? I personally think this is a very dangerous and counterproductive approach to treating PFS. \n\nSelective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, such as Effexor and Fluvoxamine, are also anti-androgens and have their own post drug syndrome (PSSD) which mimics and has many similarities to PFS. The potential for further sexual dysfunction and bodily damage is high.\n\nMidazolam is a benzodiazapine, a quite toxic class of drugs with the potential for physical dependancy and severe withdrawals. These drugs should only be used short term for the treatment of severe anxiety. Benzo withdrawl is not something you want to experience.\n\nLastly, although I think progesterone has merits in up-regulating allopregnanlone synthesis, it is HPTA suppressive and will lower endogenous testosterone production. Counterproductive for people not on Testosterone Replacement Therapy.\n\nI do not know anything about the Drs qualifications, nor his experience with PFS or justification for this protocol, however I would highly advise anyone reading to avoid this advice like the plague. Strongly agreed; I have not read or heard of anyone with PFS who was cured by pharma drugs. Especially not SSRIs, which cause their own sexual side effects. I mean, what the fuck? Those are quite the medications. Are we now supposed to medicate ourselves with benzos &amp; anti depressions meds? let alone shove progesterone up our rectums?", "Question So I have a question. Who here was fully recovered from both cognitive and sexual effects of Finasteride? Been like 8 days so far with marginal improvement. Felt driven today mentally, still a bit foggy.\n\nHowever still full blown Ed - limp dick, flaccid penis , no brain to dick connection , etc People have definitely made full recoveries. Regarding your circumstances, 8 days is really not enough time to see progress for most people. When I first got finasteride sides, it was *just ED* and it still took 2 weeks for me to recover from that. Give it a few months. Try to not worry too much in that period. It seems like a lot of people recover fully in that time frame. took 3 doses and took me 3 months to recover Hey, same thing happened to me, it took 11 days days of no improvment, and then it just magically went away over night form some reason. almost 1 year in, everything has recovered EXCEPT for ED and \"core\" libido.Specifically erection strength and sensitivity never seemed to return to that real PRE-fin state. Same with that primal sexual drive type of libido.\n\nIt is truly insufferable", "Unas are upside down plants Nervous system-branches, hair-roots. \n\nWhen you take the pesticide finasteride, it poisons your pistil/phallus so your roots grow out trying to get more nutrients. The nutrients we get from our hair is where innate knowledge and personality comes from. Mycelium connects tree roots as happens when people share trips on psychedelics.\n\nHumans and plants are one in the same. Symbiotic in how they exchange gasses. Opposite in appearance.

But on Monday I took a single 1.25mg dose of Finasteride, I am M 23 and recently started noticing my hairline recede. I wasnt honestly that worried about sides, mostly just Gyno (as I have some minor gyno from puberty). \n\nThat night I had really vivid dreams, where I woke up with a solid erection. That day (Tuesday) it was slightly harder to get an erection, but still possible to finish.\n\nBy Wednesday, I again had the vivid dreams but my erection was a lot weaker. Could not seem to get it fully up, so I decided to cut back on the medication.\n\nBy Thursday, my erection was completely gone. My penis feels like a limp noodle, I can watch porn and it gets bigger, but it does not stand up at all. It also feels like my prostate is like inflammed idk, feels super sensitive around this region. And the base of my penis is super itchy\n\nI am just worried about having complete ED after a single pill. I thought it was just in my head, but I cannot even get it up at all. I was wondering what I should be doing now? Not much to do but wait.\n\nIt takes 30+ days for the 5AR that fin attached to to regenerate.\n\nIf you start feeling pain around the base it might be Peyronie's and in that case Q10 Ubiquinol might stabilize it.\n\nIf it is only itchy and not painful it is most likely not Peyronie's though. I think you will be fine bro just stop taking it. and wait , you may recover You are crazy", "So many doubts M26 Even on fin I still had erections (but my penis was completely flaccid for the first 2 weeks of treatment). Now I just do not always have morning woods and get less involuntary erections during the day.\nBut my main problem is the brain fog. I am a student so I cannot tolerate having it. It is been 3 days since I quit. The brain fog is disappearing - not gone yet - but much better.\n\nAt the same time I get so many compliments of being handsome because for the first time I have let my hair grow. Man, I look so much better with hair.\n\nYesterday I received a package and the delivery lady said \"wow your handsome\" first thing. That just fill my head of so many doubts.\n\nMy self-steem was trash at 22-23 when I started taking fin mostly because the losing of the hair. Idk I would rather have a brain than some hair.\n\nBut I have been where you are, I did use fin after all. One of the worst decisions in my life sadly.\n\nAt least I got a large portion of my brain function back. It is worse with my sexual abilities. It is not just hair that makes a person handsome. You probably look good without it. I used fin 5mg against benign prostatic hyperplasia for two months and I crashed after quitting. My entire live is destroyed. I lost the love of my life, even the close relationship to my own child.", "Finasteride and Suicide: A Postmarketing Case Series (January 2020) Irwig MS. Dermatology. 2020.\n\nAbstract\nBACKGROUND: In 2011, depression was added to the product labeling of finasteride in the USA. The US Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System database contains at least 36 death cases for finasteride. The aim of this study is to characterize the clinical histories and symptoms reported by a series of 6 suicide victims who took finasteride for treatment of androgenic alopecia.\n\nMETHODS: Medical records and autopsy reports were provided by family members of the cases. Relevant information was extracted according to guidelines for submitting adverse event reports.\n\nRESULTS: An important pattern of symptoms was common among all cases who committed suicide in the setting of finasteride use - insomnia and persistent sexual dysfunction after medication discontinuation. Insomnia and fatigue/tiredness were some of the most debilitating symptoms. Apart from 1 case who had hyperlipidemia, there was no documentation of concomitant medication use with finasteride or any baseline medical or psychiatric diagnoses prior to starting finasteride. The findings of this postmarketing series may not be generalizable to the population of men who committed suicide in the setting of finasteride use due to small sample size and bias. Associations between medication use and symptoms cannot prove causality.\n\nCONCLUSION: Men under the age of 40 who use finasteride for alopecia are at risk for suicide if they develop persistent sexual adverse effects and insomnia. Further research is needed to establish whether finasteride has a causal relationship to suicide.\n\n\u00a9 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel. When men develop sexual dysfunction among other debilitating symptoms like fatigue and insomnia, it sadly makes sense why some men may turn to suicide.", "Full Crisis Mode So new redditer, mostly specifically for this because I am in full crisis mode. \n\nHealthy 27y.o with pretty active sex life and high libido. Drink lots of water, eat relatively well with some cheat days, but have never had any health issues. \n\nStarted 1mg/day on 6/25/20 and was on for exactly **26** days. Last time I had good sex/normal was 7/3. I noticed though cum was getting more watery etc, but was able to get hard and normal libido (that of basically a 17y.o). I noticed around 7/18-7/19/20 erections were weaker, my libido had dropped significantly, and I woke up on 7/21 and could not get hard to save my life, so I did not take it that day and have not since. That day I went to have sex with new girlfriend (first time trying to have sex since 7/3) and it would not even flinch, no matter what her or I did. \\*enter sad trombone\\* \n\nIt is now been a little over **3 weeks** since not taking it, and I still have no libido or drive, when me and her try having sex most times I cannot get it up without her help and then when I do, I go soft in her (!!!) about 40 seconds in. And she is crazy attractive and normally I would be trying to get at it multiple times in a row. It is a similar story when by myself as well and I have definitely noticed the feelings are way less and when I do masterbate it does not really stay hard, nowhere near as hard as it used to be and almost no feeling when I do get off. \n\nI have read through all of this and mostly looking if anyone has similar experiences and if there is hope and what a timeframe could look like. It is obviously impacted my body being on it for a relatively short time, but is this looking like it will get better and back to normal? My advice is to give it a few weeks and do not panic. The number one thing is to avoid reading the forums during this time and just try to relax. There is a very high likelihood you will recover in a short period of time. If not, most people will eventually recover - the chances of this being a permanent issue are very slim. Just continue to eat healthy and exercise, but more importantly, take your mind off of it for a bit.\n\nIf you are still getting morning wood or nocturnal erections, that is a very good sign. If not, again do not panic, chances are, they will come back. I would give it three months rather than three weeks. Avoid trying supplements or other treatments. If sex is not working, do not force it. \n\nIf you still have symptoms at three months, give it another three months. Look I am currently in you same situation, I took Finasteride for little over a month. The reason I stopped was more lazy matter, I read somewhere taking 1mg 3x a week would bring the same result. So doing this I would end up forgetting and completely stopped. I did noticed minor side effects when I was on it but could still maintain a hard erection. However, after stopping that is when I noticed low libido and would not get and erection as they used to. I have been off it for approximately 1 month and a half, have not seen crazy improvement but I can definitely vouch that is better for you to stay away from negative forums and try to be at peace in mind. That has helped me from panicking and going into a depression. I cannot say for sure but it seems because we have taken it for such a short period of time we are looking into a definite recovery, the best advice is to be as healthy as possible, mentality and physical and hope to make a full recovery. I took 1mg 3x/week for 3 months and sides were bad at that point. Stopped taking and was pretty much back to normal after a month off.\nHowever, I then tried going back on (topically this time) and the side effects came back after the first application. I tried a second application and then tried oral a couple more times - 4 1mg pills total spread out over the span of 2 months and then I totally quit again as the side effects came back a lot faster than last time. I have been off for 5 weeks now and this time I have not gone back to normal yet unfortunately. Will wait and see what happens. What sides are you experiencing? Sides after a single application is pretty rough, wishing you the best. Thanks all! It is somewhat reassuring. Minor update (hope this is how you do it):\n\nI have noticed the past couple days seem to be getting a *little* better. I seem to be able to get it up to 90% or so and it will stay there for maybe 2 mins before losing it completely (by myself). Is this a sign of progress and getting back to normal? Still virtually no libido at all, although a big wave of horniness hit me once, it is been flat otherwise.\n\nAlso, girlfriend and I (same as OP) are taking a week-long trip on Monday. I would like the trip to **not** be celibate and I *do* have some viagra 20mg pills I could take. Has anybody had experience with this?\n\nI have talked to her about it and she is against it and I am hesitate because, well, treating a medication problem with more medication seems like a bad idea. Curious if this would help get over the hump (pun!) on the way to full recovery if that can take a few more weeks or months it seems? Thanks. The persisting sides include being very soft all the time and overall ED, low/weak/watery ejaculation, lower sex drive or mentally \u201cdisconnected\u201d from physical, some ball ache/sensitivity, numbness and difficulty finishing, overall feel off - fragile and no drive  It helps only with the vascular (blood flow) aspect.\n\n(\n\nIf you are lacking sensitivity or libido, it will not restore those. 5 week update: \n\nThe good: Noticed I can get hard pretty easily again now, have been having regular sex, and 90% of the time able to finish. Occasional glimmers of full stiffness and full libido.\n\nThe bad: Still not staying fully hard throughout sex, erections are not 100% what they used to be. Most times there is a little dip into a semi where we stop, do some kissing and go down on her then I get it back enough to finish. Cum is not watery but still not nearly the same amount (no idea about sperm counts, but nervous to find out). And libido is still not nearly there the same. Getting morning wood but not what it used to be. \n\nAfter a week of pretty regular sex like this (2\u20133 times a day) I noticed a bit of a dip the past couple days, which seems par the course based on what everyone is saying here. \n\nStaying positive, hoping to continue making this progress and will update around the 2 month mark with any changes. I am hoping this trajectory continues and I will be back to 100% by 3 months, but praying for that. \n\nIt seems there are plenty of people who get back to 100% which is reassuring and I look at myself Day 1 off Fin where it would not get hard at all, and remind myself it is gradually getting better and will continue on this path. \n\nHope this is helpful and if anyone was here and made a full recovery let me know your timeline! I was only on Fin for 26 days. u/always_annihilated Just to give an update as well, I took Fin for 1 month same as you, Currently feeling a lot better! I can say it has to do with the lifestyle changes I have made, Currently going to the gym 6x a week, running 3 miles a day which was recommended by a doctor, Now to the improvements! I can say I water fast for 2 days this helped with my mental clarity, I have been taking Zinc, Vitamin D, Ginko, Tribulus. Slowly I see progress for me it has been a little over 3 months since I got off fin, I cannot say I am 100% yet. Thanks to Cialis, I feel I can rely on my penis when the occasion comes around, It is not a fix but it does wonders when all you think about is how you will perform.\n\nHowever, Today, I am taking a different approach, blocking all sites related to finasteride/PFS , Somedays I just panic because I am not quite certain when I will recover to pre fin and spend hours searching for solutions and different methods which in the end makes me feel worse. Now all I want to do is relax and not think too much of it, Maybe I have to get my mind off it to allow my body to heal itself. Worrying will not help the body restore itself, I have noticed the days that I am down/depressed are usually the days I think about PFS more and more LOL\n\nThat being said, I will continue to be connected to this forum and continue with the road to recovery! but all other sites BLOCKED for the sake of my mind. 3 miles is 4.83 km", "Took 4mg of finesteride over 2 weeks (split into 1/3) and now I am having problems I have never had before I have been losing my hair since I was 20, and I am 26 now.

I started noticing that my refractory period was to the point where I could not orgasm more than once a night. So I stopped Fin\n\nIts been 5 days now since my last dose, and I cannot get fully erect. Symptoms seem to have gotten worse since I have stopped. When I have sex I have trouble staying in, and I have definitely lost size since it is not fully hard\n\nThe scariest thing is, when I masturbate, I can orgasm without being hard AT ALL. This has never happened, and let us me know something is really wrong and not psychological.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Even with doses/time period as long as mine? Did you recover and after how long? Bro I know how scary it is when your body stops working like you know it should.\n\nBut you are only 5 days after cessation; most people recover within a month, and many more within 3 months.\n\nThere are a small amount of people who have problems persist after 3 months, and a lot of there symptoms slowly get better over time.\n\nWait a month before getting too concerned. By then you will likely be better. If not, you can post here again with an update.\n\nWish you a speedy recovery. Try not to get too down right now and live your life as best as you can.

The odds are on your side.", "Base levels and Blood Test Request Hi guys!\n\nI have been off finasteride and Dutasteride for 1 year this coming August, I was on Finasteride first prior to moving onto Dutasteride (Avodart). I stopped taking dutasteride due to minor sides and after researching about potential sides due to prolonged use. After nearly a year off Finasteride/Dutasteride I believe I am still experiencing prolonged side effects, or at least I am under the impression that I am.\n\nAnyways, I am due to see my doctor/GP in a couple days to discuss some sides that I am still experiencing and to discuss getting bloods and tests done regarding hormonal levels, testosterone, DHT etc. Once I receive these results I am hoping to get a better understanding of where I stand with this issue and how I can actively deal with and overcome potential deficiencies and the required treatment going forwards.\n\nSo my question is: What specific levels or tests should I ask my doctor to request for? I am sure my doctor will pick up on the basic/minimum requirements, however, are there any other crucial, or lesser known levels/tests that may further indicate or uncover  symptoms of PFS?\n\nNote\\* I have seen posts and discussions that mention free testosterone levels, estrogen levels etc. but I am not very well educated in these areas and would appreciate any advice, information or support.\n\nAppreciate anyone taking the time to respond.\n\nCheers :) I think all the talk of \u2018bloodwork\u2019 in connection with finasteride is essentially BS. It originates with youtube personalities who have no medical qualifications. \n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. We do not know, in a pre-finasteride test, what hormone profile is more vulnerable to adverse effects of finasteride. \n\n2. In people who have persistent adverse effects after stopping, hormone levels are typically in normal range. Low vitamin D seems common. \n\n3. There is no treatment that works reliably for persistent adverse effects. \n\nI am not advising against getting blood tests, but there is no guidance on how to interpret levels in a post-finasteride case.\n\nThe disease/condition seems to arise from something other than abnormal hormone levels. Perhaps receptors are not working. We do not know. For some people blood work can show abnormalities.\n\nEveryone gets hit differently it seems like.\n\nFor example my Prolactin and Progesterone are both double the upper normal range.\n\nAlso some minor other things, like my LH being slightly out of range.\n\nHave not gotten a time to discuss it with a doctor yet, but it might be at least a part of my issues (sexual).\n\nAlso my D3 was in the optimal range at 93 (optimal 75-125).", "i swear my erections have never been the same since... i took fin for 3 months and stopped a month ago i swear my erections have never been the same since. no matter what i do. no fap nonporn going to the gym etc. i used to get so rock hard and get erections throughout the day. now my erection quality is poor.  also my penis bends more. last night i had sex snd my dick looked weird like very shriveled even when erect. it also takes me longer to cum ans my orgasms are not as good. i regret takkng this drug. will it ever go back to normal? The rule of thumb (based on forum discussions) is that if these symptoms are around after 6 months and 12 months, then they may be long-term. Just take it easy for now and take good care of yourself.

I knew there were side effects but thought they were extremely rare and basically all reversible. I had testicular pain when I started but it went away. I had a slight decrease in libido and a numbness feeling in my penis. Nothing too bad though. It was not until September one day I went to \"pleasure myself\" that I noticed my penis was not hard at all. I emailed my \"Hims\" doctor and he said to stop the medicine. I did stop for about a month it got slightly better but still was not normal. I read online that you could take less, I decided to take a quarter of a pill once a day and the side effects came back worse so I stopped for good. After about 3 months I tried a tropical DHT blocker and immediately had testicular pain that day so I stopped first day.\n\nToday I am 25 and right now I just do minoxidil and dermarolling. Still slowly losing my hair. I have not taken finasteride for two years. Yet I still have a very low libido and erection problems. Neither of these I had before.

The head of my penis barely gets hard if at all. I have talked to doctors and they do not seem to believe me or know what to do. I got blood work done and it was mostly normal. I had 950 ng/dL testosterone levels but slightly high SHBG. So it seems pretty normal, next week I am getting my estrogen checked. Anyone with a similar story and did you do anything to help?

There are 6309 sufferers if Finasterid siteeffects from mild to severe cases propeciahelp.com People get similar side effect from minoxidil too, so that might be the reason you have not recovered yet.\n\nOther than that - there is no known cure for finasteride side effects, but if you read some recovery stories, it will give you an idea of some things to try. Be very careful though - some things that work in one case can make others feel permanently worse. Exactly the same here. Cialis works, but I do not want to use that forever.

My libido is noticeably better as well and I find myself ready to talk to women after a pretty long period of abstinence due to my apathy regarding women and sex.

If you have had experience with it, please let me know.", "7 days into Fin update First few days felt great. I felt like I was on top of the world. Slight increase in libido. \n\nThis is my 7th day of taking it fin. \n\nFeel a bit dizzy, definitely a decrease in libido. Feels impossible to get an erection. \n\nI am not sure if I see a little bit of gyno. Since I have gained a lot of weight recently and we have just come out of a long lock down. I managed to gain weight in the lockdown but in the process of losing weight. However, there are some irregularities in chest area. Could be from fin or could be that I am in the process of losing weight (I have a lot of fat % right now)\n\nFeel Anxious today, maybe because I am seeing symptoms and using reddit a lot, however I felt great every other day. Could be placebo? \n\nI am going to stop for a while see what happens with the symptoms. \n\nI would also like to add that I am using a clenbuetrol (a very strong fat burner, which increases heart rate rapidly, maybe anxiety is from that) \n\nI will check back soon with update", "Glycine? \n\nThis seems to indicate that glycine can up-regulate 5ar. Wonder if supplementing with either straight up glycine or magnesium glycinate would be beneficial? I have recently started taking a small amount of magnesium glycinate, and my mental sides (horrible panic attacks, suicidal ideation) seem to be subsiding. Do not know if I can fully attribute that to the magnesium, though. Safe to use? Dosage?\nEdit: Bought the Magnesium Glycinate as well. App through Magnesium the body is able to absorb glycinate faster. Although, In the same threat that you mentioned there was also somebody saying on page 3 or 4 that you should not take it too much cause it can lead to Excitatory synapse. To counter this it must be balanced with (Magnesium) Chloride. This is not my information, but I will try this experiment for a few days.", "This may be interesting for some of you here aswell  ''s it possible it has also altered 5AR and 3b-hsd gene expression in other regions of the body such as the brain?\u201d - Is there any way to test this hypothesis? And what does this implicate for a possible cure?", "After 6 months Hi, so i\\`m 34 years old and took finasteride on and off, never took it for more than 3 months at a time. I started the drug because of diffuse thinning in the NW6 region and also donor area thinning (wanted to get a transplant) after being a stable NW3 without diffusing for 10+ years.\n\nThe first two times, after stopping because of feeling like shit and boner problems and so on, i pretty much recovered after a week or two, was also getting raging wood when DHT was rebounding.\n\nSo, last autumn i did the most stupid thing ever, i took the drug again 3 times per week together with Arimidex. I took this combination for 3 months until December 2020 and than just stopped because i was feeling like shit, no libido and unrestful sleep, acid reflux and joint pain.\n\nA month after stopping i had a severe mental breakdownout of nowhere, anxiety which i never had before in my life and major depression which i have not experienced like this, also no history of mental problems, only thing is drug abuse (Opiates and booze) because i enjoy it. No amount of drugs and booze could get me out of the hole i was in and i actually withdraw from the small dosis of weak opiates i was on and pretty much stopped my habit of 2-3 beers or some wine every night because i was not enjoying it anymore.\n\nIn time i got better mentally, mood stabilized, only thing i still feel is fucked up memory and word finding issues sometimes, just like being a little stupid :). Erections are ok.\n\nBuuuut, what really still bothers me are skin problems - i have severely dry and wrinkeled hands and knuckles, my palms are also very dry and just shed skin continously, my whole skin is just dry af and does not seem to produce anymore oil, my hair is also very dry. \n\nWhat also bothers me is facial bloating. I had nice visible cheekbones before and a dry face even with drinking every night, now it is just swolen and round, does not matter if i drink or what i eat. I am also somewhat fit, 70Kg on 184cm, and do Calisthenics three times per week, do not know my body fat but i have visible abs without flexing. Before the face changes i was actually heavier like 76Kg and quite lean but also lifting heavy in the gym which i do not do anymore.\n\nAnd the worst is the freaking insomnia, at first i would just wake up after 3 hours and not being able to get to sleep again, it got a little better but i still cannot stay asleep for more than 5 hours. If i drink alcohol before sleep it fucks the sleep up even more, i wake up hungover and cannot fall asleep again. Also hypnotics do not help either, even after a strong dose of benzos/Ambien which initially knocks me out like a Klitschko punch, i wake up after 4-5 hours still drugged and dizzy but unable to fall asleep again.\n\nI did a hormone panel before starting Finasteride which showed top of the range total and free testosterone, middle to high DHT, slight over the range SHGB and high estradiol. \n\nDid a hormone panel again 2 weeks ago, free test dropped 40% but still middle range, estradiol dropped a little, as well as SHGB.\n\nHas anyone experienced these side effects, the dry skin, especially on hands, the facial bloating and the goddamn insomnia? If so, did they go away at some point? I think we are in the same boat, I stupidly thought I could avoid sides by only taking one pill a week, which was equivalent to starting and stopping 10 times in a row. But you recovered before so that means your body can do it! I had dry skin for a while it is now more oily than usual Does taking one pill a week make things worse? I would think arimidex could be behind some of your symptoms, dry skin and joint pain are common side effects in bodybuilders who take it as an aromatase inhibitor. Because your body needs some level of estrogens, and less is not always better. Estrogens are sex hormones also i think so, based on its halflife one pill is out of your system by 7 days, so its a start - stop cycle O man, it\\`s been more than 10 months from my last pill and i am still fucked. My once chiseled face and midsection look horribly bloated, my sleep is still very low quality (i can sleep uninterupted for like 6-7 hours but feel very tired upon waking, it is like i actually did not really sleep).\n\nAlso cannot eat like before, after a big meal i get very bloated and just sick. I can actually go on forever fasting because i do not really feel the need/desire for eating, i sometimes just force myself. The buzz from alcohol is also very diminished.\n\nMy beard and pubes also thinned out a lot and i got lots of grey hairs in that areas.\n\nBit of embarassing but also my junk just does not fill properly anymore during erections and is kind of numb.\n\nI also very often just feel stupid and have word finding issues, regardless of the language i am speaking. This also makes a very bad impression on people when they have to finnish your sentence.\n\nI miss proper sleep, hard boners and just being sharp minded and having energy sooooo much. \n\nI also cannot deal with stress anymore like before and i quit 2 jobs because of this inability  in the span of 10 months. This also starts looking bad on my CV.\n\nLike another guy said on that famous site, this drug is pure evil, and i would give anything to go back to my former self, kind of careless, skinny-athletic manly MF who did not really give a damn about anything. Now i feel like i am wasting some of the best years of my life in this pseudo-zombie state.\n\nI have decided that this cannot go on like that, i am pretty much determined to try TRT and maybe other very androgenic steroids, luckily i have legal acces to pharma grade stuff. Will try to get my Test levels to the upper limit, just like they were before ingesting this shit.\n\nMy heart goes out to all of you guys who are suffering like me and i will report back about the effects of TRT. Also forgot to mention the GODDAMN TINNITUS, which also sucks bigtime....", "Update - 1 month on I made a post about a month ago about quite severe side effects after 2x1mg of finasteride. A few people have messaged me privately so thought it would be easier just to do an update post to put minds at ease. \n\nI have significantly improved from the state I was in: sleep has broadly turned back to normal, libido has increased to about 80% normal levels, am able to maintain an erection, and my mental health has significantly got better which was the main issue.\n\nI would also like to add that I have never had any issues with mental health or anxiety in the past. \n\nI do however have some residual side effects: I am getting drops in my mood, my balls ache (this only started in the second or third week), I have still got quite watery sperm and I am more anxious than normal.\n\nIf anyone has any tips that would be great. I am currently taking quite a few vitamin supplements, working out regularly and drinking plenty of water. One thing I wanted to ask however is the use of Zinc. I used to take Zn before I took finasteride, however I read this paper that it acts as a 5ar inhibitor (  \\- esp with B6 which I also take - so have been a little dubious about adding it to my routine for now and wanted to know anyone's thoughts on it/experience of taking it. \n\nThanks in advance You should be fine with Zinc, I took it in the form of ZMA throughout my recovery even though it is a very mild 5ari. It has other benefits and it is good for prostate function. It actually counteracts creatine for me which counter intuitively increases DHT and 5ar expression but negatively effects libido. \n\nYou seem to be on the mend so I would not worry too much if I were you, you should return to baseline. I would eat and live as healthily as possible and perhaps look into ways in which you can improve mental health; meditation or short term therapy to process the whole event and move past it. You are neurosteriods are still out of balance (hence the anxiety) and probably will be for a little while longer but I do not think you should go down the road of trying to fix this through extensive supplementation really as it can be a rabbit hole and leave you feeling never recovered or constantly checking on your body and symptoms. There comes a stage in everyones recovery in which they have to say 'I am very nearly better physically, I need to work on moving past this mentally\". And lucky enough for you it does not seem like you have long term PFS so you are already there naturally.\n\nMake sure you are getting plenty Vitamin D, Magnesium, Vit K and nutritious food, sleep and exercise and you should be fine soon enough. If you are still anxious, go talk to a professional and go through that process. You had severe sides just from taking it twice? yeh - I would say they were severe for about 2 weeks, after that they started to gradually subsist to be more mild. Thank you much appreciated! wait, so you are still on? nah sorry if it was not clear - I have taken 2 pills in total, quit immediately after that My super healthy, buff, bodybuilder guy took Finasteride daily for about 2 years. Really bad mental, physical &amp; sexual sides. Bad muscle aches, knots, and atrophy, even though he lifted and did cardio every day (5+ days/wk) Stopped taking it and had a bad crash 3 weeks post, died, resuscitated.\nAfter defibrillator pace maker implant (46 years old) he went back to normal, healthy diet &amp; activity and we \u201cworked around the ED and desensitivity.\u201d\nMental fog subsided significantly w/in 1wk. Within about 6 months, he was doing VERY well, even down there\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udf46. Recovery with no supplements or drugs was an up and down journey (progress, then setbacks), but nonetheless, he is FULLY recovered, now, 1year later. \nThere IS HOPE, even without meds &amp; supplements.\nHaving a healthy active life, including intimacy and mental health is well worth letting go of dreams for a full head of hair. There are many other solutions for your hairstyle. I am a red blooded, American woman with a healthy libido and I profess that many of the sexiest men out there have a shiny dome \u2764\ufe0f but they can still get it on! \nIt is your choice, yes, but listen to your body man, it is already screaming at you loud &amp; clear!", "Another case of high prolactin I have milder symptoms than a lot of folks here, but they include, to some degree, low libido, erectile dysfunction, penile shrinkage, and penile numbness. These have persisted for almost 1.5 years since quitting finasteride. Note that I did not suffer any mental or cognitive side effects.\n\nWell, after reading several posts about high prolactin on here, I asked my new doc about it and he agreed it was important to test (among many other things).\n\nThe results came back today, and sure enough, prolactin was high, at 22.8 ng/mL (reference interval is 4.0-15.2).\n\nDHEA-Sulfate was also high (unexpectedly?), at 481.0 ug/dL (reference interval is 138.5-475.2). Everything else was within the reference range.\n\nI have yet to discuss/interpret this information with my doctor, but it does seem there is a correlation among some of us with regard to prolactin levels. I have the same.\n\nHigh prolactin, also very high progesterone and slightly raised DHEA-S. \n\nLike you I do not have that much mental sides.\n\nDid you get progesterone tested? I am also going discuss it with my doctor in the near future.\n\nI would appreciate if you would post here again when you had contact with yours.\n\nEdit: My values for reference:\n\nProlactin - 27.9 ng/dL\nDHEA-S - 479 ug/dL\nProgesterone - 34.6 ng/dL I have exactly the same things since 10y He replied that my prolactin is only mildly abnormal and said it is likely not related to my symptoms, but worth retesting in the fall. I just followed up asking if there is anything I could do it lower it and see if it helps at all. He also said that high DHEA-S may not have clinical significance in men. Progesterone was not tested; I just asked about it, so we will see what he says. Interesting.\n\nDo you have trouble sleeping or insomnia? Nope. If anything, I sleep too much. Just wanted to give you an update since we are in a similar boat.\n\nNo word on progesterone, but my doctor put me on clomiphene, 50 mg every other day, to force testosterone up. My level is already considered normal, but it is over 200 ng/dL lower than it was a couple years ago (pre-PFS), so we want to see if boosting it makes any difference symptomatically.\n\nIf that does not work after a month, he said we can try cabergoline to reduce prolactin. Thank you for the update.\n\nHow high was your T before and after Fin? Also interested if you got your SHBG tested.\n\nHoping that your treatment will work! October 2018 (8 months on finasteride, no side effects yet): 860.95 ng/dL\n\n* Maybe of interest, this test was done in the afternoon instead of early morning as is typically recommended (T levels peak in the morning), so the \"real\" value might have been even higher.\n\nMarch 2021 (PFS): 574 ng/dL (early morning)\n\nJuly 2021 (PFS): 643 ng/dL (early morning)\n\nSHBG was also tested recently, it was 27.2 nmol/L (reference range is 16.5-55.9). Thanks mate.\n\nI see you have pretty low SHBG like me (mine is 22). Many people with PFS has high SHBG.\n\nAnd my T is about same as you as well, I am sitting at 550 ng/dL after a crappy night's sleep due to the heat.\n\nWe seems to suffer from same side effect so when your T start to raise please tell me if you improve. Since our SHBG is on the low side it is like the body wants more free androgens. \n\nI have a feeling finasteride might have damaged my Leydig cells because my LH was slightly above the range. I will let you know if there are any improvements.\n\nMy LH was 7.9 mIU/mL, sort of on the high end of the range. Mine was 9, ref range was up to 8.8 I believe.\n\nWith such high LH do your doctor still think Clomid would help? Since it is course of action to increase T is the raise LH.\n\nBut it is still really interesting how our symptoms and blood show similarities.\n\nMost people I have read about have high SHBG and normal LH. He has not commented on LH specifically, but he does sound skeptical it will make a big difference.\n\nHow severe would you say your symptoms are currently? Depending on what area. Sexual it is pretty bad. Mainly loss of sensitivity in penis and low libido. I can still jerk off if I would want to (but I do not really do). But having sex with a girl would be hard. Even if I could hold my boner with viagra, I would not feel a thing.\n\nOther than that my sleep quality is pretty bad and I do not seem to enjoy doing things like I did before. Other than that my brain seem to function just fine. Not as witty as before maybe. \n\nIf 1 is good and 10 is really fucking bad I am probably around 3-4.\n\nIt is manageable and I can hold a job, but socializing off work and dating girls would be super hard right now. That sucks. On top of everything else not getting good sleep must be hell.\n\nMy symptoms (sexually) seem to vary without rhyme or reason. The best I felt was maybe 80/90% a few months ago, it came and went in less than a week without explanation. Was not even taking anything except Vitamin D.\n\nRight now I am maybe 40%. Libido is barely there at all. I can get a full erection but it is going to be slow and hard to maintain. Penis is thin and rubbery. I have recovered some sensitivity over time, but it is still not great. Update: clomiphene might be helping? Probably too early to tell, but I have noticed an improvement in the quality and ease of getting erections in the last week. Hello Sir!\n\nI appreciate the update, funnily enough I was just thinking about how you have been last night lol.\n\nThat is nice to hear, I hope you will continue improving. Will your Doctor get more blood work done to see where you at (when feeling better)? Thank you. I will check in with him in the next couple of weeks, and probably get blood work done. I will also likely ask to try cabergoline if prolactin is still high. Apparently my T went up to 1406 (from 643 in less than 1 month). Wtf. At Least your balls are working then lol.\n\nHow do you feel? Not super different. Erections are a bit easier to get, I get more of that \"tingling\" sensation when I am aroused. Libido and everything else is still kind of low. It is nice to hear you got some relief at least. But be careful in the long term because Clomid has some nasty sides.\n\nIf you and/or your doctor decide you need a higher T level, T injections (TRT) is way safer in the long run.\n\nDid you discuss Caber or something else to bring your Prolactin down? Are you sure? My doctor said clomiphene was the safer choice of the two because TRT can cause infertility and other issues. And yeah, I should have mentioned I just started cabergoline, 0.25 mg once a week. Yeah I am sure. TRT is basically without side-effects if done right. You can be on TRT for a decades without issues.\n\nFertility goes down while injecting due to lowered FSH. But it is not permanent unless you have been on for a very long time.\n\nBodybuilders who have been on various compounds for years usually have no trouble getting kids after all. \n\nClomid can give permanent damage on eyesight among other adverse effects. It is not a very high risk, but a risk.\n\nInteresting, I would love to hear how Caber works out for you. Thinking about taking it up with my Dr to.\n\nEdit: One source  Okay, I am going to tentatively say that libido is improving on cabergoline. I think it is made more of a difference than clomid thus far. That is nice you are feeling some improvement. I recently visited my GP but he did not hold any answers. Was going to discuss it with his doctors group.\n\nBut I am thinking of asking for caber tbh. I would recommend it. I have even seen the return of morning wood as of late. Any more updates ?", "Another question So I have started to develop insomnia , which blows since I have work on the weekdays. Maybe it is due to anxiety or other reasons. \n\nAny supps or suggestions on how to combat this? Took this week 25mg sleep aid that did not do crap Ashwagandha If you want to blame it on anxiety just remember that fin also definitely causes anxiety as well. This is a very scary drug \ud83d\ude22yet so many men take it because we were vulnerable", "Took for 1 month (weak erections no morning wood) I saw a doctor and they said not to worry about it. But I have been off it for two weeks. It is scary and depressing. I can still get erections and maintain them, but spontaneous erections and morning wood are completely gone. I am grateful, but at the same time scared that this could get worse. \ud83d\ude30 From the medical literature I have read, it sounds like the side effects you are experiencing can typically last the length you took the drug. So try not to panic - there is a great chance this will be resolved in the next few weeks. The fact that you can still get and maintain erections is a good sign. \n\nJust out of curiosity, when did you first begin experiencing the side effects while on the drug and have you experienced any additional side effects, such as low libido or just the lack of morning erections? Please share the citation u/omaha_123. I am somewhat familiar with the published literature and have never seen this guideline that side effects last the length someone took the drug. I found this to be a helpful article as its a summation of a number of studies\n\n( I find that summary problematic in a couple of ways. First, I do not know why they feel the need to discuss how *The Sun* and *The Daily Mail* interpreted a scientific study; it is simply irrelevant. Those are tabloid papers. Of course they are not going to report correctly on a medical journal article.\n\nSecond, the NHS author concludes that the study \"does not give overt cause for concern.\" This is the only study that I know of to identify the primary determinant of persistent erectile dysfunction after stopping finasteride (other than prostate surgery): length of time men took the drug. Men starting finasteride at a young age may well want to continue taking the drug for a year or more. The study found that after 205 days (about seven months), the risk of persistent sexual dysfunction went up. This means that people taking the drug long-term become more vulnerable to persistent (possibly irreversible) sexual dysfunction.\n\nMillions of men take finasteride every year. Are we really comfortable with 1% of millions of men permanently losing sexual function? I do not think that is an acceptable state of affairs.\n\nI have read the Belknap study. I do not believe it says that side effects typically resolve in the amount of time that one took the medication. If you have a citation for that claim, let me know.\n\nHere is the paper:\n\nKiguradze T, Temps WH, Yarnold PR, Cashy J, Brannigan RE, Nardone B, Micali G, West DP, Belknap SM. Persistent erectile dysfunction in men exposed to the 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors, finasteride, or dutasteride. *PeerJ*. 2017;5:e3020. doi:( | (\n\nMore research on adverse effects of finasteride: ( Here is a paper published this year:\n\nKhera M, Than JK, Anaissie J, et al. Penile vascular abnormalities in young men with persistent side effects after finasteride use for the treatment of androgenic alopecia. *Transl Androl Urol*. 2020. (\n\n&gt;**Conclusions:** While the sexual side effects of 5ARIs are well known, there may be persistent genitourinary, physical, psycho-cognitive, anti-androgenic and penile vascular changes after 5ARI discontinuation. Use of 5ARIs for treatment of AGA may lead to persistent sexual, genitourinary, physical, psycho-cognitive, and anti-androgenic sequelae even after cessation of 5ARI therapy. Thanks for all of the info. Thank you for your encouragement. I am going to do my best to stay strong.\n\nLow libido definitely. I basically feel no natural attraction for anyone right now. Also, I feel basically no emotion. Flat affect. So, basically, I am fucked is what you are saying \ud83e\udd14 I forgot to mention that I was having arrhythmias and sharp heart pain. It is what struck me first and what made me stop. I was taking minoxidil as well. Once I stopped taking them the heart issues went away. It was once I stopped that I really took notice of the sexual issues. Oops no I am not. I do not know what will happen for you although I hope you see full recovery. \n\nThis second post was part of my response to an article that another user posted. It was a side discussion. \n\nIt is early for you so I would suggest not worrying about the science. Just take good care of yourself, stay active and let us hope your symptoms resolve. So, today I got morning wood \ud83d\ude4fHopefully, I will get other spontaneous erections back too! \u2764\ufe0f I took 0.5mg for 8 days. Stopped as my penis basically stopped doing anything. A week later it improved. Now almost a month later erections are harder to get, maintain and feel about 70% strength. Morning wood is occasional, but again, weak. Before taking I had zero issues.\n\nHoping this continues to improve, but also kind of shitting myself. I would think maybe it was in my head, but I know my own body and the morning erections been weak cannot be a nocebo. It is getting better every day! I encourage anyone that experiences sexual dysfunction with finasteride to stop immediately. I took it for 1 month too man. I am slowly getting better but I feel like I am giving myself PFS. Any advice ??? My best advice is to fill your time with things you enjoy. Also, find a way you can be there for other people. My mom had total knee replacement surgery and I have been taking care of her. So, I have barely had time to think about it. \n\nAlso, it might help to see a doctor and tell them about it. For me, I told them I would take no medicine. I just wanted them to check my levels. It was merely for my own peace of mind. After they told me my levels were ok, I calmed down a bit. Yesteday, I was able to masturbate 3 times. And this is only 5 day\u2019s after stopping. I noticed it getting better yesteday but then I found out some people get better and then they crash and now I am freaking myself. I am becoming so suicidal I know it is scary, but focusing on it will only bring more anxiety. Every situation is different. We all have different body chemistry. It could take shorter or longer. I am pretty much better now. I am at like 80% or so. \n\nWhat do you like doing? What makes you happy? These are lines of thought that will be important to focus on for the next few weeks. I just tried jerking off with no luck. I feel even worse. There is nothing to do in NYC rn. I am so stuck. I want to die What do you usually do for fun? Work out Do whatever exercises you can inside. Push ups, sit ups, stretches, etc. Do you think as a 17 year old I will be fine? I only took it for 25-26 days. I feel that you will. Just hang in there. Give yourself a year. Eat healthfully, do your exercises, drink lots of water. It is going to be alright. A year ?? What Yes, give yourself a year. That is a buffer. I know that sounds like a long time, but it really is not. I am not saying it will take a year, but it sounds like you are hyperfocusing. Focusing on long term health will take the pressure off for it to get better now. I hope you are right man. It is been 4 days since I got off the pill . Yesteday I was able to jerk off. This morning I was not. My anxiety is killing it. I just feel today was that \u201ccrash\u201d PFS forums talk about. My stress and my suicidal thoughts are at a point where I could never imagine it before this. I would not wish this pain and stress on anyone. I am really sorry. I think, at this point, addressing your emotional state might be the best place to start. As happy as I am that you sought support, sifting through these forums personally caused me a lot of anxiety. I felt a lot better when I focused my mind and effort on other things. Maybe take a break from masturbating for a bit and that could help take your mind off of it. I will try my best. I just hope I can put this pill behind me. All the doctors I am talking about are saying the pills side effects are always reversible. Would you say you made a full 360? That you are back to normal before the pill? I do not get aroused as easily as I used to. To be fair, I had an extremely high drive. Like, high... Now, I would say I have what would be considered an average drive 100%.  My erections are full on. I am feeling really good about it. My goal is a year from the day that I stopped, to reassess / see where I am at. I can only pray to have results like you. How old are you man? I was worrying it would never come back for weeks. I am not even really sure when I started normalizing because I just stopped thinking about it for awhile. I am in my 30\u2019s. I am hoping and praying for the best for you\ud83d\ude4f You are a good man. Thank you. I have an appointment with a urologist anyway. This is going to be a journey. I will remember you. You really helped me with my anxiety about it. Great! It will be good for you to see someone. Do not let them talk you into sildenafil or other erection meds. That is an absolute last resort. You do not want to fall down the prescription bandaid rabbit hole. That shit has a bunch of nasty side effects too.\n\nAbsolutely, feel free to dm me if you want. I will keep you in mind as well. \n\nAlso, I am experimenting with peppermint oil and scalp massage. Turns out there were studies done that were documented by the National Institute of Health that indicated peppermint oil was allegedly twice as effective on mice as minoxidil and without the nasty side effects. \n\nI will say that my bald spots were numb... completely numb when I started and I did not even realize it until I started doing this. Now, I can feel my scalp again. It is weird shit. \n\nI also noticed that I always sleep on my back. The main bald spot is exactly on the area of my scalp that presses against the pillow at night when I sleep, which also happens to be the numb spot.\n\nI spoke to my parents and apparently I would lay down a lot when I was a baby. So much, that part of my head would go bald. And I have been laying down playing switch and texting a lot for the last two years \ud83e\udd14which is around the time frame when I started to see thinning.\n\nEither way, whether I go bald or not. I will have tried my best, while still caring about my health, which I can feel good about \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f That is really interesting Hey man.  Listen.  I am going through a similar thing, but I was on it for more than 2 years.  I believe the fact that you have been on it for so short a time means you will surely recover.  You are panicking do intensely right now that you are shutting your body down.  I did the same thing when I was like 22 when I was fucking my gf and I lost my erection.  I convinced myself that there was something with me, and this in turn caused me to have trouble getting erections and having no libido for months.  My anxiety about sex produced those effects.  I got better in a few months.  In your case, it might be that the Propecia has produced some unwanted effects, but since you have been on it for less than a month, I am nearly positive they will go away.  But if you continue to freak out like you are, which is understandable, then surely nothing will work.  Yesterday you were able to jerk but this morning you were not?  You are in an obsessive storm right now and you need to calm down.  Again, you have been on it for 20 something days\u2014everything will be fine.  Breathe my brother.  It is going to be ok.  DM me if you need to. Everything alright now?", "I am 20 yo and been on finestaride for 9 ish months, if I stop now, wold my body continue to develop like normal? Read that the body develops to 25 and I was a late bloomer. Thanks  If you continue using finasteride, your body hair will quite likely grow in alot less. If 't be true thee continueth using finasteride, thy corse hair shall quite likely groweth in alot less\n\n***\n\n\n\n^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)\n\nCommands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout` Omg bro U r 20 u r so young why did you take Finasteride, I know because of hair loss. Your sex-life is damaged How so? If u do not know why, then I guess your fine. There are changes in the body that only you can sense Double checking are you able to get erection when you see a hot girl Never in my life have I only got an erection just by looking But I can still get an erect ion by laying next to one, only some reduction in quality Are you sticking with Finasteride Want to take a break for some time because I feel like I could develop more, maybe I never get back on again if the difference in how I feel is big Lastly and most importantly do you still enjoy sex Yeah You seem fine", "Mucuna pruriens!! Must try Was really effective for me. Give it a go Give us some background . In which department did it help. What is you symptoms and for how long did you have them. More info please? Do not mind my english.\nTook finasteride for 3 months, stopped and suffered mainly from acute brain fog, poor libido and some major depressive symptoms. Have tried various \u201cnatural testosterone boosters\u201d like tribulus, shilajit, high dose zinc, maca. Worked to some extent but mucuna was by far the most effective for all the 3 symptoms especially the depression part, libido is not completely normal but much better, brain fog also improved. Maca root was quite effective for improving libido so now i am going to combine maca and mucuna and hope for best What was your last libido symptoms before and after? It just did not work before, had been months since it got erect not even with porn. Now atleast it gets hard while watching porn. But it was really the depression part in which it was game changer Did you get morning erections back? I take l-citrulline and it is like mini viagra. Got everything working again.  I could try maca too.\n\nFor macuna, how long did it take to notice a difference? Any side effects? Do you find yourself \"enjoying life\" more? Have tried l cirtuline and it was decent. L arginine worked better for me. Mucuna worked for me from the first dose really. I do not have any sides but people say it is not safe to take long term because it is a potent dopamine booster so you need to cycle it. For libido maca is really the best thing i have tried. I believe a combination of maca and mucuna can cure many people in this sub And yes, I 100% enjoy my life more Yes I am reading some people on macuna had a rebound effect when they came off it. Be careful. I know but am just reluctant to stop it because of how good it makes me feel. It also is the best thing to reduce prolactin levels. L tyrosine is a safer alternative to mucuna and it works but just does not compare to mucuna for me. And i have welbutrin ( an ndri ) just in case if my dopamine receptors get shot. How many months has it been since you quit fin now ? I have had some success with l-tyrosine as well but stopped taking it. Do you find with the reduced prolactin levels you are able to have sex or masturbate more than once a day without the fatigue? This is the key question. Mucuna raises Dopamine levels through precursor L-Dopa. It does work for the mood in any phase of recovery or in general. But watch out cause it has some nasty potential sides. Be aware and Do your research. For how long did you have side effects? When did you stop finasteride? I can confirm this + MACA helped a ton. Would you say it is normal for guys with Libido and erection probs to recover within 6-12 months ? In what areas did it help? Anecdotally, it seems that recovery within 6 months is the most common. 6-24 months slightly less so.", "Fuck finasteride. Took fin for 2 weeks at .5 eod, switched to 1mg every day for 3 days until the brain fog and anxiety started... Said fuck this and quit taking it and everything got better withing a few days but  after a couple weeks, i still keep getting hit with these waves of anxiety and panic attacks.. Dick seems to work fine and everything, it is just this anxiety and panic attacks.", "robin Williams used propecia ", "6 months looking for some advice on how you guys would go about this. So I am at 4 months post fin with sides (check earlier posts) but am at a bit of a crossroads. \n\nI see lots of people saying for the first 6 months you should just not do anything really just try and stay healthy eat good and exercise, no porn etc. The problem is that I have been speaking to a girl I like on a dating app who wants to meet up for a few drinks etc (maybe like mid February). \n\nDo you think I just say fuck it and agree to meet and go all out, train hard and take supps like tongkat Ali, mucuna pruriens, etc and amino acids like l-citrulline and just hope by month 5 I am good enough to date her etc. Maybe take cialis or something if it comes to it. \n\nIt is either that or I tell her right now I am having some mental health problems in my life and it is not a good time and that if she is still cool with it and wants to I meet her later in the year, provided I am a bit better etc.", "Signs of recovery 2+ So its been 17 days since my sides started. I was having some left testicle pain and that went away. Ive had a few days where my libido shot up and got erections and sometimes morning wood, then it dips, although sometimes I feel a little when I watch porn. I got a lot of vivid dreams but that is starting to dissipate, today I got pretty good sleep. Oddly, my body hair growth slowed down and it seems like it got thinned out? Ive heard that during recovery there is ups and downs. Hopefully I ill recover all the way soon! Wish you guys the best. Good to hear that you are feeling better, although it seems like you recovered within the normal timeframe. As I understand it, the vast majority of people who get side effects recover within six months. Hopefully it gets better I dont want to get my hopes up Just be patient and do not stress out about it. Pick up some healthy habits. Avoid stress. You will be fine, but it might take a few months. \n\nIf you still have problems after a year, you might want to try some medical interventions or serious lifestyle change. That is very interesting. When I felt like I was finally recovering a couple months ago, I started getting extremely vivid dreams too. A lot of the dreams were either violent or sexual in nature. Yeah its crazy, how are you doing now? What data is this based on, that the vast majority recover within six months? I am not necessarily disputing it, but want to understand the basis for what you are saying. You can find data about 5AR taking about a month to regain function after finasteride use. \n\nThe claim that most recover within 6 months is anecdotal - I have just a read a ton of these narratives. People post in panic about these crazy symptoms and then a) pop up a few months later to declare that they have recovered, or b) are never heard from again. It seems reasonable to assume that people who never post again probably recovered, or at least recovered to such a degree that they did not find value in posting anything. Thanks. I have also read a lot of these stories. It is my impression that a *majority* have some level of recovery, but I do not have confidence in the phrase \"vast majority.\"\n\nAnother question is what \"recovery\" means. I see a lot of people who say things like \"I am mostly OK but penis sensitivity is at 65%\"\u2014more than 6-12 months after stopping. That is a partial recovery, but it is also a significant harm that could be permanent.\n\nI think support can help as people go through symptoms after stopping\u2014but I also think people should be getting accurate information, and not speculation to make people feel better\u2014even if well-intended. I say this as a general observation.\n\nIt is a fine balance. The specter of permanent harm is terrifying, but there is a chance it will happen. I do not think it is a good idea to lead with this. Support is good. I have relied on: \"We do not know what will happen\" (as well as suggestions to take care of oneself, get sleep and exercise, and avoid supplements and medications). I believe it is more prudent and accurate to say we do not know, than that the vast majority of people recover.\n\nP.S. Regarding this:\n\n&gt;You can find data about 5AR taking about a month to regain function after finasteride use.\n\nFine, but clearly there are some lasting effects in some people that we do not understand, so I cannot rely on that textbook information to determine what proportion of people recover from post-discontinuation adverse effects. You are right, I should probably tone down the confidence level of my statements. I think I would rather say \"it *seems* like most recover in 6-12 months\".\n\nAlso agree that that encouragement can quickly turn into false hope... Which could turn into crushing disappointment and more intense mental symptoms.\n\nI think I am leaning on the optimistic side because I think one potential driver of PFS is the inability to handle stress (interference with neurosteroids and epinephrine at the same time) and the bad feedback loop that it can produce.\n\nIf I had a way to succinctly and convincingly say \"immediately adopt massive lifestyle change and organize your life around stress reduction, while also know that you have excellent chances of recovering\", that is the advice I would give to new sufferers, but that is hard to explain the full rationale in a short Reddit comment. Or perhaps I am just lazy :P", "Very excited for the future I just quit finasteride after taking it for almost 9 months. It has not even been a month since I discontinued it and I feel so much better. I had an array of side effects, and it even landed me in the ER. It is a very long and stressful story of my experience with Fin, and I cannot be more grateful to know that what I was experiencing were side effects and not an underlying serious condition like I thought all along. I was having many of the side effects manifesting in my GI tract, and I am very thankful that it is getting better. \n\nI would have stopped fin much sooner had my doctor said that fin was causing my heart palpitations, diarrhea, chills, anxiety, weight loss, appetite loss, libido loss, and many other symptoms. Unfortunately, he said fin does not cause these issues, so I kept taking it. \n\nNot only did fin cause these issues in my body, but it also made a ton of my hair shed without ever growing it back. \n\nI just want people to be aware of these possible side effects, even if my case it anecdotal. If you are taking fin and notice a change in your bowel movements, there is a possibility that fin could be the cause. I would hate for someone to go through what I did for 8 months.", "Had side effects after 3 days; Stopped taking fin but still have ED 2 days out I began taking finasteride 5 days ago at 0.25 mg every night. I felt tingling on my penis on day 2, jolts of abdominal pain on days 2/3/4, and experienced ED on day 3. It feels like penis just shut off. \n\nAfter feeling these sides I decided to stop taking finasteride. It is been 3 days since I stopped and I still have ED. \n\nCurrently my genital area has no feeling of arousal and has been shriveled up for 3 days. I cannot get hard without intense manual stimulation, and only for briefly. It feels completely different down there and it has made me quite anxious.\n\nAlso, oddly, I have had dry mouth and chapped lips since day 2.\n\nI took fin with the understanding that only 2% of people get sides. I guess I just happened to be one of the unlucky ones \u2014 so unlucky that 0.25 mg gave me sides. \n\nI do not know how long this will last or if this will turn into PFS. When might this ED go away? Has anyone here had a similar experience having ED that eventually went away after stopping?\n\nI plan on adding updates about how this turns out over next few weeks hey man, I was in your exact same situation about 3 months ago. took .33 mg every day for about 2 weeks, halfware into week 2, I start noticing ED. Then near the end of week 2, If I tried to have sex or masturbate, I would literally cum before I got hard. It scared me shitless.  \n\n\nI would say every week it got better. After about 1-2 months I would say I was nearly 100%. I would say now I am 100% back for sure. After a couple weeks you will stop thinking about it, other than the fact that you cant mess with fin anymore which sucks in its own way.  \n\n\nI was on this reddit making this exact same post at the same time you are now. Do not worry man, you are good. Just wait it out A couple thoughts:\nBetween you and me, the 2% is a lie. I cannot prove it, but I know it is true. \n\nI was in the exact same situation a month ago (21M). Took 2 pills. After 2nd pill, low libido (no interest in women), and erectile dysfunction. I stopped. Symptoms persisted for 2-3 days, then slowly went away over the course of 5 more days. I am never taking fin again.\n\nSome people take a little longer to recover even for the same amount of pills taken.(usually the minimum recovery time is 3 days. The average is probably a week or two. The maximum is probably 5+ years, and an unfortunate percentage never recover.)\n\nJust be patient and positive. A positive outlook works miracles in the medical world.\n\nEdit: and do yourself a favor and never take fin again. Thank you for the encouragement, it is seriously what I have been needing to hear\u2026 I feel so doomed at the moment. How did you distract yourself from  the lack of feeling down there? It feels like there is a void between my legs Eh, it just takes time for you to get over it. The first few days are stressful. Then it slowly gets better and then its easier to deal with.   \n\n\nChances are in a few days, you will have some more feeling, then some more and so on. Just know its not going to happen over night and not to expect it to. and do not look at this sub, that is honestly the worst thing you can do Sounds like hard flaccid which I have Bc of fin also but seems to be getting better\u2026 In the leaflet of proscar Merck mentioned 10% with ED and 10% with lowered libido\nThere is nothing told about only 2%. \nSo if you stopped taking Finasteride 3 days ago, than do not take it again!!!! Please wait until the side effects go away. The time period seems to be two weeks to 3 months. For the majority they go away. But do not make any experiments, do not risk to get PFS, by using any other endocrine disruptor anymore.", "Scared I am a 25 year old man who has previously taken finasteride for over two years. I had relatively mild side effects during the treatment itself, but they increased in strength the second year. I therefore chose to end the treatment. The treatment was stopped \"cold turkey\". In the time that followed, I got back morning wood and everything seemed normal. This changed quickly. \n\nOne month after finishing treatment, I completely lost potency and a large vein developed on the penis that ached. I went to an urologist who had no good explanation. Potency reduction was followed by fatigue. This affected me so much that I had to apply for sick leave. I felt completely outside. The symptoms have only gotten worse in the last 10 months. I can no longer train (I previously ran at the national level) and I get tired extremely quickly. I also experience very large fluctuations in mood. Nothing else has happened in my life. \n\nThe pain in the penis persisted for two months, now the blood vessel is there and I am struggling with getting an erection. I have seen several doctors. It was at my last doctor's visit that the urologist reacted to the fact that I had used finasteride. I had not stated this before and he did not have access to the original journal. He said that they had observed cases of such \u00abcrash\" increasingly, but that there was no research on the condition. He could not give me any further advice. \n\nI have never had any medical problems before. Family and friends have responded to the change. I do not know what to say to them. I have not talked about this with anyone other than the doctors. I have become aware that PFS is not a recognized condition. So I do not know what to believe. \n\nI will probably lose my girlfriend soon. She knows something is very wrong, but I do not want to say what it is. My family is worried too. I withdraw more and more from those I love. The condition can not be hidden, I get tired extremely quickly. I consider myself a resourceful person, but this has broken me.

They do not necessarily read the literature and connect the dots.\n\nPerhaps you could share some relevant papers with him. Hey man, could you google 'Lymphangiosclerosis'? Beware for the graphic images, but im kind of curious whether the penile symptoms you experience resemble that?  Then doctors should exercise more caution. In my profession as a lawyer, it is assumed that the guidance is up to date. Any uncertainty should be expressed or followed up. Absolute truths are simple, and are often what the client wants.

Having males self reporting of their sexual function instead of using quantitative measurements is bound to skew the result. I am sorry to hear this, friend. I know it is scant consolation, but I know first hand how awful it to get side effects from these drugs (well, I took Minoxidil, but still - it is much of a muchness). If you ever want someone to talk to or offload on, I would be more than happy to chat. It is not a cure, but I have found that talking to a sympathetic ear that actually believes your side effects rather than gaslighting, as most doctors do, can improve mental health.

You had zero progress sexually until 10 months? Not zero. ED slightly improved in the first couple of months. But the bulk of my progress happened after the 10-month mark.

I have been taking multi vitamins and a vitamin D supplement. You likely pushed something past it is new post-fin baseline so your body has compensated by down regulating slightly. Do not worry, it will bounce back. Supplements that are prohormonal or are adatogenic are you friend in the long run but if you are in the first six months or so this can happen.\n\nIf I was you I would take ZMA at night instead of mega-dosing Zinc like that. I, too, get problems from zinc. It is commonly noted in the PFS that certain supplements or drugs can make you feel off. Zinc in high doses makes me exhausted and slightly worsens all my symptoms.

I did not really have bad hairloss but they say you need to start while you still have hair to keep what you have, and It had been sitting in my cabinet for over a year (thanks to ( who sent it along with the minoxodil id been happily using for a year) so I said screw it one night and began the nightmare.  About 6 weeks in i started getting a headache and I started getting depressed. I kindof suspected it might be the fin but not so much that it would be causing a 'nocebo' effect at that point. I quit fin about 2 weeks after the headache started. Two weeks later I felt back to normal almost, headache was gone, then two weeks after that I had the infamous crash which included all the sexual sides (had not had any sexual sides up till that point) and raging depression/anxiety (thankfully the headache never returned) and that is when it was gameover for me, i now knew my body was significantly disrupted by this drug. Being a hypochondriac already this is the absolute worst possible situation cause it is a disease that causes such terrible effects and doctors cant diagnose or treat, and there is no mortality rate so you have to figure out a way to live with it lol I really see no way out. It is been about 2 months and sexual sides have improved (I can get 80 percent erection, have about 50% labido, my beard was not growing properly but now seems like its growing better) but anxiety and depression are worse. Had to take a leave from work and currently doing psychiatric treatment for this, which unfortunately means ssri's which I heard can make things worse but my support people are forcing me to follow through, and its not helping at all with the anxiety/depression. I made contact with this dr. bruhin guy that is all over the internet as a psych guy that knows about PFS .. maybe it will help to just to talk to someone regularly that knows what PFS is. All my life I have been responsible to not overdue drugs or alchohol and stay on a relatively good track when it comes to my health. Too bad society does not ring the bell louder about dangerous pharmaceutical drugs and the predatory companies like Keeps that peddle them around. Hang in there everyone. Damn, my mental sides went away after about 4 months? Maybe closer to 5? \n\nSexual sides stopped, almost 6 months after I stopped taking fin.  \n\nWorkout, drink water, getting proper sleep are the keys to getting back to normal.  \n\nIt is so fucked up how I cannot even tell you what was worse, the sexual sides or mental sides.  I have improved a lot from August and September, and am thankful for that.  \n\nGood luck!  With time I am sure there will be improvements. Please use paragraphs, a wall of text is very hard on your readers.\n\nPunching yourself in the testicles is not a PFS cure, it will just injure you, so do not do that. Did the mental sides resolve gradually? im 2 months off fin, sexual sides resolved after 3 days, but the severe anxiety and depression has only been resolved for about 30-40%. I took fin last July and I definitely noticed I was better mentally in December, a lot better in January and even this month I have noticed there has been improvement. \n\n Tbh, there were times in January I was feeling great, but I feel as though it comes in waves.  Does that make sense?  I will feel great for a week or so, and then like shit for a few days.  But I think the better days are lasting longer. Also, I am an optimistic person, so I just know I will be fine. \n\nI am sure you are anxiety and depression will ease up withing 6 months to a year.  2 months off is not really all that long. \n\nBtw, I took tribulus at the end of August, felt great while taking it, then had a crash.  \n\nAt the end of October I took a product called N2Generate, again felt great while on it, and I feel as thought it helped my mental sides (could have just been timing), but then had a crash again.  \n\nI feel that just letting your body recover on its own is the best course of action.  That is what had been suggested in older posts as well. Thanks alot, I must also add that, being in my last year, about to graduate in a while, and being an intern working 100% from home, being socially isolated and a myriad of other things sure doesnt help. I am now taking zinc, magnesium and gaba, and i feel like the gaba makes me sleep like an angel, which i love.   \nI would say my anxiety has halved, peaking in the evenings, and depression and motivation has improved by 30%.

Tbh, it is Sept until the end of November I would mostly just a blur.  With the lockdown in place everyday seems the same.  I remember having brain fog, and just feeling as though everything was very unreal.  Derealisation is what that is called.  \n\nI do not really remember the days, sorry.  Do not worry though.

But for those suffering really bad I wanted to check my levels soon. Somebody recommended the Dutch Test plus. Some small info on these three important neurosteroids associated with PFS.\n\nProgesterone\nNormally, the brain contains a very high concentration of progesterone, reflecting its protective function for that most important organ. The thymus gland, the key organ of our immune system, is also profoundly dependent on progesterone. \n\nPregnenalone\nIt is now known that pregnenolone is one of the major hormones in the brain. It is produced by certain brain cells, as well as being absorbed into the brain from the blood. It protects brain cells from injury caused by fatigue, and an adequate amount has a calming effect on the emotions, which is part of the reason that it protects us from the stress response that leads to an excessive production of cortisone. People feel a mood of resilience and an ability to confront challenges. \n\nPregnenolone is largely converted into two other \"youth-associated\" protective hormones, progesterone and DHEA. At the age of 30, both men and women produce roughly 30 to 50 mg. of pregnenolone daily. When taken orally, even in the powdered form, it is absorbed fairly well. One dose of approximately 300 mg (the size of an aspirin tablet) keeps acting for about a week, as absorption continues along the intestine, and as it is \"recycled\" in the body. Part of this long lasting effect is because it improves the body's ability to produce its own pregnenolone. It tends to improve function of the thyroid and other glands, and this \"normalizing\" effect on the other glands helps to account for its wide range of beneficial effects.", "Photophobia and head pain Been off finasteride for 2 months and still have cognitive issues with head pain and sensitivity to light.

I have ED, muscle atrophy, fatuiged and I lost definitely every lust for live. \n\nAll the other guys with PFS stand up in the morning, going to work, using supplement, exercise in the gym. Some have relationships.\n\nAm I the only one hanging down. Are my Neurosteroides so out of control? it must be a change / injury in the system, would not stay otherwise\n\nthe epigenetic change is a very possible explanation It is as live is switched off. I have no feelings anymore. I do not pay bills. Incasso acts floating my Mailbox. I cannot act anymore. I only life from backery shops and pizza service. I do not have a house hold anymore. My car is full of garbage from eating in gas station shops. I do not clean up the house anymore. I even have no relationship to my little daughter anymore. I just want to die. yes I understand you It is like lobotomy. I sometimes sit there saying nothing and stare against the wall. I have used the word lobotomy to describe it as well. A terrible feeling of being a slower, stupider, and less capable person. Bro just hop on TRT+HCG+proviron. There was no epigenetic change, your 60 years of age not 18-25 . Ur getting old and have lost your drive. Go to a TRT clinic get some bloods done and get back moving. Half a year can seen like a lot of time to live with these symptoms. But you might just have to give it more time, and try take care of your diet and sleep the best you can. Are any of your symptoms getting better?\n\nPersonally, I had continuous small improvements the first two years. The first 3 months was sheer hell, but then I improved to the point where I was able to work again. Next week I make an appointment with a doctor to improve my hormones. I am &lt;30 and have almost the same issues he have, although not as extreme.\n\nMy hormones are perfectly fine.\n\nI would love to hear your opinion on where the issue may lie.  We know about the epigenetic changes after quitting Finasterid in predisposed guys. After quitting Fin and  the increase of DHT our AR Genes are not downregulated like in the 99,9% normal fin users, we have an upregulation because of a wrong feedback from the tissues and AR Genes are overexpressed. Too much AR over signaling silences the AR in the cells. The next unknown mechanism.\n\nHormones and all the other effects are secundary. Hope the theory is true and cure will be available in my lifetime. Pretty sure it is ur age \nYou are 60 yuaybe need trt We really need some more active moderation on here to weed out low-effort trolling.  FPS is real but it sounds like your lifestyle right now is only going to make things 10x worse. Start getting in the gym and eating clean and you will at least feel better physically and will have more motivation Half a year is not a huge timespan for this condition. I really started to improve after a year or two. The first couple of months are a nightmare but it is going to get better. But you need to follow a healthy lifestyle to support your body. Go to the gym, take walks in nature, take supplements, meditate, eat healthy, stay away from alcohol and cigarettes, stay positive. You might have low grade environmental poisoning. I did a Dotox and my morning wood came back. It is like ah you have AIDS do a tea cure and you will be heathy again. The pharma  fighter are cynical. The requirements for a cure demand you test things that are beyond what others think is right for them. Otherwise you are stuck. What is trt?

Update us please.", "Can I recover? Under Fin and minoxidol about 6 and a half months . A week ago finding out I cant have morning wood anymore and I cant get boner even I watch exotic porn . I can only get boner if  I do manual stimulation to my penis . But it get softened easily if i no longer touch it . Also orgasm with watery sperm . Now only quitted for two days , I am really worried now .\ud83d\ude14 Im really worried can someone talk to me? I am having some side effects too like I feel like I am loosing my vision How long did you take fin? Hey guys absolutely stop using fin right away and do not go back on it. You will recover shortly after discontinuing. Literally this is coming from a Dr. I had just seen. Also I personally experienced these sides after being on fin for less than 2 months. 2 weeks after I am pretty much back to normal. Just give it some time. 3 months bro and I threw it out yesterday! I am worried too bro like I cannot even focus even when I am driving like my brain is all over the place not trynna freak you out or anything what other side effects do you have ? What was your side effects? Worsened Gyno , breast pain , and now very low libido , like Ill have no reaction even a hot naked woman is in front of me \ud83d\ude1f.\nI should stop it once i no longer have morning wood . I did not pay attention to that cause I was still able to get boner when watching porn . But now I even cant . \nLife is hard But I insisted until now . 6 and a half month I would try to be careful with excessive masturbation.\n\nWhen you are not getting a good solid boner it is really easy to develop peyronie's due to microtrauma to the penis.\n\nDHT inhibition affect the integrity of the penis negatively. What should u do now?\nStop the drug , get rest , eat vitamin and do gym . \nWhat else can I do ? \nShould I go to see a doc? Never experienced libido as low as now . \ud83d\ude1f Maybe irreseversible damages are already done to my body Could not achieve as strong of an erection as I could before, and it would not last very long. It would go away quickly if I did not do anything with it. But it is pretty much back to normal now (after I stopped using fin about 2 weeks ago) Just stop using it. You will get back to normal Bro I cannot even go to the gym anymore cause I am so weak like I used to go crazy! That shit is killing me Yes, stop the drug. Some people believe tapering is better than stopping cold turkey, but there is no evidence either way is actually better. So do what you think is best.\n\nTry to get good routines. Go to bed early each day and wake up about same time. Get outside in the sun in the morning every day, this will help your internal clock (which is responsible for metabolism/hormones etc).\n\nTry to get some light exercise, but be careful not to overdo it. You do not want excessive stress right now.\n\nEat good and healthy food, but be careful with antiandrogenic foods.\n\nYou could go see a doc if you want, but it is very unlikely they will be able to help you.\n\nIt takes some weeks for finasteride to leave your body then about 30 days for 5AR enzyme to recycle.\n\nThat is why they say it can take up to ~3 months before drawing any conclusion. Should I see the doc and get some medicines?\nAlso should I masturbate? Do not stop cold turkey. Do it gradually. It might help if you will have pfs &gt;you will recover shortly after discontinuing\n\nThere is zero guarantee of this. More than likely, yes you will recover. But there is still a small chance you will not, Merck admits this More likely then not, you will recover. Most people with PFS admit their condition is very rare and it is not considered PFS unless you have symptoms for more than 3 months after cessation not more than 3 months. more like 1 year Isnt 5ar permanently damaged and cant be replenished for pfs patients? I can agree ssris will raise allopregnanolone levels which will calm you down and be at more peace but the long term effects should be considered. Might compound pfs\u2019s adverse effects It is a theory, but it is never been proven.\n\nWhat we know is that serum DHT most often return to normal. But serum DHT is almost only synthesized in the liver.\n\nWe also know that in the brain several 5AR metabolites is missing or low. But we do not know why.\n\nIt could be due to damaged AR, but most likely it is due to something else. What is it likely due to? I strongly believe the mental psychiatric sides are from the low allopregnanolone levels from fin and dude to a disruption in the sensitive chemistry between gaba binding allopregnanolone and the nmda receptors. Out of balance equals to extreme anxiety It is almost impossible to taper with this drug. It is almost as if merck wanted it to be hard I have taken it for 6 months (1mg every other day). It is been almost a year since stopping and my sexual sides (no libido, ED, numbness, etc.) have not improved at all. Are you Azerbaijani? no im turkic tho Extreme anxiety? zibil (in your username) means trash in azerbaijani, therefore asked Yeah How many months after quit fin now? Updated: \nAfter quitting finasteride , i got 2 weeks of recovery feeling like normal , then one month now , I clashed again . \nDo not know abt the reasons , maybe due to high dose vitamin b and e . \nI got Worsened symptoms like numb penis , 0 libido and 0 spontaneous erection.\nMental side maybe depression but sometimes i feel like Im always very Clam to surrounding", "is it safe to take finasteride if you have pre existing gynecomastia ? if no why ? does it make it wors ? need help plz D: TBH gyno is the least of your worries on fin, but I assume that it cold definitely make you gyno worse. Yes it is safe, gynecomastia is non life threatening. \n\nI believe that it would make your pre-existing gyno worse. It will make it worse. Fin will increase estrogen. I had pre existing gyno and find did not make my gyno worse. I would prefer manboobs instead of a bald head. You can hide your chest everyday, cannot say the same for the head. Just my two cents Most of people tells me that it definitely make it wors you must be one of the lucky ones , Also What about other side effects , did you get any ? Fin is a testosterone booster, raise in test means raise in estrogen. ppl will comment on ur skin being soft and ur face becomes rounder like when ur a teenager. So yeah it will make it worse. yeah man, serious anxiety, depression, and ED for a short while It can cause gyno, it can make pre-existing worse but like with anything it is not guaranteed. I had pubertal gyno and started taking fin for 6 months before I had my gyno surgery.     \n    \nDid not make it any worse as far as I am aware. I have been on fin for a total of 1 year and 3 months and no, it has not grown back in the 9 months since I had surgery Thnk you bro, what abt other side effects ? I have personally had none Hey can you tell me what do you mean by short while ? was it in the first week of taking fin ?", "Recovered! Heres my story: I took 5 1mg pills from May 7 - May 12. At first I noticed intense blue balls and higher sex drive. About 2 weeks later is when I noticed the sides. These include only the following:\n\n\\- Libido loss to around 0%-5% (somedays)\n\n\\- Waking up in the middle of the night (made worse by smoking and masturbation)\n\n\\- Would feel dizzy/lightheaded from caffeine\n\n\\- Vivid dreams\n\n\\- Brainfog (Functioned normally but felt lightheaded/high)\n\n\\- Body hair loss/thinning\n\n\\- Anxiety (due to the sides occurring and reading horror stories online)\n\n\\- Left testicle pain which turned out to be epididymitis \n\n\\- Less sperm volume\n\nMy recommendations: Stop reading online horror stories (this is my biggest mistake), live a healthy lifestyle, and be patient.\n\n7 months later I am doing  much better. All those sides went away and I sleep fine. Only thing left is epididymitis which is healing and bodyhair slowly growing back. Hopefully you guys reading this will heal up and be normal again. I wish you the best. Thanks for reading!", "What helps with ball ache pls someone help Help me", "A New Victim Hi everyone - I am unfortunately the newest victim to this shitty drug. I took it for 2 weeks and experienced the first ED of my life on the 15th day. I have not had a real erection in WEEKS.\n\nThis is not okay, this is not normal, this drug is BAD.\n\nI am hoping that I can connect with other guys who are going through the same thing. I encourage everyone to keep sharing their stories so that we may find a way to recover.\n\nThanks everyone. Hoping we all get better soon. Stay positive. My guy was on Finasteride for about two years. Most of his sexual &amp; mental side effects were gone within about 6 months of stopping use. He kept up his healthy diet and activity level. He worked at staying positive. He avoided supplements and extreme tactics. Stay busy and nourish your mind and body with a healthy and balanced intake. Learn stress management techniques. Give it time. Taking Finasteride is like playing Russian Roulette. Best wishes for supporting connections during your time of healing Is it complete ED, and do you have any other symptoms?\n\nHere is hoping you recover swiftly. I really appreciate this comment. Thank you.\n\nMan, I cannot even believe this is real life. Never thought this would happen to me. But if your guy recovered, then I have faith that I can too.\n\nThanks again for the support. Hey bro, first of all thank you for your well wishes.\n\nTo answer your question, it is almost complete ED. For example - no random erections throughout the day, I mean not even one. Like I used to get those literally all the time.\n\nTechnically, I can jerk off if I want, but it is terrible. I have to work 3 times as hard to get an 80% erection, and even then it is very hard to sustain. If I pull my hand away it flips back down. It is completely not the same.\n\nAs far as other side effects: huge loss of appetite and fatigue. And RINGING IN THE EARS. Holy hell this might be the worst part.\n\nAny other questions I would be happy to answer. Stay safe. The ED description pretty much matches my experiences in the early days. And I have ( but never experienced it myself. It sounds truly awful. All I can offer for now is hang in there, there is a good chance you will get better. Thanks dude. Appreciate it.\n\nSo if my experience matches your experience, how long did it take for you to get better? What was the timeline? (Assuming this was in reply to me) It is been a slow, gradual process. Generally speaking, I felt somewhat functional sexually (NOT recovered) after 2-3 months. My erections were still weak and hard to maintain for long, but it was definitely less of a struggle to feel aroused. Note, all of this started almost a year ago for me.\n\nNow fast forward to the present day, I am measurably better, often at anywhere between 75-95% of my normal feeling. I personally attribute this (your mileage may vary, this is completely anecdotal and unscientific) to my decision to start weightlifting at the start of 2021. I just hit the weight machines at the gym 30-60 minutes a day, 4 days a week. I have to keep it up though: if I go too long without working out, the progress seems to disappear. It could be something to do with my testosterone levels, which I am getting checked soon.\n\nAnd just throwing this out there, a lot of people take various supplements and meds (zinc, Cialis, L-Citrulline, etc.) to help them, but all I have taken so far is Vitamin D3 (1000 IU) and it really helps my mood during these depressive winter months. Gotcha. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining all that.\n\n(And yes, post was for you, should have hit the reply button! Lol) Hi Coriander,\n\nI am a 23 years old guy who took a pill 3 months ago, and I am still battling with sexual sides, flat emotions and slight tinnitus.\n\nI just wanted to let you know that my tinnitus was unbearable at the beginning and it got better. But it might fluctuante man, mine was crazy for the first 3 weeks, then it dropped down for 5 weeks, and then became unbearable again for another 2 weeks. However, in the last 2 weeks, it has been much lower so I feel blessed.\n\nI just wanted to let you know it gets better, I created an account just to post this, because I wish I would have known that when I was getting crazy in the last few weeks.\n\nIf it does not get better, I was also considering getting an Dexamethasone shot in the ear from an ENT specialist. Studies have shown that it can reduce tinnitus in 70% of patients when performed within 6 months of onset. However it is a steroid injected in your ear, it is pretty crazy so I would wait to see if it diminishes and use that as last resort.\n\nFor the rest of the symptoms I cannot help much. I am following a ketogenic diet with exercise, lots of water and good sleep. I limit masturbation to once a week since it makes me crash, but daily edging could be a could idea to promote bloodflow. I was impotent the first week, and now I can achieve normal erections (but it takes 5x more work). My biggest sexual struggle is the numbness and the lowered libido.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo not hesitate to reach out to me if there is anything, I am here Hello, The sides you are experiencing will most likely subside with time. Finasteride is said to have a half life of a couple of hours, but the truth is that after two weeks, you have quite a build up. You will need to give it 3 months, but quite likely not that long.   \nIt is also important to note that you may want to try to forgot about it (i know its hard), but trust me on this one; your mental fixation on the problem makes it alot worse. Whenever the thought of this whole ordeal pops into your mind again, fight to ignore it and focus on whatever you were doing. Do not worry too much about it. Fin sides exist but alot of the 'PFS' people are bullshitters and had pre-existing conditions. Im sure you will return to normal.  \n\n\nGood evening :) Thanks man, I really appreciate you going out of your way to make an account to post this. Even though we are just strangers on the internet, it means a lot that you would take the time to do that.\n\nThanks for the update on the tinnitus. I will take your advice and remain patient. Although things suck right now, I am sure that our bodies will re-regulate themselves as long as we are off the medicine. It just takes time.\n\nLesson learned! No more pills! I have no problem going bald anymore! Lmao.\n\nStay well. This is a very helpful comment. Thanks my friend. I agree that thinking about it only makes it worse.\n\nAnd you are right. My doctor said that PFS usually only occurs in men who have taken the drug for years.\n\nMuch appreciated. Keep going forward. Do not take any more pills or supplements to straighten this out. Drink water, rest carefully, and do not put your body in any sort of overdrive the next few months. Do not even workout too hard. \n\nYou may recover from this naturally. It is only been in a few weeks. Best of luck. A bunch of whimps. Pathetic Has the libido and numbness improved ? How are you doing man? Thanks for checking dude. I am actually 100% recovered. It took some time but I guess your body will regulate itself after a while.\n\nLesson learned, Finasteride is not worth it. I would rather go bald and keep my dick! \ud83d\ude02 \n\nAll good now but a scary situation. Never again! That Is great news man! I am not, but hopefully one day How like did it take to fully recover ? Hey, if you do not mind me asking roughly how long until after you stopped taking fin did you finally recover? Thanks It took about a full month", "Finasteride Can you shed (in the temples) from finasteride within a week?", "Update: mostly recovered 23 M Symptoms Previously I posted about my symptoms from using for 2 months. Symptoms were immediate, and did not subside during the 2 month period. After posting here and finding out that side effects can be permanent, I decided to stop taking to make sure I could recover. Below is my description of symptoms from my original post for anyone curious. \n\n1) Decreased natural libido- I can still get har from porn, but not really randomly throughout the day. Random boners do not happen, and morning wood is rare when before it was an every morning thing.\n\n2) composition of my sperm changed? Very curious if this is the case for anyone else. My sperm, almost within 2-3 days of taking finasteride, has become a lot more watery. Major decrease in glue like parts, but there is still a tiny bit of that. \n\n3) While sex drive is down, my recovery time between ejaculations has gotten quicker? I used to only be able to ejaculate 1-2 times a day, but now I can do 3-5 times a day. I find this part really weird.\n\nAfter one week, my libido is about 90% back to normal, and my semen consistency is 90% back to normal too.\n\n\nI never want to feel like I did on finasteride again. While experiencing symptoms, I thought the decrease in libido was not that big a deal, but now that I am back to normal I realize how valuable that is. My hair is not worth the symptoms. I can live with balding. \n\nThat being said, now that I know I can recover in about a week, I am considering hopping back on, but trying 0.25 mg instead of the full 1mg.\n\nAnyone had any similar experiences? Is it possible that .25mg might be able to give me results without the symptoms? Thanks.", "finasteride related mental health.

I moved to Germany fairly recently and came across information relating to the side effects while researching how I can get it prescribed here. Previously it was prescribed to me in the UK via the NHS, where they seem to be pretty dismissive of the risks. I generally find the NHS has a good judgement on such things, but the fact that the German officials seem to have a different perspective has caused me to reconsider.

I hopped off then no problem. Then I decided to get back in in March 2020 until this month. This month I was masturbating and all of a sudden my dick became soft. Here are my symptoms: I can get errections, but they are a bit more difficult to get. However, once I get them, after a little bit, it is incredibly hard to maintain. I can still get myself to cum. After I do cum, normally I should be able to get an errection pretty easily, but now it is almost impossible. My refractory period has been extended to now a couple of hours. \n\nThings to note. I hopped off fin last Tuesday. It is been about 6 days. My morning wood came back this morning. Is this a good sign?? My libido is ok, I think nervousness and stress are bringing it down. I am an emotional wreck tho I am terrified of PFS and have been crying and having anxiety for days. Please if anyone has advice or comments, I would love to hear from any of you I see ED as twofold: trouble getting an erection, and trouble keeping it. You do not experience the first one, but are currently experiencing the second one.\n\nThis is the only side that I can identify. Refractory period and everything, I discard because not being able to force multiple rounds without any rest is normal, and even if you used to do that often, your current mental state would be enough to block that.\n\nYou are freshly off fin and have already shown improvement regarding erection (you getting morning wood). Also, for the majority of people, stopping fin will stop the sides. So I would relax, try not testing your Johnson because then your brain will stop looking for pleasure in masturbation and will link stress and anxiety to that act.\n\nIf you can get morning wood, think that your body is now able to get, and keep an erection with mental stimulous. So, if you control your fears, your body should be able to follow the same path while awake.", "My side effects so far It feels like all of the erogenous / pleasureful  sensation from my penis has been muted. I can still get and maintain an erection quite easily, but there is no sensation of pleasure. I do not feel any pleasure or euphoria when I finish or climax either.

It feels like I can no longer truly feel aroused at all.\n\nViagra works on a superficial level. It gives me strong, long-lasting erections, but again I feel no pleasure.\n\nMy doctors do not believe me. It is been 8 weeks of this so far. It got better at week 1, but then I crashed at week 3.\n\nI do not know how I can go on like this. Being around family and friends who I can talk to has been the biggest help when the anxiety gets to me.\n\nI plan on taking tribulus 1000 mg twice a day as long as until this improves. God help us.", "Has Anyone Here FULLY recovered from ED / Libido Issues? 5 months off the poison (only 3mg taken total). Really starting to lose hope here guys :/\n\nThe one bit of good is that i ONLY have sexual sides left but for me this absolutely devastating to my life. Especially since i had a very high healthy sex drive before Fin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor those that recovered (i Know you are here and reading this) I would LOVE it if I could get your input on these questions:\n\n\\- How long did you take Fin for?\n\n\\- How hard did you get hit sexually?\n\n\\- Have you recovered, How are you doing?\n\n\\- Sexually, are you back to 1000% pre-fin levels? \n\n\\- Around when did you notice real recovery, what were some signs?\n\n\\- Did you ever get your \"visual libido\" back? (Mental to physical arousal, Mind-penis connection, ability to get hard from thoughts visuals / thought without touch etc etc.) I would do anything to get this back hey, I also only took 3mg and got bad brainfog from it, so i stopped. But after 3 weeks i got hit with real bad anxiety and I also feel very weak and I feel I lost a lot of muscle mass. I am now 1 month off.\n\nThe weird things is I am still able to get an erection and to have sex, but I am always tired. I imagine after your 3 pills, you started getting sides ans that is why you stopped? If you have PFS, you do not 100% recover from ED forever not true I think it really depends how long you had taken it for, I only took 1mg for about a week, and I had watery semen, no libido, and no morning wood. I did not have a problem getting erect though. My only concerning symptom was tenderness in my breast that is when I decided to quit it. \n\nAfter about one week off of the pill all of my symptoms went away, I never got hit with any brain fog or anything else, I felt completely fine. I think as time goes on you will see and feel the way you were before the pill. Have faith! And think positively sometimes positive thinking can really help uplift and make you feel better! This is not true, while I did not take it for long, I had 4 side effects and after stopping have zero, my erections are just as hard as they were before finasteride. 5 months can seem like a lifetime if you are missing a basic mental function like libido, but in the scheme of finasteride recovery, it is not that much. Anecdotally, I have seen lots of people recovering from it.\n\nIf I were you, I would focus on reducing stress as much as possible. When your body is in \"fight or flight\" mode (look it up), it is not prioritizing sexual functions. The irony is - stressing out about your missing libido heightens this stressful state. So give your mind a break from catastrophizing, which in turn can help your body heal with time. That just means you did not have PFS This is not PFS.... I am in the same spot as you man.\n\n Its fucking brutal. I have temporarily recovered to almost 100% before. It is always fluctuating.\n\nTook fin for 2 years, currently 1.25 years off of it. Recovery started after about 10 months. I got hit with ED, low libido, penile shrinkage, etc. The signs of recovery included the visual libido signs you mention. yes. i did something possibly worse. I took 1mg , quit for 1 week and then took another 2mg.  I initially got hit immediately with the 1mg. but i got back on because i thought hair was more important. big mistake, i got worse side effects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pray to God everyday that this condition subsides soon. really strange, I did have brain fog &amp; a bit of anxiety initially but it went away.\n\nSucks to be ONLY left with sexual issues. Id rather have brainfog This is so true. I noticed whenever I focus on libido and ED , i am more susceptible to it.\n\nIm a 1000% believer in PFS however i DO think nocebo does make it slightly worse in certain situations. great to hear this. believe me you dont. Not even in TRT? I think the nocebo thing is misunderstood in the context of finasteride.\n\nWhat is happening is that that finasteride makes you more susceptible to stress and trauma (by lowering neurosteroids like Allopregnanolone and THDOC), which makes you freak out harder about the very real side effects that do happen.\n\nMeaning - I do not think people are manifesting the side effects from expecting them, rather, it is the freakout after the side effects have occurred that makes it harder to get better from them.\n\nIt is a fascinating, but also terrible feedback loop.\n\nI should say that this does not explain the persistence of PFS, though. There is probably something more complicated than depleted neurosteroids going on. And? TRT is not a cure for PFS. If it was, everyone with PFS would just jump on TRT and be cured. Doctors who do not know what they are talking about will blindly prescribe TRT and it does not work for PFS.\n\nI would check out ( personally. That is what I used to recover after years and years and years of no improvements. (Although I did not have ED as a symptom.) did you take Viagra or something similar in the period were you recovered? And if yes, did it work? I did not. How much have you recovered your libido now ? How long after quitting have you seen most people recover fully main issue being libido ? I do not know about libido in particular, but the majority of people with side effects seem to recover within 1-3 months, then followed by a smaller group that gets better after 3-6 months, and then a smaller group still who get better in the 6-12 month time frame. Then there is the small, unlucky group of people who have problems past that that. \n\nThere seems to be some correlation between severity of symptoms and how long it takes to get better from them. Meaning \u2013\u00a0if you only have one or two side effects, it could be that your chances are better than someone who is hit with the whole smorgasbord of mental, physical, and sexual symptoms. \n\nSo \u2013\u00a0if libido is your only complaint, judging purely from reading tons of anecdotes, is that your chances are very good.", "406 members. Please introduce yourself by taking this poll. I am here because:\n\n( If you have been hit by the long term side effects from finasteride, you will not be using words like \"I think I may have it\". You will know. I think I suffer almost 9 months now. I was taking the drug topically for 7months.  I said I think \"I may have it\" because I used to be and I am an anxious person all my life and a lot of symptoms that I now experiencing post finasteride, I used to also have them. Do not underestimate the mental cause. Even genital shrinking can occur when someone is anxious, to me it happened without the drug. Now imagine taking a drug that supposedly have shrinking as side effect. That can easily be overforced by anxiety.", "Will taking an ssri slow down or stop my body from recovering from fin? Venting I was put on suicide watch due to mental sides from fin and prescribed lexapro. I decided to stop taking it on week 3 as I started to feel suicidal again and crippling anxiety. Now I am having insane withdrawal and I am forced to take it at a lower dose. Just paranoid that my body will not be able to recover if I keep altering it with SSRIs.\n\nLastly I tried fin twice for 2 weeks each time before quitting. I am worried that I have permanent damage to my brain as it is my 2nd time using it, and my sides are x10 more severe this time around. \n\nAny hope for me? First, I hope you did not stop Lexapro cold turkey. Please do not ever do that, always taper down after consulting with your doctor. I speak from experience, it will fuck you up.\n\n&gt; Lastly I tried fin twice for 2 weeks each time before quitting. I am worried that I have permanent damage to my brain as it is my 2nd time using it, and my sides are x10 more severe this time around.\n\nThis part is unclear, are you still taking finasteride? If so, I highly recommend you stop. Any competent doctor should have told you the same if you were put on suicide watch because of it. Yeah I stopped the lexapro cold turkey, as I thought I was not on the drug long enough to feel withdrawal. I know this was mistake now.\n\nNo, I stopped taking it a month ago. Looks like you have been on Prozac and now Lexapro.\n\nYou need to chill with the meds, they are not going to do you any favors tbh.\n\nAnd as one poster above pointed out, do not quit cold turkey unless your doc has said it is OK. I completely agree with you that the meds are not going to help long term.\n\nMy issue is that prior to taking lexapro and after taking fin I was very suicidal and had severe mental sides so the hospital put me on them. Now I just feel stuck :/ I feel you, even though I cannot relate since I never been suicidal.\n\nSounds like a truly moment 22 for you. No idea what to do honestly. probably not, ssris have been show to help in traumatic brain injury and neurogenisis.\n\nIt helped with my pfs insomnia. Brother do not stop drugs prescribed to you cold turkey.\nRequest you to wait a month and observe your thought pattern. Also request you to consult a qualified doctor/neurologist ,and do not do self diagnosis \ud83d\ude4f. Thank you man, yeah Im going to ride it out a couple weeks until I can see my new psychiatrist. \ud83d\ude4f", "Extreme Panic Attacks from Finasteride I have been taking finsteride around 2 and a half to 3 weeks and at first it was fine. For the past week or so almost I have been having insane panic attacks around the same time every morning - 6:30 roughly. I wake up feeling fine then all of a sudden this intense tighetning feeling in stomach comes about, I get nauseous, restless, and I sometimes get acid reflux because I have an empty stomach. It lasts for well over an hour and by the time it is over, I am too exhausted to go about my day. I stopped taking finasteride yesterday and this morning I had a very very bad panic attack. I was confused, I felt terrible and I was very afraid of what was happening. I am hoping it stops happening soon I just want to be able to to sleep. Relax! I know these are frightening side effects, but most people recover. Be prepared for the process to take a few months, though.\n\nTake good care of yourself. Nobody knows what you need to do exactly to avoid having long term problems from this, but I think everyone here would agree that you need to put your body in the best possible state to heal - de-stress, lower your workload, moderate exercise, sleep well, avoid processed/fast foods/sugar, try to stay positive. I took it for about 5-6 mos before having the exact panic attacks you described plus a lot of other sides. Did not stop cold turkey until 7 mos in. They resided after about 6 weeks. Maybe shorter for you. Hang in there. It will get better and you will be back to normal. \"most people recover\"\n\nWhat does this mean, and what is the evidence?\n\nSee an earlier discussion including this comment:\n I am not attaching any overly confident time frame around it, so at least I am getting a little bit better :)\n\nWhat would prefer that people are told? The phrase \u201cmost people recover\u201d is vague and comes with no evidence. What does \u201cmost people\u201d mean? Over what time frame are we talking? What does \u201crecover\u201d mean? Then: what evidence is there?\n\nThe idea is to give some kind of evidence for any claims, and label beliefs as beliefs.\n\nIf you have interest in this stuff, and have not taken or read an introduction to philosophy, try it. Understood. \n\nBut what would you prefer that we tell the unlucky people who end up here? Not up to me to decide. But you seem to have some preferences about not offering any prognosis about recovery...\n\nI am just trying to figure out where you are going with this. I prefer facts to opinions stated as facts. I guess it is a public forum. I agree that we should be careful with that. Feel much better after about 2 weeks the panic attacks have completely stopped and I can sleep and eat. Definitely do not recommend if you have low testosterone or sensitive to drugs that effect your hormones. I should have done a lot more research beforehand. Im experiencing this i think, ill preface by saying i already suffer from moderate anxiety but have only suffered a few panic attacks, now after stopping fin after 5 months. i seem to be having panic attacks almost everyday, its hard to tell whether this is caused by the drug or not but ill try and ride it out, let me know how you are doing bro, We all should have. But the doctors push these drugs and claim they are safe.\n\nThey do us a real disservice.", "Losing hope ... I hate writing this because I know no one likes reading sad posts about this syndrome, because it makes others lose hope too, but as Aragorn says in the Two Towers, 'there is always hope' ... so I hope I do not bring you down too much. I have reached month 4 since discontinuation of finasteride and there is no improvement of my symptoms.  I think the first step to recovery is being able to improve anxiety and depression and I have had no success so far. It seems every thought that comes into my head starts a train of thoughts that lead to me thinking about taking finasteride and developing this syndrome. \n\nFor example I am working on cognitive behavioral therapy, which basically involves avoiding triggers that give you negative feelings by changing thoughts and behaviors and eventually changing feelings. But it is hard to avoid triggers when everything in the world and every memory I have before finasteride is a trigger. Why? Because it is a constant reminder of how I used to feel before finasteride. I cannot think about a past time when I felt happy (which is one of the methods therapists suggest) because I know that If I could repeat that experience I would not enjoy it like I did back then. I think that if my body could take the first step and give me a day of partial remission I might be able to use that going forward, but unfortunately, I have had no full days of partial remission, just a few evenings that were likely related to supplements I tried. \n\nFrom the recovery or partial recovery stories I have read people usually experience a remission for atleast a day in the first 3 months post-fin. And then they can use that as motivation to keep pressing forward and improve the debilitating anxiety and depression, and once that is dealt with dealing with physical symptoms probably comes so much easier, in that it becomes easier to follow a protocol or to make appointments with doctors. Has anyone gotten a full 1-day remission/partial remission for the first time post 4 months?? Until then I will keep reminding myself of Aragorns words of inspiration in the Two Towers. Hang in there bud. It took me a year to start feeling different, but I am fully recovered today. It sucks but time, healthy eating, and supplement rotation helped get me back to normal, I am sure it will help you too. I am so reluctant to try any supplies as it may damage my body further. Please can you advise which ones you are taking ? Then do not take them. I eat a fruit/vegetable smoothie every morning and try to run two miles a day. Probably has way more of an effect than the supplements. Thanks mate, going to try incorporate that into my lifestyle. But I guess it will all take time What supplements are you taking just for reference incase nothing else works I cycle through the ones on totalmaleoptimization.com When you got PFS can you answer some questions?\n\nHow long did you use finasteride?\n\nWhat was your dosage?\n\nWhen did you first see symptoms? \n\nWhat ultimately caused you to quit?\n\nDid you quit cold turkey or did you slowly lower your dosage? \n\nHow old are you? &gt;When you got PFS can you answer some questions?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;How long did you use finasteride?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2 months  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What was your dosage?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1 mg/week - (I believe more and more that this is the cause of my problem as after 7 days a single pill is out of your system, and then by taking it again you are driving your system crazy. I think this might be why people get screwed up on SP because it is a supplement and people treat supplements kindof as something they can take as needed, and there is no dosing prescribed by a doctor like with Fin. I am like 99 percent sure that if I took 60 pills of finasteride every day for 2 months instead of 10 (one per week) id have been way better off.)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When did you first see symptoms?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I started getting headaches the first week  \n&gt;  \n&gt;What ultimately caused you to quit?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Did you quit cold turkey or did you slowly lower your dosage?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;cold turkey  \n&gt;  \n&gt;How old are you?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;35 Thanks man, I am not even going to ask what supps you take, getting so tired of that game, PFS is a personal journey Have you tried any medication to improve your anxiety/depression? \n\nWithout it I would be as lost as you What were your side effects and at year mark your got fully better ? Would be very careful with SSRIs. The post drug syndrome for this class of medication is very similar to PFS. Risk of damaging yourself further is high. It is good to be careful but I can also confidently say I went from on the brink of losing my job and girlfriend to panic disorder to feeling 100% normal with no side effects on a low dose of sertraline.\n\nI would not try them if you have not already given it your all (ie, for anxiety, stopping drinking/caffeine, eating healthier, exercising and therapy). But if that stuff does not work (did not work for me) medication can be a life saver, as it was for me. Sertraline improved your sexual symptoms? That is surprising given the side effect profile. I would love to hear more. No I did not say that. If you read the post OP was talking about depression and anxiety. These were also my primary symptoms and sertraline cured those things for me. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc Do not just quit it and wait. Optimize your health, look for hormone imbalances, nutrient deficiencies, optimize your diet, sleep, really. If there is anything physiological going on, working on your psychological will still help (CBT is indeed really powerful and effective esp for Anxiety and Depression) but will not be that effective right now. I think antidepressants should be considered ... The problem with fin is that it crosses the brain blood barrier ... And that is why this syndrome develops ... Because a strange drug enters the strangest organ of the body ... It can only be fought by drugs that similarly cross the bbb Check PM please", "Asking advice on when to quit I am 25 years old and have been taking finasteride for about 8 months. Initially I felt no side effect accept for some tinteling in my toes. It might has attributed to my depression and mood swings though that certainly has other causes in my life as well. Now I noticed my erection seems to be shorter. Other than that I have no side effects. Should I quit or will that cause this post finasteride crash so many people are talking about and make things worse? Personally, I would just quit, and avoid reading anything about PFS whatsoever. Then re-evaluate in about 3 months or so and you should be fine. I think my crash happened in part because I started reading about worst case scenarios and had a panic attack - meanwhile my brother quit at the same time but was not worried at all and he says he never had any lingering sides. That is anecdotal, but it does seem to be the case that all of the guys who work themselves into panic attacks when they quit end up getting PFS.\n\nHere is what I would do to quit safely. 1) Quit cold turkey, because finasteride is very strong and just cutting down your pills will not halve the strength. 2) Absolutely no alcohol for 3 months as you wait for a natural recovery, because alcohol does have a mild negative effect on your hormones and you do not want to add any stresses on your body when it is trying to reestablish its proper hormones after quitting. 3) No gluten or processed food for 3 months. 4) Meditate for 10 minutes each day (ideally 20 mins). 5) (Optional) Start a weightlifting regimine, or at least some at-home HIIT.\n\nIf you do those things it should minimize the chances of a crash, but the top thing is to avoid reading or stressing out about post finasteride syndrome. Then also avoid alcohol (bars are closed now anyway), gluten, and meditate and you should be fine.\n\nIf you do wind up having a crash, or persistent side effects, go to the Swole Source\u2019s post-finasteride syndrome forum and ( I have been using that protocol for the last 2 years (though not with super strict compliance at first) and I can see a light at the end of the tunnel after being messed up since **2009**. I would forgotten what an orgasm even felt like...\n\nIf you do end up needing to go through the protocol to heal, I would just jump in with both feet and follow everything it says, to the letter. I hesitated for a long time because none of it was really scientifically backed, but I decided that I could not live like I was anymore and when I started it I did start feeling improvements very quickly. I very strongly believe that PFS is curable by following the CDsnuts protocol - you do not have to use his affiliate links or anything, he is just a dude who recovered and encourages other people to recover, many years later, for free.\n\nWith all that being said, I know that plenty of guys love finasteride, and you are free to do whatever you want with your body. Thank you! This seems like very wise advise. I have just one more question. What exactly does gluten (and processed food) have to do with it? Gluten was a weird one, but it really does lower your testosterone a bit. There is maybe 1% of people who are Celiacs who get very sick from gluten, but another 90% or so of people get mild irritation from it. It ends up lowering your testosterone and interfering with your hormones - not enough to cause major problems for a healthy person, but if you are coming off of finasteride or you have PFS, you need all the help you can get and it is essential to cut gluten.\n\nAnd then processed foods, they tend to have lots of added sugar, and all this weird chemical stuff that is not good for you. Same kind of logic here, when you are recovering you do not want to add in extra stuff for your body to deal with. Added sugar also lowers testosterone a little bita, which is why you also want to avoid that. Thank you. I think this is the most practical advice I can get. Hope it will go well. You are welcome, this is the advice I wish I got. And in the unlikely event that you do get PFS I also gave you the way to cure yourself, so there is nothing to worry about - you got this!", "Recovery ", "Recovery Sup my brethren,  \n\n\nI took fin for roughly 4-6 months before experiencing the side effects, no libido and every other sexual side effect.   \n\n\nI thought hope was lost.  \n\n\nA year and a half later, im basically 100% recovered. I have no way of knowing what helped my recovery but I think daily cialis 5mg was crucial in increasing blood flow to the area.  \n\n\nI also took L-Arginine, Tribulus and Saw Palmetto,  I think the Tribulus really helped, I would reccomend taking this twice daily for 3 months and see how your results go.   \n\n\nIt is important to journal your feelings to keep track of your progress, its hard to remember how you felt at a certain time.   \n\n\nI think at the end of the day, its most important to get in contact with a health care professional who knows what they are doing, or are aware of the syndrome. They got me started on these medications and I am now happy to be where I am now.    \n\n\nGood luck to everyone So your libido/erections/sensitivity all came back 100%? \nWas the recovery gradual with ups and down and could you explain what recovered first and when the first signs of recovery happened within the 1.5 years ? It is really good to see these longer term recoveries in here. I am seeing many people recover after 1.5-2 years so it really gives me hope of a full recovery someday.\n\nAgain, thanks for the update! It really means a lot to everyone on here. Do not take Saw Palmetto! It is also a mild 5-ar inhibitor that probably slowed your recovery.\n\nGlad to hear you recovered. Yes! Definitely DO NOT take saw palmetto when you have PFS! \n\nIt seems like they recovered more in spite of what they did than because of it.    Any depression/ Anxiety sides? How did you get the Cialis? A regular doctor (Versus Hims/Roman)? Did you have any side effects? Are you still on the Cialis? Regular doctor prescription, no side effects from the cialis besides the expected reaction hahaha and I gradually stopped using it going from 5mg to 2mg, to 2mg every second day until I no longer needed to use it. I still use it once a week to spice things up though he he Hard to say because those were persistent previously Interesting ! Thanks for the heads up guys Of course. So I probably noticed improvement after a couple of months with libido and erections, the recovery was definitely gradual, there were periods where I had made progress and then the next week I would be back to square one. But the curve of progress was trending up on average. Exercise is crucial too I should have included this in the OP. The first things to improve were probably erection strength, nocturnal erections, pain when ejaculating, for me sensitivity and libido took time to come back. However, everyone is experience will be different, I wish you all the best in your recovery Best of luck for your recovery ! thanks for the info! Much appreciated! Was it expensive/did insurance cover any of it? Yes it is quite expensive, however I think prices are dropping as other companies now have the rights to make the same drug, look for \u2018tadalafil\u2019 and see if you can get it cheaper. But yes talk to a doctor, that is the critical Thanks again for the info! It is a big help! I am happy for you!  It is good to hear positive stories.  Can you tell us during the day when and how you were taking cialis, arginine and tribulus?  Before or after meals, morning, afternoon, evening etc. I would take everything in the morning, arginine three times a day after every large meal, tribulus after breakfast and dinner, cialis after breakfast Best of luck to you! You still taking all the things, or now that you are 100%, you quit taking the suplements? Yeah I no longer take them But let us say at 1 year mark would you say you were 100% yet or did that just happen recently where it is consistent 100% all around ? Also you mentioned libido took longest to come back fully could you describe your experience more in detail like was it completely gone and then slowly started coming back in waves or something ? And did you smoke weed or drink during this time ? Let us talk on message Just quited fin for two days , after seeing your post , now considering seeing the soc to get some cialis Do you have side effects ? Give it some time plenty of people take a couple of weeks to get better Could Saw Palmetto actually of helped? Maybe the slight reduction in 5ar or whatever re-kickstarted the recovery process?\n\nObviously I do not know what i am talking about. Just a thought lol. Yes , a lot . \nI took finasteride for six months and I have many side effects for example ED , no morning wood and gyno. I am really worried it could he permanent \ud83d\ude1f congrats man! I have been dealing with terrible insomnia since I took finasteride. Did you have this symptom and did it improve? Yeah I had this symptom initially, within a month I would say it had improved to almost normal How long have you been suffering ? Almost 7 weeks now. The first four weeks I could not get an erection which has improved. And my sleep has been terrible the whole time. I could only sleep maybe 3-4hrs a night in 30min intervals across 12 hours the first week. It slowly improved to 5-6 hrs of sleep, with random nights being less, during the 3 weeks after that. I had one night so bad I immediately went to a walk in clinic. They put me on trazodone, which helps me get enough sleep now, even though I still randomly wake up and some nights it does not work. Conveniently a side effect of trazodone is long lasting erections which I think has dramatically improved my erections in general. Hello sir how long was it until you would say you recovered 100% sexually after stopping the finasteride? 6-8 months, do not worry about timelines just do what you can to feel better What advice can you give me I quit give or take 3 months ago what is your best tips to heal ?? Exercise, no fap, no porn and everything I have listed above. Exercise is key ", "23 year old- got hit with the bullet too. So in around July of this year I started taking Finasteride. When I say i knew immediately something was up, I mean it. It started with ball ache, then followed by a numbness. This was most noticeable the day after I took my first pill. In total I took 2 pills, and it has rendered me with all the conditions people mention that I do not feel like rehashing.\n\nThe only symptom I do not really exhibit is the chronic depression/brian fog people tend to cite. I have been attending counselling, but for unrelated reasons.\n\nOne solace is whenever I get intimate with someone I feel like i do get reasonably hard, much more so than being on my own, etc.\n\nCrazy how I only took the pill twice (1.25mg) and it continues to fuck me up this much. I have accepted that I have more than likely caused some sort of permanent mark because it is been 5 months already and no major changes. \n\nIt is what it is, just trying to resume normal physical activity and stay around friends and keep happy.\n\nMy heart goes out to anyone else experiencing the same thing. I know a lot of people doubt this condition, fuck  them, they are not you. \n\nI just wanted to throw my hat into the ring. I have not consulted a urologist, just because I have been busy with grad school, but I am determined to get some sort of professional advice.. even if it seems that it would be hopeless.\n\nThanks. Dude, I took 3 pills in July.  Reading your post was surreal.  \n\n&gt;I do not really exhibit is the chronic depression/brain fog people tend to cite\n\nI had the brain fog in August and maybe a bit into September.  I took some tribulus for my sex drive that helped while I was on it.  I took n2generate at the end of October, and that seemed to get me back to normal in terms of cognitive function.  \n\n&gt;One solace is whenever I get intimate with someone I feel like i do get reasonably hard, much more so than being on my own, etc.\n\nThis is my only ongoing issue.  Fuckin sucks though. I used to have to masturbate twice a day, and now that is not the case.  Luckily my doctor had me do blood work prior to taking the finasteride, and I just got some bloodwork done this past week, so will see what she has to say.  \n\nKnow that you are not alone.  \n\ni am very optimistic, as I have definitely improved from where I was.   \n\nGood luck in your recovery! Thank you, you too! Sorry to hear about your symptoms man, hope your recovery starts soon! I would advise against using the word permanent since there are too many recoveries out there to show that it is rarely the case. Do not underestimate the power of your own mindset when it comes to healing!\n\nAbout your last paragraph, I hate to say it but doctors for the most part are pretty unhelpful when it comes to our disease. I saw this urologist and was totally dismissed as \"anxious\" the moment I mentioned finasteride even though there are physical changes to my body (My testicles are 10% of the size they used to be!). I recommend doing some extra research to find an endo or urologist who will actually listen or even has experience with PFS patients, I am thinking I might do that soon. I have been called crazy too many times to continue seeing run of the mill doctors. Thank you for the injection of optimism! I totally concur with everything you have said. I fully intend on continuing to live my life and not be inhibited by this in as many ways as possible. \n\nThank you for the insight on your experience with doctors, etc. I have to say I am rather stunned by what you have said about the 10% thing. Do you mind me asking how long were you taking it for? (I understand everyone carries symptoms in different ways).\n\nAgain, thank you for the kind words. I only took the damn thing 3 times. Noticed minor sides at 2nd dose, and then had to quit after the 3rd. My symptoms were pretty stable for a while, and then suddenly after a month my testicles started to shrink, I started experiencing insomnia, and my ED got  worse (although luckily that is never been terrible).", "How long after stopping taking the medication does it still affects you Someone i am close to took finasteride for roughly four months, and experienced erectile disfunction, so he stopped. Nothing happened for a whole year, and now he is experiencing it again, and of course has gone down the PFS rabbit hole, and I do not know what to do. I really want to help him. Should we wait out a few weeks to see if it goes away? So he never took finasteride after the first time? And he recovered and then got side effects again a year later? It would really amaze me if the ED he is now suffering is still due to finasteride. Fin is completely out of your system/celular tissue after three months, so one thing is sure, it cant have been active finasteride molecules in his system causing this. Now what finasteride can do in the long run, even after long periods of cessation, im not sure and noone here is. Can you tell us about his age&amp; lifestyle? How long has he had the symptoms recently?\n\nWhat is his\u2026\n\n- age\n-diet/exercise\n- health issues\n- testosterone/estrogen/prolactin etc. levels\n\nIs he taking any\u2026\n -meds (including viagra)\n- supplements\n- essential oils\n- Minoxidil can have similar effects anecdotally\n\nNot a healthcare professional. Yes, exactly that! He is in his 20\u2019s, we are going to see about testosterone/estrogen levels next week, he is not taking any meds and has a relative healthy lifestyle, a little sedentary. He is had what seems to be very mild symptoms (occasional erect disfunction/dry skin, stuff like that, but he says his libido has not been affected) for like 2 weeks now. I really dont know if it might be a little bit of projecting going on. He is in his 20\u2019s, we are going to see about testosterone/estrogen levels next week, he is not taking any meds and has a relative healthy lifestyle, a little sedentary.

I really dont know if it might be a little bit of projecting going on. There is not alot of good scientific info on this topic. One study suggested an average of 4 years of sexual side effects. But getting side effects 1 year later does make it hard to attribute it to finasteride (never read anything like that before). Most people will say it is not the finasteride but the lack of research keeps the possibility slightly open imo. Apart from possible psychological factors (stress, relationship issues, anxiety) and any blood test/health abnormalities etc, in the off chance it is due to PFS, luckily the symptoms appear mild. Some guys get severe ED, shrunken genitals, and mental issues so atleast he is not in that boat. Getting in shape might help and give him a healthy objective and improve any anxiety etc. Then, avoiding obsessing about it and trying to appreciate things are not worse can help but that takes time. Not things a friend or loved one should bring up which could lead to arguments. He has to get there in his own time. I would not worry too much and just wait to see what his blood test/heart eval says. Then go from there. 2 weeks is not long at all, does not mean it is not stressful though so being mentally healthy and optimistic is key. Waiting to see is the hardest part. There are tons of reddit resources on dealing with PFS but I would avoid that until his tests are done. Keep us updated if you like! \n\n (Not a healthcare professional) Lastly I would not blow it off as just in his head either. That can be very hurtful as well, especially if it turns out to be real. Can you tell me more about the 3 month period?  Why that mark specifically?  What is the science behind it?  Literally asking for my friend lol. Yeah, that is what i am avoiding doing, since it it a real thing, there is no point in saying its all in his head. Especially since a lot of doctors seem to do this. Thank you for the advice! We will se it a day at a time, and focus on the fact that it seems like it could be worse. Thank you! Yes, doctors do blow people off and they are wrong for it. Any other questions down the road feel free to ask or dm :)", "Does finasteride cause nerve damage? Some of the symptoms I have had that started after taking fin are consistent with nerve damage. Is that even possible?", "Has anyone tried phosphatidylserine? Studies claim that it boosts the 5ar activity, i am considering taking it with pregnenolone.\nworth trying?

Took it for about a month or two. \n\nDid not know that it was supposed to be paired with pregnenolone... What is up with that?

Do you have source for that?  Thanks!", "Need Advice Hey guys, do you think taking creatine after stopping Fin would help out?", "HPA Axis Dysfunction (Hypholamus) The Cause of PFS? Hey guys. I posted that masturbating 4 times a day was improving my PFS and that NoFap caused my PFS. \n\nThe hypothalamus is a small but important area in the center of the brain. It plays an important role in hormone production and helps to stimulate many important processes in the body and is located in the brain, between the pituitary gland and thalamus.\n\nWhen the hypothalamus is not working properly, it can cause problems in the body that lead to a wide range of rare disorders. Maintaining hypothalamic health is vital because of this.\n\nThe hypothalamus acts as the connector between the endocrine and nervous systems to achieve this. It plays a part in many essential functions of the body such as:\n\n* body temperature\n* thirst\n* appetite and weight control\n* emotions\n* sleep cycles\n* sex drive\n* childbirth\n* ( and heart rate\n* production of digestive juices\n* balancing bodily fluids\n\nHormones secreted by the hypothalamus include:\n\n* antidiuretic hormone, which increases how much water is absorbed into the blood by the kidneys\n* corticotropin-releasing hormone, which helps regulate metabolism and immune response by working with the pituitary gland and adrenal gland to release certain steroids\n* gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which instructs the pituitary gland to release more hormones that keep the sexual organs working\n* ( a hormone involved in several processes, including the release of a mother\u2019s breast milk, moderating body temperature, and regulating sleep cycles\n* prolactin-controlling hormones, which tell the pituitary gland to either start or stop breast milk production in lactating mothers\n* thyrotropin-releasing hormone activates the thyroid, which releases the hormones that regulate metabolism, energy levels, and developmental growth\n\nSymptoms: \n* sensitivity to heat\n* (\n* feeling irritable\n* mood swings\n* ( and difficulty sleeping\n* lack of sex drive\n* (\n* constant thirst\n* itchiness\n\n\n\nNoFap increases Androgen Receptor Sensitivity and I thought that is what caused my PFS but apparently NoFap also has a big affect on Hypholamus and I think that is what is the cause of PFS and explains why masturbating 4 times a day works for me. \n\nFinasteride affects Hypholamus:\n\nThe effects of FIN on FST responses were associated with a dramatic decrease in corticotropin release hormone (CRH) mRNA and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. These results suggest that FIN impairs stress reactivity and reduces behavioral activation and impulsive behavior by altering the function of the hypothalamus\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis.\n\n\nI said that when I took the SSRI, Citalaprom, I felt cured of all my PFS symptoms but it stopped working when I tried it again. Citalprom affects Hypholamus:\n\nSerotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can affect the basal activity of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) axis in rats. A single injection of citalopram has been shown to stimulate the HPA axis while repeated administration leads to attenuation of the corticosterone response to the SSRI.\n\n\n\nI said after I started taking Curcurmin it improved my erectile dysfunction and penis shrinkage. It affects Hypholamus:\n\nWe hypothesized that curcumin may also alleviate stress-induced depressive-like behaviors and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction. \n\nThese results provide compelling evidence that the behavioral effects of curcumin in chronically stressed animals, and by extension humans, may be related to their modulating effects on the HPA axis and neurotrophin factor expressions.\n\n\nI said Green Tea improved my PFS symptoms and helped with hair regrowth: It affects Hyphomaus:\n\nThe results showed that dietary supplementation with matcha could effectively inhibit the weight gain, fat accumulation, glycemia and lipidemia increase, and excessive activation of microglia in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.\n\n\n\nI said after I took CBD Oil I had huge erections. It affects Hypholamus:\n\nCBD and other cannabinoids may restore balance to this system directly through the hypothalamus and pituitary but also on the endocrine organs themselves.\n\n\nI always saw people say they were cured of PFS when they used Tribulus and I was really confused because I read that Tribulus can upregulate Androgen Receptors. Now I see why it works for PFS. It affects Hypholamus: \n\n**Objectives:**  To study the effect of acute and repeated dose administration of lyophilized aqueous extract of the dried fruits of Tribulus terrestris (LAET) on sexual function in sexually sluggish male albino rats.\n\n**Materials and methods:**  Aphrodisiac activity of the test drug was evaluated in terms of exhibited sexual behavior. In order to assess the effect of chronic T. terrestris exposure on the hypothalamus--pituitary--gonadal axis, testosterone level estimation and sperm count were carried out. Twenty-eight-day oral toxicity studies were carried out to evaluate the long-term effects of the LAET administration on different body systems.\n\n**Results:**  A dose-dependent improvement in sexual behavior was observed with the LAET treatment as characterized by an increase in mount frequency, intromission frequency, and penile erection index, as well as a decrease in mount latency, intromission latency, and ejaculatory latency. The enhancement of sexual behavior was more prominent on chronic administration of LAET. Chronic administration of LAET produced a significant increase in serum testosterone levels with no significant effect on the sperm count. No overt body system dysfunctions were observed in 28-day oral toxicity study.\n\n\nI said that I think Androgen Receptors in the brain have a lot to do with PFS and you guessed it:\nThe hypothalamus, preoptic area and brain cortex were found to possess a single class of high affinity binding sites for androgens and the dissociation constants\n\n\n\nI said that masturbating 4 times a day really started improving my PFS symptoms and I felt so much better: It affects Hypothalamus.\n\nMale sexual behavior is regulated by limbic areas like the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN), the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), the nucleus accumbens (nAcc) and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). Neurons in these brain areas are rich in androgen receptors (AR) and express FOS-immunoreactivity in response to mating. In many species sexual satiation, a state of sexual behavior inhibition, is attained after multiple ejaculations. The mechanisms underlying sexual satiation are largely unknown. In this study we show that sexual activity reduces androgen receptor immunoreactivity (AR-ir) in some of the brain areas associated with the control of male sexual behavior, but not in others. Thus, one ejaculation reduced the AR-ir in the MPN and nAcc, but not in the BST and VMN. Copulation to satiation, on the other hand, reduced AR-ir in the MPN, nAcc and VMN, and not in the BST.\n\n\n\nWhen researching I read about Gonadotrophin, which is affected after starting NoFap.\n\nGonadotrophin-releasing hormone is produced and secreted by specialised nerve cells in the hypothalamus of the brain. It is released into tiny blood vessels that carry this hormone from the brain to the pituitary gland, where it stimulates the production of two more hormones \u2013 follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone. These hormones are released into the general circulation and act on the testes and ovaries to initiate and maintain their reproductive functions. Follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone control the levels of hormones produced by the testes and ovaries (such as testosterone, oestradiol and progesterone), and are important in controlling the production of sperm in men and the maturation and release of an egg during each menstrual cycle in women.\n\nAny trauma or damage to the hypothalamus can also cause a loss of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone secretion, which will stop the normal production of follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone, causing loss of menstrual cycles (( in women, loss of sperm production in men, and loss of production of hormones from the testes and ovaries.\n\nI think that is what caused PFS. It all make senses to me and explains why all those things I tried work for me. I read about adrenaline fatigue and all the symptoms seemed similar to PFS symptoms and HPA Axis Dysfunction (Hypholamus) and adrenaline fatigue are one in the same. This is really a breakthrough for me and hopefully it can help a lot of people suffering from this disease. God is good! Allahu Akbar! Thanks. Can you summarize in detail what this implicates in course of actions to undertake?  How many days without Fap to see benefits? I started to do masturbation or better said ejaculation 4 times a day three days ago just like you said. Since then I have seen SO much improvement in erection strength (pretty much back to normal size) and it lasts longer (although needs much more improvement here)\n\nSummary of things you listed (This is not a protocol!!)\n- Curcumin: Is this safe?\n- CBD Oil\n- Green Tea\n- Tribulus\n- Masturbate (ejaculate) 4 times a day.\n\nWhat about this?\n300 mg Rhodiola rosea?\nIts said to restore Hypos nuclei.\n\nI do in fact believe that you touched an important aspect here, there more I read about the mechanisms of the hypothalamus. \n\nWhy is the hypothalamus so important? \n\nThe hypothalamus is the endocrine system\u2019s main switchboard. Most of the body\u2019s critical hormones, which promote growth, metabolism, and normal functioning, are prompted by chemical signals from the hypothalamus.\n\nThese hormones, in turn, communicate with the hypothalamus to provide feedback about the body\u2019s functional status. Damage to the hypothalamus can impair one or all of these hormone systems and lead to disastrous consequences, causing the complete shutdown of hormone production.\n\nQuoted from your link.\nDaniel Murrell, MD While I do believe this post might hold some value, one should note the guy who posted it used SSRI and not 5ARI, like Fin.\n\nAs a prior Fin user, I can say for sure masturbating 4 times a day does not do me any favors. My Prolactin is already high, so that is probably why I get worse (even more increase after ejaculation).\n\nAlso, having sex with a female like the rats did have way different hormonal response than masturbating alone to porn.\n\nMain difference is masturbating will release more Dopamine &gt; less Prolactin release. Also you do not get any Oxytocin release, as it is release is bound to the touch of a female body. I used finasteride for 4 months. Quitted now for 7 weeks. I mean my erection speed is not too great. But I have seen significant improvements already. Before doing this my flaccid was also far more numb and dead. I am getting my old feeling back. Im pretty convinced it does something for me and pushes me into the right direction. Nocebo or not. I will continue for a while now and see whenever I leave a week without how it goes. Besides, he said he took an SSRI for his PFS problems..  That is so great that it is working for you! And I made a new thread of my protocol for this:  I did use Saw Palmetto too which I believe is a 5ari. That caused the suicidal ideation for me I do not think it would be possible for me to masturbate 4 times a day, I just do not have enough sex drive anymore.\n\nHowever, I have noticed my symptoms improve when I masturbate at least once a day and tend to worsen when I abstain for too long. This is contrary to a lot of the advice I have seen for PFS saying to avoid masturbation.", "Get off before it is too late? Hey!\n\nSo I have been using fin for almost two months, 1mg every other day. No sides so far other than what seems like rather higher sex drive (usually normal sex drive nothing crazy). Hair seems to have gotten thicker since starting. Nonetheless I have been worried about the sides early on. Wanted to know if there are Symptoms that only come after getting off fin? Or would I be alright as long as I do not feel any sides while still on? Do not want to be delusional and go this path and run against a brick wall in the long run without noticing any signs. I know most people on here would advice me to get off since that what this sub is about but I would like to hear your opinion and your knowledge if I should stay on it as long as I do not have any sides or get off ASAP to avoid ever getting any. \n\nHope you guys can help me. Feel good with more hair but do not want to mess with my head and my life in the long run. Better safe than sorry, in my opinion. I do not think any man should take finasteride for hair loss because the adverse effects may be severe and permanent (and not limited to sexual function).

Just a few weeks ago I noticed my erections were slightly harder to get than normal but other than that I was okay. Then it just dropped to a really low point. I have been asking on other subs because I cannot focus enough to look for information by myself. Obviously not going to continue the drug. I am asking specifically on this sub because it seems to have the most information.

I am 21 years old with a 2-3 Norwood scale. and have been on minox for a few months, was planning to hop on finasteride next week because my confidence is destroyed. From your experiences, should I not mess with drug? Any advice will help It is a difficult risk assessment to make. Most people have either no side effects or minor side effects, but some people have catastrophic side effects - life-altering stuff, and for a subset of these, the side effects do not go away. And there is no way to predict who will be hit. You can be a healthy dude who never went to the doctor, it does not matter, post-finasteride syndrome can come for you.\n\nSo it is a little like playing Russian roulette, except you do not know how many chambers there are in the gun. \n\nIf finasteride was a treatment for cancer, I think it would make sense to risk your sexual and mental health. But for some hair? That would be a crazy risk to take.\n\nPersonally - I have been sick for ten years from taking finasteride for a week and half. Not a day goes by where I do not regret taking that stuff. I would recommend to never touch fin and stop minox if it has the same side effects. I was in your same position, asking the same questions; and now I am here cuz I took it anyway. Take it if you want, but you should know that even if you take it for 10 years straight no problems, you can still develop side effects that late in the game. There is no way to know if the side effects will happen, or if they will be permanent or not. Good luck dude. I am sorry that happened to you man Thanks for your response man.

For some, the adverse symptoms may get worse or stay as is (after stopping the medication). I would exercise extreme caution. Check the FDA information sheet. It says adverse effects can continue after stopping the medication. See page 2 here: \n\n\n\nI am not a doctor. \n\nYour body is indicating that it is not tolerating finasteride well. If you stop now, you are likely lowering the chances of developing persistent adverse effects.\n\nSome men have said they will forever regret taking finasteride because sexuality is more important than slowing hair loss (if finasteride is even effective for an individual).\n\nFinasteride is inhibiting an enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). After that there are many other metabolic links in the system that governs sexuality, cognition, emotions and the musculoskeletal system. Everyone who takes finasteride is meddling with this delicate system. It seems that for some men, finasteride permanently disables the metabolism of neurosteroids. For these men there is no known treatment to restore the neuroendocrine system to its pre-finasteride state.  If you want to delve into the research, see \n\nOther resources:\n\n\n\n  Sounds like your mind is made up.. I might reconsider taking .25 mg but I definitely need a week break. I prefer a working penis over hair though so probably not.\n\nEdit: Not taking Fin ever again Appreciate it. Definitely stopping hopefully I did not do any permanent damage to my body. Based on numerous patient reports, stopping and starting again may increase the risk of adverse effects continuing after stopping. It stands to reason: by taking finasteride and inhibiting the 5-AR enzyme, you alter metabolism; stopping finasteride is another change; when you start again, it is yet another change. It may make the system more vulnerable to permanent disruption. Look how quickly you both gave up on the sight of medical research.. what did you think, it was some sort of magical hair pill.. jeez.

I am sure this drug affects everyone differently but this post is to serve as a glimmer of hope and provide a little information during a scary time.  I have outlined my journey, where I experience prolonged sexual dysfunction as a result of finasteride, and how eventually I have recovered. I am not claiming to be a doctor, or claiming anything I have done has worked.\n\nAt 32 I started to take  1mg finasteride for hair loss, after about a year I started to experience a decreased sex drive and had occasional instances of erectile dysfunction. This happened to coincide with a change in my career, and I had assumed this was a result of added stress to my lifestyle. It took me another 3 or 4 months before I realised it was finasteride and stopped taking the drug. I was not very good at taking finasteride every day, I often skipped days, sometimes for a week or two then took it continuously for a week or two. I would say I took it on average 4 days out of the week.\n\nOnce I stopped taking finasteride, it took about 2-3 weeks for my libido to improve, (potentially to 60% of what it was before finasteride), I could also feel my erections starting to get stronger. Then after about 5 weeks being off finasteride, everything crashed, I could not get an erection and had zero sex drive, Cialis helped with the erection but it was only at about 70% potency, not enough to have sex.\n\nThis persisted for another 2 weeks, naturally, I took to the internet and that is where I read about post finasteride syndrome, reading the articles depressed me and caused me to worry and panic. I would recommend not reading these articles. \n\nAfter 2 weeks everything started to improve, i was able to get an erection again and my labido was returning. I also started taking red ginseng , maca and Tribulus Terrestris supplements and these have helped things a little (or maybe its a placebo) either way it took about 4/5 months for things to return to normal. My advice try to stay away from reading things which will depress you, stay strong and try not to get lost in your own head (stress can be a cause of ED), live a healthy life (eat well, go to the gym, cut back on alcohol and weed) and most importantly give it time. For me it was 4/5 months after taking finasteride for things to start to improve, I truly hope this offers some light for those who are worried they may have persistent side effects. I make no claim that this is the case for everyone, and for those who are still suffering any side affects my heart goes out to you.\n\nTake care, be safe, be healthy and patient, and give your body the best chance of recovery. Did you ever experience fatigue or brain fog as a side effect?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd you said it took about two weeks post-crash to see improvements?", "4/2020: Penile vascular abnormalities in young men with persistent side effects after finasteride use for the treatment of androgenic alopecia.

Hi there,\n\n34 y/o here who has been taking Propecia for around 2 1/2 years.  Significantly decreased libido appeared in November of 2019.  Just started tapering off because I thought the lowered sex drive may be a result of taking Anafranil, but it does not seem like that is the case.  A couple weeks ago and last night, I had very intense sex dreams where my libido was super high and I craved sex desperately and it felt great and normal.  Then I woke up of course and it was back to the same. Could this be a sign that my libido is still intact and that it is trying to come through in waking life?  Sex dreams must indicate that my sex drive is still intact right?  Perhaps, it is anxiety or other factors that are blunting it during the day?  Any feedback is appreciated! First need to see what happens after you discontinue. Give it three months after discontinuation and see where you stand. \n\nIf symptoms persist six months after discontinuation, they may remain long-term. How often are you reading about PFS online? This could potentially be psychosomatic/Nocebo. Not to demean people who actually have PFS but I suspect there are people out there who are experiencing Nocebo. There is many things that can increase or decrease libido, as a bodybuilder, my libido fluctuates wildly, when I am bulking it is incredibly high and disappears completely when I am in a caloric deficit.  If you have no erectile dysfunction, consider looking for other causes for low libido in your life.  These could be lack of exercise, depression or anxiety, diet, your current partner, pornography, or many other lifestyle choices.  However, to be safe, I would recommend you discontinue the finesteride for a period of time and see if your libido returns, if so, you may want to restart the medication on a lower dose, it is still effective at preventing hair loss at .5 and .25 mg Thank you for this encouraging reply!  I am still tapering off, and am currently at 1 mg every two days.  I will say that a large part of me is scared to completely come off because there are reports of PFS only starting once the medication is stopped.  I am meeting with a urologist in a couple weeks, so I will discuss that with him then.\nMy lifestyle choices could definitely be improved.  Primarily concerning exercise.  When I masturbate, I can get erect easily and cum easily.  But it always feels like the excitement is not there like it used to be.  Also, since this started happening, I have not hooked up with anyone.  So a real encounter could change things.  I do not get morning erections as often, and really no spontaneous erections.  But I feel like this could be a result of the ostensible lowers libido because sex just is not on my mind as often.\nAnyway, I appreciate the reply.  It is just such a scary prospect, losing my desire for intimacy. Absolutely, understand exactly where your coming from as somebody who suffered sexual sides from finesteride, however I completely recovered after stopping the medication but the anxiety about it was enough to turn me away from it completely.  Chances are that the Covid quarantine have definitely lowered social contact and daily activities for many people which can also cause lower libido so just keep in mind that if your libido does not return immediately, it may be a product of the unusual situation much of the world is in right now.  Best of luck, feel free to PM me with any questions about my experience. How long were you on finasteride before the sides started to appear?  What sides exactly did you experience? Appears after about a week, had constant panic attack and anxiety, insomnia, erectile dysfunction, nausea etc.  basically I just had panic attacks every half hour or so which caused all the other effects and majorly fucked up my system.  Once the I stopped the medication is took about two weeks for the panic attacks to go away completely and everything returned to normal physiologically.  Currently in therapy to recover from PTSD from the trauma I incurred after all the panic.  But yea, worst two weeks of my life, luckily none of the side effect stuck around.  Have not had any panic or anxiety in over 7 months, all good now. That is great man.  So glad everything returned to normal for year.  I totally get that fear.  Fuck it is scary.  It is just odd that I did not see the libido drop until like 2 years into the medication.  If it is from the Propecia, I do not understand why it would pop up like that. Better safe than sorry, talk to your doctor about it.  I would say there is no need to worry because you have been on it for a long time without issue.  But when dealing with something so important as your libido it is important to just be conservative, you can always restart the treatment. At least everything works \ud83d\ude05 I take finasteride + Avodart for hair and Anafranil + Paxil for severe OCD i dont care for wanting sex because mental health and hair to me are more importants but i take cialis every other day and i force my self to have sex and everything is fine never orgasm though", "New research incentive!

It was numb, shriveled up, and cold down there for about 6 days after stopping finasteride. It felt like there was a void between my legs and part of who I was mentally died. I could not sleep, relax, or feel anything down there this whole week. I had fatigue, brain fog, dry mouth, and chapped lips the whole week, too. \n\nToday, 8 days out from quitting, I feel 90% back to normal. I made the most progress in the past three days.

Tell me more I am interested too.", "Unscientific Personal Experience w/ Lion's Mane I wanted to hop on and share how much of a game-changer lion's mane has been for me, I feel I would be remiss not to. I had taken finasteride for a few years before stopping, and it subsequently seemed to exacerbate some existing issues I had with motivation, cognition, verbal recall. The days would drag on and the anxiety and guilt I would feel from procrastinating would snowball. I would be constantly distracted and unable to think clearly. I had trouble communicating in very basic ways with colleagues. \n\nAfter having taken LM for a few weeks... I am elated with the improvements I am experiencing. More relaxed, can communicate more clearly, more sustained concentration and productivity during work, just on so much more of an even keel. I even feel like my digestion is better. I have used a lot of different supplements and nootropics and I do not recall anything else having this pronounced of an effect, aside from modafinil in a different way. I am taking a more pricey brand that I felt confident about the quality of, not some brand off the shelf of Walgreen's - I feel like that may be important as I would not want someone to disregard it after trying a low-quality brand, though I do not want to be seen as shilling for this brand either.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to share my two cents. How has your libido been? Lion's Mane is a mild 5ARi (finasteride is a very potent 5ARi), so it is very possible that it may have negative impact on people. Of all of the supplements to take for PFS, this would be the one of the ones I would be most hesitant to take (reishi mushrooms being #1 on that list as the are such potent 5ARi's). That said I have always been interested in it and considered myself cured of PFS. I do not think I have noticed a huge difference, libido-wise.\n\nYou consider yourself cured of PFS? What supplements are on the top of your list you would recommend?", "Been on fin for about 4 months.. I recently realized my erections have gotten super weak.. I have gained a large amount of weight in these 4 months due to having surgery on my leg so I just wanted to know if there is certain blood work or certain test I can do to narrow down and confirm the cause of my weakened erections is fin?\n\nThanks If there was a test, you can test every body before taking fin about he is a PFS and siteeffect candidate or not True What do they check in those tests? It is Fin..... do not know why you are surprised or would have to test for it. Do not want to have to stop taking it because of your hair? Nothing that is going to make a difference They would have to test for genetics... So what do you plan on doing/", "Took my first Finasteride pill and have issues I am a 25 year old M who has been going through a bad receding hairline since I was 20. I went onto HIMs and they prescribed me a fin/min solution. Knowing about possible side effects, I was calmed when I heard that only 1.6 percent of people end up getting PFS.\n\nOn Monday, I took my first pill (1mg) in the morning and immediately started noticing that my penis had a slight numbing sensation and did not have that Brain to penis connection. I was able to masturbate twice on Monday /Tuesday but the erection seemed a bit weaker and the discharge was a bit more watery. I only took the pill Monday and threw the rest out.\n\nThe sensation in the penis is still persistent and does look a bit smaller when flaccid but may have a slight cloudiness in my head and poor sleep last night(not sure if this is related - recently quit pot a week ago and sometimes  have this reaction with not sleeping).\n\nI am getting worried I may have permanently damaged my penis. Is there any advice you folks could give on how to cope and if/when I should expect a recovery?\n\nBest Hey man. You will be fine. I took fin for about 10 days and noticed symptoms around day 8. Its been 2 months now and am nearly 100%\n\nI also only took .3 at a time so its probably why I did not get it immediately like you. But your body has not built much in your system to have real lasting effects.\n\nI was exactly where you were and made a post here as well. Have not heard of any stories of someone getting true PFS without long term use, at least a couple months. Many took it way longer before they got symptoms\n\nI wish there were more doctors who had patients they treated for PFS, so they would have the data on if its better to keep trying or if you should immediately halt use.\n\nI keep wanting to go back to use topical, but I do not know if I am kidding myself that it will just take longer for the hell symptoms to start\n\nI had symptoms like not even getting hard before I ejaculate, scared the shitbout of me, and there is NO WAY it was in my head. Hell I was hornier the first week and was super happy about it. Fuck /r/tressless because they will always blame these symptoms on placebo. But I could not fake that shit I appreciate the response buddy. Looking back I probably should of did a little more digging on the internet but it is hard to know for sure with a lot of information passed around. At least I quit immediately and it makes sense that not alot of it is built up in my system also I am glad that your recovering well There is a few people who only took 1 or a few pills and got PFS. Although longer exposure equals more risk.\n\nAnd I would not recommend for you to ever use fin/minox again!\n\nThere is **A LOT** of people who got sides, quit, got better and then went to \"try it again\" and ended up with permanent PFS.\n\nAnd this goes for topical as well sadly.\n\nBe careful, your hair is not worth the rest of your body and mind! Thanks for the reply. A little off topic but if were to aim still for hair growth, would you recommend dermarollers ? I think dermarolling would be safe if used correctly.\n\nBut I never tried them myself so I do not know how effective they would be. But they do work. No you did the right thing by trying. You will be okay. Most people can take the drug, so it would be dumb not too if your hair is very important \n\nI am still praying for another breakthrough drug with less symptoms. I hear something is on the horizon from preventing dht from affecting hair follicles\n\nSo I can get a transplant and use that to maintain. Just got to hold onto some hope. Based on my older brothers, I have about 10 more years till its irreparable I am also curious on how many people get through their symptoms after using it for longer periods of time. That scares me shitless Microneedling/dermarolling by itself has been shown to be more effective than minoxidil by itself, and some of its best responders rival those of finasteride. It is safe as long as you do not go too hard and remember to sterilize the needles.", "long time lurker, i think its the time to tell my story its a throwaway account for obvious reasons, got the PFS  almost 5 years ago, since than that motherfucker stole everything from me, my youth, motivation, libido, character, humor, vision and hope, i am not kidding, all went away overnight, i am not here to argue with deniers, if you guys think its a myth go ahead, take your chances, pop even 2 pills a day it might make the hair-loss process slower but for those who are skeptical and rational, just do not take it, it is not worth it, if you get the syndrome, you are done, by done i  mean DONE DONE, you will become a loser overnight, it is not even explainable, i cannot even explain this shit but depending on its severity you may lose a lot of things and by a lot i MEAN a LOT, i have not even mentioned the physical sides yet, pelvic constant pain, lower back pain, insomnia, 24H fatigue and brain fog. just do not do it brother, it is not worth it. God bless you all Dude post this shit on tressless .. or better yet Facebook .. it is time we own up to thus syndrome and put our john Hancock's behind it ... most people here have already made the bad decision to take it. You could drive someone to suicide. Sucks to hear, man. Like u/fearsomepigeion said, lots of people here have the same struggle.\n\nThe sense of losing your character is familiar to many here, but really hard to understand for anyone else, especially those considering to take finasteride. So yea, I think it is the people on hair loss forums who need to read this. PR on this syndrome is as much of a nightmare as the syndrome itself, on one hand you want to keep people from making the mistake by scaring them, but on the other hand for those who made the mistake and cannot go back you do not want to drive them further down into hopelessness", "Scared and looking for some help I have taken about 40 1mg pills over the past 3 months.

But that is very rare.\n\nYour endocrine system is in a fragile state right now, so I would avoid doing anything drastic - just try adopting some healthy habits - stay away from alcohol, get good sleep, eat clean, moderate exercise, de-stress. Thanks mate this is really appreciated. Needed to hear this \ud83d\udc4d You will most likely be fine, i was told finasteride side effects can last for as long as you took the drug, so do not be surprised your route to recovery will take 3 months. Most people have to take it for 3-6months untill sides kick in, that is why most recover in 3-6 months. Im pretty sure u'll be fine. Thanks bro. Really struggling through it. We all need to help each other through this. Horrible journey nobody should go through. Rather be bald than face such issues. Some of the stuff the internet says about finasteride is crazy. At the end of the day, everyone reacts to it differently and we are all in this together. The true half life is 30 days for finasteride, Wait 90 days and you should be good. How long till you first saw sides? I took it for 3 and a bit months. 107 1mg pills to be precise. I reckon I first saw sides towards the end of my third month however it became more prominent when I stopped altogether. Hopefully this goes away, it is ruining my life. This is interesting, mine is the same I took .5mg everyday for 3-4 months before I really noticed it as well. I quit a month ago and am back about half if what I lost so far. So you have not fully recovered ? What sides have you got? Lowered libido, weak erections, and way more difficult to get an erection that before, I had testicle paint but that went away in like a week after quitting. Seems like depression which I never had before but that might be because of hair loss/quitting fin. What about you? The first time I saw sides was about 3-4 months in after I went to. a party and drank a lot. It felt like a hangover for a few days and it never really diminished. Not sure if the alcohol had anything yo do with it but I think I quit within a few weeks of that happening. I have the exact same but I think my depression is because I am struggling to get an erection and it is affecting my relationship. Hopefully you get better bro! This is shit. Should have just shaved it off in the first place cause now I am losing hair and struggle to get an erection whereas at the start I could have had a shaved head and a high libido I wish I had the option to shave, Im going to have to try topical or try fin again because my head shape is fucked. Bro whatever you do do not try fin again. It will ruin your life. I rather have any head shape than get on fin again. Keep me and the rest of the group updated with recovery \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I would try other topicals but if a non -fda approved topical anti androgen goes systemic I think it could screw me up even further than Fin.

How old are you if you do not mind me asking? 23, wbu? Man i feel you.  I took it for 6 weeks. Took me about 2.5 months to feel any better. Then I had a week or so of feeling 90%.

It is hard to keep on though. I did not know this was the case and was drinking for a couple weekends, will that fuck me up or if I quit drinking and pick up healthy habits will I be good The erections come back but your orgasm...

That meant trying new approaches to fix the ED, which is my main issue.  Since PFS seems to be largely in the brain, the problem seemed to be a disconnection between the brain and genitals, resulting in ED and a lack of sensitivity.\n\nThis week, I have been treating it by practicing getting erections.  I know that sounds crazy.  I decided to start out by focusing on getting an erection (using only my mind if possible) three times per day - morning, afternoon and evening.  I would also fap once per day, because I have found that keeps my sex drive up.\n\nAt first, it would take me 15 minutes of concentrated fantasizing to even get the slightest nudge down there.  They were pretty soft and not nearly full hard-ons.  Over time, getting to that point has become easier, and I have started getting natural erections again without thinking about it.  This morning I woke up with one that is pretty much back to my pre-PFS size.\n\nAfter dealing with PFS for 15 months, this is very encouraging to me.  I know it probably will not work for everyone, but it is worth a try! PFS is not in the brain. PFS is not the result of \"not taking responsibility\". This post is clearly trying to delegitimize the condition.", "Finasteride has taken another life  The worst is being told by health professionals that there is no link between fin and your systems and then they try to establish links between other drugs or situations that are even less likely. Like why are health care providers so invested in telling people fin is safe???? I like how this exact article is posted on r/tressless, and they are all blaming PFS foundation instead of fin. Absolutely brainwashed. Money... I just do not believe that Merck is paying doctors to prescribe fin en masse. Other drugs like opioids sure\u2026. Oh I am sure they are getting payed for it. But Finasteride is not patented anymore. So Merck does not get any money from generic fin", "PFS and Sweating/ Bounding Pulse and overall tiredness Hey all, I took finasteride for about 2 months, until one day I had stomach cramps, diarrhea, and a ton of heart palpitations. I also had heart palpitations for weeks, but not as common as a few nights. The only other time I had heart palpitations was when I discontinued accutane back in high school. I have not had many palpitations recently, but the two main symptoms that have been persistent ever since I stopped 2 months ago are sweating (especially on my forehead) and a heavy/ bounding heartbeat. I told the doctor about this, and he prescribed me zoloft for anxiety. It has helped relive some of my anxiety I think, but the sweating, heartbeat, and tiredness have not been showing any signs of stopping. I also want to note that about a week after I stopped fin, I had a day where my heart was beating extremely fast, and my blood pressure was really high. I was only able to get it down by taking a beta blocker, propranolol. Please let me know if any of you guys have experienced this from finasteride. Thanks. The anxiety and gut issues can all be caused by finasteride. The heart palpitations be from the anxiety. \n\nIt is believed that accutane causes similar side effects as finasteride through its effects on the 5AR enzyme. So you have gotten a double dose here.\n\nSeems like you are throwing the whole medicine cabinet at these side effects, though. Might be worth trying to let things stabilize and resolve by themselves. Many have made themselves worse by taking more drugs and supplements after getting hit with the side effects. Thanks for the reply. I am hoping to get off of the zoloft, because I do not want to be relying on it. I just hate these symptoms and I feel like I am trapped in my own body. Did you already go to a cardiologist in the past to check your heart? Did you have already had any heart-related symptoms before finasteride? \n\nAnxiety should play a role here for sure, also I think some antidepressants can cause some heart rhythm issues. I also had ectopic heartbeats, and sometimes I got some tachycardia when I pushed too much at the gym, and my anxiety and sleep are bad. So it could be the same thing for you. But it is always better to do a checkup, even if it is nothing just to know. \n\nFinasteride has not hit at me at first with heart palpitations but with sleep and anxiety issues yes. So that could be a factor that triggers heart rhythm problems. It is an awful feeling! I got an EKG, and they said my heart was fine, but the doc wants me to get a heart monitor Yes a holter is a good I have felt the same way from fin sides. Took it for 7 months. Started having negative sides at about month 4 or 5. Took me almost 3 months to realize what I was going through and the cause. Something was off in me\u2026 depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, non existent libido, even suicidal thoughts. Trapped in my own body is a great description. I have been off fin for 6 weeks now and feeling about 60% normal. Each week it is getting better. Someone else told me 2-3 mos to feel back to normal. My advice\u2026 time will cure, be patient. I wanted to avoid any drug dependency. It absolutely sucks what I put myself through but I see a light. Try to keep doing the routines you used to do or things you loved to do before all of this happened, but do not stress out if it does not happen. As hard as it might be to do those things right now you will be there soon enough. Do not lose hope.", "About to buy fin Was about to buy some fin and rogaine but then decided to see what reddit had to say about it. Let us just say I am not going thru with it I would rather be bald lol", "fin sides after a year I started finasteride in march 2020. I was fine all the way until this week. All of a sudden it is extremely hard to have an errection. I watch porn, and i cant get it. But for some reason, it randomly comes back,mainly when im talking or texting a girl about sexual activity. Once that happens, I can maintain a full erection and cum.\n\nim freaking out. i stopped fin. How long you think till these sides subside. Please anyone Give it a few weeks. Most likely you will recover fully if those are your only side effects. I would not advise getting back on fin. thanks.  get errections randomly but never when i really want It takes about 30 days for the 5AR enzyme to come back online, so it will take minimum a month to start feeling back to normal. Try not to freak out in the meantime and take care of yourself. TBH it sounds like you will probably recover quickly. Just heed the above posters' advice and do not try to take fin again when you recover.\n\nStop-starting fin seems to re-roll the dice on if your sides will be longer, or even more severe the next time you start it. Commenting from my non burner: yeah I have learned my lesson. I will never touch it again. I was on it for a year prior, stopped, and then took it again for another year and got these symptoms. It is so odd because I can get boners here and there throughout the day and they will be strong. But when I want them (ie watching porn) it will not come up. Yeah that sounds really mild.\n\nAt my worst sexually, I could not even get an erection while masturbating while watching porn. It was super scary. My dickhead literally turned white instead of the usual pink. Yeah I cannot get it up watching porn either. But when I talk to girls sexually, boom right up I took fin for two years. No ed no sexual side effects when all of the sudden i started feeling depressed and full of anxiety. I stopped for a week and i was feeling like myself before i started using fin. I love my hair so i took a pill today. But i just dont feel right.What should i do? Should i switch to topical fin or just try to use foam minoxildl which i already ordered Topical fin can cause the same problems. I would steer clear of it. Seems like I am 95% back to normal already. Leading me to the conclusion that this was really mental (in my head). That being said, I am done with finasteride regardless. Just is not worth the freak out or hassle. I have already had one hair transplant, so I am not opposed to getting more in the future. Rather shell out the money if I care about my hair as opposed to being destroyed for life without no amount of money being able to bring my health back. Thank you to the guys who commented Dude how old are you? There is nothing \"so odd\" here. You can get hard in certain times and not in others. What you just said points to this being 100% mental, I hope you realize.\n\nI do not think Fin is something people should just run and take, and no offense but it is posts like this with guys running online saying they have ED at the first occurence of \"not\" being able to achieve an erection, that scare off guys who would otherwise be more comfortable possibly taking it and having it work wonders for them. Maybe try lower dose or topical if that is your only issue", "Anyone here suffered from facial bloating (moonface)? Hey guys,\n\nI took finasteride for about a year and I stopped 2 months ago due to my face becoming bloated/swelling (moonface). I know for a fact its due to this medication as I have had no other changes w.r.t my medication, diet, and lifestyle. No weight gain, nothing. My face is CONSIDERABLY less sharp and its definitely very round when I used to have an oval shaped face. When I chew food, fat rolls in the side of my neck are very evident and when I lie down I have a double chin which I did not have even a year ago. If anyone has dealt with this, please let me know how long it will take to go away after stopping the medication! I saw on an online forum that it can take as long for it to go away as the amount of time I was on the med in the first place, or even two times as long. \n\nWould taking testosterone supplement or estrogen blocker help (assuming that the reason im still impacted by the side effect is due to hormonal imbalance aka too much estrogen)? I will get tested by my doctor for hormonal levels this coming week. Thanks! Update: I just read this on a postfinasteride syndrome article: \"Second, many adverse effects that are induced due to indirect action of finasteride (via hormones and GABA receptors) persist after finasteride cessation. This suggests that finasteride merely triggers/initiates the respective neuroendocrine disorders, which then have the capacity to self-maintain over time, eventually even evolving towards new and more complex neuroendocrine imbalances (not necessarily related to finasteride).\"   \n\n\nThis is really scaring me. I do not want to live with this forever. I look horrible. Somebody please respond :( maybe a waterfast DHT is the most androgenic compound we know of.\n\nAndrogens counteract estrogens in the body. So taking away a huge amount of the strongest androgen, even normal estrogen level could cause this.\n\nStay the fuck away from estrogen blockers / aromatase blockers.\n\nGo check your T, if it is low testosterone injections might help.", "PFS - hopefully I can get rid of this I have previously been taking Finasteride everyday for a total of 9 years but with a gap inbetween - so from age 23 to 28 I took it 5 years before stopping for 6 years and then from 34 to 37 years old I took it almost 4 years before stopping last week for good. \n\nMy main symptoms are the following:\n\ncomplete insomnia (to begin with although last night I managed to get 2 or 3 hours of sleep)\n\nzero libido with numbness feeling down there - I literally cannot aroused at all even while looking at porn although last night I noticed the numbness feeling had subsided a little bit\n\nbrain fog - hard time concentrating, although again feeling some improvement since yesterday\n\nfatigue - from lack of sleep\n\nWhat seems to help me with symptoms are eating healthy food only, exercise i.e. going for run every evening, Magnesium supplement in the evening and Valerian if I am having trouble getting to sleep.\n\nAnyone out there in a similar situation recover from this?\n\nThanks.

I tried every supplement under the sun....Finasteride messess with our hormones severely and permanently.  HOpe you get well buddy, but you may have to learn to live with the illness.

You are only a week out, most people naturally recover in your situation. Keep being healthy and try not to stress. Come back in a few months if symptoms have not subsided. Can you list everything you have tried so far please it will be helpful cialis, viagra, testotone, citrilline, zinc, gaba, ginseng, ashwanghanda, fish oil..to name a few.  there'sa  bunch more i tried but those are the main ones.  You will never be normal again even taking high dosages of these.... Ok speak for yourself man with that negative thinking you probably will not. How come you stayed on the poison this long? It is like that other guy on propecia help was on fin for 20 years even when getting severe sides.\n\nI am already much much better by the way lucky for me I only took it for 5 years...it is been about 20 years since i last took it.  I\"m glad you are much better....Hate my life, but just have to learn to live with it.. I took it few weeks got sides right away. \n\nWhy do not you try more potent steroids more extreme therapies if you could afford or some sort of healing retreat. I know how it feels man honestly if my symptoms persisted I would do spend all my money and effort to heal because life with PFS is simply not worth it what have you tried that is helped?  belive me...i read all the reddits and propeciahelp forums for any kind of help, but nothing really helps my friend.. I cannot really pinpoint it. I just got back to gym with a good diet. I also like you read everything on propecia help but tbh it only added to my stress so I blocked it all out and pretended I was a monk. I am only returning now because I feel better. I take normal supplements like whey, fish oil,ect. I added coenzyme and liposomal vitamin c and shilajit near the end when my symptoms got much more tolerable but I do not think they contributed that much. And I sleep like 9-10 hours a day including naps. I am lucky because I have no need to work financially I am good. \n\nI read everything from pphelp, reddit, cdsnut ss and many other forums. A lot of people get better some do not so I do not think you can make definitive statements man. It seems main issue is AR signalling and overexpression/underexpression of thousands of genes. Cycling androgenic herbs or pharma steroids will also change your gene expression FYI. Also you are on TRT but based on everything I read it is counterproductive for PFS. I honestly do not know it is not like anyone knows exactly how to fix this but try do not give up. Why do not you just go on a bodybuilder cycle with actual DHT derivatives like anavar and proviron go crazy in the gym and try to change AR expression. You can try natural route with many herbs like Cdsnut does and he claims healed. Look if I had to live so long with castration I would at least want to be the biggest most muscled guy around. I would go on the craziest bber cycle but that is just me. I forgot I did cycle some t boosting supplement one especially was great by universal called M-stack which contains turkesterone. And I am telling you man for over a year I had terrible sides... Imagine your D shrinking and retracting in your body. And I was very fit. Just demoralizing and the when it got better I almost could not believe it was back it was like a miracle I have finally started feeling better 8-9 months after stopping.\n\nHopefully you start healing sooner! Do not give up it will get better. So ur basically 50 and cannot get it up - shocker. Erections getting worse with age -\nanother shocker. Testosterone dropping as u got older - shocking. How fit were u while taking fin? Do u even do regular cardio? Pray bro Thanks - really good to hear about guys recovering. You should do a Dutch test and try HCG with a good doc A couple of people on the propecia help forum noticed that they felt better on corticosteroid injections. I also noticed this myself. I had an ACTH stimulation test and improved and basically felt cured but unfortunately I crashed after about a week and never felt the same after Is that therapy same as sinus injection you get I never had one so I am not sure. The ACTH stimulation test is done to check Adrenal function. They inject you with a synthetic version of ACTH which is similar to a corticosteroid. ", "5 week off update Was on for 26 days, off now for 5 weeks.\n\nThe good: Noticed I can get hard pretty easily again now, have been having regular sex, and 90% of the time able to finish. Occasional glimmers of full stiffness and full libido.\n\nThe bad: Still not staying fully hard throughout sex, erections are not 100% what they used to be. Most times there is a little dip into a semi where we stop, do some kissing and go down on her then I get it back enough to finish. Cum is not watery but still not nearly the same amount (no idea about sperm counts, but nervous to find out). And libido is still not nearly there the same. Getting morning wood occasionally but not what it used to be. Still getting brain fog occasionally. \n\nAfter a week of pretty regular sex like this (2\u20133 times a day) I noticed a bit of a dip the past couple days, which seems par the course based on what everyone is saying here. Seems to be hitting the 5 week crash some people have reported, where it is 2 steps forward, 1 back. \n\nStaying positive, hoping to continue making this progress and will update around the 2 month mark with any changes. I am hoping this trajectory continues and I will be back to 100% by 3 months, but praying for that.\n\nIt seems there are plenty of people who get back to 100% which is reassuring and I look at myself Day 1 off Fin where it would not get hard at all, and remind myself it is gradually getting better and will continue on this path.\n\nHope this is helpful and if anyone was here and made a full recovery let me know your timeline! I was only on Fin for 26 days   i took it for 8 days and i think im recovering too, something i feel anxious because libido comes in the night but in the day i have nearly 0 libido, occasionaly full libido too How long have you been off? Sometimes the anxiety gets to me, but trying to stay positive and look at it week by week instead of days. Considering it did not flinch the first day off and now I can (typically) get hard it is somewhat reassuring. \n\nPlus I am going to try to stop freaking out until the 3 month mark, but sometimes it is easier said than done. Always here looking for reassurance we will make a full recovery but it varies so much.", "Topical Finasteride Safe in comparison? Hi there,   \nI am terrified to start Finasteride and take the pill, honestly, however, I was wondering if it is safe to take the topical solution with minoxidil?\n\nPlease do let me know as I am so conflicted. If you use topical finasteride, it will still get into your blood so there is still the same risk as normal.\n\nI would not recommend taking finasteride for hair loss, but you are entitled to take risks with your body / sexual health. I am just so nervous about this all when I see the results of some people it is so unfair they have practically grown their hair back and I am here at a massive loss going bald. Surely there is another way? Just shave your head, or get a hair system. Hair System? I cant do that, im sorry There is no need to apologize to me. Make whatever decision you feel comfortable with, that works for you. I wish I could Take fin, but I am too nervous too... i really am just so nervous. What is a hair system? You can read peer advice here:  I got sides from topical fin, but i got sides after one use. After 16 days all sides went away however i still have a slightly weaker erection and my libido is fucked. But cus im stupid and care about my hair more than my sexual health ill be planning to take it again and have another go What does peer mean and where did they get this info from Seriously, you will take it again after that? Bro do not do it. Seriously. It is no joke. \n\nYou being serious with me? Peer advice means it represents the views of some men who have taken finasteride and gotten a syndrome that does not go away after stopping the drug. See also the box on the page that shows the information sources, and the article citations at the bottom of the page. \n\nYou can also see some relevant research here: \n I mean the worst thing that could happen is i can be stuck with sides for a few yrs. the sides I believe do always go away tho eventually.\n\nI just cant deal with it anymore, im 19 with a nowood 2 and my hairloss is really aggressive. I really genuinely wont be able to live happily bald at a young age. I dont care if my sexual health has to go i just want to keep my hair Take it, dont be a pussy xD Nah will kill me No \ud83d\ude02 it is not that bad Chances of sides are super minimal and generally go away upon quitting. I took it for 6 months than switched to the more powerful dutasteride. However! I would not do it if I were you. It seems as though you mayyyy have a lot of anxiety (I may be wrong). If you do, you will constantly be worried about whether or not you are having side effects, which can create them or just keep you uneasy. \n\nStart with minoxidil. That should at least give you a shot at holding the hair you have and potentially re growing some as well. The side effect profile of minoxidil is way less intimidating. You are right c I suffered from depression before and have anxiety/ocd. I do not think I should take it.\n\nIs minoxidil even worth it?  Honestly? Yeah dude. Do not do it. If you were to do it you need to go on with positive thoughts, not negatives ones. That would outweigh the benefits honestly. \n\nAnd about Minoxidil, who knows. Some people get great results. If you really want to keep your hair though what do you have to lose by just trying it out? True. I will try it. You know how to get it in the UK? Do ittt. But make sure you keep it up. Persistence is key with hair loss. I would give it a solid 6 months before deciding whether or not to give up and try something else. \n\nNot sure where to get it in the UK but it is over the counter here in the US so I am sure it would not be too hard to get online. \n\nAlso, if you ever feel down about your hair loss. There is always hair transplants. Look up Elon Musk wayyyy back in the day and compare his hair to now. Yeah I wonder if he takes fin? I do not know when though to get the hair transplant that is all That is a good question. I guarantee you though he got all that hair back from a transplant. To my knowledge, you want to let the hair loss go until it starts to slow down so you can see what it is going to do and how best to do the transplant. My opinion, do it when you feel like you have to, like once you really cannot stand the way your hair looks anymore. Side effect can be permanent for a few ones, if they werent finasteride wouldnt be so dangerous So not worth it? Okay, so hold off on a transplant for as long as possible? Cucha wacho cavesa de pija, depends on how much your hair affects you, i would try min first, on my is very powerful What did the first thing you said mean?\n\nDo you take fin? Is it workint Min? Yessir. The idea is that the transplanted hairs will survive longer than those around it. So in theory you might keep your transplanted hair but lose the hair behind it and it will look funny. Of course if you are well off financially you could get several transplants, then waiting is not as big of a deal. But the donor hair could dissapear though To my understanding, if the donor hair is going to go, you are kind of out of luck. Do you have any family members on either side that have no hair left in donor areas? Where is the donor hair The lower back of your hair. It seems like you are new to the topic hair loss. Minoxidil alone cannot save your hair. Finasteride is the only drug available which works against aga. If I were you, I would ask myself: Is my hair really that important ? If yes go for it. Only 2-4% will experience sides. Check you Hormone levels. If you have a natural high estrogen level chances for sides are higher. Mate people get finasteride syndrome post all the time and it scares the shit out of me The reason why it appears that so many have these are quite simple. You are searching for them in forums. I asked so many people if they had sides and only a few had minor sides which went away. PFS is really rare. In the end it is gambling. Worth the risk ? Fin is safe man, just start it. This is a subreddit for discussing the debilitating effects many of us have experienced on and after finasteride. Whether or not OP ultimately decides the benefits outweigh the risks, it is irresponsible to pose the blanket statement \"it is safe\" to him. I am too scared man honestly Do you think, minoxidil is safe? Any serious sides? \nDo you recommend using min only? Minoxidil + derma pen is safe. Minoxidil 2% or 5%? \nAnd what mm derma? \nAnd what do you do for dry and itchy scalp? Either one should be safe. For the derma pen you will have to google it and search on YouTube. Probably 1mm on scalp.\n\nIf minoxidil gives you a dry itchy scalp try the foam. If it still itches then you cannot use it Not itchy, but dry. \n\nSo in 2019, i started 1 mg oral fin and 2% minox (twice a day) \nI tried for 6 months but side effects started. So i stopped it immediately. \n\n\nI took second opinion, few days back. The doc put me up on topical sol of 5% min with fin. But I cannot get out the thought of sides happening again. I do not want to risk it again. \n\n\n\nCould you help me with the dosage too? \nIs 1ml daily of 2% minox okay? Or should i take 5%? \nPlease help If you are in your 30s I would just let all the hair go, and see where you are at. Then possibly a hair transplant or shave your head.\n\nIf you are in your early 20s and you are losing major hair, you will have to accept that you will lose your hair like many other men. I would go with the shaved head look + work out and build nice muscles. If you really feel a need for hair you can consider a hair system I guess. Or wait until you reach the final baldness level and see if hair transplants are an option for you.\n\nThis sub is really about PFS though, not hair loss what about now? I took topical fin again, weirdly i have no sides at all apart from ball aches which is annoying. Hair fall has reduced a lot but not completely It definitely does cause the syndrome... its nit the only syndrome, I have pssd - post series sexual dysfunction.. a syndrome where the sexual side effects of antidepressants are permanent.. on top of that the drug triggered male pattern baldness, prior to usage I never had any hair loss whatsoever.. now I am stuck, I never wanted to lose my hair.. but because I got pssd I am scared will I get pfs.. I do not know what to do Dude basically called you a penis head in the beginning. What an asshole lol", "TRT is often an ineffective treatment in Post Finasteride Syndrome patients because their levels of total testosterone, free T, DHT, and E2 are already in the middle of normal range.

I did not really have bad hairloss but they say you need to start while you still have hair to keep what you have, and It had been sitting in my cabinet for over a year (thanks to ( who sent it along with the minoxodil id been happily using for a year) so I said screw it one night and began the nightmare.  About 6 weeks in i started getting a headache and I started getting depressed. I kindof suspected it might be the fin but not so much that it would be causing a 'nocebo' effect at that point. I quit fin about 2 weeks after the headache started. Two weeks later I felt back to normal almost, headache was gone, then two weeks after that I had the infamous crash which included all the sexual sides (had not had any sexual sides up till that point) and raging depression/anxiety (thankfully the headache never returned) and that is when it was gameover for me, i now knew my body was significantly disrupted by this drug. Being a hypochondriac already this is the absolute worst possible situation cause it is a disease that causes such terrible effects and doctors cant diagnose or treat, and there is no mortality rate so you have to figure out a way to live with it lol I really see no way out. It is been about 2 months and sexual sides have improved (I can get 80 percent erection, have about 50% labido, my beard was not growing properly but now seems like its growing better) but anxiety and depression are worse. Had to take a leave from work and currently doing psychiatric treatment for this, which unfortunately means ssri's which I heard can make things worse but my support people are forcing me to follow through, and its not helping at all with the anxiety/depression. I made contact with this dr. bruhin guy that is all over the internet as a psych guy that knows about PFS .. maybe it will help to just to talk to someone regularly that knows what PFS is. All my life I have been responsible to not overdue drugs or alchohol and stay on a relatively good track when it comes to my health. Too bad society does not ring the bell louder about dangerous pharmaceutical drugs and the predatory companies like Keeps that peddle them around. Hang in there everyone. Hang in there, man. I know you are likely aware of this, but SSRIs can cause similar PFS symptoms and may worsen your PFS symptoms. \n\nI hope you keep getting better as time goes on. 50% libido improvement is good especially in this short amount of time. Best of luck!", "Yet Another Victim in the Early Stages Seeking Advice Hey everyone,\n\nI was just hoping to reach out to get a better idea of where to begin a 'possible' recovery from where I am now, which is basically feeling like complete shit every day. Honestly, if my prescribing dermatologist had ever told me that there was even the slightest risk that I might be feeling like this, I would have never touched finasteride. In what seems to common now browsing this subreddit and propeciaiahelp.com, earlier this year I was noticing a decent progression of hair loss and thought during my annual trip to the dermatologist that I would ask about hair loss treatments. Almost without explaining any of the possible risks aside from saying that some experience sexual side effects, but they all resolve after cessation of the drug, she prescribed me a topical mixture of finasteride/minoxidil (0.25%/7.5%), which with the application equated to 1mg finasteride every night.\n\nFor some context, I am a reasonably active 31 year old that had never had any sexual side effects prior. After taking this drug for 2 weeks at the prescribed dosage, I started noticing some lowered libido/minor ED. I immediately stopped for 3 weeks to things to return back to normal. In that time I contacted the derm which said that I might have better luck at half the dosage every 2 days. Not knowing any better, I switched to that and was relatively successful for 3-4 weeks, until the same side effects came back. I hopped back off again and decided that the drug was just not for me, thinking that in another 3 weeks or month I would be feeling back to normal. This was last Sunday (3/28).\n\nI cannot begin to describe how wrong I was. For the most part things were fine, I was experiencing some similar testicular pain as I had the first time, but no problems really getting an erection or having sex. That is until 4 days after on Thursday night, which after reading a bunch of posts in hindsight is when I experienced the feeling of crashing. My testicular pain jumped up from a 1-2 to an 8, I started feeling genital numbness, my heartbeat was racing, and I could not fall asleep at all. I thought taking a shower at 3AM might help, but even at room temperature my teeth were chattering and I was having the most intense chills. I was able to get a rapid appointment to go to another dermatologist the next day (was not trusting the initial one), who said that it was still too early and that I should give it 4-6 weeks and would mostly be recovered. Given how systemic all the symptoms are, this did not exactly inspire confidence, especially as I felt as though my penis was shrinking before my eyes. Having no other options on the weekend, yesterday I went to an urgent care facility to rule out anything seriously wrong, and I walked away with labs submitted for my thyroid, and a testicular ultrasound script, and an increased estimate from the internal medicine doc saying it might be more like 3 months.\n\nI was hoping to seek some advice from people who really know what I am going through, especially anything which might be time sensitive in the early days following the finasteride crash. To summarize my current symptoms:\n\nTesticular pain, insomnia, heart palpitations/elevated heart rate (85-100bpm vs. 60-70bpm beforehand), genital numbness and lack of any sexual sensation in penis, and non-existant libido\n\nI am really concerned that if I do not take steps to address this while my endocrine system is fucked/oscillating that it might just decide to select this feeling of shit at its new normal indefinitely, which is why I was hoping to get advice as to what I should be doing in the immediate aftermath of losing my manhood. Also am I completely screwed because I had the crash \\~5 days after stopping? If you crash, is there any hope of a recovery?\n\nFrom all the helpful advice I have see on this subreddit I have been taking the following supplements since the crash: One A Day Men Multivitamin, 25mg Vitamin D3, 50mg of Zinc, 800mg of Ashwagandha, and 12mg of Melatonin every night for sleep. I have increased the frequency of my workouts from 1-2x a week to every day since the crash, along with going outside for additional Vitamin D.\n\nI also have a referral to an endocrinologist, and tomorrow morning I am going to call one of the doctors in my area listed on the ( resources page, just so that I am not dismissed/laughed out of the room.\n\nBasically I am just feeling like complete shit and was hoping to find a community that understands what this is like for any possible advice (or maybe assurances that I have not messed up my body completely in a month). Horrible stuff mate, I am so sorry to hear you are experiencing this. PFS is sadly very real and it sucks to see more people becoming victims of this syndrome.\n\nI have had PFS for 2.5 years now, crashed severely in October 2018. I have done a ridiculous amount of reading on the internet, forums, etc, so hopefully my advice best represents the optimal path for your situation. This is what I would do if I could go back in time to when I initially crashed.\n\nYour body is currently in a VERY sensitive state. You need to be doing everything in your power to eliminate all burdens from your body so you can give it the best possible opportunity to heal itself. You must do your best to eliminate all stress &amp; pressure from your life, avoiding overexertion, obviously eating as healthy as you can, getting enough water, plenty of sleep. This is a time for rest, relaxation, etc, your goal is parasypathetic nervous system activation, this is the state your body heals in. I would highly recommend avoiding stimulants, caffeine, stress, etc. Your approach to increase workouts to every day is the complete wrong mentality and will only make your situation worse. The body is struggling as it is, increasing the burden by killing yourself in the gym is just a horrible idea. Trust me - I had the same mindset. I crashed and continued to live my high intensity adrenaline filled lifestyle (I was in my early twenties), killing myself in the gym, overworking, stressed, partying, etc, and it only led to my situation deteriorating and getting worse and worse and worse. It was only when  I took a step back and focused on rest, relaxation, parasympathetic nervous system, eliminating stress &amp; anxiety, avoiding the stressed wired overstimulated state, etc, that was when my body healed and I was able to recover my testosterone to 900-1100 ng/dl (I was at like 400ng/dl for over a year). Follow protocols for adrenal fatigue, Health Recovery on youtube is great, I will link him below. Following his advice got my testosterone to 900-1100 ng/dl. Your approach of pushing through it, increasing workout intensity and volume, is what kept me at 400ng/dl.\n\n(\n\nYou must eliminate stress, anxiety, overexertion, pressure, overwork, etc, focus instead on rest, recovery, sleep, relaxation, etc, be consistant and give it time and patience. Have faith in your bodys ability to heal itself, there is no doctor as intelligent as your body, its job is to maintain health, it wants to heal, it wants to be healthy, you just have to get out of the way and let it.\n\nI do think you should discuss the use of HCG with an endocrinologist. HCG should be the first point of call to restart steroid acute regulatory protein, repair neurosteroidegensis, and reboot the HPTA. An extended run at high dose, like 3-6 months of HCG, is advised. \n\nI also suggest making a post on propeciahelp with your story and complete the survey. \n\nGood luck and do not hesitate to reach out. My crash happened a month after stopping fin, and lasted 2 weeks. Worst 2 weeks of my life. Awful anxiety/ insomnia and penile pain.\n\nI am 3 months post-fin and feel waaaay better. I had one day yesterday where I felt 100%.\n\nSo basically just remember it does get better. Tough through this horrible crash nightmare and you will start feeling better slowly but surely. Here is my advice: do not go to PropeciaHelp - the website is not actually helpful and is filled with suicidal men. The more time you spend there, the worse your mental health will get.\n\nI personally know several men who recovered fully within 2 years. Go to the Swole Source message board\u2019s PFS section and follow the protocol. Do not dick around or wait, just go all in and do it, and recover and move on with life. PFS does not have to be that big of a deal, and no, it is not permanent - as long as you follow the protocol.\n\nNo I do not benefit from this financially or otherwise. No I am not a relative or friend of the guy who created the only recovery protocol I have seen with a strong track record. No, he is not a scam artist like some say on PropeciaHelp. I was in your situation for many years, and now I have my life back. Do not waste time on PH, and definitely do not go on TRT, HRT, etc. None of the medical doctors have any clue what they are doing when it comes to PFS. &gt; do not go to PropeciaHelp\n\nThis is really such good advice. Reading threads while I was at my worse made my anxiety 2x worse. \n\nI still am going through this PFS bullshit, but getting better every week. I may try the protocol after 6 months if I am not cured, but I think letting your body try to fix itself is not a bad idea either. Agreed with this. I followed the totalmaleoptimization protocol and am recovering well. I was where you were at several months ago. Check out these pages:\n\n(\n\n( If you come across any doubters, let them know about the published literature here:\n\n(\n\nAs well as more literature by system and specific symptom here:\n\n(\n\nThere is been a considerable amount of research in the last few years. It is likely many doctors are not aware of it at all. Hi sorry to hear about this, side effects after cessation of finasteride can indeed be pretty horrible.\n\nI will not repeat the advice in the comment section but one thing that really helped me was sun. I live in the UK so sun is few and far between but when I managed to get outside in a sunny day I felt a temporary but significant  reduction in my symptoms. Getting out in the sun has repeatedly had this effect. Not claiming by any means that this is some miracle cure (given that we do not really have much of an idea what pfs really is), however there are lots of anecdotal reports of this same phenomenon in propeciahelp with seemingly a lot of consensus (am happy to be contradicted on this). Worth noting that sun exposure has positive effects independent of vitamin d. \n\nSounds obvious but I would also recommend trying to target the gut microbiome by eating as healthy as possible, as there is research that finasteride has a long term effect on this: ((\n\nMake sure you are getting enough magnesium as it is very important for regulating sleep and most people are deficient in it.\n\nWorth noting that you have  just crashed - the half life of the 5ar enzyme is 15 days which finasteride irreversibly binds to and inhibits. These side effects *might* resolve themselves quickly, however give yourself time to try and heal. \n\nGood luck. forgot to mention that I have now recovered 99% - other than a slight penis sensitivity and mild testicular pain my symptoms have pretty much resolved themselves. Of course different people show radically different trajectories, but seeing recovery posts was great for my anxiety at the beginning. Honestly thank you so much for taking the time to write such a length response. Fortunately, I have already drastically increased my water intake and significantly cleaned up my diet through including much more cruciferous vegetables and cleaner meats (no frying etc.). Although the remaining advice makes sense (particularly the video linked on adrenal fatigue).\n\nGiven my current state, the sleep portion might be the most challenging as right now I am only getting max. 2 hours of continuous sleep per night. Hopefully the few supplements you have listed and some relaxing teas prior to bed might help out. Out of curiosity, after your crash how was your insomnia? I am only asking as the prospect of sleeping through a full night would be a dream for me right now.\n\nHopefully I will be able to get an appointment soon with an endocrinologist, and I will bring up the use of HCG. Was this something that you went forward with during your 2.5 years? I am really glad to hear that you are doing so well after such a short period of time! From the brief amount I have read it seems like post-crash its still a toss up on whether or not the symptoms will resolve within that 3 month window.\n\nWas there anything in particular that you did during this time frame that you thought was beneficial? Also how did you deal with the insomnia and heart rate (which I am assuming is linked to the anxiety?) Thanks for letting me know about this. I will look more into the Swole Source message boards, really anything had to be less depressing than what I have been reading on propeciahelp. Did you also end up with similar symptoms after coming off a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor?? I do not really want to get too much into the specifics of my side effects, but they were life-changingly bad. Definitely do the protocol and then just move forward with confidence that you will fully recover, because you will. I actually had a suspicion that sun deficiency might have lead in some manner to this terrible experience (obviously with the help of finasteride). Fortunately in the southern US there is tons of sun, so I have been making an effort to spend more time outdoors. Also the linked article is one of the few that I would stumbled upon during a panic search in fits of insomnia!\n\nCleaning up your diet seems to be a consistent theme across all recoveries. I have definitely made drastic changes over the past few days in this department, and was wondering about probiotics in the form of yogurts and fermented foods might be helpful?\n\nBut thank you for letting me know that it might be possible to recover. At this point, even an 80% recovery would seem like a miracle and probably be pretty close to how I was on finasteride.\n\nIt sounds like the 2 week point might be pretty critical. I assume this is 15 days post the finasteride itself being removed from the system. So if I stopped taking finasteride last weekend, its 15 days from today? Thanks again! No problem, completely understand. Thanks for the advice - really hope I can recover. I really cannot imagine living like this indefinitely. You only really need HCG if your testosterone is really low and stays low for an extended period IMO.\n\nBest point of call is to give your body a chance to heal itself through everything I mentioned earlier. HCG is still something you can talk about with your endocrinologist. But maybe its best to give your body some time to heal itself first.\n\nI thankfully did not have insomnia as bad as you do now. From what I understand, this is very common post crash, and generally improves with time. Consider picking up the book Sleep Smarter by Shawn Stevenson and implement the sleep hygiene practices he talks about. Reading might be difficult in your current state, so either get the audiobook and listen or, listen to the podcast Shawn Stevenson did with Rich Roll on sleep. I do think that Ashwagandha Sensoril, Phosphatidylserine and CBD can help significantly, they all work to reduce stress &amp; cortisol as well, which is important for your situation.\n\nI was personally on HCG for like 4 months. I do think it played a big role in recovering my testosterone levels. My testicles atrophied severely from finasteride, so HCG helped in getting them back online.\n\nGood luck I hope you get better soon For the anxiety, there was not really anything that helped besides trying to sleep, and eliminating all stress and unnecessary worry. You basically want to put your mind as ease as much as you can while you fight this. \n\nWhen I had insomnia though it was a real nightmare as I just had constant crying and panic attacks, but I just survived and it got better.\n\nI did not notice having a increased heart rate, but I probably did in hindsight (at the time that was the least of my worries).\n\nThe biggest help for me post crash was going on bike rides. Gave me a decent exercise, got me outside and made me forget about my problems. I would only try this after you crash, and begin to feel a little bit better. During the crash I would just stay at home, relax and try to get through it.\n\nThe only supplements I take is a men's multivitamin and grape seed extract (do not think it does anything but whatever).\n\nHopefully your recovery goes well! And remember to message me if you have any problems. cool dude, given that it is such a large protocol, could you tell me the main things you are currently focussing on, regarding the protocol? The supplement rotation for me seemed to have an effect Well the half life of the enzyme is 15 days so in theory the drug will not be operating in your system after 30 days. I would not put too much weight on the 15 days though to be honest, my point was more that it takes time just not to be active, and a lot of people's side effects clear up after this, so try not to worry too much for now as you have only recently stopped the drug.\n\nI think there is some consensus that PFS is constituted by side-effects persisting 3 months after cessation so you are a long way off that at the moment. \n\nI did personally did take probiotics, however I mostly tried to eat a massive variety of plant-based foods. The average person should aim for 30 different plant based foods in a week so I tried to replicate that. \n\nBest of luck! Would it be possible for your symptoms to worsen rather than get better after 3 months? &gt;DifficultBid2822\n\nIt is possible yes, but a lot of people get better within a short period of time. Had a look at your post history and it seems you only stopped taking the drugs 2 weeks ago. Would recommend getting out in the sun, eating v healthy, lightly exercising, and try to get plenty of sleep as that is how your body will repair itself. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMight be worth getting some bloods done to see if you are deficient in anything as well.\n\nBest of luck\n\nBes Thanks Bes,\n\nHopefully this horrible phase goes away for all of us. This pill needs to be removed from the market ASAP. It is killing relationships, changing peoples lives drastically. I have read so many stories and my heart goes out to all those who are in my shoes. Any updates ? Mentally i feel basically 100%. It is just sexually im not there yet. I have a lot more hope than before though! \n\nI think I will heal sexually it will just take time. I will update when I recover.  People here are sending you their horror stories and that is not cool. The last thing you need to is to be more upset about this. \n\n... I had erection problems for about a month after about a week of Fin use and had severe ED problems for several months when I was in my late teens after going on anti depressant medication for only a week. I felt like I had suddenly lost all sensation in my penis and nothing stimulated me at all anymore. All because I tried to improve my depression. Luckily everything came back to me eventually and I am 100% back to normal. \n\nAs someone who used to have a lot of mental health issues, you got to give yourself a break. \n\nA lot of this stuff becomes a self fulfilling prophecy when you are this freaked out. For example, you start worrying tremendously about sexual performance which makes it harder to get an erection. You cannot get the thought out of your head so you cannot sleep. You start writing off sleep loss as a side effect of the meds. The erection problems and sleep loss becomes worse and the cycle continues and you get more depressed and anxious. \n\nHuman beings have a weird ability to will things into reality in both incredibly positive and negative ways.\n\nGive yourself a break. Your likelihood of going back to normal is way way higher than the likelihood of these feelings persisting. \n\nI believe in you. You will get better. Get a blood work if your testosterone is low means fin efffed u up other wise ull recover Hey man I have the same symptoms as you pretty much and I am in current hell\u2026 how are you doing now? And what was the penis pain like ? Bc I am in pain rn too\u2026 thanks", "AMA Finasteride Addict ", "Can someone help me?  Do not take the pills. There is no way this had any affect on you but you will drive yourself crazy. Plus 19 is too young, you are still developing. My doctor said my dick was big enough so it does not matter if I started. I started at like 6 inches flaccid, 8 inches hard but now it is like 3 inches flaccid and I cannot get it hard. I even tried watching my favorite pornos like \u201cThe Hills Have Thighs\u201d and \u201cOcean\u2019s 11 Inches\u201d, nothing. What do I do!? 6 inches is 15.24 cm I am not sure your doctor is credible, I usually get like 10 more opinions at different times of the day, both hard and flaccid. Did you tell your doctor that those pornos are not working? That is basically extra strength.. Unless you tried backdoor sluts 9, but I hear it is hard to go back once you have seen that. I will give backdoor sluts 9 a chance. Do not say you were not warned. Lmao dude nice troll", "Finasteride and Gastrointestinal issues? Can fin cause GI issues? It definitely has for me, but my doc said there is little to no research proving it. There is been a lot of speculation about the GI origins of finasteride side effects. There is even been a study indicating that finasteride may alter the gut microbiome. Personally I had/have minor changes to my bowel movements that I believe came from finasteride. Yeah, it definitely fucked me up", "4 days in 1mg fin, within 24 hrs already having symptoms I started taking fin 4 days ago. I have experienced less sensitivity and difficulty getting hard within 24 hours of taking the first pill. Is this normal? I will let every hair on my head fall out before I go through this for much longer! I have taken fin for 4 days. I am usually horny 18 out of 24 hrs of the day and this has already killed me. I am 29 with a minor widows peak forming. Yes people have reported reactions from as little as 1/4 pill. (0.25 mg) If you stop fin now and never take it again, you have a very good chance of recovering in a month (or two or three).\n\nIf you are one of the unlucky few for whom this is very long lasting (or permanent), then I am sorry to say that this will be the start of a long health journey. And yes, long-lasting symptoms can happen with as little as a single pill. (I took 10 myself).\n\nIn either case, you should stop taking fin. Risking permanent mental and sexual side effects is not worth your hair. I took one finasteride 1mg pill 4 days ago, 21 y/o. A day after, until right now ive been experiencing terrible mood, motivation issues ED and massive brain fog. If it stays the way it is rn my life is over, i wint be able to finish my degree feel like -30 iq points. Im just praying to recover. Please update your situation if you seem to recover. Right now im in a dark place. My symptoms stopped ~24 hrs after I skipped a dose. How you doing now?  Only mild improvements, sadly. My symptoms improved quite a bit a week ago, but now that I am forced to focus on my upcoming exam I became painfully aware of how much it all stayed with me. Concentration is impossible. Mood is fluctuating. Sleep is not really replenishing my energy. Erecile function isnt as it was, but sufficient to have sex. the scariest part is that I think im getting used to it. If you have had mild improvements it will get better, a common trait I have seen with people suffering from PFS is that it gets worse rather than improving in the first couple weeks You are reaction to it is the same as mine, and I was iffy for the first month then got better , if it was permanent there would be no improvement for ages yet right?", "Elevated Heart Rate I have seen a few posts about people saying one of their symptoms is elevated heart rate. \n\nIt makes it hard to concentrate or relax.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to combat this? I think this might be a downstream effect of having 5ar inhibited. You are not producing enough allopregnanolone- a neurosteroid that is responsible for activating GABA receptors. GABA is the brain\u2019s chief inhibitory neurotransmitter, and is responsible for producing feelings of calmness and physical relaxation. Chamomile tea and passionflower extracts are both mildly GABAergic, they seem to help me a little when i am having a panic attack. I have found blood pressure medications, particularly clonidine, really help. Beta blockers would probably help too, and would alleviate any physical symptoms of anxiety overall. It sucks, i am 3 days into an intense crash and my heart rate is constantly elevated and am dealing with horrifying mental side effects. Keep your head up.", "Breast Enlargement? I have been on Finasteride 1mg for like 15 days. Today I squeezed my breast and it did hurt. What percentage of people have enlarged breast? Does not really matter? It is a known adverse effect of finasteride. The medical term is gynecomastia.", "MENTAL SIDES POST FINASTERIDE SYNDROME I just started noticing severe depression and anxiety out of nowhere during a seemingly good time in my life and after a week finally realized it was the finasteride I had been taking for 1 year and 1 month and had no previous sides, I am now terrified reading all these reports of people who never get better, I have only been off cold turkey for 2 days. I wake up freaking out sometimes and have crazy mood swings throughout the day. Id love if someone who has experienced something similar could reach out and give me a timeframe of when this could go away or if im in serious danger? I found that I can still function normally my emotions are just out of whack and I have no control over the panic feelings. I think you will be fine, these are side effects not pfs. No problems in the ED department? That is a good sign. People who have both sexual and psychological have the toughest time. Yep, totally right. These are side effects. It is only PFS if they persist long term. Take it easy for the next few months - low stress, cut the soda and fast food etc. I took it for 7 months. After quitting cold turkey it took about 6 weeks to really break through the depression and anxiety. Gradually subsided with each passing week. I was 100% back to normal after 10-12 weeks. Hang in there! does it get better everyday bro? It comes back in waves, you will still have some bad days between stretches of good ones but do not be discouraged. I do not think I necessarily noticed the day to day changes but each week I would reflect on previous weeks and would see the change. My advice, just try to keep doing the routines you did before experiencing the sides. For example, I had a routine of exercising. My interest in it decreased a bit but I look back and feel like my recovery time was not a waste. And find a person you can talk to about it, a friend, a spouse, a sibling, your doctor, or a therapist. You are going to get out of this. Be patient with yourself. These things take time to heal and in due time it will be behind you. Dude same my anxiety was thru the roof after i quit fin. I have NEVER felt this way in my life but its been around 11 weeks and it slightly improved. Social situations still trigger stress responses which is major depressing but you got to believe in yourself. Fuck merck fuck this drug.", "Should masturbation be avoided during side effects?  avoiding masturbating all days help me to stay positive because i feel with more libido, but i dont know if it can change something.", "If i never have any of the sexual side effects from finasteride can i still get the mental side effects? ( Brain fog/depression?) So ive never ever experienced any of the most common side effects or any of the effects of pfs. i do suffer from alot of depression but this was before finasteride and right now after aswell, i do not notice brainfog like pfs people describe. so does this mean i am in the clear of any mental side effects? my theory here ofcourse is i cant imagine me getting some of the worst side effects like the depression and yet have none of the more common side effects such as sexual functions. And imo i think the depression side effect is more caused by the hairloss and loss of sexual function. You can still get the mental sides without any of the sexual ones.", "12 days ago I took a quarter pill for three days, not even a full pill, and then I stopped because I noticed a pain in my balls. Then after I stopped I noticed ED that gets worse by the day. I only took around .75mg of finasteride total. The first week since the first pill I got less spontaneous erections but I could still get erections if I wanted. Then all of a sudden a few days ago I cannot get it up even if I tried, and the furthest it seems to go if I am lucky is like 50% full. \n\nIs it normal to be experiencing such extreme ED from such a small amount, and now that it is been 9 days since I stopped how long will it take to recover if ever? Yeah, this can be the norm. \n\nYou could be looking at months before you are fine and sorry for the bad news, BUT it will most likely get worse before it gets better.  ED sucks but the mental sides are just as concerning.  \n\nGive it 3-6 months.  You will improve though.  Drink a lot of  water, exercise and keep a positive mindset. I suggest posting this in another sub. You are in a sub with people experiencing long term sides from fin. You will most likely get a lot of scary answers in here.\n\nPain in the testicle seems to be a common side. About ED, just chill for the next couple of months. As I see it, testicle ache got you scared about fin having an impact on youra sexual organs and the fear prevents you feom getting an erection.\n\nLet the fin get out of your system. Come back to this sub if the problems persist after more than 3 months to get good advices. Thanks! Have you ever heard of anyone having long term sides from only about 1mg pill though? Also why would it take months to get out of my system? Why 3-6 months? That seems like a long time for a little less than 1mg of finasteride ever ingested Yeah. Stories start from a single 0.25 mg. Everything less than 3 months is consider regular sides. After the 3 months mark you are really talking about PFS. It takes a while to clear fin from the system and your body to go back to baseline. That just seems to be the normal recovery time, if you are lucky.  I do not make the rules, I am just going off what others have experienced, as well as myself.  I only took 3 pills.  \n\nFor some guys they do not ever get back to normal. \n\nGood luck! It took you 3 months to go back to normal after 3 pills? And are you fully back as you were before your took it? For me, closer to 4 months actually.\n\nAnd to be honest, I consider myself very lucky compared to some of the posts I have read on here. I would not say 100% \n\nLower libido for sure. How much lower? Not sure. \n\nIt is just not as high as before.  \n\nGet your mind off this, and see how you are in 3 months. You should know that anxiety and stress will make any sort of ED 20 times worse. Think about a time where you have been genuinely stressed, anxious or scared. Were you ever aroused during those moments? Me neither.\n\nYou can be nervous about BEING hard in the moment. (Maybe you are on a stage or something). \n\nBut I doubt your going to get hard while being chased down by wolves.\n\nExercise. Try to eat good. You absolutely need good sleep. It is going to be difficult as hell, but you got to take your mind off anything sexual. Maybe invest in melatonin gummies if you really have trouble sleeping. They have no side effects other than making you sleepy, just try not to rely on them too much. Maybe once or twice a week is okay. 5 times a week is pushing it. From what I understand, finasteride binds to a certain enzyme in the body that regulates male hormones.\n\nFinasteride has a half life that makes it go away in a couple of days, meaning the fin is gone; but the enzyme that it affected has a half life that is much longer, meaning the altered enzyme takes 3 months to replace.\n\nSo basically, the fin changed the enzymes, and now you are just waiting for those enzymes to be replaced back to the normal ones.\n\nNot a doctor or pharmacist so do not take this as fact. How long were you on it? 1 pill a day for 3 days.  \n\nHahaha, looking back I knew I should not have taken that third one.  I just could not believe side effects hit as quick and as hard as they did.  \n\nIt is in the past now, I am in such a better place especially mentally.  This was in July when I took the pills.  So, 5 months out now and have been feeling great for the past couple of months. I took 6 pills and it happened to me,  I am terrified. How bad were your symptoms? A week in and everything's gotten worse, there is literally no connection down there with my brain. I am just praying i recover. At the time I was pretty terrified.  I do not even want to think about that anymore though.  \n\nA week is nothing man, wait AT LEAST 3 months.  Like I said earlier, it was closer to 4 months for me, before I felt \"normal\" again. If that is true why do dht levels go back to baseline within 14 days? We do not understand the relationship between DHT levels (or any other levels) and adverse effects.\n\nTake good care of yourself and avoid supplements or other prescription drugs unless necessary. See where you are in about three months. Everyone is different.  I was on finasteride for over five years and three months ago I started experiencing side effects for the first time.  Shriveled dick, no libido, no morning wood, inability to hold an erection.  Stopped finasteride immediately and within a few days I started to go back to normal.  After almost a month off, I am completely back with absolutely no issues.  I actually feel better now than I have in years which means that I was probably experiencing mild side effects of which I was unaware.", "List of tele-health that sell Finasteride Hims\nKeeps\nRoman\nThere are more of them that I have not looked up but basically they are portraying themselves as men\u2019s health businesses and they are false. They sell Finasteride which can ruin a man\u2019s health. Four more: Happyhead, GoodRx Care, Lemonaid Health, Strut\n\nFDA should be looking at these companies\u2019 practices. Yup. Little to no warning of any potential side effects and prescription in 5 minutes.\n\nIt is honestly sickening. I had keeps. I took fin for two years. Barely starting noticing mental sides. Depression and a real bad anxiety that never in my life i had experienced before. Stopped taking it for 4 weeks and man do i notice a difference. Iam now the same person i was before taking that fucking drug. But do i love my hair... i know ill be back when im done maturing but not now. I started taking it at as soon i turned 18 and i feel like thAt shit fucked up my growing. Im 21 now and i am now noticing it, but ill be back... not soon tho I mean they do state side effects... its ones choice tho. Even the pill case/bottle comes with the side effects but most people ignore it thinking theyre not going to be on the 1% of people that experience side effects but in reality its really about 40% of people that experience them Dude why on earth would you get back on that potent chemical knowing everything here In my case I did not get any warning or anything. Maybe in Canada they do not have to.", "For those of you with PFS, how is your hair? I keep reading about people having these terrible symptoms, and saying taking finasteride was not worth it, but did your hair grow back or continuing growing after stopping finasteride? My hair probably got thicker. Since I cannot use fin due to sides, I am balding again and it is pretty visible. I buzz my hair and I hope that sides will go away. I have been buzzing my hair for the last year as well.  I do a \"number 1\" on top, and \"skin-shave\" on the sides.  \n\nBald is beautiful.  The Rock, Vin Diesel, Jason Statham.  They all embraced it and so should we. \ud83d\ude01 visit r/bald. It is a very supportive community, although a little pushy when it comes to shaving your head. :) Hey, sorry if I came off that way.  Definitely was not my intention.  \n\nI have been thinking about taking finasteride for a while, and the sides just do not seem worth it, to me at least \n\nMaybe a trip to Turkey or India for a hair transplant might be it for me. Finasteride is not worth the risk for any man, in my opinion. Mine's OK, I had an intense widows peak when I first got PFS, and it is gotten about 25% worse over the years. I also did a steroid cycle which I assumed would be a death sentence for my hair, but it did not do much until I went off cycle and attempted to recover. So who knows what is going on there. \n\nI recently had a hair transplant to fill in the widows peak, but I am thinking I will have one when I honeymoon in Europe when Covid is gone to fill in the crown and bring the hair line down by about a CM. This second hair transplant will fill in any additional loss I have between now and then. If you have PFS, hair loss is the least of your problems. I completely understand that.  \n\nThe reason for the question was more to see if you still have the benefits of finasteride, while still suffering from the sides. \n\nI would have thought most would, since their DHT levels would be much lower. It seems like it is a mixed bag, like with everything PFS. Some people's hair loss stop completely, others see their hair loss accelerate. This. For the record propecia worked wonders on my hair. Once the dust settled though, I was left with PFS and now my hair is worse than ever. But again, not even close to the top of my priorities anymore. Why is that Here is your answer: they have horrible hair because they will not take DHT inhibitors like finasteride or dutasteride. Topical anti androgens alone cannot keep hair forever, they are bald or are well on their way. It is not beautiful at a young age. But at like 30+ it is alright", "Stopped Finasteride I just turned 52 and was on Finasteride for about six years.  Two months ago I started to experience a severe loss of libido and trouble getting/maintaining erections.  I thought it might be low test so I got it checked and it was actually high 750.  Got a prescription for Viagra.  Useless.  I forgot about the negative sexual side effects of Finasteride.  I stopped taking it about two weeks ago and literally within a couple of days, I started to get morning erections again and now everything is back to normal - in fact better than normal.  Hoping that the Minoxidil, Nizoral and supplements like Biotin and Saw Palmetto will help stave off hair loss.  But in the final analysis I would much rather be sexually functional than have a full head of hair.  I feel very fortunate after reading the nightmare stories of guys who have had permanent ED after stopping Finasteride.  Just horrible. Blessed are you ... it took me 9 months of finasteride to become impotent, I have been for 6 years ... now I am 31 years old, I lost everything: work, friendships, love ... it is simply unacceptable and unnatural.\n Death is scary but I have to find the courage to end it, this life is horrible I would like to euthanize it.  Hi man, I have been in the same situation as you took it at 23 years old for 9 month got impotent for 1 year after quitting. And still have sides now more mental one. Did you try sodium butyrate? It is something that help me the most. Also red light therapy and low carb / Keto diet. The synergies between red light and keto is really impressive. I know it can be devastating and make you feel you want to come to an end. But there is more and more people talking about it and finding recovery. There is a guy really aware with those stuff dereck from more plate more date podcast, I know he help some people to recover. The consultation is quite costly but if you are in the situation I think it worth a try. Keep hope we are near an end for this PFS shit we going to find a cure that work Saw palmetto is also a pretty potent 5AR inhibitor, just like finasteride. There are plenty of people who got the same symptoms (some long term) from using SP, so if you are looking to reverse the damage done by fin, stay away from SP. Hi. Yes. I am also interested to know if SP is worth a shot. Fin is a big no-no for me although my brother in law swears it has worked great for him for years. He does seem to have reversed his hairloss a bit and swears he has no sides.. but still- I am not going to risk fin. Glad the OP recovered. I cannot tell you what to do with your health, but saw palmetto is a 5AR inhibitor just like finasteride. If you are having side effects from fin, your chances of recovery will diminish if you use SP. Simple as that. Yikes!  Thank you for the information. Have your side effects come back? The side effects did not hit you until 9 months of usage?", "Cured my post finasteride syndrome!!! How to cure post finasteride syndrome? Hey guys I experienced pfs 8 months after I quit. I read a Reddit post that said Dopa Mucuna and DIM can help. I took them and a couple days later felt like normal again. 100% recovered. I experienced brain fog, memory loss, gynecomastia, ED, low libido. \n\nI have actually taken it for a couple days and it seems like it hit the reset button. I do not think it is something you would have to take forever. I read some more articles and found it works for other people as well", "%5 Minoxidil has induced PFS symptoms My story\n\nIn 2017 at age 25 I took finasteride for one month, side effects appeared the next day. Watery semen, loss of libido, complete PFS. Luckily after stopping I experienced no crash, and %100 recovered within 2 weeks as most cases do. This demonstrates my AR receptors (or whatever it is) is obviously weak or sensitive, but not as weak as some. And I vowed never to touch finasteride again.\n\nAt the same time I was also applying KIRKLAND liquid minoxidil, however after 6 months gave up. (I dont believe this formula gave me any sides tbh)\n\nFast forward three years... I noticed some more thinning and decided to try minoxidil again, this time a different brand that was extra strength (as it has a reputation of being %100 safe, and being applied topically that makes sense and previously gave me no sides)\n\nIm a VERY sexually active gay guy, and would easily have multiple partners a day, every day, most days. And soon after starting minox my libido SKYROCKTED! Having to climax 4-5 times a day over a week. It was insane.\n\nThis was at the start of the pandemic and I was working from home and we were in lockdown (no active cases in my country though luckily) and I was with a guy and strangely I could not get it up, I thought at first it was due to lack of vitamin D due to working from home, or maybe the lockdown and stress. \n\nThis continued until COMPLETE impotency around a month later. It was at this strange time I started to get really concerned and did some in depth thinking. After some research it FINALLY clicked it was the minoxidil (after 2 months use, one of that with the side effects as I did not recognise it in time) and quit using the product all at once altogether \n\nTHE CRASH:\n\nI was not ready for this, and will be scarred for the rest of my life because of it.\n\nAt the time I had no idea what was coming.\n\nThe first three days after quiting I started to improve, however on the  fourth I hit a wall. COMPLETE impotence. I was really scared. As even with finasteride i could still manage an erection. \n\nI cant give a whole timeline of events as theres a lot there, but essentially I had a complete sexual PFS crash. \n\nAnd then the other symptoms started, my whole body started getting muscle twitches, constantly, I lost my vision and developed BAD eye floaters (my vision is now fucked), I developed skin lesions all over my body, nerve damage/neuropathy throughout whole body, dry skin and I pretty much went insane (anxiety, brain fog)\n\nI developed panic disorder due to the brain fog and anxiety, I was convinced I was dying from a terminal illness and was VERY close to suicide (I have never had any mental health issues in the past).\n\nBut test after test after test I kept being told im fine and it was all just anxiety.\n\nI was almost admitted within the first 2 months and did not work at all, thankfully my best friend was able to be there for me during that time. And was on valium tablets x3 a day which helped me through. I went to ER a total of 4 times, bloods, scans, everything was fine but the anxiety was so bad it was the only way to calm myself down.\n\nI didnt realise I was even crashing as it was not PFS, if I could even recognise what it was man that could saved me but ive never read about a \"minoxidil crash\" and with every muscle spasm was convinced I had MS, ALS, PARKINSONS.\n\nTODAY:\n\nIm on my 5th month now... im doing better... but im not okay... Lucky compared to some I think, but still a shell of who I was.\n\nMy erections have somewhat returned, aswell as precum, semen has slowly improved, its not watery anymore but its a little clumpy. Still dries out very quick. Libido is zero, some days I feel more than others. Only one day have I felt desire again but subsided quickly.\n\nMuscle twitches persist, sometimes spasms, however have greatly reduced.\n\nSkin lesions have stopped appearing (i posted about them a little while ago with pictures if u look at my post history) they still change color now and then, Dr has no idea what they are but says not to worry.\n\nI know my eyes are permanently damaged, use to have perfect vision. Now just floaters everywhere, its pretty upsetting but most people have them or develop them at some point so I know im not alone.\n\nNerve damage/neuropathy has subsided, my pinky toe is still sensitive to hot showers but tingling/numbness has stopped and feels like its healing \n\nMentally, as I can now recognise what is happened and have found other sufferers online im doing better. Still very sad as my old life of sex and partying at only 28 seems to be gone. I try go out with my friends clubbing, but its a painful reminder who I once was.\n\nWHAT NOW?\n\nI have read multiple recovery stories, some only a week, some three months... 6 months... 2 years... 3 years...\n\nHowever ive also read multiple non recovery stories... 2x guys with 8 years... one guy 4 years... couple guys 3 years...\n\nCurrent minoxidil group im in has close to 30 guys without recovery... longest one is 4 years... who is the only one with similar crash symptoms to me.\n\nCompared to finasteride this seems rare, BUT IT IS REAL and I cannot believe I was given a 2nd chance all those years back after finasteride and I blew it again.\n\nMy main question for you guys, is do you think with such a hard crash that my sexual symptoms can recover? Even just %50 libido? I dont expect a full recovery, but if my twitches went away... and I got my libido back... I could be myself again I think.\n\nI also want to raise awareness of minox as I think this drug may have destroyed my life \n\nOral minoxidil regrows hair just as effective as oral finasteride... my symptoms align with PFS so I %100 think this has affected AR receptors or a very similar mechanism to finasteride \n\nMy only hope is that ive seen gradual recovery... less twitches, erectiond returned, pre cum... I can actually still functionally have sex. I just have no desire to :/\n\nLONG POST I know but any advice would be great\n\nAnd this is my active reddit account so ill be around for the long hall for updates. That sounds like a lot, and I do mean A LOT of sides. Some of them I have read about, some of them I have never heard before. I agree that they do sounds like what you can read on PFS.\n\nI would say it is due to fin. I have read about people having problems AFTER stopping fin even if everything was fine on fin. You can check out the guidelines people posted that made them recover and try them out. I have never read any paper that even comes close to talking about min causing permanent sides, or even sides after stopping. Not to mention min, at it is core is a blood pressure medicine, and to the best of my limited knowledge, has no impact on brain function. I say this because brain fog would be out of the board due to this.\n\nBest of luck on the recovery. Hey, nah the previous fin was not the reason at all.\n\nI could feel my body in distress due to minox, some of symptoms were relieved upon stopping, ie vision loss (optic swelling), dry skin, ect \n\nBut thank you, \n\nOnline there is a whole community of us affected... just like PFS... PSSD... PAS... Saw palmetto \n\nTruly fucked that this can happen... I live in constant fear of a terminal illness and dealing with this kind of quality of life. Absolutely CRIMINAL that these drugs are still available! Please do not let shame keep you from notifying doctors and authorities of your experiences with these drugs. Do not let the physical symptoms of hair loss ruin your quality of life. Sexual health trumps having hair!\nI am the wife of a sufferer who has remained in denial about what Finasteride has done to him, us, and our family. Let me start with **HUGE ** gratitude for your candor and willingness to share these very personal stories. Please do not stop sharing and fighting.\nMy husband &amp; I have been married for 19 years. He is 46 years old in very good health, no prior issues with ED or heart issues, used low dose Finasteride for AGA over approximately 24 months. Within approx 16 mos of use, feelings of isolation &amp; depression were steadily worsening, as were sleep disturbances &amp; personality changes, having severe consequences to relationships and wellbeing. Also erectile disfunction, ejaculate irregularities, libido decline, skin rash, and body temp irregularities were prevalent. He ceased use of Finasteride in mid-Feb, 2020. Brain fog &amp; severe depression cleared w/in about 7 days of cessation, yet ED has steadily &amp; rapidly worsened. On March 6th, 2020, he experienced Sudden Cardiac Death. He hired a sex worker because he was so broken &amp; hopeless over the erectile problems. (Not to mention the completely WHACKED idea that a sex worker could help. A complete example of the demented thinking part of PFS) Took a cocktail of black market ED meds, then dropped dead in the sex worker\u2019s hotel room.\nHe was resuscitated, his heart was stabilized, yet bradycardia persisted. A Defibrillator/pace maker was necessitated &amp; implanted because no other cause for the heart function anomalies could be ascertained. I believe the Finasteride was the cause. I think his SCD was his \u201ccrash.\u201d\nPlease DO be aware that **HEART irregularities ** are a not-oft-spoken-of part of this, too. \nNow, 11 months later, he has recovered to about 99% normal. It did worsen, before getting better, though, so do not panic. Give it time. Be gentle with yourself. Time is the most difficult but best \u201ctreatment.\u201d Hold your head high &amp; strut your sexy stuff, and forget about your thinning hair. Bald can be very sexy, especially when paired with a nice stiffy ;)\nWorst of all, PFS is not even on the medical pro\u2019s radar. This MUST Change! Onward &amp; UPWARD\u2014 all you gallant souls! Keep talking about this and fighting the fight.\nAll best for steady recovery \u2764\ufe0f Has his full sexual function returned? If so how long did it take? Storys like that let me believe the whole pfs topic is bullshit. Pfs from minoxidil? Really?! I was on topical fin and minoxidil for 3 days and developed ED, severe brain fog and my libido flatlined as well as having no connection to my dick... oh it also has shriveled up. This was almost instant and happened from the first time I used it. Before I would get consistantly morning wood even though it was not 70% hard at best but now it is nothing. This along with my other symptoms tells me I have low T. \n\nAt the age of 29 I pray I can recover. The first day of not taking is today and I feel noticeably less brain fog even though I only slept a couple hours and I feel upbeat and optimistic of of my recovery. I am only here to share my experience, some support would be nice too. Thanks for sharing this, wishing you both full recovery.  \nAdvocate accounts here keep shaming, laughing at such reports, just for the purpose of maintaining the safe reputation of hairloss drugs. what are the active and inactive ingredients in ur minox? i know azelaic acid and saw palmetto can possibly cause pfs issues Minox is the active ingredient haha\n\nInactive is rogaine foam... so alcohol, ect.\n\nThere is no inactive ingredients that affect 5ar reductase from what I can see\n\nAn active ingredient such as minoxidil would... which it did. \n\nIf there was a warning on the bottle I dont think this would of happened.\n\nAlthough quite a few minox guys report permanent  issues from as little as 4 days use... its rare but they must be extremely susceptible to 5ar inhibitors. I had no idea minox messes with 5ar/dht \n\nOr is it something else minox does to trigger pfs? Cuz i know minox does stuff with stimulating blood Yes I am living with the same. Caused by minoxidil also. It completely destroyed my libido and erections. I am still living with it 5 years ago. We have a group chat of over 60 men living with the gone libido and ED that minox/rogaine has caused. Please, if you want to discuss it, try to find a cure, join our chat discussion below:\n\n Hey man,\n\nIm doing a lot better now. Almost recovered.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend starting the CDnuts protocol \n\nMinox causes androgen issues just like PFS\n\nPlease be careful in that group chat... its a very negative place and I dont recommend going near it.\n\nIf you need anything just ask Updates on libido ? How much is the CDnuts protocol helping, like what % are you feeling better? So many people say he is a scammer but I have seen a lot of post-minox guys say his protocol helps them. If you want to know the truth about Minoxidil and side effects come to  r/MinoxidilSideEffects Which were your neuropathy symptoms? Would you recommend to stop minoxidil progressively to avoid the crash? Thanks a lot", "Finasteride symptoms 23M 2 months Just documenting this for anyone curious. I am also interested to hear if my case is similar to any of you.\n\n1) Decreased natural libido- I can still get har from porn, but not really randomly throughout the day. Random boners do not happen, and morning wood is rare when before it was an every morning thing.\n\n2) composition of my sperm changed? Very curious if this is the case for anyone else. My sperm, almost within 2-3 days of taking finasteride, has become a lot more watery. Major decrease in glue like parts, but there is still a tiny bit of that. \n\n3) While sex drive is down, my recovery time between ejaculations has gotten quicker? I used to only be able to ejaculate 1-2 times a day, but now I can do 3-5 times a day. I find this part really weird.", "Why most PFS people are experiencing terrible sides off the drugs and less on the drugs?  The drugs create a hormonal imbalance that I believe supplies enough estrogen to make a low sex drive possible and off it the estrogen balanced back out with not enough testosterone. That experience is enough to traumatize people and associate a negative stigma every time they even think about sex psychologically crippling them if not inducing anxiety. Anxiety makes testosterone lower and estrogen higher.\n\nFeed or breed or fight or flight mode, you cannot do both. Many people are probably stuck to a degree in fight or flight mode and every time they have sex the trauma resurfaces and makes it harder. What makes it easier are substances that give your body an abundance of materials to regulate sex drive with and stimulate the mind because the gut environment changes too and makes you almost in a diseased state. Some people might have diminished abilities to regulate certain amino acids, it is all personal experience. Can this be countered with testorone boosters?", "really bad anxiety from fin? (along with severe insomnia and depression) considering taking it every other day instead I only took finasteride for a month and 10 days before stopping. I got more and more depressed and I realized I could not think straight and my problem-solving skills were reduced drastically. \n\nMoreover, my mind would constantly be in fight or flight mode and overthink future situations (both likely and unlikely events) and try to figure out a solution ahead of time. \n\nI also was very suicidal because my brain was so shot that I truly believed (still do) that I am not capable of living as an independent functioning adult\n\nI also had really bad insomnia for a month too. Either I would fall asleep and wake up after 4 hours of sleep and not be able to go to bed or there would be days where it is literally be 0 hours. \n\nI know most people here will probably say that I should never ever take it again but I am still considering it because my doctor said it would take a few weeks to 2 months to feel better, and I feel so much better after stopping fin for a week and a half. I have loved having hair so much and it is a big part of my image. I have been terrified of going bald since I was 17 (almost 25 now) and if I go bald, I will be depressed for sure anyway. \n\nI am scared of PFS, but if it is permanent or long-lasting even after taking it for a short time and stopping, I think it is worth another shot... \n\nIt is easy to say just stop taking it and embrace being bald. I am not sure if I will ever be able to cope with it. I cannot say anything else other than I have always loved having hair and it is always been very important to me. I would highly advise you not do it. I also had side effects, stopped and everything went back to normal after 2 weeks. But because I was still worried about my hair I restarted at a lower dose. Of course the side effects came back and this time they have not gone away even though I have stopped 3 months ago.\n\nJust go to a dermatologist who will prescribe you oral minoxidil. That is a good alternative to finasteride. I would recommend to stay off for 2 months at least. By then you can clearly asses, how you feel, fully free of the drug. Now, even though i would recommend to quit forever, i can tell you probably will not, but given that you say 'i feel better', id definitely wait another 2 months , and only then restart if you feel like '100% yourself' Do whatever you want, take it and see how it goes at your own risk, you are a grown man and you have to make that decision for yourself. Have you tried other possible alternatives? I would not do RU58841 personally but some people use it with great results, there is also fluridil/ eucapil, might work? I have also herd minoxidil + dermarolling works great too. I would suggest exactly the same thing as u/enough-Estimate if you got sides mean your are sensible to 5ar inibhator. It also mean you going to be sensible in any cases also the topical version. I would highly suggest to never restart fin cause you can get PFS from your second try. I had sides effects after 1.5 years, stop it took 2 years to recover from sexual sides, hopefully my cognitive one were light expect insomnia. From there I wait 5 years before retrying the topical way, and that was the biggest mistake I made. It fuck up my brain despite not doing so much on sexual sides. Hard insomnia since 5 years, anxiety with panic attack which I never had it laterally changed my life at a point I cannot even had a job. Hopefully I was able to manage my life without one but I am lucky I know it. I still got those mental sides and see little to no improvement. So I know hair are important and feeling good looking also, but please try the minoxidil root with dermapen for example and any other stuff that are not 5ar + a hair transplant once you need it. It can be done this way a lot of people with nice hair transplant are not taking fin Do not do it again man I am warning you. If your hair bothers you that much take something else for as long as it works then get a hair transplant. Any updates ?? Also sexual sides your talking about ?", "Test Enanthate does not feel the same After taking finisteide for a single month. Used to make me feel great and motivated and great. Now I do not notice a single effect. Has anyone else experienced this? \n\nSex drive is also gone. Hopeful thing return to baseline. how is about your hair??? I hope it returns to baseline too! In some Finasteride users, it takes a while to get back to normal. How long has it been since you stopped taking it? It is been 4 months. Maybe a 10% improvement .. I am sorry, man. I cannot wait until research finds out to mechanism of action of what is happening here so we can have a shot at treatment. Have you tried Proviron or Aromasin?\n\nT on its own aint going to do anything because Finasteride prevents dht from being made in the first place.", "Another website created by a PFS recovered French guy. Look at the patterns guys (compare this to other recovery stories even on PH)  Thanks for sharing will have a read", "Does brain fog get better after quitting? 25 yo male, taking 1.25mg a day for around 10 months... quitting now I got recovered after a month from brain fog Bro you will recover from brain fog it just takes time How long did you take fin?

Stay calm. It may take a few weeks to get out of your system. In all likelihood, you do not have PFS. In different posts and comments over the past three weeks, you have said your age was 20, 21 and now 19. Interesting, now the post has disappeared and the username was deleted.", "Please read the Wiki for information, published research, and more information on Post Finasteride Syndrome!

Some pieces I took were bigger than others, so chances are I took over the 1MG dose at times. \n\nFor the past little while, my libido seems to be almost none existent. I have not been thinking about sex AT ALL. It almost feels like I could care less if I ever have sex again, which is worrisome. I do not get horny throughout the day at all, and it feels like the finasteride, mind you in a short period of time, messed my body up. I know chances are it cannot do anything in just over a month, but I stopped taking the pills in fear.", "Merck has a history of manipulating their clinical trials. Merck has hid data Here is a timeline of Merck's product Vioxx which caused an estimated 88,000 heart attacks and 38,000 deaths to show you Merck is not trustworthy, and is endangering the public. ", "Please help Did your side effects go away after taking? I should not of taken the pill today I regret it. I have not really slept in like 2 days. I feel like crap.  Have so much anxiety right now Really need some reassurance. I am taking such a low dosage. I did not think it would affect me like this .  Legit 1/12th of a pill every 3 days . Have been for about 2 weeks now. By definition, PFS is when your symptoms do not go away long after you stop taking the drug. As in months and years down the road. \n\nIt is only been two days for you. Give your body some time to do its thing. You might just be experiencing side effects and not PFS. Do not take more pills, and do not take any supplements. Just let your body do its thing. Stop taking Finasteride. Do not take any DHT blockers or anti androgens, avoid saw palmetto, fenugreek, minoxidil, ketoconazole, etc. Do you best to eliminate stress entirely. Stress is the #1 killer, you need to be staying calm and relaxed at all times, practice meditation, deep breathing, walks in nature, etc. Statistically speaking you will recover just fine so you have nothing to worry about. Just avoid these class of drugs at all costs and eliminate stress is my top advice for you. I would also recommend 3g melatonin and 300mg phosphatidylserine to help with your sleep. Propranolol 20-40mg at 9am will also help significantly to reduce stress, anxiety and sympathetic overdrive. You are going to be fine man Thank you so much bro \ud83d\ude4f Keto shampoo too !? \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude32 Ketoconazole is a anti androgen, lowers testosterone and is absorbed into the blood stream. Why risk it given the side effects you are currently experiencing? What is more important, your health or your hair? Take it from someone who has severe PFS, who gives a fuck about hair, health means more than anything. You can add keto back in at a later date, I personally just think it is best to cut it out for the moment, remove all toxins and let your body heal Your 100% correct my guy. I have kidney stones Illl be the firstt to say health is way more important than vanity.  This is not good though. I was punching myself this morning cause kidney stone pains I do not usually do that. The anxiety I experience was insane this morning and i really questioned if it was even worth living.  The not being able to sleep is what is killing me an officially making me stop fin for the 2nd time now.. sleep derivation + not being able to handle stress anxiety will = suicide .. thank you for the information an reassurance I am sure you know how much A person values some support in times like these. I did not know Keto shampoo blocked androgens. Fawkk. I used that shit this morning . Hey man. I need you to understand that suicide is never an option. This is temporary you will get through this. There is always a way through the pain and there are always people who will be able to help you. Finasteride lowers crucial neurosteroids in the brain responsible for having a calming, anxiolitic and mood enhancing effect. This is why you are feeling anxious and unable to sleep. It is nothing more than a temporary chemical imbalance. Just stop all the drugs, do your best to reduce stress and give your body time to heal itself. Obviously eat healthy and do your best to live the healthiest lifestyle possible. I would highly recommend you pick-up some Melatonin and Phosphatidylserine ASAP for your sleep. Sleep is so important for not only how you feel, but also for your recovery, our body heals itself whilst we sleep. High strength Melatonin will put you to sleep, and Phosphatidylserine will lower cortisol &amp; stress to keep you asleep. Good luck man, be kind to yourself, and if you ever need someone to chat to do not hesitate to message me, I have been in your situation before and I am more than happy to help Can phosphatidylserine be purchased at a cvs? And thanks again.  I am on my year and about a half taking Finasteride 1mg. Idk why you guys are ashamed about the side effect in our libido. Since the 7th month of treatment I started to do wear female clothes, doing make up and I am actually a beautiful bitch. I was joking, anxiety is common in my opinion, I have moments of really deep depression and anxiety, but I have insomnia problems because I have problems in home. If your insomnia persist, try visit a psychiatrist, I got to go but It is not inheritance to the Finasteride pills Thing is I do not remember having night sweats an insomnia for 2 days straight my body tired as hell while my mind is just overly active and stressed.  I did not have this until about after a week an a half on fin Oh, you are starting. Look, you are going to experiment weird things in your body and mind because this is an anti-androgenic pill. They are going to block the DHT, so in a way your body are going to experiment some changes, I mean like lose or gain weight, skin more soft and maybe a really little change in your voice, It is like you are going to turn a really little more feminine xd or maybe that is my perception. I am in my year and in a half and I love this pills, they helps me a lot with my confidence so I am with a better mood with friends but I have deep depression when I am alone sometimes. Take It easy bro, If this pills did not make you feel better, just leave. Also: you are going to experiment a lot of hair loss, thing is really normal, that means your old hair is going to grow again in a better way and low libido (but dude, when I have sex, I can dure a lot more with this pills, so no problem ;) :v  ). My advice If you still taking them: sleep nice, hang out with good ppl, eat sane (do not eat too much oil, cookies, bad stuffs), do exercise If you want and drink only water the most you can What Is wrong with Minoxidil? I know it can have some mild side effects but no where near the severity/ type as Fin. I personally think it is best to take out while he is recovering from finasteride use. Why burden your body with more toxins in the form of minoxidil and ketoconazole? One pill. I took 100\u2019s. I am good 3-4 years later. Chances are astronomically high that you are good. Stop thinking about this now Nocebo effect is quite likely. what are your sides besides anxiety, libido drop and depression? probably nocebo or other factors. Try to not think about it for a while. :) im sure ur fine Thanks bro feel much better today anyway. You are welcome. Im pretty sure you are imagining this. How are you even managing to cut your pills in such small portions? Sexually fully recovered back to normal state ? Yes How long did it take and was it gradual could you please explain more how it came back ? I messaged you I got it please get back to me whenever you get the chance thanks again !", "a couple questions about the medication Is there any way i can keep on my treatment with finasteride but also minimize the side effects ( in my case, i have really been struggling with the erectile dysfunction)? like, if i only take it every other day or something\nAlso, i have read that the side effects only last for some time during the treatment but dissappear after a while, is that true? did this happen with any of you?\n\nif u guys cans answer at least one of the questions i would be very greatful, i am only starting taking it but i am already having second thoughts Hi! I do not know how to mitigate side effects while you are on the drug. Common sense tells me to lower the dose, but I am not sure if that will completely alleviate side effects. \n\nMy side effects did not go away after the drug was stopped. It is been over three years for me with low libido, ED, fatigue despite normal hormonal levels. Having side effects while on finasteride is a red flag that they are disrupting normal functioning of your hormone metabolism. Taking it every other day creates fluctuations in drug levels that could worsen side effects. We do not now what triggers the syndrome. but there is reason to believe that sudden changes in finasteride level could be a factor.\n\nAlso, some individuals are extremely sensitive to the substance so that even one pill will cause a severe reaction. Maybe you are not that sensitive, but it tells us that even a small amount can have major effects.\n\nIf you really want to avoid side effects, the best bet is to stop taking it entirely. We do not know about whether tapering helps, but a friend of mine has done a very slow taper over months. He had a pharmacy convert pills into drops so that he could administer very small amounts to himself. In my case, some side effects disappeared and some did not. So I quit. Sensitivity never recovered (it is been \\~2 years). By this I mean pleasure from touch, this drives/sustains erections.", "Currently on finasteride, and my appetite is completely gone Not sure if this is fin related or not, but I have noticed that my appetite is completely gone after taking fin for 5 months now.

I know that can affect your appetite Many people have reported this side from fin / PFS. Really? i am 100% sure it is not because of fin. Check your health first, then blame it on fin Being 100% sure of something just proves how stupid you are.\n\nIt could be unrelated to fin, but it is been reported plenty. If nothing else changed it is more than likely fin is the reason.

It is pretty evident to me that porn and masturbation can cause ED and libido issues because I have dealt with it and have seen thousands of reports on /r/nofap.

Throbbing pain, shriveled up testicles, skinny and wrinkled penis, near complete numbness - did porn do all that to you? Not to mention the myriad mental effects that so many have reported (and which I was lucky enough not to get). My ED and lack of libido were the least of my concerns for months, if I am being frank.\n\nIf your mind's already made up and you are hellbent on taking finasteride, go ahead and take it. If you think people on here are exaggerating or lying, then maybe you will be fine. Personally, I think it is pretty silly to risk it knowing what you know from reading this subreddit. Please check this out:  Post Finasteride Syndrome is much more severe than just erectial dysfunction. Try penile shrinkage, testicular atrophy, chronic fatigue syndrome, brain fog, insomnia, tinnitus, anhedonia, loss of emotion, and the list goes on. This syndrome is much more debilitating than just sexual dysfunction. Penile shrinkage? bs Looks like you have some more research to do.

My hair is actually not too bad at all, I have essentially just got tons of shedding over the last year and I thought hey, male pattern baldness is inevitable - might as well keep my hair looking good since preventative is the only real solution. Got a prescription online on Tuesday after thinking about it since july, got the 5mg pills Thursday and took 1mg that day and 1mg friday(none Saturday or today). On Friday I noticed I was like super zoned out during my online classes(kind of normal for me) and i did only sleep like 5 hours that night. But then i was going to go out with my friends that day and i ended up being SUPER lazy in bed for like 2.5 hours. Went out and had some drinks etc all good. I did do ALOT of research before getting the prescription though. So i know the side effects and was like eh, honestly i do not really care about the ED and sex drive stuff because my sex drive is insane right now so if anything it going down is more manageable. But on Saturday, i slept like normal Friday night and i was still super tired when i went out for dinner with my parents and i was just like a bit out of it? and i was thinking during the day why am i so damn tired and brain foggy. Ive had brain fog before a few years ago when i used to smoke weed in highschool etc and i dont really like the feeling. I also quite vaping a week or so ago (after many years) so i already had a bit of brain fog. Today i acted normal but i just felt hyperaware of stuff and I am not a anxious person at all but i feel like I have been over examining everything including my memory as i feel like \"tunnel vision\" where i can recall everything fine when i try to but i feel like my memory is not as good unless i focus on it. Not sure if this is because of the Fin or me hearing all the negatives and quitting nic. Did anyone else with bad side effects get this? Did anyone else get this and it went away with continued use? Im just hesitant to continue because i feel like i cant multitask as well as normal and i feel stuck in my head. No physical side effects at all, and I feel like asking my pharmacist would give me a biased response since they obviously have not personally taken the medication themselves. Thanks for any advice or help! The drug reduces the availability of DHT. Research has shown that finasteride use is associated with altered levels of other neuroactive steroids.\n\nSome neuroactive steroids act as modulators of brain receptors such as GABA and NMDA receptors. \n\nAltered levels of neuroactive steroids may also interfere with dopaminergic signaling. \n\nSo we have evidence the drug is linked to disruptions in important aspects of our brain/mind architecture.\n\nHere is a recently published review:\n\nSaengmearnuparp T, Lojanapiwat B, Chattipakorn N, Chattipakorn S.

I cannot live with that anymore :/ Dude have you tried to do some bloodwork? Do not just quit finasteride and wait for symptoms to disappear, investigate further. I did not try , i will do in the Next days\nIt is possible my hormones did not come back to normal yet ? Has there been any recovery? It is possible that they were never that great to begin with or that some other life factor screwed them up. Test every single thing you can afford that could cause these symptoms. Do not accept \"normal range\". Read, interpret, and discuss your results with your doctor. I agree, this does seem possible. i believe my mental health never been great i had Anxiety , depressed way before finasteride and my hormones never been good ( just my feelings) , but now far worse i never had total loss of libido , my face looks bad ( i was very good looking), i loss my muscle,my girlfriend left me ... \nThank you i Will give that a try.\nif i recover i will be better person and happier person in the earth Yes - I am a year off and symptoms come in waves.

I have not been on anything since around  Dec 1, and have just started feeling better this week.  Morning wood every morning now!  I am very happy about that! \n\nI feel as though taking tribulus and N2Generate really delayed my recovery, but that is my own fault.  \n\nThanks for letting us know that creatine caused you to crash after feeling good for so long.  I workout a lot, and will stick to only protein and BCAAs for the foreseeable future.  \n\nLay off the creatine and hopefully you will be fine. \n\nGood luck!

As a result, atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant of ground, surface, and drinking water. Atrazine is also a potent endocrine disruptor that is active at low, ecologically relevant concentrations. Previous studies showed that atrazine adversely affects amphibian larval development. The present study demonstrates the reproductive consequences of atrazine exposure in adult amphibians. Atrazine-exposed males were both demasculinized (chemically castrated) and completely feminized as adults. Ten percent of the exposed genetic males developed into functional females that copulated with unexposed males and produced viable eggs. Atrazine-exposed males suffered from depressed testosterone, decreased breeding gland size, demasculinized/feminized laryngeal development, suppressed mating behavior, reduced spermatogenesis, and decreased fertility. These data are consistent with effects of atrazine observed in other vertebrate classes. The present findings exemplify the role that atrazine and other endocrine-disrupting pesticides likely play in global amphibian declines.\n\n", "Recovery Stages For anyone that is recovered here, what were your stages of recovery?

I found out ED can be a side effect of quitting and when I found that out I quit cold turkey. Immediately getting a hard on became more and more difficult and now Im 2 weeks off the meds and I can barely seem to maintain an erection when I used to be able to masturbate multiple times a day and stay hard for hours, I can barely seem to stay hard to finish watching porn and its only like 80% of my normal erection and my libido is nothing like what it used to be.\n\nI just want to hear I am not alone.

Im inclined to go back on the meds to go back to semi normal like I used to be. I just need hope. Is all lost? You will be fine.  Give it at least 3 months before you jump to any conclusions. Do not go back on finasteride to try to fix this, that is a horrible idea.\n\nTake it easy, meditate every day, and do not drink any alcohol for the next 3 months at least.

I am in my year and 2 months and I did not had that problem but also less sexual appetite and I jerk myself only once a week because If I did not do that I am going to wake up wet (this was before this pills so I am like always be). I think It is because you left the pills but do not be scared, wait more time and idk, If I would be in your situation I would not stop to take the pills for that, It is not a problem for not take It for a couple of days, the problem becomes after much more time I think. Do not get obsessed with this, just take It easy and try to only think about xxx stuff only when you are going to do It (that would make you less and less anxious and also this helps me a lot for sex, I can have sex many times in the same day). Hope your thing gets better :) I took finasteride for 12 years, have been off for 11 months now. I go through waves of this. A couple weeks I am almost back to normal and then back to no sex drive and ED. I am hopeful it will get better over time but I did take the drug for a very long time. A big positive is that I did get my wife pregnant while I am going through this, it was something I feared would not happen because of my side effects. It is depressing but I stay hopeful it will get better. Also, the sleep thing is real. If you are getting bad sleep it makes the ED a certainty. Mind giving us an update on how you are now doing? Thanks man! I have fish oil I am going to start trading that and more vitamin c. Also what is a hyperangrogenic phase? I hope it gets better soon. It seemed like the libido thing got better breifly, but now im having the same issue... Normally with my girl before I stopped the drugs I would be rock hard around her 24/7. I have been off finasteride for almost 2 months now? I stopped around the 25th of December, its the 21st of February now...and have heard it can take up to 3 months to recover... like she still arouses me and I get like 60% hard, sometimes 80% hard just being around her but its not like it was before \ud83d\ude15 and I just feel so embarrassed and emasculated around this woman I am so deeply in love with. I am holding out hope that I will start recovering by the end of next month. I am attempting to get back into a regular gym regimen. Trying to eat healthy and lose a little weight while cutting down as much as possible on heavy drinking. I will post again 3 months out to let you guys know. I appreciate all the kind words. Please if anyone else has more stories please post.i could use the encouragement. Thanks guys. Update. Im about 3 months out now. Happy to report all seems to be working well again!!!! Libido back, no apparent erection issues... even gained sensitivity back. Theres hope people!!!!", "Can finasteride beta-ize men? When I was on it I remember having more dainty mannerisms and feeling less manly and less aggressive. I had gay men hitting on me and women thinking I was gay. Is it just me? Since stopping I feel like the manliness and aggression is coming back. It is kind of weird and I did not even knew finasteride could even cause this. You did not know you would get more feminine when you inhibit a large portion of the most androgenic hormone known to man? No I thought DHT was only important when going through puberty and that testosterone could make up for the lack of DHT. I did not even realize the finasteride was the cause at the time but it makes sense now. tl;dr: The origins of finasteride trace back to a study of people in Dominican Republic who had ambiguous sexual development: believed female at birth, matured into males with alterations at puberty. The drug was developed to emulate an enzyme deficiency in this population.\n\nThe discovery of finasteride was prompted by research on people in a Dominican village called *guevedoches*. They were believed to be girls at birth, but developed male characteristics at puberty, with a few exceptions: they had smaller prostates, no hairline recession and no acne. The paper reported that this population had a deficiency of the enzyme 5-alpha reductase. Finasteride was developed to inhibit 5-alpha reductase, to emulate the condition of the *guevedoches*\u2014specifically, smaller prostates and no hair loss.\n\nDocuments from the Propecia drug approval process quote the lead investigator, Joanne Imperato McGinley, saying that the drug emulated the 5-alpha reductase deficiency, but it was OK because other than these few differences, the guevedoches were otherwise normal.\n\nStory:\n\n&gt;The extraordinary case of the Guevedoces  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(\n\nStudies by Imperato-McGinley:\n\n&gt;Steroid 5alpha-reductase deficiency in man: an inherited form of male pseudohermaphroditism. (  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Androgens and the evolution of male-gender identity among male pseudohermaphrodites with 5alpha-reductase deficiency ( In most tissues DHT is the main androgen, especially liver, brain, prostate and penis.\n\nAnd DHT have a much higher affinity for the AR together with a several fold longer binding duration.\n\nAnd since T is a substrate for aromatse, it is virtually impossible to maintain high enough T levels to cut the slack.\n\nAnd then we are not even discussing the other hormones/metabolites where 5AR is taking part in, or the metabolites of DHT. Just come out of the closet and stop blaming Propecia for being gay. It is 2021, it is ok. Bro I thought I was crazy lol. Idk about the gay stuff but since I started I have been noticeably less aggressive. My girlfriends have even mentioned this for me it is a positive as I feel I was a little too aggressive before, I feel like I am more touchy and intimate with them lol. And I do not blow up over small things like I was too I am just like w.e lol. Haha it is ok bro. They also had mini penis syndrome less than 3 inches and some borderline hermaphrodites. And no one did studies on mental health . 3 inches is 7.62 cm Men who take Propecia or Durasted get it from family Drs and Dermatologist. And never bother taking a blood test BEFORE using it .If you have low T levels to begin with 400 or under and crush your DHT which is 5\u00d7 more androgenic than testosterone than you probably destroyed the hormone that was keeping you sexually active. And crushing the 5 alpha reductase means instead of converting to DHT the binding testosterone MUST convert to estrogen. Plus 5 alpha reductase makes many other hormones that men need that Drs dismiss . DHT is responsible for agression  including sexual aggression and muscle strength. Muscle size is usually not changed. I agree there was not enough study of these people to say that they were otherwise healthy. idk about the gay part but since this shit i noticed something weird. \nThe other day i was in the supermarket with my mate.

I got Gyno from from Fin like 9 months in (mainly just puffy nipple) looked in SERMS but do not really want to fuck with my hormones rn. It also caused the nape of my neck to thin out which may just be from hormone imbalance. Any advice or similar experiences? I got it also about 9 months after my first pill. That is when I quit fin. \n\nI can tell you that the only way to get it removed 100% is surgery.\n\nBut when you stop using fin and your androgens go back to normal it is likely it will at least shrink considerably for you.\n\nIt did for me but it took a few months to go back. I had some teen gyno already so technically I still have gyno. But after I quit fin it got back to baseline after 2-3 months. Right. I am just scared to use a SERM because I did not get any blood work done before getting on Fin so idk if it would mess with my prolactin levels and make it worse. I see studies of gyno being reversed with discontinuation but no personal stories. I am only a month off rn and it still basically the same. Are you back on rn? I was taking 0.5 everyday might switch to 0.5 2-3 days a week once my levels get back I got Gyno when I went thru puberty as well, worse than I do now and it went away after a few months. I do not think a SERM would affect your prolactin. But I do not think it is a good idea to use one either. Done wrong it can make your issues worse in the end.\n\nNo, I will never use fin again. It was a really bad decision to begin with. It is such a badly designed drug. Of course I did not think I would get persistent sides, but someone have to get them after all...\n\nOne month is not enough time. The 5AR enzyme is recycled every 30 days. And with fins half life your not even producing DHT at full force yet. Damn you still got sides? I had watery semen and maybe a 10% drop in erection quality but they are back to normal and my semen is a little better probly need more time tho Yeah I still got sides sadly. But I am still recovering slowly I think. Yeah I reversed mine after 2 months of Raloxifene  Did you get back on Fin? No, going to wait till I am 20 to get on it again", "All doctors on pfsfoundation.org have taken Finasteride themselves. Easily visible.

I was aware of all the potential sides with Fin, but did it anyway.  I have been on it for 2 months .25 mg MWF - which I am thankful for because I cannot even imagine if I did 1mg Fin everyday.  \n\nI went to urgent care and everything came back normal.\n\nI stopped taking fin, and will not be going back to it.  It has been 4 days since I have taken my last one.  Feeling a little bit better, definitely still some brain fog and bursts of anxiety. \n\nI hope to get a full recovery, and am optimistic considering my low dosage.  Just wanted to share my story, also does anyone recommend any supplements to take while coming off fin?\n\nThanks!  Join group for help Yeah it could be the result of fin. Only panic attacks I have ever experienced was while taking fin, it can induce pretty heavy brain fog and anxiety, especially about a week or 2 after ceasing to take it. After you experience those sides and experience the prolonged wait to recover from those mental sides suddenly balding does not seem so bad at all. Those are facts.  I will try other things but fin, I rather have my mental state about me than my hair.  It really puts things into perspective I would recommend NOT taking any supplements. Plenty of people have made themselves worse with random herbs and pillows. Avoid stress, nourish your body, do some light exercise, and get good sleep. \n\nYou will be fine.", "Success after a week off topical finastride It is been a week or so since I stopped using topical fin and minoxidil and I feel like I am back to normal. My brain fog has lifted as the days passed, my libido has gotten back to normal, my erections are back and seem bigger then I remember, like theres more blood flow...it feels thicker, my semen is back to normal. I get morning wood but not as commonly because my diet has been trash so I need to get a handle on that. My penis now hangs normally instead of being shriveled up as if I were stood nakid in the north pole.\nI am never taking any DHT blocking chemicals ever again.\n\nIt is remarkable to see this turn around. The people I bought it from said I would be feeling normal after a week of coming off but I was fearing the worst. \n\nSome tips that may help:\n\nSupplement with Tongkat Ali, it is the best natural testostrone booster out there. It is a herb that comes mainly from the Malaysian forests. It work by signaling the cells in your testicles to produce testostrone which may help in reducing the symptoms. You want to do your research and get it from a company that is the real deal like \"lostempireherbs\"\n\n4000mg of L carnatine daily will build back testostrone receptors.  ordered it and it still has not arrived so I could not say if it helps or not but that is what I believe to be true, you also want to take it with a fast digestive carb to spike insulin to help it work its magic. To what extend do/did you fear going bald, and now that the anti androgen option is gone, how long would you suspect, till ur shave-ready? just curious My man (46) is 1 year out from last dose of Fin., FEB 2020. Had bad crash (died &amp; resuscitated) in MARCH 2020. NOT an unhealthy guy. His heart rate was lowered by Fin.(bradycardia)\n99% of the bad sexual side effects &amp; mental clarity symptoms are gone. STILL has nice amount of hair, plus fully working parts down there \ud83d\udc4d glad to hear it, I hope you guys are happy for years to come a couple years buuuuuuuut I am going to be doing nail rubbing which increases blood flow to my scalp which then in turn decreases build up of DHT. This has worked really well for me in the past, along with that I will be doing 1.5mm every week as well as driving to go further in my nofap journey which will also decrease DHT in the scalp so I am increasing blood flow and decreasing DHT in the scalp normally along with eating foods that are nutrient packed so I am hopeful still. If not then well I will admit defeat. What about you This is encouraging to read. Fuck these drugs man. Why would I ever put something in my body that decreases DHT? We are MEN, we NEED THIS SHIT. Lol", "Could this be it? Guys I took Propecia for 3 days and I quit 3 weeks ago because I had severe brainfog.\n\nAfter I quit I saw a lot of improvment but now after three weeks I had something like a huge crash. I have trouble to concentrate and I have huge anxiety. \n\nI am still able to have sex but i feel like my orgasm are a bit weak but I can still become full hard.\n\nDo I have just to wait a little bit so these symptoms disapear or will they be permanent?  I only took 3mg.\n\nThanks It is very typical for Post Finasteride Syndrome to present itself as a couple weeks of improvement / normality after ceasing the drug, followed by a severe crash and worsening of symptoms. This has been reported by the many anecdotal accounts over the years. PFS is sadly very real despite what you may read on hairloss forums. The best thing you can do is to eliminate stress &amp; anxiety entirely, do your absolute best to not worry about it, get off the internet &amp; forums, focus on living as healthy as possible, eliminating stress, good sleep every night, healthy diet, just the essentials. Put your body in the best possible position for recovery. Good luck, you will be fine, it is a marathon not a sprint. Will I be better off because I only took 3 doses? You will be fine man. Please listen to me when I say stress &amp; anxiety are currently your biggest barriers to healing. You must do everything in your power to reduce stress, anxiety, cortisol. Focus on parasympathetic nervous system activation, staying relaxed, mindfulness, etc. Do things like deep breathing, walks in nature, listening to relaxing music. Avoid forums as this will only fuel you with more anxiety. Avoiding the \"fight-or-flight\" is of the upmost importance. Do not push yourself or force yourself, listen to your body. You will be OK, you will recover. Set your mind on that and do everything I am talking about. You will get there. Thank you!! How old are you 23, how likely is it fir the symptoms to dissapear after a couple of months? very true what he is saying  \nIts like a wound, if you keep picking it, it will eventually heal, but it will take longer and it will not heal as well. Stress is now the equivalent of that very did you also experience side effects which lasted after stoping propecia? and did they dissapear? That Is why im here. anxiety&amp; depression havent left me Worst case the symptoms should at least improve over the next couple months.\n\nMost people seem to recover in the early stages though. Do what everyone says and relax, and try to live your life as normal and not stress about it. It likely is, I had a huge crash that sent me to the hospital for panic attacks. My symptoms have improved over the course of 4 months quite steadily, although anxiety comes in waves.\n\nThere is already some good advice in this thread. Focus on self improvement and know that it gets better, you just have to be patient and proactive in your recovery.", "Right upper quadrant pain Anyone get this while on finasteride? It is a dull ache just below the ribcage. It is likely the gallbladder but I had an ultrasound and they did not find anything. Ya I experienced that right as my dick started hurting/ lost feeling. That part went away but still\nHaving penis sensitivity issues, been off for 5 weeks now, things are starting to get better I think\u2026fingers crossed Interesting. Are you circumcised? Ya How far up does hair grow on your shaft? You are Autistic, so you cannot be giving sarcasm here. Why ask this? I am curious. I am not autistic lol. The guy was complaining about sensitivity problems. Being circumcised will cause keratinized skin leading to desensitization. Moisturizing daily and wearing a Manhood will soften the skin. Also shaving or having the hair waxed off the shaft will make it more sensitive. oh... I have never came into contact with a hairy shaft... just the base. TIL... Thanks, I think. Depends on the size. Larger ones can have hair growing halfway up. I hate it, I get it waxed off. Not a fun experience but it makes everything feel so much better.", "Strange experience - is this Fin Syndrome ? A couple of days ago - while getting intimate with a sex partner with a complicated history (broken heart, feelings are involved), I went limp. I thought it must be anxiety at first but then when I could not get hard even with physical stimulation - I immediately freaked out and thought Finasteride. I almost always respond to physical stimulation and I had started taking Fin about 4 weeks ago.\n\nI freaked out the entire night and could barely sleep. I was quite depressed and nervous the day after too. Then I tried masturbating to see what is up a day after. I was still feeling quite anxious and again, I could not get hard and came while only like 50% hard - so kind of while flaccid. This was again very demoralizing.\n\nI have been reading stories about Fin syndrome online since and was quite convinced this is what I have. \nI had even noticed decreasing libido and tried to compensate with maca for 10 days prior to the ED episode. Some in this sub have pointed out can make matters worse and so I thought may be Maca and Fin had some kind of interaction and completely killed my libido and erection.\n\nI did not take Fin today (my first day to stop). I had stopped Maca couple days ago.\n\nExcept I started feeling horny a while ago, decided to see if I can still even get hard and ended up having the hardest erection ever and stayed quite hard through the session and after for a bit (sorry, TMI - but nature of the question).\n\n\nIs this Finasteride Syndrome or something else ?\nI am finding it a bit difficult to believe that just discontinuing one day made such a big difference. \n\n\nSome other things to note - \n- I do have a history of anxiety in general and performance based anxiety even before I had ever started Fin.\n- Also, this is my second time starting Fin. I had been taking it for 17 months and stopped about 7 months ago. I was going through severe anxiety and depression for some unrelated reasons. And my doctor wanted to do a baseline of everything including testosterone. So I discontinued for 2 weeks to get a baseline testosterone test but then decided to just discontinue to see what happens. Then restarted about 4 weeks ago. when you stop fin sides become stronger in the next week generally, so stop fin and if you experience more sides or less libido then its probably fin, read the experience of other people, fin can be very dangerous for some people best not to use finasteride for a while, but knowing from my own experience with anxiety, it might fuck you up. anxiety can make you feel things, not feel things, think things, sense things, etc. anxiety is quite an animal There is another poster, here, who shared a similar experience with \u201cextreme\u201d super-improvement, only to experience another period of worsened symptoms-read deeper into the posts...\nAs for your link to previous disposition-My guy had a history with manageable mid-level depression, anxiety &amp; paranoia before Fin. Obviously, Finasteride took his symptoms off the charts after about 18 months of use. He stopped, cold turkey, after about 24 months of use, but, it played havoc with his mind and our lives for a bit.\nIt seems that there is a subset of people with a \u201cpredisposition\u201d to depression &amp; anxiety that are impacted quite drastically and negatively, as their symptoms are compounded. It takes self awareness to self-assess and correct. Seems like you are already turning things around \ud83d\udc4d best", "PFS but all hormone levels are OK - Possible? The title says it all. I am wondering if that is even possible?\n\nAnyone here had PFS and cured yet hormonal levels looked OK to begin with? \n\nI feel many of the symptoms BUT estradiol on the lowish range for men. Also prolactin, progesterone, test and free test seem fine. Hormone levels on the blood do not seem to correlate with PFS symptoms. Meaning - people can have blood tests within range and be totally messed up. Or they can have blood tests outside the range and feel relatively ok.\n\nThe one study I am aware of found no difference between PFS patients and normal controls. The differences where in the spinal fluid (meaning the brain). Thanks. Actually my hormone levels were OK even DURING dutastedie use. Estradiol actually on the lowish range, high testosterone, good prolactin and progesterone levels too. Hormone levels remained looking good post usage.\n\nSo how can one know if it is just a coincidence that he got depressed and other symptoms?\n\nClearly there will be people with depression and anxiety that have taken finasteride or dutastedie same as there would be people who have taken any other drug. Might be a coincidence and non related to the use of 5AR inhibitors.\n\nI have taken for about 15 years and I have gone through so damn difficult years in life so I am trying to figure out if my difficulty focusing, general anxiety and depression are the result of environmental psychological issues or the result of fucked up neurosteroids or what gives.\n\nLooking for a biomarker I guess. The PFS Foundation and the PFS Network are working with researchers to find a biomarker. There are some candidates, but nothing is certain yet.\n\nRe: coincidental depression - these are people with no prior history of mental illness, who saw their problems start when they took finasteride, and in many cases get worse after they quit.\n\nAlso, it is not as simple as \"just\" getting depression and/or anxiety. In most PFS patients, this coincides with memory problems, brain fog, low motivation, inability to focus, visual problems, reading problems, and many more things.\n\nI think it is actual far more common that people have mental problems, but fail to attribute it to finasteride/dutasteride. In your case, you might think you had some difficult years, but it could have just been pernicious side effects sneaking up on you. Yeah. Also have low motivation, brain fog, inability to to us and reading as slow as hell. But having taken the medicine for 15 years never really noticed. Might have creeped in slowly.\n\nSo you or anyone knows of a doc who specializes in treating PFS patients? Or any possible treatments to try? Doctors are not much help, I am afraid.\n\nYou can check it this list, though - \n\nIf you are on the US West coast, DM me for a few more. What is your E2 level? Low E2 can be punishing. Wonder if Finasteride can somehow lower E2. What is your exposure to thallium? The symptoms you describe are all in the list of diseases that thallium causes. Exposure to thallium bioaccumulates  in the hair before other parts of the body. Thallium binds to sulfur. Thallium exposure in just 1/2 gram, will kill you. Much less will give you Alzheimer\u2019s, hair loss, etc. Tested PFS patients all had low E2 in the brain, but normal in blood serum. Is there a study that comes from? Yes.\n\n\n\n U maybe having low gaba activity My Estradiol (E2 Low) level is 45 pmol/L (12 pg/mL) which is on the lowish side. That is super low. Go to /r/steroids and you will see people whose ideal level is 30-40. Granted, their juicing and everyone likely has a different ideal E2. But yours is low, and I wonder if that is causing your symptoms. How does one raise E2? Mine's at 13.8. Do you also have PFS? What is your total Testosterone and free T?\n\nFrom my research (do your own), you raise it by taking or increasing testosterone injections and lowering aromatase inhibitors. I have also read of some guys taking Dbol to raise their E2. Also, DHEA pills could raise it. \n\nOf course, you are not on steroids so your case is more difficult. I am not telling you that you should just blindly take those compounds, but that is how you could theoretically raise E2. I wonder if both of you (you and OP) have symptoms from low E2 that Finasteride somehow caused. Yeah, PFS for 20 months.\n\nActually, I am probably speaking too soon re: E2 numbers; that test result is several months old and from before I started clomiphene, which ramped up my T significantly (to 1406 total). At the time of the E2 test, total T was 643 ng/dL and free was 25.3 pg/mL.\n\nJust had another panel done last week, so I will be waiting on that. Did you do \u201csensitive E2\u201d test? I read that is the more accurate one and the others can overestimate. How do you feel now after the Clomid run? I specifically asked for high-sensitivity tests, and I think most of them were (LC-MS/MS), but E2 and a couple others were labelled \"Roche ECLIA methodology\" for some reason. Kind of annoying. This latest test should all be sensitive.\n\nClomiphene helped a little bit in terms of erection quality, did not do too much else. My doc also gave me cabergoline for my elevated prolactin, and I think the combination of them helped somewhat more for libido, etc. There are weeks where I feel like I am finally starting to recover fully, but then the progress vanishes. I think I have plateaued at 60%, where I have been all year. I have came back a visit with my functional doc and she said that my estrogen levels for a male as just right and she would not want to raise it. I was eve pushy about it and she declined needing to raise it. I am not surprised. No doctor would ever touch a mans estradiol unless it was sky high. Most Doctors, except TRT clinics will not know a thing about E2 levels and such. \n\nYou could try a TRT clinic for a different advice. They would likely put you on clomiphene or TRT to raise your E2. \n\nI know PFS is unique, and it does not always respond to hormone therapy. So try at your own risk? \n\nHow long have you had PFS? Maybe you can naturally improve with time. I see. Well, I hope that you continue to improve. Hang in there. I had gone through tamoxifen treatment for 6 months for gynecomastia.  I finished the treatment 3 months ago.  \n\n\nThe gynecomastia was confirmed even though, to the extreme surprise of the endocrinologist, estradiol, prolactin and progesterone were all fine! in perfect range. The endocrinologist even ordered to repeat the blood tests, which again showed the same values. had him scratching his head. \n\nAnyway, the reason I am mentioning this is that my testosterone levels are already on the high end. My test levels were good to begin with, but tamoxifen elevated them to crazy levels. \n\nThis means that I will not be prescribed anything which elevated test levels because my test is already very high and the functional med doc told me she wants to wait so it will be lowered a bit, maybe by itself, after another month of being off tamoxifen. I even wanted to supplement with DHEA but she was against it, as it would raise test levels even more (I have tried DHEA and Pregnenolone in the past and even at very high doses felt no effect on anything, besides elevated libido)\n\nSo I do not see the point in going to a TRT clinic due to this.\n\nTotal testosterone.  \nBefore tamoxifen 23 nmol/l  \nDuring treatment 37 nmol/l  \n3 months after treatment  25 nmol/l\n\nEstradiol (E2 Low)   \nBefore tamoxifen 45 pmol/l  \nDuring 80 pmol/l  \n3 months after treatment  45 pmol/l\n\nAnyway, currently all my hormones are good, except for the slightly elevated Teststerone levels for an almost 50 yrs old male.\n\nI have morning wood every freakin' morning and my libido is up considerably after stopping dutasteride. So that is not my problem, like other PFS suferers.\n\nI stopped taking dutasteride 3 months ago after taking it for 10+ years every day. I see. I agree with your decision making. No need to add more compounds. \n\nWhat is your goal then? You have high test, high libido, and functioning erections, right? Yeah I do I think, I did not test it in real life scenario yet lol.\n\nWhen you read about people with PFS the focus is on libido and erections. I think after stopping the duta for 3 months these things are much better \n\nMy problem, which by the way may very well be from other issues, not 100% sure it is PFS, who knows. But I suffer from mild depression, constantly low mood, and low motivation. Without my ADHD meds cannot get stuff accomplished. Ibwas only diagnosed by a psychiatrist for adult ADHD at the age of 40+, I think the stimulants might be treating the symptoms of PFS in the mental department or the PFS has created an ADHD like condition.\n\n20 years ago my focus was much better, was CTO and confounder of startups and stuff. Also as a developer I did not even drink coffee for focus. Did not use any meds back then.\n\nThis makes me think that the prolong reduction of the 5AR enzyme caused some serious shit.\n\nFor example low tolerability to stress. I think I used to tolerate stress better. I never suffered form anxiety up until 5 or so years ago. It is not that I have any social anxiety or stuff like that or get anxious for no reason. No. But I can get easily anxious from no big deals. As if tolerance is lower.\n\nPerhaps, due to changes or gene expressions, hormones or some other stuff, my body is lacking the the better control of stress and balancing that he could do before. Just a hypothesis.\n\nI am very fit,, active and meditate daily yet I am much more anxious and unrelated than I was year ago without meditation.. Why would that occur? I took a DUTCH test \n\nFunnily enough my E2 was perfect range...\n\nBut my 2OH estrone and 16b estradiol (from memory) were FUCKED", "Is it pfs? Age 22 Took finasteride for like 2+ years and I was fine then I crashed one day close to a year ago now.  I stopped taking it and I was mostly better with a 1-2 week crash maybe every 2 months. Now I am crashing again it is so fucked I will have so much drive and libido usually and then just crash completely it is terrible. Took blood tests and my T levels are good, I think It might be psychological more than anything but it is messing w my life.", "Leo longevity and post finasteride syndrome interesting info!  Leo and his bs advice\n\nFor. Fuk sake the guy takes finasteride What is wrong with his advice", "Is it possible to get fin sides after using it for years without any problem? I startes using fin when I was 26, I am now 32 and for several years I had no sides or what so ever. It was when slowly but steady my erections got worse.  I realized that I no longer had morning wood, performing sex became more and more difficult. I stopped using fin now for several months, so far no improvement. I started to think that maybe my ED is not coming from fin. Is that even plausible to get fin sides after several years? Maybe my ED is totally fin unrelated and it is not worth stopping it.\nGlad for any answer or help! This paper found that among younger men, length of exposure to finasteride was the strongest predictor of developing persistent erectile dysfunction (PED). That is, longer exposure predicted greater risk of developing PED. \n\nKiguradze T, Temps WH, Yarnold PR, Cashy J, Brannigan RE, Nardone B, Micali G, West DP, Belknap SM. Persistent erectile dysfunction in men exposed to the 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors, finasteride, or dutasteride. PeerJ. 2017 Mar 9;5:e3020. doi: 10.7717/peerj.3020. PMID: 28289563; PMCID: PMC5346286.\n\n i am 47 and i taken fin for 5 years when i was 21 and stopped at 25....Sorry to tell you, but your ED is permanent .  Since i stopped after 5 years, the ED and low T got worse.  I tried every supplement known to man to try and help, but they dont really help.  I have to take viagra and T shots just to feel at least 30% normal. Hey man did you try the HCG protocol? I went to the doctor to get my stats checked and the hormon levels seems to be fine. Do not know if he had run all tests but testosterone level is fine.\n\nLiving for the rest of my live with ED would be absolute shit. I really hope it will get better, but what if it is totally fin unrelated. I will loose my hair as well, although it has nothinh to do with my ED, that would even be worse. I would say it is quite likely your problem is from fin if you are otherwise healthy (not overweight, not smoking etc).\n\nI suggest you read through this thread. It has a lot of good posted studies etc. \n\n Thank you for the link, kind of makes sense...\nGuess I am done with fin for good.\n\nReally just hope that I can recover from it. With viagra and co. everything works fine but do not want to have to rely on another pill... This was, if you had ED on fin, and continued taking it, the risk of your ED became PED was higher. \n\nI would say it is a mistake to say: the longer you are on fin, the more likely you are to get ED. This leads to assuming that you will get ED because fin is a lifelong commitment, which is not backed up. You should also post in tressless, you will 100% get replies saying nocebo, etc., but might be positive to check other routes instead of just thinking ED came from fin. Hey are you still taking fin? I am the same way. Started taking fin at 19 and gradually my erection quality has gotten terrible and I have almost 0 libido. However I am to scared to quit fin and lose my hair. The situation sucks. Actually tried to do that but this damn auto-bot deleted my post instantly... I stopped in March, then I tried some suppliments and it got better. Thought it was washed out and hopped on fin again (lower dose). Erection got worse within a month or so. I would say I stopped using fin completely around June 2021 Tired TRT for years.  Does not really help.  never tried HCG.  once you on TRT..you have to take it for life if you numbers are low Good luck to you man.  Fin is the poison pill i wish i never took.  I rather be bald and single than take that thing again..... The paper defines persistent erectile dysfunction (PED) as ED lasting 90 days after stopping finasteride:\n\n&gt;Our main outcome measure was diagnosis of PED beginning after first 5\u03b1-RI exposure, continuing for at least 90 days after stopping 5\u03b1-RI, and with contemporaneous treatment with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5I).\n\nIf someone is still taking finasteride and has erectile dysfunction, it does not count as PED for the purposes of the Kiguradze et al paper.\n\nThe OP said he stopped several months ago. If that means 90 days or more, then that matches the paper's definition of PED.\n\nTo be more precise than my earlier comment: longer duration taking finasteride increases the risk of new erectile dysfunction which lasts at least 90 days after stopping the drug. (I say 'new' because the population of young men did not have erectile dysfunction or low libido before taking finasteride.) Yes because the same thing(chronic inflamation, mostly in the brain) can be caused by other factors like head traumas or other medications like ssri, accutane etc. Testosterone is not nearly enough to check. Ask for a full hormone panel Thanks for the advice. Can you tell me what hormons should be part of this scan? Actually I thought that  my ED could even be due to a covid infection...apparently there are more and more doctoes who link ED to covid. \nIt is just so weird literally two years ago I did not even struggle to get a rock hard erection when I was blind drunk! I simply cannot imagine that the decline with fin would come so suddenly, after years with no issue at all. Absolutely, it has to do with the immune system, disease are one of those things that can mess with it a lot In addition to test you need free test, SHBG, prolactin &amp; e2 at an absolute minimum IMO. A lot of things in theory could cause libido issues though. FSH &amp; LH are also useful to have. In addition to those ones, my endocrinologist ordered:\n\n* Macroprolactin\n* L Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy\n* L Cortisol\n* L Thyroxine (T4), Free, Direct, S\n* L ACTH\n* L IGF-1\n\n/u/Labalay It is. I was on it (topically) for around 2.5 years. Not an issue till I stopped and then came the crash. Been dealing with sides for 5 years now.  I would suggest you to check CD\u2019s protocol. It is the thing that has helped the most and some people have recovered. I got those\n\ncreatinin: 86  (range: 62 - 106)\nLH: 4.0 (range: 1.7 - 8.6)\nFSH: 4.7 (1.5 - 12.4)\nprolactin 11.2 (range: 4.0 - 15.2)\ntestosteron: 18.0 (8.64 - 29.00)\n\nGuess a few values are missing, but sexual hormons should all be in range. I am in a similar situation and in my early 60\u2019s. Tried everything, and have been on TRT for close to 10 years. Injecting Trimix as prescribed by my urologist was life-changing. Getting hard and satisfying my wife was a win-win on many levels. I feel like a man again. Best of luck to you and everyone else here. I have PFS since 5 months. It is a nightmare day by day. My relationship and my future was totally destroyed. I was left suicidal by pharma euthanasia. And you are qsuffering PFS since 25 till 47 for 22 years. Unbelievable!

I am on PFS for 5 months now and it is already a nightmare!   Recovery is posible. Do the total male optimisation protocol. Check the swolesource forum. No, stupidly I got it off the internet (KEEPS is the website), and got one of the faux\"doctor\" online consultations. It was for hair reasons. My urologist did a doppler on my penis to make sure I was physically ok. He then prescribed Trimix injection, which is a life-changer. Go get the exam and ask for it, you will not regret it. My wife now requests having sex! Way better than avoiding it my friend! Good luck to you. Holy shit, please pm me. 22 years with PFS. I want to know how you managed to survive. Only sexuell sites or muscle atrophy too?", "Is this a good sign? I have been off Finasteride for seven days. \n\nFor the past seven days I have been able to achieve a brief erection while watching porn or focussing on a sexual thought. It takes a while and takes some concentration to have a tingling sensation there.\n\nI also get a tingling sensation during masturbation but have watery semen. \n\nI have also woken up most mornings with a brief and numb erection. How are you doing now? Sorry I am not able to pitch in with anything significant but I hope you are doing better with time ? I am sorry this has happened. These are all recognizable as post-finasteride symptoms consistent with many other reports. \n\nThe rule of thumb is to live healthy and give it three months. If things have not passed by then, give it another three months.\n\nNote that supplements may have adverse effects or create complications so use caution if you go that route. There is no known treatment for these symptoms. Guys have probably tried a thousand different things, from hormone replacement to supplements to fasting and nothing works reliably (if at all). \n\nTry to focus on other things rather than obsessing about this, although that is easier said than done. What adverse effects have been caused by supplements? Would Melatonin and Organic Cacao Powder be supplements to avoid? I have been taking those to help me sleep. The first one is a big question I cannot answer. I do not know of anything that actually works for PFS/PSSD.", "How fin impacts me (not a horror story) First of all, I am well aware there is no current cure for PFS and I am also aware that it is a good idea to stay away from the horror stories. That said, I still want to share how the drug has impacted me:\n\nAround the age of 27 I noticed I was balding (well, 25 really but I did not do anything about it for a while) and decided to do research. I knew of the possible side effects of taking the drug before taking it but figured since they were reported to be in the minority I would be safe taking the drug. Big mistake.\n\nAbout 6 months in I noticed it was harder for me to maintain an erection when viewing porn. I have never had this issue, ever, even though I did (and still do) consume porn on a regular basis. I chalked this up to my mind thinking too much about things since I knew the drug could cause erectile issues. And since I was able to achieve erection and ejaculate I figured I was fine.\n\n6 months later and my issues grew progressively worse. I finally stopped taking the drug after a year or so and even reported to my doctor who just told me it was a mind thing (which I do not necessarily disagree with HOWEVER I knew it was a physical issue too). These days I am not able to maintain an erection. I can get hard but before long it is flimsy and shrinking. I have to constantly touch my penis and be in a certain state of extreme arousal for my penis to feel hard as it used to. Never had this issue pre-fin.\n\nWhat is also weird is that I can only maintain a strong erection if I am lying or sitting down. When I stand up, I immediately start to lost my erection unless again, I am viewing something extremely erotic or am touching myself to keep it up. Never had to do this before taking fin. My erections would stay rock hard regardless of my position.\n\n\nGuess I am just wondering if anybody else has these exact symptoms? I have tried abstaining from porn and masturbation but to me I lost momentum when doing that. Like my penis forgets how to get hard if I do not use my tool often. It is very strange. Sex is out of the question. My penis will not stay hard long enough to penetrate (although that could be some psychological issues mixed in now that I am aware I have erectile issues).\n\nJust needing to vent. I hope they come up with a cure of successful treatment plan soon. I hate to stay like that. I feel like I am forced to be a single man. I have read stories that some guys recover years later and I would not mind this being the case for me but a cure would be best. Idk. Thanks for listening.", "Symptons back after vaccination Anybody else got their symptons back after they took the Johnson (or another) vaccin? When I took finasteride I would get a weird tinteling feeling in my toes and fingers and pain in my balls. It stopped once I quit taking finasteride. Now after getting vaccinated I feel it again. How long after quitting fin did you get vaccinated? Probably just a coincidence. About 7 months later No but from what  i heard   covid vaccine's side effects can mimic finasteride side effects and pfs. People are complaining all over internet about: brain fog, tingling, depression,  blurry vission etc. after vaccine. So maybe you were unlucky enough to develop side effects from vaccine. You should be fine in a couple of months Thanks for your reply I am totally fatigued since my second BionTec Vaccination on the 30 August 2021. Ah sorry to hear that. Hope it will get better. Now at the end of November it has become much better. Good to hear! No I have a coldness.", "Has anyone else noticed this? ", "Did PFS hit me? I took Finasteride for about 7 years (started with 20) and quit 3.5 years ago. After I quit finasteride I had a good libido for approximately 2 months. And after that I had issues with my libido. I have to mention that I take pills (viagra) everytime I have sex and it worked in 95%. I also took viagra to have sex with my former girlfriend.\n\nI masturbate like 7 times in one day (always on weekends when I was drunk the former day) but always with tadalafil 10mg(cialis). I think my body works better with erections and libido when I am hungover (does that make even sence?) \n\nI have some nights were I rarely have to touch my penis but get and erection and can keep it long. But all of this just with Tadalfil! There are also nights were I do not need pills but veeeery rarely!!\n\nI had an affair for 6 month. The erections were good until i had to get in action.. i could keep it for like 15 minutes (petting) but that time i had to stick in my erection fell apart. \n\nMy libido since i read about pfs fell more and more..\n\nWhat do you guys think? Did you have any type of sexual problem before fin? In the 7 years you took fin, how was your libido and sexual problems? After stopping fin, was there a point where you did not have sexual problems (constantly no problems)? Yes I had like altogether 2-3 months problems with my erection when i took fin. My libido was good i masturbated after sex a lot of times. With the years my libido fell. I had the first 2 or 3 months no problems after quitting and then for several month problems again. And it switched from having problem in having less problems.\n\nI also have erections in the night. A common symptom is numb genitals. Loss of sensitivity. Medical term: genital hypoesthesia or genital anesthesia. How do you define \u201anumb genitals\u2018? When I touch or softly touch my penis i can feel it. Then you clearly dont have numb genitals, cause if you did, you would know. With numb we mean a cold tip, rubbery, unable to fill with blood, zero(especially sexual) sensation, tough, small and shrivled Okay. No I have a sensitive tip. When I softly touch it I can feel it.", "Finasteride recovery I am sharing my experience with finasteride to help people who are trying to recover from the syndrome. I realized my hairline reciding so i started to use finasteride. I used it for a month and my gf realized that my penis is gradually getting smaller. And I wasnt as big as i was before. So i stopped taking immediately. A week after, everything went to normal. There are plenty of guys whose side effects do not go away just by not taking the medication anymore. From my experience, psychology is so important that this made my recovery really fast. I believe that after stopping the medicine everyone will wake up with a morning erection someday finally. Dont be down. I believe in science. Believe in experience, too, it is the main data source of it as much as i am concerned. Yeah.  But countless men still suffering for years and many went for counseling too. \n\nRead the studies by Dr. Roberto Melcangi and see how the \" medication\" effects the human body.  I will definitely check it, but like i said dont give up hope Research is the only way. Glad you recovered. From the timeline you have given, it appears you did not have the syndrome. In those with long-term adverse effects there appears to be an irreversible change that does not respond to any treatment. I am glad you'r feeling better. It sounds like you experienced a temporary (but concerning) bout of symptoms after using Finasteride. What most people consider to be PFS, however, is symptoms that endure 3+ months after cessation of the drug. Many people continue to have symptoms years and years down the line. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRegarding the smaller erections you experience, that is common amongst PFS victims. Erectile quality is significantly decreased and many people cannot maintain a full erection. My psychologist insisted that I was fine, and I believed him - yet my symptoms remained for years and years after that, despite deluding myself into thinking I was okay.\n\nYour experience is not PFS, it is a normal recovery. PFS is completely different.", "Feel free to share I am going to try and take myself away from these forums for a couple of months because there is so much negativity about (I guess rightly so). \n\nHowever, im was hoping people could share some positivity, not just for me but other members. \n\nMy question is does anyone know of ppl who recover from sides like ED and Shrunken/thin/weird looking penis with that feeling of lightness? \n\nI am sure there is not many active users and if anyone does recover they rarely come back but still. \n\nFYI I can get decent erections but they take work (not spontaneous) and I struggle to orgasm more than once a day from masturbation (although I am trying to limit it).", "Help with anhedonia The only symptoms I had were increased depression and anxiety, and sexual/general anhedonia. The only symptoms I have now are sexual and general anhedonia 1 year out. My orgasms just are not pleasurable anymore and it is hard to be happy. Does anyone have any thing they can recommend to help with this? Thank you The anhedonia is really hard to deal with. I have had it for four years. I feel like a robot. It sucks. The things that make me feel most alive are working out, doing hobbies I enjoy such as playing music, and being outside. I suggest doing things that make you feel alive to fight the anhedonia. Make yourself busy. Perhaps having a therapist will help with this, too? Did anything help with orgasms? Did you try mucuna (velvet beans)?", "DIM blocks testosterone!  Hi guys,\n\nI was looking into starting to take DIM as I seen a lot of people use this as part of their recovery but I am seeing things such as the link above which suggests it is a bad idea. Blocks testosterone and androgen. Too bad. I just bought DIM. I will quit for now then.", "Is it just me or does anybody else scrotum/penis of a much darker color?  Nope. It is darker than the rest of my skin for sure, but it is always been like that. True. I guess i am just overthinking That is due to the penis being exposed to more testosterone in the womb. Happens to most men", "Long term finasteride consumer recently stopped and its symptom 26M Hey all,\n\nI have been taking finasteride for about a couple of years and I was perfectly fine with most of the symptoms such as ED, loss of sex drive, and other physical symptoms. The only thing that I felt different was the strength of erection.\n\nBefore taking finasteride, I was a perfectly fine individual. After taking finasteride, I would say the strength of my erection was at its 80% and not the fullest like pre-finasteride.\n\nI have stopped taking the medication for about 2\\~3 months now that I am planning for a baby with my spouse. Ever since I have stopped taking the medication, I was expecting the condition to get better as time passes by, but lately, I feel like the strength has been much worse than when I was taking the Finasteride.\n\nDid/does anybody experience something like this? I wonder if this is a persistent/chronic problem or will it get better soon?", "Week 2 update. Full recovery I seem to have fully recovered from all of  the side effects of finasteride. Started to feel better at day 12  and things improved more over the weekend. I feel completely normal now. I still would not touch finasteride with 10 foot pole and advise everyone to stay away from this poison Curious how long you took it and what your side effects were? I took one pill, immediately discontinued, felt fine a week and then developed ED last few days Great to hear! How long did you have symptoms? 2 weeks? Glad to hear you are fine now, but lets not go being toxic about the drug. It works. It works really well for some.\nIt works really poorly and can cause big issues for a small minority of people.\n\nWe cannot paint the drug with one big brush because that is how we lose credibility for what is happened to us. Obviously most people who take it do not get side effects. But there is no way to know before taking the drug whether you will or not.  I would personally advise men not too take this drug for male pattern baldness. Maybe if you have prostate problems the gains are worth the risk. But for a solely cosmetic reason I do not think it is. I was lucky enough to have me side effects reverse but it does not appear that all men as so lucky. I took the drug for a little under 2 weeks. Did not began to regain sexual function until 12 days after I took the last pill. I took it for about 2 weeks. I started having ED while on the drug and after I stopped it continued/got worse. It took 12 days for me to began regain sexual function and then at precisely the 2 week mark I felt normal again Wow, glad to hear you have recovered. That is great. Just out of curiosity, did it affect your libido as well? Or just the ED? Yes it did. I had a  whole host of side effects. ED, complete loss of spontaneous erections and morning wood. My body did not react to visual stimuli like it used to. No arousal from porn or seeing a beautiful woman.  My semen volume decreased to the point that it was just basically water. Really my sensitivity to all stimuli seemed to decrease. I drink coffee all the time, but I was not feeling the effects of the caffeine as much. I have chronic back pain, but while experiencing side effects my back did not hurt. My facial hair grew much slower and I did not have any acne. I have had like five pimples show up since I recovered. It felt like a whole hormonal change. Interesting okay, thanks for the background and again, that is great all of those issues resolved. I am worried myself, even though I took one pill. High libido still, but no morning erections for a couple of days and difficult to get an erection. What is strange is I had no symptoms whatsoever until 8 days after I took the pill.  That seems counter to other experiences I have read. Anyway, thanks again for sharing your story I suffered adverse affects as well. Far worse and longer lasting than yours, but I do not advise that people not take it at all, I advise people read up on the real risk of the drug before they take it and make an educated guess. were your side effects eventually resolved? In my opinion, medicine should not permit men to gamble their sexuality on a hair loss drug. 5 years later and still unresolved Sorry to hear it. Have you seen improvements in any areas or mostly the same since onset? How long did you take it? My sentiments precisely. I have been taking fix for just under a month now. I have lost all libido and definitely cannot get it up at a 31 year old. I have been taking Prozac as well which can cause ED so I think the stack of the two may have fucked me. Going To give them both a break and update Any progress ? Been fin and Prozac free for 5/6 plus weeks, all side affects have subsided. I would rather walk into a bedroom with plenty of confidence knowing my man hood will work extremely well than walk in discouragingly with a woman whose may have already excepted my insecurities. How long did you take it for , and how old are you ? 32. Pretty active physical life but not always the best diet (being a chef and drinking above average....much above tbh). I started end of April \u201820 with FIn and shortly there after the SSRI. Consistently took for 5 weeks. 0 libido, 0 interest. Went cold turkey and have returned to a more definitive normality. I thought/hoped I would be in a percentile that would not be affected but I was not. My time to start and quitting was damn near a 3/2 recovery from the time I had begun to a good consistent return. I am 17 took it for 3 and a half weeks. I stopped it Cold Turkey 5 days ago... I woke up with wood this morning but I am so scared I am going to be the population that never gets it back fully. Any advice ?  I have begun rogaine. Kind of a stupid regiment tbh but I am giving it a tryNot the most lucrative thing to admit but if your hair is important to you like mine is, maybe this is the direction you want to start. \n\nAs a 17 year old I would wake up every morning rock hard and any given chance set of legs etc blah blah blah. I would say the probability of FIN effects is a lot higher than reported due to how sensitive of a topic the effects can be. \n\nI have very long curly hair but have always tended to it pretty well with expensive and suggested shampoos/conditioners/products/advice with no family history to balding/thinning of my/family crown. \n\nEither start early with the rogaine and hope to see good results in the future before you are my age. But do not you dare deprive yourself of the probability of a less than lucrative college/early 20s life (if that is a path you want to choose) over a drugs side effects. Shave your head, wear it well and begin rogaine. Grow it out again when you want and are ready. You are young! So what does that mean for me ? I just want to get back to normal my man I do not pretend to have all the answers brother. Your hair and how you take to FIN is going to be different than it may be to me. But I would say do not risk the side effects. Go with rogaine. Just have to be consistent with it and it may take longer. But do not let your hair be the final reason you seclude yourself to getting women (if that is an issue) and having all the self confidence in yourself. FIN did me wrong and I was barely on it. Do not exacerbate the issue starting young and being on it for years on a gamble that you may or may not be suspect to years of side effects for the cost of hair. Fuck I wish I had Reddit when I was your age. I already took it man. It will reverse man. You are young and I cannot say how long you have been on it but you WILL reverse given any side effects you may or may not be experiencing. \n\nHell man, I do not mean to sound convoluted but try it out, it just did not work out for ME atart experiencing some ED...stop it. But you will recover it just will not be overnight depending on how long you take it and start experiencing side effects if you do I took it for 1 month. It is my 5th day off it. My balls hurt right now. Did you experience this ? I did not experience that. Now tbh I did start working out with a good bit of supplements but that was a weight check thing as that is been something I have battled all my life. If you were on it for a month, maybe give it a month for it to get out of your system. \n\nBalls hurt? I am not doctor but it sounds like maybe (AND AGAIN IM NO DOCTOR) but you might just have a build up you need to get out of your system you may not have a desire for due to FIN and early onset ED implications\n\nNot something to quote me on just general male facts and common sense allegations Maybe you are right. I woke up with wood the morning. I guess it is a good side. When I see sexy girls in the street I do want to lick them all up but my dick is still soft. It is weird. But to be fair, i do not usually get erections just from looking anyway. Chat with me, maybe we can talk ? It is real man, I only took it 4 x between 2014-2017 and it has been a living nightmare. Physical changes specifically. All of which started showing months after I quit taking it. These even an article written somewhere out there that I remember it saying \"side effects can persist when quitting the drug after taking as little as one pill of finasteride\" they are are many medical professionals from the PFS foundation that are making it possible to PROVE its real. #pray for it to be reversible. Has anyone else experience the genital shrinkage, it is so devastating that it did this. I can handle the anxiety and depression it caused but it is whole other can of worms no pun attended dealing with losing almost 2 1/2 inches and a ton of girth! Are you kidding me, this drug should be banned! At the LEAST just have warnings about this life ruiner of a drug. The damn dermatologist that prescribed it did not mention ANY of the side effects that men before I started taking it were suffering from. It all seems like it is being covered up if you ask the right people. Toxic life ruiner drugs should be dubbed as toxic. There is nothing wrong with exposing the reality of what this drug has done to so many men, in so many different variety of ways. The fact that the side effects can be PERMANENT AFTER DISCONTINUING the drug should grounds to AT LEAST put a god damn warning on the bottle ! Have you experienced the genital shrinkage? That is the most devastating part in all of this, for me at least. If your genitals are not shrinking, than be grateful  that your side effects could be a lot worse. Because there is always viagra if ED is your only problem. But how do you regrow, and go back to your normal size flaccid/erect. Its literally a living nightmare. Lost a ton of girth and over 2 inches in length. That is great to hear!", "Looks like I have got PFS... What now? (25M) SIDE EFFECTS - low libido, weak erections, less frequent erections, think about sex very little.\n\nStarted getting side effects very soon after starting Fin but reasoned that it was worth it while I figured out what to do with my hairline. However, the side effects never went away. After 4-5 months, I stopped taking it because it just wasnt worth feeling like a sexless old man. Thing is, my libido never recovered, and I have been off the stuff for about 4 months now. I used to be horned up all the time but now it is completely absent.\n\nQUESTIONS - What do I do now? Anyone found anything that is helped them to recover their libido even marginally?\n\nN.B. I posted this on r/tressless and it got barred 3 times on the grounds of \"strangers cannot help you, see a doctor\". I am livid that they get away with suppressing PFS sufferers and side effects so they can keep shilling fin to unsuspecting and susceptible people. Just sexual sides for you? Nothing else? bro why would you continue taking it if you noticed side effects? Never do that with anything. There is a stunning amount of people in these sub reddits who egg you on to keep taking it saying the side effects are only temporary. Side effects usually are temporary for lots of medications Yup, no depression or brain fog or anything else That is true. Even doctors sometimes recommends lowering the dose or just toughing it out. Insane advice. We are the same age, and I have been off fin for about 2 years. Not much has changed but I would recommend you to get a full blood panel done.\n\nImportant hormones are T, SHBG, DHEA-S, E2, Progesterone, LH, FSH and Prolactin.\n\nThese biomarkers might help you figure out a course of action for symptom relief.\n\nMe personally had normal T and low-ish SHBG with high LH so I decided to try Creatine to boost my androgen status and it helped with libido moderately.\n\nMy Progesterone and Prolactin is still double the reference range though and it is probably why I still have libido issues. I am discussing with my doctor to try a low dose Cabergoline to lower prolactin, but not sure what to do about progesterone yet. Might need to suppress my LH with TRT or something.\n\nBut I would try Creatine 5g/day if I were you. Should be safe enough and might help you out.\n\nBe careful though if you still care about your hair, I noticed a quite significant increase in hair loss. After I quit Fin my hair loss was pretty much completely halted, even years after. God that sounds invasive. Going To go for a blood panel and see if anything's up with my levels though. Yeah, I will probably stay away from creatine as I would like to keep whatever I have got as long as possible ha Sounds like low testosterone. Dont take fin if u have lowish T, everyone should know that Well...it may or maybe not permanent .  There not much you can do.  Maybe get on TRT and viagra.  Those are the only things that seem to help.  I am a PFS victim 25+ years...It gets worse as you age.  Good luck my friend. It does not matter. Low or high T can both be hit by PFS. Yeah start off with that and do not skimp out.\n\nMany people just check their T, while in fact many other hormones are just as likely to be fucked up. Show me one proof of that. Ill help you - you cannot. There is not even a causation between finasteride adn long term sode effects that is actually observed and proven. The fact is very simple: people with erectile dysfunction often get treated with teatosterone therapy, u know why? Because it works. Can you guess why they do not get treated by DHT gel? Ill help you again - because it doesnt work. You clearly do not know what you are talking about so I am not even sure it is with replying but whatever.\n\nThere sure is proof that finsteride can cause long term negative health effects, there is a reason why \"permanent or persistent erectile dysfunction\" is on the leaflet in the package. It is okay if you did not read the studies, but you should not make stuff up just because you do not understand it.\n\nYes TRT can be very good for ED, but it is mainly DHT who is responsible for the positive effects.\n\nT works as a prohormone and is great at circulating through the body. In specific tissues like the penis, prostate and the brain there is a enzyme called 5 alpha reductase that convert T to it is more potent androgen DHT.\n\nT is also very good at penetrating the blood brain barrier, where DHT is not. That is one of the reasons why DHT is not used as hormone replacement much.\n\nT is the main circulating androgen, where DHT is more site specific.\n\nIf you were to get DHT-mono replacement it would suppress your endogenous production of T, and thus also the other T metabolites that DHT can never replace (like E2).\n\nSo in order to use DHT cream one would also need TRT to feel good. But in most people having high T is enough to get the right amount of DHT.\n\nThere is many people who have 700-900 ng/dL T but still suffer from ED after they have used finsteride. How come?\n\nWell, androgens are not the sole reason to libido and erections and thinking so shows how juvenile your way of thinking is. Biggest bullshit ever. Show me 1, not asking for more, study that shows CAUSAL effect of finasteride and long term side effects. You cannot, because there are none. The reason Merck put those sides on their label is because paying 5-10k for every PFS \u2018sufferer\u2019 and settling this through putting it on a label saves a ton of money on legal expenses later on. What is more, the only thing that has any evidence mentioned by you is that DHT is intracrine. ED can be caused by other things, but none of those things are related to finasteride (physical trauma, neurotransmitters, blood pressure, connective tissue disorders). Fact is: finasteride lowers your free testosterone. If you had lowish free T to begin with, you are going to suffer from sexual sides. DHT has very little to do with sexual function, people with 5AR defficiency syndrome have normal sex drives and bigger muscle mass. Only respond if you found the actual evidence for CAUSALITY between finasteride and long term side effects or \u2018pfs\u2019. Your ignorant rant is uncalled for and does not help the OP at all. If you are as smart as you think you are, tell him how to fix the problem. I will help you: you cannot. \"Teatosterone therapy\"? STFU already. If you do not believe in PFS, i hope it hits you because only then, you will understand and change tune really fast. Yeah sides do not go away when taking it, it is more like you get used to it and it becomes your new normal. What people do not tell you on these subs is that for them quitting finasteride (no matter how nasty the side effects are) is not an option. You always have a choice. Hair is not everything. Finasteride users will find any way possible to convince themselves that they have made the right choice and nothing will change their mind. For them, stopping finasteride is not an option and I believe many of them have already convinced themselves that they will not get any side effects, because they simply cannot afford to stop it. No matter how bad the side effects. This is a guy with severe mental issues who was likely banned from tressless a while back for being too toxic even for them. We should not be engaging with him. Again you are making a lot of stuff up. It is great that you have a vivid imagination, but you should not post your dreams as facts.\n\nPeople with 5AR2 deficiency have low sex drive, but slightly more muscle yes. But they have 5AR2 deficiency, and fin inhibit both 5AR2 and 5AR3 to the same degree. 5AR3 is important for N-linked glycosylation which is very important for overall health.\n\nPFS directly affect your neurotransmitter / steroids as well. So again you are talking out of your ass.\n\nBaylor study that was recently published showed that PFS sufferers had impaired soft/connective tissue gene expression.\n\nThere is plenty of people with 700-900 ng/dL T that have PFS. Please explain how.\n\nFin has shown to impair eye function, decreased penile weight (in rats) and increased stress/free radicals in the testis (in rats).\n\nIt is likely this could happen to humans as well, only because some people tolerate it does not mean all will.\n\nPSSD, ME/CFS or even depression was once thought to not be real. But today they are all recognized.\n\nOnly because you have not 100% proof of something yet does not mean it does not exist. Only a fool would assume that. Exactly. No one in their right mind would defend the drug (let alone Merck) if there was an effective drug with a better safety profile. Edit: I misinterpreted your comment and thought this was about the OP. Rats penile tissue is completely different than human. It doesnt mean anything, 95 % of drugs work on rats and dont on humans. Finasteride doesnt inpair eye \u2018function\u2019, it inpacts dryness or lack of it not ur vision which is the function. 700-800 ng/dl testosterone and depression/schizophrenia. Facts are: around 10 million people take 5ar inhibitors worldwide, there are 2000 people claiming to have pfs. 1 in 100 males have schizophrenia. Put it all together and see the picture. Again, absolutely no proof on finasteride effects on neurotransmitters, complete bs. Only CORRELATION between neuroSTEROIDS and fin was proven, neurosteroids have insanely short halflife and there is a reason no antidepressants target them even tho it would be easier than to target neurotransmitters. I am not even going to crack the Baylors study , it was already done many times by both me and others on tressless. It has 0 explanatory power and is super biased. Your argument is pathetic. You are telling me to disregard science and rely on online anecdotes. That is exactly why flatearthers exist. Schizophrenia is mostly genetic bro. Im over the age for peak incidence. I agree its a terrible disease and I wouldnt wish it on anyone. Get help, there is treatment available. Sorry, I could have worded that better There is no point arguing with this guy, just look at his post history. Dude has serious mental issues. He made his choices in life and we have made ours we should ignore him and leave him be. I knew that from the start. Not even arguing just sharing information. Maybe someone else will come here and now they will be able to read more than his uneducated beliefs. Fuck you... I wish you will burn in hell. Finasteride is fucking poison you idiot, dont need your stupid study to prove that shit.. im the victim of finasteride, the brain fog and sleep deprivation is so real, i swear to god . Been off for 1 month and slowly i feel better thx god Earth is flat and covid 19 dont exist.", "If you are about to take fin, be careful. I am 19 and noticed a bit of recession around my temples. Talked to the derm and told me I have male pattern hair loss. We talked for a while and he told me about finasteride, how it is safe and all that, \"especially at 1mg\". I took 4 pills total (thursday, friday, saturday, and sunday), here are the side effects I got:\n\n\nThursday : overall felt ok, however my penis felt numb.\n\nFriday : Numb penis and slight pain in left testicle.\n\nSaturday : Numb penis, felt like I had some kind of peeing sensation (hard to describe), felt detached (it is like I would have to try harder not to forget things/remember things). Also, I woke up at 5am after having a wet dream (very odd, I do not even remember the last time I had a wet dream), this is when I noticed I had watery semen.\n\nSunday : Numb penis, peeing sensation, left testicle pain, felt detached from the world,  another one of those dreams.\n\nMonday (the day I stopped taking it. Did not take any dose on monday): Numb penis, peeing sensation, left testicle pain and some pain on the right testicle, felt like a zombie, voice cracks (idk why, maybe it is not related to the drug. But I am putting it here because this did not happen before taking this).\n\n\n\nIt is tuesday morning. I still have a numb penis, but the testicle pain seems to have gone away and I do not feel as detached anymore. I feel a little bit better overall.\n\n\nBefore you say this was all in my head, a nocebo or whatever , I literally learned about PFS yesterday. The derm said the drug is safe and I did not think I would have any side effects.\n\n\nTldr: took finasteride for 4 days, everything started to feel off, stopped taking it immediately. Numb penis for life. Game over.\n\nJust kidding. Hit it with a cold teaspoon and it will come right. And......how are you now? Not funny.  There have been men that have killed themselves because of this.  If joking around is what you like to do, maybe a forum where that is appropriate is more your speed? Feeling better. Still have watery semen, though. I hope that will improve soon. Most will get back to pre Fin state after two weeks to three months. Only a rare percentage develope PFS. i am 19 as well and started taking fin on the 2nd of this month i got sides two weeks in and i stopped 4 days ago. sides include no morning wood, hard to achieve erections, little amounts of ejaculate when i make myself jerk off. i am hoping these sides go away soon, this is honestly super scary. hope we both make a full recovery and get back to our normal lives, sucks that we responded negatively to finasteride though :/ i really wanted to keep my hair. Talk to your doctor. You also take 1mg a day? nope, i took .5mg a day. my insurance is going to make me book an appointment for an endocrinologist wayyy far out from now so i can only go to a general practitioner right now. did your doctor tell you anything of help? Told me to try 0.5 mg 3 times a week.", "23 years old, took fin 1mg for 5 days, very worried I took fin for 5 days then stopped once I noticed my balls aching. That was the only side nothing else. Erections and libido else was perfect. Matter of fact it felt like fin boosted my libido. Fast-forward 2 weeks, I cant get hard easily as I used to. Dick is just limp. I do not notice any other sides, besides the feeling of your balls being under your stomach. I have no history of health problems and im very healthy. One thing I will say though, is I am abstaining from porn and masterbaition. I had a binge about 2 weeks ago as well and I think I may be flatlining as a withdrawal symptom (low libido). Is this fin related? If so, should I be worried? Im scared as f**k  What are we talking about here. Do you take 1 min to get hard when before you got hard at the first touch? You get fully hard? You do not experience difficulty in keeping hard? \n\nIf you answer yes to all, I think you are just too worried. Relax. There was a study trying to relate risk factor to PFS. The most important was: people having strong sides (complete ED for example) and continuing treatment. You are very very far from this, you took fin for 5 days, and you had no sexual side. I used to get hard much faster than now. Even porn doesnt turn me on that much. If that is the only thing do not worry dude. It can just be slightly lower libido.\n\nYou are golden! Any mental sides? No The odds for getting over these symptoms are massively in your favor, but you should try to avoid stress and generally take good care of yourself in the next month or two.  In my experience symptoms kicked in after 18 months, a much longer timescale, so I honestly think this is far more likely to be psychological - try to distract yourself, hydrate and get plenty of rest and forget about it for a couple of months.  The mind is a powerful thing. 18 months!? No way! How long did you take it for? And are you sure its because of fin?", "Limpness Guys was just wondering if the feeling of limp ness can possibly go over time (if any of you know of course). Honestly some days when I might feel my libido a little more (possibly slowly coming back?) or manage to get a semi it is just disheartening when you can still feel the limp noodle feeling. People who have experience it know what I am talking about, kind of feels like your dick is hanging over your body. \n\nFYI I am 4 months from last taking fin today.", "Try Glycine it is working wonders for me at the moment. I recently found a post of someone who experienced depression/ severe anhedonia after stopping finasteride, exact same symptoms as me. I currently have been off finasteride 6 weeks today but crashed 4 weeks ago. \n\nCurrently added glycine into my regime along with omega 3 and vitamin D. No change was found with omega 3 and vitamin D but after taking glycine for the past 2/3 days I have felt so much better in terms of anhedonia and motivation. Took 2 tablets (1000mg) of first day in early afternoon, did not really feel anything to be honest thought it was going to be another dud. Then I took two more around 8pm, started feeling a lot better around 10pm, more focused. Less anxiety and my feelings were much more felt after listening to music. Then it is been 2 days since and this is the best 3 days I have had since getting of that poison. \n\nNo difference in libido, (I still get spontaneous erections but I am definitely not as horny was pre fin). Maybe because of stress of all this but no libido change from glycine just cognitive wise it has benefited me a lot. \n\nI would give it a shot, it honestly is really helping so far.", "Recovered, but sides have suddenly returned I stopped taking Finasteride three weeks ago because I had very bad side effects. I took 0.25 mg for three days before feeling all of the bad sides. The side effects went away after one week of stopping. However, yesterday, three weeks later, the symptoms have suddenly returned.\n\nI currently have lack of sensation in my genital area. I still have sensation, but any sensation that contributes to arousal is significantly limited, and my genital area is \"shriveled up\". The mind-muscle connection down this is lost, too. Dry mouth and chapped lips are odd side effects I felt the first time I took the medication, and those side effects have also returned. And like last time, it has become very, very difficult to sleep or relax at all. I generally feel uncomfortable every second of the day.\n\nThe side effects this second time around are not as bad as last time, but they are still very uncomfortable.\n\nI do not know why these side effects have returned. These side effects did begin after a day of drinking alcohol. I suppose I must wait this out again, hopefully this goes away after a week like last time.

I have been on fin for prob about a month now and I am loving it. Since I have started I have only tried to masturbate once and it felt fine if I wanted to get off. I personally am glad I do not have the urges to do anything sexual anymore though. You know how much time is wasted on porn? Idk but too much I am sure. I am not really interested in sex either tbh, but never have been. I would say I was depressed before I started fin, but now I feel better tbh. Not sure it is helping my hair a whole lot, but I will take ED if it means I continue to feel as good as I have lately. Just curious why so many of you all dislike the effects? Like decreased libido is a godsend for me. I never had a problem with the ed either. I got insomnia from it which is why I had to stop taking it. More side effects may show as time goes on. So feeling asexual is a positive? I mean I guess if you want to live your life alone and do not mind never feeling the pleasure of sex it is ok.\n\nMost normal people will get depressed and feel down about not being able to have a satisfying orgasm anymore .

Hey guys just got my second vaccine dose 2 days ago and all my PFS symptoms got worse, do not know if it is related or not, anybody here with the same experience? Insomnia, anxiety(feeling on edge constantly) , de-realization and sexual/libido sides got worse. I think there might be a link with the immune system and PFS. I remember reading somewhere that someone who got the flu would get temporary relief from their PFS symptoms suggesting there might be a link with the immune system and PFS. I will let you guys know if things get better in the coming weeks. The connection to the immune system might be inflammation. In the gene regulation study that just came out, PFS patient had dysregulated genes related to inflammation response and cortisol production.\n\nIt could be that the immune system activation from the vaccine created temporary inflammation that added on to the inflammation your body was already dealing with. Good info thanks! Did you have a similar experience after getting vaccinated? Do you have the study that highlit the issue in the cortisol gene? I had chronic high cortisol and SDHEA after stopping fin that did not go away. Here is the summary - \n\nBut the full paper is behind a paywall. If you dm me perhaps we can work out a way for me to send you the full paper. I was very sick after the vaccination, but it did not last more than a few days.\n\nIf PFS was about an auto-immune response, then we would see people improve from taking high doses of corticosteroids (which suppress immune functioning), like dexamethasone or Prednisone. But this has not happened.\n\nInflammation is partly an immune system response, of course, but based on the paper (and anecdotes), it seems like the problem might be in cortisol (and related hormones). Androgens like testosterone are also mediators of inflammation, and we know that those are messed up in some way with PFS. All of this is way above my pay grade, but smarter people than me are also doubting that auto-immunity is a potential cause/driver of PFS.\n\nAll of this means that you should try to do lower inflammation in the body... Easier said than done, of course, but obesity and an unhealthy diet is a major cause of inflammation. There are many other factors. Thanks I know how to work it out \ud83d\ude09 Sci hub? University library? Yes, I am pretty sure it is a auto immune disease PFS is an auto-immune disease? Yes, its a chronic disease that affect hormones everywhere in the body, what else can it be? Yeah it is interesting how amino acids such as taurine and glycine help alleviate the symptoms a little bit. Amino acids help ( and help lower inflammation. Yeah we do not really know if it is 100% the case but I think the possibility that the immune system is involved is quite likely. Did you get vaccinated? Did you have a similar experience? No, and I am never going to Glycine and taurine actually makes me feel worse... Confusing! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Hey man, I also have very high DHEA-S and slightly high cortisol, did you ever find a solution for it? Endo keeps dismissing it as my \u201cnormal levels\u201d. My DHEAS is 880 while the high end of the range is like 600. There are actually a lot of people who noticed improvements after injections of high dose corticosteroids if you look on the propecia help forum. It seems as though the type of corticosteroid and method of administration matters a lot. A high dose intravenous injection is what seemed to help the most. A few users stated they completely recovered from a high dose methylprednisolone injection. \n\nI personally temporary recovered after an ACTH Stimulation test where they injected me with a synthetic version of ACTH, which seems to function similarly to a corticosteroid. \n\nUnfortunately this did not last and I crashed after about 7 or 8 days. I remember feeling the crash I was a different person from one second to the next I have not seen these stories you refer to. \n\nBut even if those existed, I do not think it is the immune system that is \"broken\". There could be a stress hormone dysregulation that in turn affects immunity and inflammation. This is what the recent Khera paper suggests too.\n\nIn my own experience, I have been helped by low doses of hydrocortisone, but large intravenous doses of dexamethasone did nothing.", "Study that finasteride alters 3700 genes in PFS sufferers  ( seems like a solid study. could there be any treatments that come out of this information. can the body fix genes? The body can fix gene expression on its own, and there are theoretically ways to manually induce repair. Epigenetic changes are thankfully known to be reversible. If the study is correct (let us not get ahead of ourselves, there have been numerous critiques of the methodology), then the condition should be curable.\n\nAlso, you should fix the link in your post. The androgen receptor over expression make me think someone who compare that to insulin resistance. The mechanism behind insulin resistance could be translate in our case for androgen over expressing This is perhaps the most exciting study to come out about PFS so far. The findings seem to explain many of the symptoms people are dealing with (the psychiatric and sexual ones in particular).\n\nThe findings I thought were the most interesting were:\n\n* downregulated blood vessel and 'cellular matrix' development (probably explains the various pelvic issues people get... everything from ED to peyronie's to pain)\n* dysregulated genes related to neuro-steroids (probably explains the psychiatric symptoms, like anxiety)\n* dysregulated genes related to inflammation and cortisol production\n* no changes to GABA-related genes, but rather NMDA-related ones (this was surprising)\n\n3700 genes sound like a lot, but I suspect that these changes are caused by a smaller number of \"upstream\" genes or hormones that in turn cause other genes to change. Hormones have widespread effects, so this is not a stretch to assume.\n\nOne complicating factor here is that the gene expression changes could be tissue-specific, meaning that genes were only up/down-regulated in the penile tissue and not elsewhere. What is nmda ? What symptoms might that cause?... I definitely relate to cortisol disregulation, my anxiety is worst in the morning when cortisol is highest, I either have too much of it released or my body cannot tolerate it properly I will jump in here, I have some surface level neuro knowledge\u2026 \n\nNMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid) is an amino acid derivative that binds to NDMA receptors. It mimics the action of glutamate, which also happens to bind to NMDA receptors. Both NMDA and glutamate activate NMDA, making them excitatory. I will not dive into what exactly this means, but it is exactly what the term excitatory would suggest; it fires up the brain. NMDA receptors are involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. It plays a huge role in cognition. \n\nOveractive NMDA/glutamatergic pathways are implicated in various psychological disorders. Seeing as NMDA/glutamate are excitatory, too much can produce some pretty gnarly anxiety. NMDA/glutamate (excitatory) are in direct competition with GABA, the brain\u2019s chief inhibitory neurotransmitter. It is basically a tug-of-war between a glutamate and GABA- a delicate tug- of-war that is sensitive to change. Too much glutamate/NDMA activity, and not enough GABA to compensate for it? Bam, wicked anxiety and depression, along with other symptoms. Too much GABA and not enough glutamate? Bam, fatigue and memory problems. \n\nOf course, this is a very reductive view of things, it is much more complicated in practice. \n\nIt is known that finasteride disrupted the synthesis of neurosteroids that are responsible for activating GABA, thus creating under-activity at those receptor sites, and horrible anxiety. It really whacks out your central nervous system and makes you sensitive to even tiny amounts of stress. Additionally, if finasteride interferes with NMDA/glutamate, this throws off the balance and compounds the issue even further. The way I explain it is a bit all over the place, so let me know if you would like any further clarification :D how can i fix this . icant tolerate stress or even little sounds. what should i do . plz help . dont want to take ssri   I know that fasting repairs DNA, can that help? Explain me why is this hairloss drug on the market if it lowers numerous important neurosteroids in men and shows all these possible implications. Literally making money off people\u2019s agony. Great product strategy: Here it works; but do not look at us if anything goes wrong. You took it yourself. Sorry, we only care about money and results. I thought they had PhD\u2019s over there, not a Kindergarten education.\n\nPS: How to improve my synthesis of neurosteroids and GABA regulation? Very much appreciated. What makes you excited about this study? A few reasons: \n\n* It shows a large number of biological changes in PFS patients vs controls, so it is not based on self-reported symptoms or a single mutation (which previous studies have done). It indicates a real and serious problem.\n* The gene expressions seems to be correlated with symptoms people experience, which could mean that these changes are driving the disease. That brings us closer to understanding the mechanisms, and therefore closer to a cure.\n* This gives researchers targets for what to look at next, and could inspire other researchers to investigate. I do not know, but some people include that as part of their recovery protocol and say it helps. It would have been interesting to test a third group that took fin but did not develop PFS. Big pharma is a fucking disaster. To be fair, many folks do not experience side effects, but those that do often experience agonizing ones. I am actually working on a meta-post right not detailing how to support proper GABAergic signaling! I just posted a guide on how to help in the subreddit. Yes, absolutely.\n\nAn even better study would be to take tissue samples from different groups, expose it to finasteride and see if the same changes occur. Then we would be able to know what factors predispose people to PFS and also prove causality. Could you DM me if u find anything interesting. I am not willing to go experimental, but if u find a stimulator that would be nice. How does fasting repair? and how should one fast in order to induce repairs?", "HPA Axis Dysfunction/Adrenal Fatigue Protocol Drastically Improving My PFS Symptoms! Hey guys. Like I said before. I think PFS is really adrenal fatigue/HPA axis dysfunction. Also, after doing more research I think PFS and PSSD are the same thing and it is all to do with 5-HT1A desensitization and HPA axis dysfunction.\n\n\n## The mechanisms behind PSSD\n\nThere are many different SSRI drugs all with different effects. Some are serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, others are serotonin releasing promoters, others are serotonin receptor agonists, norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors, or even serotonin receptor antagonists.\n\n* **Increased serotonin** , even after SSRI drugs have been stopped.\n  * Serotonin regulates proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron output and inhibits melanocortin MC4 receptors through 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C action. Melanocortin signaling is essential for sexual function. So blocking 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C can be very helpful.\n  * Serotonin-enhancing agents that do not stimulate 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors apparently do not cause significant sexual dysfunction ((\n* **Reduced 5-HT1A sensitivity** , due to chronically elevated serotonin and 5-HT1A agonism.\n  * ( shows that antagonizing 5-HT1A during SSRI treatment prevents the induction of SSRI induced sexual dysfunction. More on that in a bit.\n* **Increased prolactin**\n  * Prolactin and serotonin correlate very well and prolactin is a major inhibitor of sexual function. Serotonin primarily increases prolactin through 5-H2C, however, that receptor can be downregulated and you can still have high serotonin and low/normal prolactin.\n* **Decreased dopamine**\n  * Serotonin and prolactin are inhibitors of dopamine release. When dopamine levels drop, prolactin and serotonin get out of hand even more.\n* **Decreased testosterone**\n  * Serotonin and prolactin are well-known inhibitors of testosterone synthesis.\n* **Decreased oxytocin**\n  * 5-HT1A activation releases oxytocin, so desensitized 5-HT1A can lead to reduced oxytocin levels as well, and this can also reduce sexual pleasure.\n* **Lowered nitric oxide synthase**\n  * Low nitric oxide production, possibly due to enhanced oxidative stress, could also contribute to ED. However, excess NO can contribute to vascular leakage.\n* **Blockage of cholinergic receptors**\n  * Cholinergic fibers help in filling the corpus cavernosum, a requisite for erection\n\n\"Restoring 5-HT1A sensitivity\n\nSo how do we sensitize 5-HT1A? First off, excess serotonin suppresses 5-HT1A, so lowering serotonin can be helpful.\n\nSecondly, blocking 5-HT1A has been shown to increase its levels.\n\nThere are not a lot of natural 5-HT1A antagonists that I know of, but one good synthetic one is  **cyproheptadine** . So if you dose it once or for a few days, you should be able to increase 5-HT1A expression as a rebound effect. While you are using it, you might not feel better, but then you might get this rebound effect where you feel awesome when you stop the drug. However, if excess serotonin is not being lowered, then 5-HT1A will be desensitized again\"\n\nI still masturbate 4 times a day, but not as often. It does affect the HPA Axis and really works for me but I do not have the energy to do it every day and I think my new protocol is working even better.\n\nMy protocol is Curcurmin, Licorice Root in tea, Green Tea, Coconut Oil and Rhodiola Rosea capsules. I have been doing this work a week and I feel absolutely incredible.  no more erectile dysfunction, no more penis shrinkage, hair growing back, losing weight, semen not as watery and thicker, no more suicidal ideation, feel mentally better and I feel like I have everything to live for. \n\nWith the Licorice Root. If you are going to use capsules do not exceed 450 mg because this product can raise blood pressure and honestly, I do not think you need to use Licorice Root because it can lower testosterone. We need to raise testosterone to lower serotonin but when  I was researching I saw more people say they got cured from PSSD using Licorice Root more than any other product. Also, I tried it last week and it worked instantly so I am sticking with it.\n\n\nRhodiola Rosea: \n\"By interacting with the HPA axis, rhodiola impacts the  which secrete [cortisol (aka the stress hormone) in response to triggers. It specifically affects an enzyme called mono-amine oxidase A, which is closely associated with cortisol production\"\n \nThis works just as well as Licorice Root and does the same thing but does not lower testosterone. \nAlso, these 2 products can affect sleep and make it difficult to sleep but I think you only need to take them for 3 months or less so it is worth it. I would rather not be able to sleep properly than have these horrible PFS/PSSD symptoms!\n\nCurcumin\n\"Curcumin significantly prevents the stress-induced decrease in 5-HT1A mRNA and BDNF protein levels in the hippocampal subfields; two molecules involved in hippocampal neurogenesis. Moreover, curcumin, via up-regulation of 5-HT1A receptors and BDNF, may reverse or protect hippocampal neurons from further damage in response to chronic stress, which may underlie the therapeutic actions of curcumin\"\n\nAnd I had to edit out Ashwagandha out my other post. Apparently that can cause PSSD/PFS and has the opposite effect..\n\"Ashwagandha reduces the sensitivity of 5-HT1A, but increases the sensitivity of the 5-HT2 receptors Blocking the 5-HT2 receptors are recommended for PSSD\"\nSTAY AWAY FROM ASHWAGADHA!!!\n\nCoconut Oil and Green Tea are also great for HPA Axis Dysfunction, so that is my protocol and it is working wonders!\n\nI am done researching about this too because I really believe I found the cause of this disease and I feel amazing,\n\nAlso, it can take 3 months to cure HPA Axis Dysfunction, so stick with it and be patient!!! I feel absolutely incredible and better than I have in years and I really hope this protocol works for you guys like it has for me!! God is good! Allahu Akbar! Some PFS patients were cured with Ashwagandha in their routine if im not mistaken. How come? I think it is more a matter of timing perhaps. Restoring function before increasing function. I have seen some people say they were cured using it but I also saw people say it caused their PFS/PSSD and it increases the sensitivity of 5ht2 receptors which is not what we want and that is probably why it can cause PFS. Rhodiola works just as well as Ashwaganda and doesnt increase the 5ht2 receptors Ashwagandha lowers cortisol levels if high and increases if cortisol levels are too low. More a balancing tool. Have to know your values then.. I had both ordered. Will start with Radiola. Thanks man!\n\nJust to make sure, is the cyproheptadine necessary or is it sufficient to just take the rhodiola, curcumin and green tea?\n\nAll these supplements are also known to inhibit 5alpha reductase. Do you think there is a correlation here.\n\nIt seems a little bit dangerous for me to inhibit 5alpha again... No problem! And I do not think you need to take that. I only included it because I copied and pasted that whole section but I think my protocol will really help you \n\nI thought it would be dangerous to take them for that reason too but all these products affect hpa axis and I feel better than I have in years What about those of us who were already on SSRIs (and still are) long before taking finasteride, and tolerated them well? Does any of this still apply? Did you also have mental/neurological symptoms like brainfog, slurred speech etc? Did it help with those?\n\nCould you also please state your exact dosage and brand you used for each supplement? You can also PM me if you do not want to post it.\n\nThanks again! Just saying, licorice depending on the dose, and duration can cause low level of potassium in blood. &gt;!That is a bad thing. So you better take it only for few weeks maximum, then take a break. \n!&lt; The only thing I do not understand is hair growing back. It should keep falling once you are off fin/dut. You sure this is not just your subjective appreciation? I never took fin. My hair started falling out because of Nofap and it was telegon effluvium Probably this sub is not the best for you then, or you should make it clear in your posts that you never took fin. Your post is extremely confusing since this is a community for people whose symptoms started upon use or discontinuation of finasteride.\n\nYou even make assertions as to what you think PFS is, based, partly, on your experience, but you never took the drug. I am at a loss for words. I took Saw Palmetto I took Saw Palmetto and Fin is not the only thing that can cause PFS/PSSD Ah ok, sorry. That does make sense, I was dumbfounded after your last comment. It is cool. Also need to make a new post because I think I made a breakthrough. The protocol I am using now has me feeling amazing    I have actually ordered some Kudzu root too and yes I believe Licorice root will help you. I am using licorice root, Rhodiola Rosea, acetyl l carnitine and I will use the kudzu root when it arrives", "unprotected sex on finasteride and contraceptive pills Hi! I am taking finasteride and want to have unprotected sex with my gf who is on pills. Would this be fine, there is no risk of pregnancy this way. Hey bud - why would propecia have an effect on your potency?\n\nThere is always a chance, but if she is taking the pill as directed you should be good. Does being on fin affect any chance of you having a kid in the future. I am male and wondering if it would cause side effects to kids or if I take it now and stop would it in the future. Finasteride can cause birth defects. Finasteride can cause birth defects. How, if I take it now and then stop? Or just whilst taking? Can you please explain in detail Merck itself, drugs.com, the US FDA, Medicines.org.uk etc, all state that Finasteride is not safe to take for men while trying to conceive.\n\nI recently had to freeze sperm and Finasteride was one of the drugs they asked me specifically about to ensure I was not taking it given the potential for birth defects.\n\nHere is one anecdote:\n\n(\n\nIf it was me personally, I would wait for the 5 half lifes of the drug to clear my system, then an additional couple months for the sperm cycle to produce new sperm. This is scary man, should I not ever take fin because of this? If I take fin, does that mean their is a chance my future kid could have a fucked up body.\n\nseriously..., what is the process then You will be fine man.Just when it comes time to conceive I would advise to stop Fin.I do not think the changes are permanent. Just do not be taking Fin when it comes time to conceive and it will be alright. Mate that study or Reddit post alone has made me almost write off fin completely. I bought topical fin, but I am close to throwing it away.\n\nWhat did this guy do wrong? In the post? Take fin in the first place or continue to have sex with his girl after pregnancy, whilst taking fin?\n\nHow long before trying to conceive should I stop fin? How long does it take for fin to clear itself from the system How do these make you feel?\n\n(\n\n\"risk of sustained sexual dysfunction was high (60.1%)\"\n\n(\n\nI would wait 3 months before trying to conceive. 25 days for 5 half lifes to be eliminated (tissue binding is 4-5 day half life), and then another 60 for a new sperm cycle to be completed. But I am no expert, I am just approaching this from a position of logic &amp; reasoning. Wait so are you pro fin or against fin, I cannot tell Are you pro fin I cannot tell? I have had Post Finasteride Syndrome for nearly 3 years now. This drug ruined my life. I am only providing you the information I wish I had before taking the drug so you can make your own informed educated decision. Seriously? What happened, what is your story? Can you please private message me? Why is this so approved! Are there risks associated with minoxidil? Can I take that and derma pen? Minoxidil, nizoral, dermapinning are all good and much safer options. I would be starting with those.\n\nSome say topical dutasteride is safe as it does not go systemic. You will need to research and decide for yourself. Dut is stronger than fin, surely that is worse!? Larger molecule. Not easily absorbed and believed to not be systemic like topical finasteride. Best to do your own research first though, I am not 100% certain After all this I think I should stay away... from it all,,, is it even worth getting a hair transplant I know that but if your gf is on pills is it okay to have unprotected sex? Does finasteride have any other effects on women? I would be wary...I have heard Finasteride can cause fertility issues for men. Sorry to bring more gloom to the chat but my partner took it for 4yrs and is now 8yrs off it and still suffering a full range of side effects. Amongst the many tests he had recently was a spermiogram which showed abnormal results. What if the pill fail? \n\nYou have to consider this possibility.", "Possible to have Fin sides month after usage, when I didnt before? Hey, I took fin for about 3 months, and the last 3 days I experienced some sides, mainly erection quality/time to get hard increasing. I stopped, being scared, and 3 days later noticed i was back to normal, like i hadnt taken the drug. A month and a half later however, I was fapping and my dick was totally limp. This stuck around for a little bit, and this was in April 2019, Nov 2019 i tried no fap to see if that was it, but only went 15 days and noticed nothing, so gave up. Today, I still get horny and hard, but i feel like the quality isnt what it used to, but I have gained a lot of weight, stopped working out as much, but i have no had limp dick since Dec 2019, but never as hard. Also, around the time my hardness came back, I stopped using rogaine. Is this lifestyle effects or post fin syndrome?\n\nTldr: Stopped using fin after 3 months when noticed sides. Got better really quick, but following month experienced limp dick when fapping, even though I didnt notice anything til a month later. varied ever since, but never original strength, however many lifestyle changes since then. Im quite certain ur OK and it is in your head given your description, and even if finasteride did in fact cause thise, give it time. Most guys recover quite well. Even if this happened back in 2019? Is there a way to knoe for certain if I have PFS I have definitely heard of people who took fin and stopped with no side effects, and then got hit the second time around. It seems to be a roll of the dice every time you go on it. Also , duration of use does not seem to matter.\n\nThere is not much else to do than to try to not freak out to much about it (easier said than done) - it is hard to improve sexually when you are scared about PFS. Also implement positive lifestyle changes to increase your odds of your body resolving this on its own. Would it be worth bringing it up to a doctor, or taking a blood test? Given that you are saying; \"Is there a way to know if i have PFS for certain\", probably means you dont have it, otherwise you would be certain. What are your main concerns at the moment, or is it that you get hard to about what? 75%? &gt;t are your main concerns at the moment, or is it that you get hard to about what? 75%?\n\nI get hard about 50-75 % strength and my dick has lost a lot of sensitivity. I still get horny though, and I never had any of the cognitive sides The more doctors how know about this issue the better, so I would say, yes. But be prepared to be met with ignorance or dismissal.\n\nThere is not much they can do though. If you find obvious problems with testosterone, estradiol, prolactin, or thyroid hormones, you could try to correct those, but it is not guaranteed to give you any improvements. So you have been at 50-75% erectile strength for the past give or take; two years? Yes, pretty much. Once in a while 100% How bothered are you by this, and also; to what extend do you, yourself intuitively think that it is caused by PFS instead of nocebo/life circumstances Because I noticed this happening a month after i stopped the drug, and it seems tp be the same symptoms of finasteride crash. Over a two year period I have noticed improvements, but I never thought to ask about it so I figured i should. It could 100% be life stuff, and there are times where i think it is my life style, especially cause i never got any cognitive side effects. It does concern me I have not felt 100% since I agree with you sir, thank you, doc said we would test T levels, and said he doubts it has anything to do with finasteride, but said he would look into it, like many docs he said no one he has intwracted with had permanent sides. But he is a good guy, and in his defense i dont have the super sides like some of the other guys in this sub Send these two papers to your doctor:\n\nKhera M, Than JK, Anaissie J, et al.

Source: trust me bro No need to be so arrogant. I am in the same PFS shit as both of you so i have no hidden agenda. Given that fin is so widely prescribed, and sides are not uncommon, most people must recover given the relatively small amout of PFS people and the massive amout of fin users. I cannot give you a large scale study in which they prove this incredibly obscure statistic, if that is what you mean with 'evidence', but a simple minute of reasoning will do. Obviosuly, by saying this i do not disregard PFS, given that im struck by it aswell, im just a littel baffled by the protectiveness and borderline rudeness You made a claim and I am asking \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Nothing rude about that.\n\nI do not know any evidence that allows us to say with confidence that, among men who have adverse effects that continue after stopping finasteride, most recover quite well.\n\nThat does not mean it is necessarily false. I am saying: we do not know. You have made it clear during your Reddit tenure that you would rather cast doubt on the odds of recovery for the average person. You can use the lack of definitive scientific proof to do so but the fact remains the drug still is on the market and most people do return to a perceived baseline after discontinuation. I know the drug has harmed you and you are bitter but it would probably help to acknowledge this. In my research I have decided nobody should take this drug if they value their health but I still cannot help but question your attitude, especially with respect to people who come in here scared. The last thing they need is stress in their fragile state and you often are the first to link or mention some pretty terrifying shit. I mean no disrespect and I admire your \u2018pragmatic\u2019 Approach to this issue, but it is not hard to parse you out of the \u201cfearmongerer\u201dcategory as you do not seem to want to entertain the other side of the aisle, even to a small extent Your comment speculates about attitudes, motives and experiences.\n\nI am interested in evidence, and welcome any evidence you might bring to support your claims.\n\nObviously Reddit is a place to share opinions and stories, and it is not a scientific forum. But if you package your opinions as facts then I will ask for evidence. But youve got to admit that millions and millions use fin and do perfectly fine. We are clearly outliers, dont you think that is pretty solid evidence in a deductive sense? Unless you are willing to say those millions of fin users are all screwed   I guess fin can turn people into robots after all", "1 week on fin 1mg pills and at the second day i felt some kind of pain at my testicles. 1 week on fin 1mg pills and at the second day i felt some kind of pain at my testicles. It was like my right testicle was bigger than the other and it made me really uncomfortable all the day, especially when i was laying on the bed.

Should I stop fin NOW because of side effects? Hello everyone, excited to post here for the first time. A semi long read but would mean alot to me if you did. I formatted it as neatly as I could for an easier reading experience.\n\n*Background*:\n\n\\- 23 yr old. Experiencing major diffuse thinning during last 9 months (ever since COVID began). currently NW2.5 ,\n\nSo I had planned on getting bloods done but never got around to it. I finally booked appt after noticing sudden inflammatory acne + diffuse thinning. This caused me great worry and concern so I immediately built the big 3 superstack for hairloss. (+ tret/doxy for skin)\n\n* \\-Fin 0.5mg / 3x per week : 1 week in. will likely discontinue (see below)\n* \\-Min. 5% foam: Just started today\n* \\-Nizoral: Just started 5 days ago.\n\nTo get my lab test requisition, I went to the Dr with my chief complaints. **Note:** I also had symptoms of Low T / mood changes **PRE-Fin**. I did **NOT** have this prior to COVID (when shedding started to accelerate). Quite the opposite actually.\n\nAfter tons of research, this led me to believe that my hair loss could actually caused by a deeper nutritional / hormonal imbalance issue and **not necessarily androgenic alopecia**. At this point, a blood test was a MUST and LONG overdue for me.\n\nAt the end of Dr appt, i was glad to receive a comprehensive requisition. My test will include things like:\n\nTotal TFree TDHTSHBGLHFSHEstrogenDheaVitamin d25Prolactin+ a few more\n\nDue to the busy time of year, my lab test will be **conducted in exactly 1 month from now**\n\n*So that brings us to now:*\n\nI took Fin last week in a rush decision as I had ENOUGH with the diffuse thinning and was really starting to become noticeable. I ignored everything I read bout Fin sides and went in with a clean blank slate &amp; mind. I hoped for the best. I took a total of 3 doses of 0.5mg.\n\n1 week in officially, and oh boy this drug is truly REAL. Like clockwork , I experienced the beginning of the classic sides. The whole week that i was on , I did not masturbate and never had the urge to. Usually by day 5-6 of nofap i would be horny as hell but not anymore. No morning wood. Weak Erections, reduced libido. I could still get hard if i really wanted to (porn/stimulation) however would never reach 100% mast. Also would deflate at a speed which I thought could not be possible. As you can imagine, this is absolutely crushing and devastating to experience especially as a young man.\n\n**Questions**:\n\n1. I am planning on stopping FIN now so I can at least salvage myself UNTIL the lab test. Do you think this is wise? Why or why not?\n2. What should i be looking out for the most in the blood test results? How can I be sure Fin has lesser chance of side effects if I take it again?\n3. I assume the Fin will already be in my system (even though took only 1.5mg) Unfortunately could not get bloods done sooner. How will this affect the result? How significant will it be?\n4. How would the results be different if I CONTINUED to stay on Fin for the next month. Will my dht , fsh or lh be heavily skewed?\n5. Any other advice in the meantime?\n\nThank you in advance.  Quick Note: I mentioned that i was experiencing Low T symptoms starting 9 months **prior** to starting Fin. While this is true, I could clearly feel that the SEXUAL side effects and drops were noticeably more this past week while **ON** Fin. Sexual adverse effects have not been clearly linked to T levels or any other blood level for that matter. \n\nThe way to minimize your chances of adverse effects of finasteride (temporary or possibly permanent) is to stop taking it and never take it again in the future. \n\nMoreover, anecdotally, stopping and then restarting seems to increase the likelihood of a long-term syndrome. It is not too hard to find stories of men who go on, off, on, off, and then the third time they get hit with more adverse effects or greater severity, and they continue to have problems long after stopping. Also known as post-finasteride syndrome. \n\nThere is more information here which draws on experiences of men who have taken finasteride and had long-term adverse effects:\n\n", "Upcoming research at The Institute for Human Genetics has been fully funded PFS Network is very pleased to announce that overnight we have reached our fundraising target for important upcoming research at The Institute for Human Genetics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein.

Thank you all for your incredible support - without you, this would not be possible.\n\nOur next step is to finalise the collection of tissue samples. As we have indicated previously, our team is working with researchers who have previously published findings on Post-Finasteride Syndrome to use existing samples, rather than collecting new ones. As we reached our target so quickly, we are still working through the logistics of this, meaning the study will not begin immediately. We are working as quickly as possible to secure these samples and begin this important study.\n\nWhile the immediate target has been met, this does not mean we can become complacent, and we are calling upon patients and their families to continue supporting PFS Network and our work over the coming months and years. Our research roadmap will require a continuous fundraising effort to ensure that any meaningful insights can be acted upon immediately. It is critical that we do not stop and begin a new fundraising effort for each subsequent study.\n\nTo kick off our ongoing fundraising efforts, our team has personally pledged an additional \u20ac10,000.

And that is how it will always be, but you will definitely get better after a few months.  I have been there, it sucks. But you will get better. You said \u201cthat is how it will always be\u201d was that a typo? Most people with ED and depression recover once they are off fin.

It helps to talk too.\n\nI was on it for a little less than a year, Probabaly 10 months. Noticed increases anxiety about 4 months ago but did not think much of it since it was not bad. It is progressively gotten worse though, and my doctor recommended I stop fin immediately. My anxiety is really bad atm, full fledged panic attacks multiple times per day and insomnia. Damn man I am sorry to hear that. I will send you a DM Dude, I am great.  Back to normal.  Took about 6 months.  \n\nI am thinking of getting off this sub, I have contributed a lot on previous posts.

How have you been lately?", "Experience with Finasteride and Anxiety  I was taking finasteride 1.25mg daily for two years. No obvious side effects. I had no sexual side effects that I was aware of. After two years I started having extreme anxiety, though I was attributing it to real life stress( which I had a lot of in that time). Unfortunately, anxiety was so severe that I started looking up for other causes since real life stuff started to steadily resolve itself. Once I realized anxiety is a recognized side effect of finasteride I stopped taking it and it has taken me months to get back to 80-90% normal. Nothing but time helped, not even meds or therapy. My therapist was puzzled with me, because I had no accompanying anxious thoughts which she found weird. Just pure anxiety, seemingly unrelating to anything.\n\nFast forward, I was doing fine but my hair started thinning again. I was wary to start finasteride again, but I changed my mind about the finasteride being behind my anxiety since anxiety stuck with me for months after the last dose of fin and I had some legitimate issues (work and family) while I was taking it two years ago. I wanted to try microdosing 0.25mg but I only had 5mg tablet so I thought I would go with 1.25 mg 3x week. After just one and half dose my extreme anxiety is back and is already sticking for two weeks. Seems like my anxiety after all was either directly caused or heavily contributed to by finasteride.  \n\n\nDoes anyone have similar stories? Is is likely that the anxiety will resolve itself again? bro i do man i thought i was crazy lol your not alone i was taking it for like a month my hair came back your boy was looking good but i was have panic attacks for literally no reason and never in my life have i had one. i was at a family BBQ and because i want offered food first i could not stand i had to go in the house and sit down. every little thing was giving me anxiety and my hand would literally shake i stopped taking it i had to but unfornatley the hair loss started again.... now i am stuck between waiting that nice full head of hair again and running around like a mad man and having crazy panic attacks or being normal mentally with a head half full of hair \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Update after one month: Anxiety worse than ever.

Hope everything\u2019s going alright for you man. \n\nFor multiple weeks after taking a dose of and then ceasing fin your hormones go pretty crazy going up and down in a state of homeostasis. It is definitely very overwhelming mentally.\n\nSend me a message if you need to talk to someone mate. I had a very similar experience. I started taking finasteride in my 20s as a precautionary measure. My moms brothers were all bald and I did not want the same thing to happen to me. Not sure how long I took it but I eventually stopped because I did not think I needed it. I started again right before my 40th birthday. My business partner and I went to a hair restoration clinic and after seeing the back of my head I called my doctor immediately. That was March of 2019. In august 2019 I competed in a grappling tournament in LA. I flew home to the Midwest and had been taking some thc on the plane. I landed about midnight and drove home. During the drove a take me home by Phil Collins came on and I cried like a baby for several minutes. Nothing like that had ever happened to me and i processed it as something positive. I was able to tap into deep emotions and it felt cathartic. That was the start of a downward spiral. Over the next few months I had a few major memory lapses/confusion episodes at work. In March of 2020 I was supposed to make a board presentation and the stress of that drove me insane. I could not sleep. I would wake up in the middle of the night with massive anxiety that would turn to sobbing. My family took me to the emergency room but I pulled it together when i heard the realities of being admitted. All the time I was taking my finasteride to make sure my hair would not fall out. Finally i started thinking about what changed. Did I hit my head, did turning 40 drop my testosterone? Then I remembered finasteride blocks testosterone. I googled propecia and depression and was shocked. People with my exact symptoms were killing themselves. I stopped immediately. For the better part of the year I have been trying everything: microdosing, accupuncture, meditation, transcranial stimulation, praying. The good news is it is gotten a lot better. I used to be scared of talking on the phone. Now I can be out and about and am back to pretty normal. I would say the biggest difference is I am much more aware and sensitive to what makes me anxious. For the my he best Medicine is\nMovement, exercise or talking to my wife. In another 6 months I will be back to full force. Better than before. That is by goal. Mad anxiety here as well with topical finasteride 0.01%. It will subside after a few days, but after the latest few applications, I get horrible anxiety, mentally slower, insomnia and just generally feel like shit. I am throwing the rest of my prescription out. hang on brother. i actually have an anxiety disorder - exercise is your new best friend. totally stops my panic attacks. Crazy because same here. Never had panic attakcs in my life until proppecia. Shit is poison What does this mean?

Two years after stopping im 95% recovered So I am making this post because I fell into a deep depression when I realized I had PFS after 3 years of use. Reading online made me feel as though I was doomed forever. I could only find posts of people who were not recovered, had horrible sides, and even of some people who committed suicide.  \n\nHere is the problem. Online is biased. You are going to have way more people posting negative experiences than positive ones. The ones who are recovered (like me) often times move on with their lives and do not share any updates. While the ones who are not recovered stay online to talk about their suffering.\n\nThat is why I decided to make this post, to let me people know that recovery is 100% possible. And that there are great doctors out there who can help.\n\nFeel free to ask me anything about how I recovered and what sides I had. Hello, thanks for sharing. a couple of questions:  \n \\* Did you have an initial 'crash', like most of people do?  \n \\* What were your sides (All of them), and which ones bothered you the most  \n \\* How did you know you were recovering, what were the intial signs? and did it happen gradually over those two years, or did you 'find a cure?'  \n \\* What did you do? Supplements, hormones, lifestyle changes, wait it out? , ...  \n\n\nThanks alot What did you do you can message me Did your dick ever get numb to the touch? The top half of mine is currently. Thanks, and congrats What did the doctors give you?  Until I was 25 I never had any sexual disorders, after finasteride I became impotent.  I have not been able to have sex for 7 years, while before finasteride I could have been a porn actor.  - Did you have an initial 'crash', like most of people do?\n\n**I would say yes but I was so obsessed with my hair that I ignored it. Also was not sexually active initially which made me more ignorant to it. Once I started seeing girls I realized there was a serious problem. I just was not feeling any pleasure, my semen was watery, and ED every time.**\n\n- What were your sides (All of them), and which ones bothered you the most\n\n**Sexual anhedonia (numbness), low libido, ED, watery semen. Definitely sexual anhedonia/low libido. This was the worst. To not feel pleasure from sex is a horrible feeling. ED is not as bad because this is a purely mechanical function. Improve blood flow to the penis with PDE5 inhibitors; and boom problem solved. Anhedonia/libido is much more complex and involves nerve function among other factors**\n\n- How did you know you were recovering, what were the intial signs? and did it happen gradually over those two years, or did you 'find a cure?'\n\n**I saw a urologist who is a specialist in male sexual function. I would recommend anyone who is suffering to do this too. The initial signs began with restoration of mechanical function. Cialis helped me get and maintain erections immediately. The libido, anhedonia and watery semen were helped my gabapentin. Incremental improvements happened,  but after 1 year watery semen and anhedonia was gone. Libido was significantly improved. I stopped the gabapentin after 1 year and half post fin and have maintained my function to this day. I am still working on the ED, I am 50-75% there. Some days are better than others, but with cialis I am completely normal. I will add that I have been using fenugreek extract and it is significantly boosted my libido as well. My libido is restored to pre fin levels. I feel like 20 again (minus the ED)**\n\n- What did you do? Supplements, hormones, lifestyle changes, wait it out? , ...\n\n**Supplements/medications include:\nCialis, gabapentin, and fenugreek extract. I have always worked out and stayed healthy so that did not change. I have tried to be more positive and stay off the forums regarding this issue though. It definitely helps psychologically** I made a lengthy comment at the top of thread answering this. But yes I did. Gabapentin to start. See a specialist who can help you First off thanks for the uplifting comment. I have been off fin for just under a week, the most significant side effect I have been able to notice is my brainfog. I was prescribed gabapentin a while back for a different reason (restless leg syndrome) but I never took it more than a dozen times. I have never heard of anyone taking it for any reason other than RLS, could you tell me why your on it and what it is supposed to help with? I am not a doctor or biologist, but according to my doc gabapentin was prescribed to help restore nerve function. He believes the drug caused some kind of nerve damage/dysfunction, which caused these anhedonia/libido effects. He was right on the money because gabapentin helped a lot. That is super good to know. Thank you for your post and response   How long where you on fin?  &amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks alot Wait a sec. You post in other subreddits claiming your erectile dysfunction is due to SSRIs, not finasteride. Well which is it? You seem like you have mental health problems unrelated to finasteride to be honest. Did you take it irregularly, or did you take 1mg every day at the same time?    hmm so it started randomly then\ud83e\udd14 Mental health problems are you and your fucking retarded family ... pssd and pfs are the exact same thing. Except they are literally not? SSRIs are not the same as finasteride at all dude", "Advice from those who have recovered from side effects after stopping finasteride - I took 1mg of finasteride on June 14th &amp; within 40 minutes I felt an impending sense of dread, diminished cognitive ability &amp; anxiety. I threw the rest of the pills out immediately. Now, four months later the above mentioned side effects have gone, but I am left with the most notorious one.. ED.\n\nI want to ask those of you who have recovered.. is this permanent? How long can I expect to deal with this issue for? Hard question to answer.\n\nThere is no consensus on the matter really. Some people recover some do not, but it is very few that goes back to 100%.\n\nI can get a decent boner, but it is not pre fin firm or thick without some kind of aid.\n\nIf ED is your only problem you should be glad though. You can always use viagra or injections.\n\nMany of us are left with no libido and no sensation in the penis. So even if we get an erection with injections, there is no pleasure to it... I really do not know how people get side effects from the first pill, i did get some side effects but after 4 months of using it such as low libido and some brain fog and cognitive impairment from now and then but nothing that sever. You may not know, but many many people have reported it after the first day.  That means that there are some PFS cases who need an injection to get an erection to penetrate in a sexual intercourse and with lower libido and penile numbness they feel nothing.  Yes.  Yeah.", "Sometimes it is like I understand It is like I understand women on another level, which to me is not, desirable. I never asked for this.

Opposites attract, but the tension, contrast emotionally is a lot less prevalent if not, absent.\n\nTo the point of me thinking, how would I ever go back to that point of saying to my friends: \u201cWomen, you will never understand them.\u201d, \u201cWomen are a different kind of being. We will never understand them, and it is probably better that way.\u201d \n\nIf that is not possible, to say that once more, how would you ever conceive restoration is this particular aspect to be possible.

I do a 24 hour fast every week, and it keeps me even keeled. I think I recall hearing Peter Attia doing 3 days per month. Of course you do not want to develop an eating disorder or anything, but most people vastly underestimate how long they can go without eating.

Awesome bro Good news. I am still fucked. What supplements worked? How long have you been fucked? Too long. Hard as well. Can\u2018t see straight.", "Test boosters and fin question So background I am 23 my hairline was receding took my first fin pill this morning. I have read about the sexual side effects and as someone who is active sexually and enjoys sex I want to avoid them could taking an otc test booster help this? Do not do this. Taking exogenous T shuts off your body's endogenous T production, which will further fuck you with sexual side effects if you ever decide to come off it, perhaps permanently. Plus, your T rises anyway when you take fin, as it creates a bottleneck for converting T to DHT. It is not the lack of T that gives you side effects, it is the lack of DHT which is a much more potent androgen. \n\nWhen you are messing with hormones, you have got to be careful. No, there is no known way to \"avoid\" the adverse effects of Fin. \n\nT cannot do what DHT do. DHT is 2-10x as potent as T. \n\nBut I hope you at least got a high quality blood test done before starting? It might be useful if you develop any sides. I am not sure if you used finasteride but today was my first day taking it I got a 90 day supply I was just wondering what side effects if any did you notice right away? I also take adderall 25mg xr in the morning and 15mg in the afternoon for my ADHD/ADD Yup, took it for 5 months and got massive sexual sides (libido and boners gone etc), so stopped taking them. It is been 4-5 months since stopping and the side effects still have not gone away. My advice is if you start to get side effects that you would not want to have be permanent for the rest of your life (even after stopping), then stop taking it. I was planning on taking it for the 90 days then stopping and just using rogaine I actually did get blood work done and my doctor or said I am in great health and every thing looks normal I just have been reading a lot about the negatives so just wanted some other opinions Not worth taking it for 90 days really, it is an all-or-nothing long-term thing. Might as well start using rogaine straight away and skip the side effects. You either take it for life (or until you do not care about hair) or do not take it at all.\n\nThere is no reason to risk getting adverse effects if you are only going to take it for 90 days.\n\nOnly if you care more about you hair than about your penis then fin for life is ok... I have been using rogaine for over a year and have noticed some difference but thought fin would be the last little boost my scalp needed I thought the risk associated with ed and stuff was very small that is what my doctor said at least do you know of any natural alternatives that produce the same results? It will only keep your hair/grow more for as long as you take it, and you will lose that extra hair grown as soon as you stop. I would either take it long term or save the money and risk of side effects tbh. Do not take finasteride, period. You do not need dick problems in your 20\u2019s. Enjoy life, enjoy your youth. I took it late in life at 60, did it for 14 months and destroyed myself. I thought my life was over until I found a solution prescribed by my urologist-which you should not have to do at your age. I feel very bad for all these young guys with old man problems. Having sex and enjoying your life is much more important than hair. Balding is one thing, but ED is another. I will take thinning hair over a dead dick anytime. I cannot stress this enough: finasteride is fucking poison. Stay away from it. PS: Do not waste your money on test boosters. Take care of your body, hydrate, get rest, add some vitamin D, eat healthy, exercise. Alcohol in moderation. What did your urologist prescribe? Cialis? He did a Doppler first, injected the penis with Caverject to make it erect. Looked for veinous leaks or abnormalities-none found. I know it was from the fin, 100%. Finally he prescribed Trimix, a stronger injection, and it works beautifully. It would suck for a young man your age to do that, but seeing a urologist made a big difference, one that actually acknowledged PFS. I also injected a peptide known as PT-141 (google it). I am not suggesting anything other than seeing a professional. Otherwise if your plumbing is working fine do not fuck it up with fin. Repeat, do not take it. Enjoy what you have. Too late - I have been in the PFS hole for 10 years, unfortunately. I am just looking for new things to try. \n\nErections are not my problem though - it is blunted emotions, absent motivation and libido that affects my life the most. \n\nPeptides are interesting - a doctor recommended BPC-157, so I might try that.\n\nAnd yes, I would recommend everyone to stay the fuck away from finasteride. Not worth it. Thanks for speaking out and warning people. I am just starting another peptide called Sermorelin. It addresses the issues you mentioned.  My wife is taking it as well. I found a specialty/wellness MD, one that advertises anti-aging. Natural supplements are a total waste of money, but peptides are totally worth investigating. I have tried human growth hormone before, which sermorelin helps release. It did not do anything for my finasteride problems, but it might still help others. Thank you for the tip, though! How long did you take it? My thought on Sermorelin is it could potentially improve or repair the neural pathways fin destroyed. Also fin alters the neurosteroids in the brain. I am also considering pregnenolone, the \u201cmother hormone\u201d as it can act as an adaptogen and can potentially transform itself into whatever hormone you need. There is no study on this as related to PFS. I am willing to stick with it for 6 months to see if there is any improvement. I have also been on TRT for 10 years and everything worked fine pre-fin.  I hoped that would help restore sexual and mental functions but sadly it has not. That is why I think any natural supplement outside of vitamin D is a waste of money. Might want to look into Cerebrolysin, not much info on it regarding PFS tho. Hi man, i hope you are doing better,i hope your condition will improve everyday.. sorry if my english is bad, english is not my language.\n\nThis is me, someone who has chatted you 1 month ago ( as i remember). I ask you about my PFS and my insomnia. And i just want to say that your advice at that time was very valuable. i was really afraid at that time. At that time, i thought that my PFS was  permanent,so that really scared me out,i was really panic at that time.  But after saw your reply, you are really make me calm. Your advices give me hope , i cried at that time because you are the only one that care about my PFS,you are the one who give me advice .I will make you my best friend if i meet you in real life i promise.\n\nAt that time, You said to me \"dont panic, because it will make your condition worse. Eat healthy, exercise, avoid stress,youre going to be better in few months\" guess what?  that shit is really make my condition improve. My insomnia is getting better slowly right now and my panic attack slowly controllable now.. I just want to say, thank you so much.youre the best human being in reddit. Im pray for your health, i wish the best for you. Fuck Finasteride That makes me so happy to hear! I just said what I wish someone had said to me when I first got sick. Glad that you are feeling better! Looks interesting. Perhaps it could address or repair the lost brain-penis connection brought on by PFS. I was on HGH for a month. Did not see any change. Testosterone and hCG gave me shortness of breath/chest tightness. Felt a little better with progesterone for a week, but then got worse. Pregnenolone might be worth trying as a more \"upstream\" hormone.\n\nOne technique that seems to work with some people is to take very low doses for longer periods, in order to gradually change the body's \"tolerance\" for some of these hormones.\n\nGood luck to you! It seems like you are over the worst. Are you still trying to fix some lingering finasteride issues?", "Thoughts?

Within 40 minutes I felt many negative effects &amp; immediately threw out the rest of the pills. Now it is 4 months later and most side effects have gone except for ED. It seems to be slowly improving, although I am not sure. I am very worried I have done permanent damage &amp; that this will be permanent. \n\nHas anyone out there been through something similar &amp; recovered completely? I need some good news. It is hard to say for sure. But I will say this. I have PFS and I wish the only persistent side effect I had was ED. \n\nLook into getting trimix  Yes I have PFS, I pray that I wake up once and all was in my head I have PFS, I pray that I wake up once and all was in my head How long were you on it? Dear stringer bell I am only 6 months in.

I take topical now. Ok the chance getting PFS is very very rare.... I know the signs.. Basically your dick will feel like your earlobe.   I think exsexgod stated he is been on 6 months (see above)  I am referring to exsexgods situation but I am in the same boat. 3 days ago I took a single 1mg pill of Fin and got a whole bunch of side effects that day, which includes limp dick, no libido, Penis sensations, head fogginess, etc. still hard to ejaculate and cannot get full boner . I I only took one pill and through the rest out after noticing sides How could you possibly of noticed side effects 40 minutes after taking this pill? Did you have a raging Boner from your girlfriend before you took the pills and then you try to have sex 40 minutes later and you could not?  It was not necessary 40 min after the pill but on the first day it was numb , could not feel a thing down there. I jacked off twice and it was a half ass erection with reduced sperm. I have been told it takes a few days-weeks-maybe months to recover. I feel sensations in my penis today which might be good  but who knows, I not a dr unfortunately You should be able to get back to base level no problem. Assuming you did your hormone test before hopping on hormone manipulation drugs. Well I got it for hair loss since I am 25 and my hairline was getting gnarly so I just went on HIMs and got the prescription.. I am confident I will be fine though, fingers crossed I took the fucking poison for two months from Feb 21 to April 21 and crashed in early April after quitting. I took the fucking poison for two months. I am 59 yo and I took it against benign prostatic hyperplasia. I am noticing a trend and Finasteride side effects when prescribes thru HIMS. Suspect af. Brutal dude. You should go back to base level. Did you get it thru HIMS cause I am noticing a correlation between getting it from a doctor and getting it thru this suspect website. Doubt that makes a difference. There are plenty of us who got it the traditional route and still ended up with PFS. In many cases hormone levels are within normal range. What is the evidence that lab tests before taking finasteride can predict adverse effects? Here are some reports of the onset of persistent symptoms soon after taking one dose or a few doses:\n\n(   This is a claim but it is not evidence. What evidence supports this statement?  &gt; tons of people\n\nWhich people?\n\nWhich videos have evidence that supports what you are claiming?  What is the evidence that knowing your base levels does harm? It is no harm, but it is no guarantee you will not get PFS either.\n\nI see you are very ignorant and an avid MPMD / Tressless fan.\n\n5AR is not only responsible for T &gt; DHT but like 6 different enzymatic processes. It is not clear that PFS it solely due to decrease in DHT, but the issue could lay in any of those pathways (or a mix of them which makes the prefect storm).\n\nThen I think you should read up on 5AR type 3 and what happens to it when you introduce finasteride.\n\nThen we have the persistent changes in nuclear receptors that have been reported both in rat studies and human studies. This includes overexpressed AR and ERa in the brain (rat) and overexpressed AR in the penis (human). \n\nNow we have a **very** complex issue at our hand. As receptor expression is next to impossible to diagnose, and even if we did there is no data on how to fix it.\n\nThinking you will be fine as long as you get your bloodwork done is not only false, but ignorant as fuck. You also need to understand that Derek have a commercial interest in spreading that information. His knowledge about PFS is **very** low, and why would not it be? After all he is using the drug and apparently do not have sides.\n\nBut of course it is not bad having more data (bloodwork). But it is not a guarantee at all like you make it sound like. Would not the fact that you see my presence in the treads dictate you also troll the area to all hell? \n\nWhy such a long post when all I asked is why would not you get your base levels before fucking with hormone drugs?\n\nOh wait I forgot this is Reddit and \u201cknow it all\u2019s\u201d run rampant with insults. \nYou have outed yourself as a unhelpful smart ass\ud83d\udc4d \n&gt;Would not the fact that you see my presence in the treads dictate you also troll the area to all hell? \n\nI do not even know what this means, literally makes 0 sense.\n\n\n&gt;Why such a long post when all I asked is why would not you get your base levels before fucking with hormone drugs?\n\nBecause your post is ignorant and has 0 science behind it.\n\n\n&gt;Oh wait I forgot this is Reddit and \u201cknow it all\u2019s\u201d run rampant with insults. \nYou have outed yourself as a unhelpful smart ass\ud83d\udc4d\n\nSounds like you are describing yourself to be honest.

Also forgot to mention if anyone has anecdotes about Cialis/ Viagra let me know. My main issue is worrying about not getting it up or staying hard when I am with someone so if anyone knows how well those kinds of drugs work with finasteride sides I would love to hear about it. Sounds like you are improving, it can be a slow process. \n\nWould recommend getting bloods done. I supplemented magnesium and it really helped with sleep. Light exercise both before  you go to bed, and in the morning also helps regulate sleep as well. Recovery is not linear. Two steps forward, one step back. The overall progress will be up. Marathon not a sprint. Do you best to stay positive, keep an optimistic mindset, you will be OK, you will recover :) Use of cialis / viagra is a good idea &amp; is safe in my opinion. I have not seen anyone make themselves worse with their use Thank you needed to hear this! Past couple days have been rough again so I really appreciate it. Best of luck on your recovery as well! Ok good to know I am headed in the right direction at least.\n\nThanks for the tip I appreciate it. I will definitely buy some magnesium if it does not start improving here shortly. Thanks for letting me know. I will get in touch with a doctor and see if I can work something out. Appreciate the help ( and as of right now, I feel almost 100% mentally. \n\nTry not to get too discouraged if you see improvement, and then setbacks. It has been really hard for me at times but it makes it feel that much better when you see a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nHave a good day and I wish you a quick and smooth recovery! Thanks a bunch man appreciate the honesty. I am trying to keep my head up and it is good to know setbacks are a natural part of recovery. Glad to hear you are feeling better, best of luck on your recovery as well!", "Needing reassurance Some background: \nAround the very end of august and start of September I applied some topical Finasteride solution a handful of times. I never used a full 1ml (1mg equivalent I think) but microdosed it concious of side effects. Although this seems strange, almost immediately my dick kind of felt weird and I felt dizzy, took longer to get an erection. I did not think much of it as everyone says the first few times you use feels weird etc. \n\nI have struggled in the past with porn induced erectile dysfunction and low libido however this felt different. My dick had never gone floppy and lifeless like that before so after only a handful of times I stopped. \n\nI had just come out of a breakup and a few of my friends kept saying they used Finasteride with good things to say and foolishly one night, when very down about my hair, I took a quarter a pill for some reason thinking it would be less bad. This was around the 13th/14th of September a few days after I last used topical fin. Again the next day I felt off and decided that instead of taking more pills every other day I would take no more and leave Finasteride for good. \n\nIt is now the 1st of December and I still have some sides. Mentally I feel better but sexually not. \n\nSide effects include lower libido, no erections unless I masturbate and work up to. Once hare and masturbating I do feel horny and do enjoy orgasming, maybe not as much as before. I do get morning woods however they are almost always only a semi. The most concerning is the penis itself. It just looks weird, more veiny, discoloured, often looks shrivelled and bumpy as if it is a fruit with juice sucked out of it (this happens especially after masturbation). It also just feels soft and light, it is droops around and feels weak. My penis used to look nice, not especially big but a nice shape. Now the shaft is considerably thinner than the head and feels like string. My erection length is similar I believe (maybe slightly smaller) but the shaft is less girth. \n\nIm going to do a nofap over the next month and have bought a bathmate to hopefully help with girth and erectile quality. In the meantime I am posting to just say is there any hope for me, at this point suicidal thoughts often happen and I struggle to have hope", "Finasteride finasteride\n\nIve been taking finasteride for about 4 months and all of the sudden I have had pressure in my ears every-time i swallow i hear crackling is this a normal side effect i do not want to stop taking it because progress is going good but  if its going to affect my hearing i should stop, any  advice. Everyone here will say stop taking it cause we all had bad experiences. Talk to your doc My advice: stop taking finasteride. \n\nTinnitus has been reported as a symptom that continue after stopping finasteride. \n\nYou can read more here: ", "Day 1 (1mg): instant clumsiness, motor ticks, brain fog and slow thinking I used topical finasteride with ketoconazole (1% cream). First I applied the ketoconazole and there were no side-effects, nothing I could feel. Then I added 1mg topical finasteride and instantly I became clumsy, I could not walk right, and weird motor ticks, like my arm would move by itself in a spastic motion. \n\nIs this normal? No of course it is not normal. You are actively rubbing yourself with a poison. Those are all potential side effects of Finasteride but for it to happen instantly is strange. \n\nDid you read about Finasteride side effects (particularly the ones you listed) before applying the topical solution? Of course, but I did not find anything about clumsiness.\nI have elevated glutmate levels (GAD enzyme defect, normal mutation) and my theory is that finasteride lowers gabaergic neurosteroids that are neuroprotective, which causes the clumsiness.

He recognizes PFS and has consulted and tested a couple of us.

Marek Health. ? Name of a clinic", "My (negative) Finasteride Experience and Recovery Hi all,\n\nI am a 21 year old male with androgenetic alopecia who tried finasteride in October for the first time and wanted to detail my honest experience with the drug. I am not here to convince anyone of any opinion, I just want to put my full (negative) experience out there to hopefully further people's knowledge of what is possible with the drug. I took detailed notes on how I was feeling each day to track if I was recovering or not so I wanted to post  a summary of my recovery to show people how the drug effected me and perhaps to help anyway else worrying about their symptoms and the recovery process.\n\n**The TLDR is:** I took a single 1.25mg dose of finasteride and had an extremely bad reaction but have now fully recovered as far as I can tell besides still having very slight swelling in one breast still.\n\nDay 1: On October 25th I took finasteride for the first and only time in my life and had a very negative reaction. I took one quarter of a 5mg pill so about a 1.25mg dose. Within about 20 minutes I could tell that I was having a very bad reaction to the drug. Over the next few hours I had to pee constantly. The pee was flowing out endlessly it seemed but there was very little feeling in my penis when peeing. I noticed my penis looked much smaller than normal and had shrunk to an almost prepubescent size. I had complete impotence with no ability at all to obtain an erection. This was a physical change and I am 100% sure it was not just a mental state. I had lost almost complete sensation in my penis. It just did not feel like my penis anymore at all. At this point I obviously decided I would not try finasteride ever again. I took a sleeping pill about 4 hours later to help me get an early night's rest as I was hoping a night's rest would help me.\n\nDay 2: This was the worst day of my side effects. I believe it was my experience of \"the crash\" which people talk about. I developed the worst depression of my life hands down. It was absolutely crippling. Throughout the entire day I ate only a piece of fruit as I had no energy to leave my room and had no appetite either. I had constant suicidal thoughts throughout the day. I even ordered more sleeping pills from the doctor with the thought that if this continued I may have to kill myself soon and that the sleeping pills would help. I just could not shake the thought of suicide from my mind. I thought that I would had depression before in my life but this was something different. It was like I was still there somewhere in my mind but completely helpless to fatigue and sadness. My penis continued to look shrunken with no sensation when touching it, it was like touching rope - it just did not feel like it was a part of my body. \n\nDay 3: Friday was a complete blessing of a day. The brain fog and depression improved very significantly. I was able to function again as a human. Had the brain fog and depression from Thursday continued I knew there was no chance I would be able to work a job or continue with college. It would have meant my life was over at age 21 as there is no way I would have been able to continue living the way I felt on day 2.\n\nDay 4: By day 4 the brain fog and depression had cleared but my penis was still shrunken and this was the first day I began to feel breast pain. I looked in the mirror and could see swelling of my breasts. This freaked me out even more as I knew the sexual side effects would take a while to clear but gynecomastia could take months or even never go away on its own.\n\nDay 5: I achieved a very very minor sort of erection on day 5. I was able to get my penis to grow but there was no strength whatsoever to the erection. Still it seemed that my penis had recovered to normal length when flaccid and no longer looked like a prepubescent penis so this was a good sign. The breast pain was most sore this day however.\n\nDay 6: On day 6 the breast pain had noticeably reduced but there was still some painful sensation. On this day I was able to get two more soft erections where my penis would grow slightly but would just hang in a flaccid state because there was no strength holding it up whatsoever.\n\nDay 7: On day 7 there was still some breast pain and my breasts were still noticeably swollen to me so I contacted the doctor and made an appointment. They asked me if it was an emergency and I said \"yes somewhat\". They had a doctor phone me later in the day (because of COVID initial appointments are over the phone and then the doctor decides if you need to come in to physically meet them). I was completely honest with my experience with the doctor. This was not the doctor who I got the prescription from, I got the prescription from a web doctor. The doctor was very surprised I could have gotten such bad side effects so quickly from only a single pill. The doctor made an appointment for me to see her the following week and told me to cancel it if my symptoms improved on their own.\n\nDay 8: In the very early morning of Wednesday (maybe 3am or so), I woke up with a very strong erection that would not go away. This erection lasted for perhaps 20 minutes and was normal length and normal strength. I was of course incredibly relieved. I did not attempt to masturbate or ejaculate, I decided to just leave everything alone down there for the time being.\n\nDay 9: On Thursday my breast pain was pretty much gone and in the mirror I could see that the swelling had reduced a bit. I tried to get an erection during the day but could not. That night I started to have some ball ache. I saw this as a good sign as this is normally one of the moderate side effects of finasteride so I thought maybe my DHT levels had improved a bit.\n\nDay 10: During the early hours of Friday morning I woke up during a wet dream with semen in my underwear. From here I knew that I was on the path to recovering as I was not permanently impotent.\n\nThese ten days describe most of my recovery process from being unable to get an erection to ejaculating for the first time since taking finasteride. From there on my libido started to gradually improve and I was able to get erections as before. I would say it took me about 4 or 5 weeks to feel pretty much fully recovered. Today I feel great and do not notice any permanent side effects except I still have one breast that is very slightly larger than the other but it would not be noticeable to someone unless pointed out or they knew to look for it.\n\nI hope my story might give hope to people who have recently taken finasteride and are currently experiencing side effects. To the people who have had an incredible experience with finasteride this is not a post to scare people away from it, I just want to tell what happened to me so that people know the risks involved and the possible recovery time frame. At the end of the day everyone has to make up their own mind about this drug. \nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

Thanks for sharing info with the hair community.\n\nI decided to go on 1mg finasteride after a while of thinning along the hairline. \n\nI was hoping you would be able to give me advice on this matter. \n\nI have only been taking finasteride for two weeks, and I have been experiencing problems in my private area. I have overall shrinkage when erect or flaccid. \n\nBased on your research, have you ever heard of or read about a case like this? \n\nI am going to see a urologist, but most doctors usually are not very helpful. I was told to see if .5mg resolves the issue, but I am not sure how long I should keep trying until I give up on the drug.\n\nDo you think it will go back to normal on its own? If you were me, would you stop taking finasteride?\n\nI would highly appreciate your input If it made your penis shrink, yes I would definitely recommend stopping finasteride.  \n\nSome other posts may have mentioned shrinkage, I really have not heard of that myself.  People usually end up with ED for a period of time.  And the mental health issues such as brain fog.  Sides are not worth it for a full head of hair. I would stop. Shrinkage has been reported, and much more. You can learn more here: \nand the \u2018For patients\u2019 page. Finasteride blocks the production of DHT, which helps maintain penile tissue. Reducing the dose will not help - fin is effective even at extremely low doses.\n\nThe urologist might give you Viagra or Cialis, but that is just a band-aid fix. The problem is that you are taking finasteride.\n\nHopefully the issue will resolve if you stop. It does for most people, although it could take a few months. If you are one of the unlucky few whose issue do not resolve \u2013 I am really sorry.\n\nAs mentioned by others, you are risking other more serious side effects if you continue also. My penis shrunk a couple of weeks after stopping finasteride ... all of a sudden it is as if everything has atrophied, whether flaccid or erect.  The thickness is very very small and despite years have passed it has never returned to normal size. By erect do you mean erect length?", "Got side effects after 12 pills how do i recover ? \u0130 quir about a week ago after sexual.side effects like ed ans numb penis kicked into overdrive and got better first 4 days but now.im back to where i was and im noticing high beard shedding where i can find 3+4 haird everytime i run my hand through my beard im thinking its because of low dht. Will i recover naturally or am i screwed ? There's no way to answer that question. There best thing you can do right now is to try stay calm (very difficult, I know) and take care of yourself - good nutrition, exercise, and sleep. \n\nAnecdotally, it seems like lots of people recover within a few months. Yesss, this. It does take months oftentimes. I had really bad facial bloating due to what I assume is hormonal imbalances from finasteride, and I thought it'd never go away. I was freaking out. The first two months I noticed no difference. Ever since then, its been improving significantly. Right now I'm about 3.5 months out, and its like 75-80% better. Very grateful for that. It will get better, but it will take time. So don't panic or get anxious or freak out OP, you will be okay I promise. Of course you have low DHT.  You were taking a potent 5ar inhibitor that BLOCKS DHT.  That's how fin works.\n\nNo, you' are not screwed, but you most likely wont' \"naturally\" recover without some work on your end. That is due to high Estrogen.  A fin side effect the fact that you had a period of recovery followed by a regression isn't a great sign. \u0130m glad to say that 2 days after posting that i am back to normal and maybe not everyone responds to that the same Thankfully im back to normal now hope i dont experience a crash Consider yourself thankful. No no, not everyone responds the same to 5AR inhibition be glad that you responded the way you did Well just after i said that i noticed the symptoms came back for a few days then somewhat went away but right now my libidos normal the only problek is my penis being shrunk when soft i hope it gets better You may get lucky.

I have it tomorrow. Is it safe for someone in my condition? Although people have speculated about a possible auto-immune link in PFS, the scientists looking into are mostly focused on hormones, neurosteroids, and hormone receptors. So there should not be any interaction between the vaccine and your condition, if it is hormonal, like PFS.\n\nYou might feel sick for a day or two though. I got really sick from both my doses, but I did not have any long term problems. I personally did not. No side effects, but YMMV.", "I cannot believe this is happening to me Hello everyone,\n\nI was just a dumb and desperate balding 24 year old when it all started. For the first month I got propecia, after that I switched to proscar and used to cut them in 4 pieces. Although I felt some side effects immediately after swallowing the first pill I did not stop. Went with proscar about 3 months and I quit. \n\nShort before quitting I was getting way better, my penis was rocking hard, I felt a sex drive again. It lasted for about 4 months and as I saw my hair falling off I made the worst decision in my life and hoped again on proscar. I only used it for about 3 months and quit for good.\n\nOnly that this time is far worse than ever, although 6 months have passed since I had my last pill, my penis is completely ruined. My erections are really soft, I cannot feel any desire in it anymore, cannot get horny, cannot get it rock hard.\n\nI went to an urologist and took a testosterone test. The results point that there is nothing wrong with me.\n\nIs there anyone that has experienced similar issues? Hello, you are far from alone in your circumstances despite lack of adequate recognition from the scientific community. I would recommend checking out the propeciahelp website and forums for further support and a more active forum than this subreddit. I am so sorry you are experiencing what many men have also gone through. I promise you are not alone. \n\nI recommend reporting your symptoms to the FDA. There is a link on the Wiki. \n\nAs far as coping goes, getting a therapist or professional to talk to could go a long ways. I use exercise and meditation to keep healthy and busy. \n\nAs another user pointed, PropeciaHelp is an awesome resource and a huge community. \n\nDo not let people tell you this is in your head. Evidence of the condition exists, and Reuter\u2019s important work definitely put Merck\u2019s shadiness in the spotlight.

I too am experiencing sides from a one month 1mg per day protocol.. total loss of sexual desire (gf is pissed) and when I take testosterone I do not even feel it like I used to. &gt;Do not let people tell you this is in your head. Evidence of the condition exists, and Reuter\u2019s important work definitely put Merck\u2019s shadiness in the spotlight.\n\nThe amount of Merck shills in /r/tressless that still pretend it does not exist, ( is disgusting. My test has been around 700\u2013800 every time I check it with free T in the middle of the range. There has been a lot of talk about blood levels among people with PFS and as far as I know, no consistent abnormalities in hormones or other blood levels.\n\nThis is why doctors may not think PFS is a physiological condition: because the measures they are used to looking at are not producing any warning signals.", "Any long term (1yr +) reports from short term users? Used Finasteride 1mg for 20 days back in March this year, so 8 months ago. Still suffering a huge decrease in libido. \nUp until a year ago I used to have a hard time not masturbating for 2-3 days and used to have morning wood almost every single day with random erections during the day. \nSince using and stopping finasteride I will only have sexual desire after about 7-10 days. I will only get erections from physical stimulation. No morning wood at all and less sensitive penis.\nApart from the loss of libido/erections nothing in my life really changed. No increase in stress/depression whatsoever. I do notice a substantial decrease in ambition and general drive.\nI wonder if there are any reports from people who experienced 8-12 months of side effects from short term use, and especially whether these symptoms fade after 1.5 - 2 years. \nHaving a little hope makes it so much more bearable. Information about the syndrome, based on patient experiences and research, has been compiled here:\n Thank you. Know the website. I am curious whether there are any people who still notice any progress 1 year after stopping short term finasteride use. \nOf course most sources say no progress after 6 months but still curious whether there are people with different experiences. Ya hard to say. People talk about incremental improvements and even recoveries. But it is hard to know what it means when someone says \u201cI am 80% recovered.\u201d My own impression is that people want to feel like they are improving so they may inflate these percentages. \n\nI am not sure it matters whether use was short term or long term. Different people have different degrees of disruption/toxicity. Could depend more on their own biological susceptibility and dose pattern rather than length of time on the drug. But we do not know. Recovery trajectories are all over the place for those who did not recover in the usual 1-3 mo timeframe.\n\nSome get better, some get worse, some get better suddenly, some slowly. But the pattern seems to be tilted towards some improvement over time, although this could also be attributed to better coping strategies. Took fin for 6 days. Stopped, but ED + low libido for 5 months now. Fingers crossed. Exactly the same. Took it at 0.5mg and a week post fin..\n\nWhat was your experience with ed and low libido? Were you able to get erect, have sex? Any improvement in 5 months? I forgot to mention that I started with Saw Palmetto 1 month prior to finasteride. I had no side effects while on Saw Palmetto, but go them as soon as I started on finasteride (I had extreme libido while on Saw Palmetto tho).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first week with side effects: 0-5% libido, unable to get erection at all. I did not try to have sex, but pretty sure that I would not be able to do so anyways. My penis was completely dead (I used to have morning wood everyday). After 1 week I got tiny bit better. Libido was maybe 30%, but I could still not maintain erection even with porn. I felt disconnected from my penis most of the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 1 month I could get maybe 70% of full erection while trying to masturbate, but I was pushing myself. My libido was maybe 30-50%. I felt that I was getting better, but it was up and down. I also had 1 week with ball ache, but it faded away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever. I have good news. I woke up with morning wood yesterday and today. I feel like my libido has improved too, maybe 80%. I can maintain erection even without watching naked girls. I feel like my penis is connected to my brain again.  I have really good feeling that I will recover fully soon. It takes time and we have to be patient.\n\nI did nothing special for my recovery. Just normal vitamins as supplements. I hope you will recover soon too brother. Just stay calm and do not think of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(btw I took blood test yesterday and still waiting for the results). Brilliant news.. i hope the recovery continues on an upward trajectory.. so to speak.\n\nI am about 10 days post fin (5 tablets total) and have managed a fair bit of sex (albeit quick sessions rather than marathons) and have been getting night time erections.. still a disconnect between the brain and the mini brain down there but i have hope that it will improve with time and i am not as stressed as i was before about the whole thing.", "Recovery from Symptoms? I took finasteride for 12 years, have been off for 11 months now. I go through waves of ED, and my libido is drastically less.. A couple days  I am almost back to normal and then several more weeks back to no sex drive and ED.\n\nMy penis used to be 7 inches and thick when erect. Now it is only around 6 inches and does not seem to get fully hard(when I can). It also seems smaller when flaccid.\n\nAnyone go through this and recover? Looking for some light at the end of the tunnel. I have also been off finasteride for 11 months, and I think I have started to get better in the last month. Like you said, there are ups and downs, but the proportion of time where I feel normal, and the degree to which I feel normal, is increasing. Working out a couple of hours each week may have helped, but I do not really know (and many people do not respond to exercise at all). I have mentioned a few times on the forum that I have recovered from this using CDNuts protocol back in 2017-2019. I strongly believe that the right lifestyle fosters an environment of healthy hormone production and that the right supplements can lead your body to favoring raising the  (now lowered ) baseline of 5AR and it is metabolites as I was part of a community where people got better.\n\nI think that many people of make the mistake of going the urology route and treat the symptoms of ED specifically when there is a much broader issue. I hate to say it because I hate anti-intellectual and anti-science bullshit but I have yet to hear of a doctor making anyone better because they are just not versed in how to manipulate the endocrine system or foster hormonal production. I have seen people have varying levels of success through going private with an endocrinologist who is willing to go the trial and error route but even then it is hit or miss from what I have seen - granted I do not spend a whole lot of time in the community any more so there may be new developments. But either way, I strongly believe that general health and fitness plays a big role and that certain supplements are very, very important. Not one thing I have found is a silver bullet. But when I put it all together for a sustained period of time I got better, slowly but surely, and in waves - but I got better. I was on finasteride for close to 10 years and about six months ago I started to experience severe ED.  Could not get fully hard, serious penis shrinkage, etc.  I got off cold turkey and the ED issues resolved themselves within a month or less.  I agree with one of the other commenters.  Do not go the urologist route.  Drugs do not always help and can actually mess you up.  Healthy living is the way to go.  I have always kept myself in tremendous physical condition (former college athlete) and I think that is why I was able to recover so quickly once I got off.  Eat clean, workout consistently and make sure to get enough sleep.  Vitamin supplementation is also very important.  It will get better.  Do not give up. Thanks man that is great to hear. Can you recommend what vitamins you take?\n\nAlso - did the penis shrinkage reverse? Thanks for this. Can you link me to CDnuts protocol? Yeah of course, he made a website about it (it is a bit cringe) where all the info was. I did not follow it all but I did a juice fast, followed most of the diet, did the herb rotation, took some/most of the supplements at for varying amounts of time, did two courses of androsterone based pro hormones, and I did the meditation, cold showers and Wim Hof breath work. Plus I have always been big into fitness. As I said, none of it is a magic bullet I do not think and I think some of it is probably a bit woo (skin brushing, no shampoo, etc) , but doing the protocol kept me motivated in thinking that I was helping myself and unlike many with PFS I did get better and I feel as good and healthy as ever at 34.\n\nThis is the website: (\n\nI just want to leave a disclaimer saying that I have never bought any supplements from anywhere that CDnuts recommends and I always sourced them myself either, usually on amazon or ebay.\n\nAlso if you want to find a bit more about me you can see me post through my time on the protocol and recovery on the swolesource pfs forum. My username is the same as it was there. Thanks man - appreciate the direction, gives me hope. No problem man, feel free to pm me if you need. I know how shit this all is when you are going through it. Sorry for the delayed response.  Work has been nuts!\n\nI take a lot of vitamin supplements.  Here are the key ones that I would recommend:\n\nGood multivitamin (nothing synthetic - whole food), Vitamin C, Omega 3, Vitamin D and Zinc.  I also take Biotin and Saw Palmetto for hair loss.  Not sure if you have seen the YouTube channel - More Plates More Dates, but it is a treasure trove of information regarding hair loss.  I learned about the efficacy of microneedling as a hair loss preventative measure and ended up purchasing the Derminator 2 which is a medical grade microneedling machine.  I have been using it for about a month so far.  Results are supposed to be visible in three months.  I figured I needed to be proactive once I stopped Finasteride.  I have seen a little bit of additional hair loss since I stopped, but nothing major (thankfully).  Hope to see some positive results from the microneedling.\n\nYes.  Penis shrinkage completely reversed.  Back to normal in all areas - size, erection frequency and hardness.\n\nGlad to discuss more about diet and working if you are interested.  Two very key components in overall general health which can greatly help ED issues. If you are already having upswings without even doing the protocol, you are probably going to fully recover pretty fast if you do the protocol very strictly. (By very fast I mean possibly 6 months, maybe even less.)", "Baylor study: Differential Gene Expression in Post-Finasteride Syndrome Patients  Free access to the article may be requested through Elsevier\u2019s patient access program.

Nobody knows.\n\nEvery time you put your body under \"stress\" it will change it is gene expression to cope with it.\n\nLike when working out you put your body under stress, then the body will try to adapt to that and the next time you workout your body will be better at it. \n\nIf the body cannot adapt fast enough to whatever stress you put it through, you get issues, like getting burned out if you do not rest between workouts. \n\nBut this PFS is to novel, and not the kind of stress the body knows how to handle.

Could it be due to norepinephrine &amp; epinephrine ?\n\nI have read in an article that finasteride inhibits PNMT, an enzyme that converts norepinephrine into epinephrine.\n\nSince there is overexpression in the androgen receptor due to lack of DHT, could it be an overexpression in the Beta receptor due to a lack of epinephrine during the treatment?\n\nIf so once you stop finasteride you will be constantly stressed out due to over-expression in Beta receptors and a surge in epinephrine. That can trigger a cascade of other stressed hormones like high cortisol, SDHEA and prolactin.\n\nI tried beta-blocker and feel much better, calmer and not constantly worrying like after fin. I tried 1/4 of the lowest dose of bispropol Could be, well yes. But it could be a myriad of other things as well.\n\nThere is not enough data to draw any conclusions yet. That is why this study is a great stepping stone to more research.\n\nI for example got less anxiety / stress after finasteride than before. I know other share the same experience as me.\n\nSo I would guess it is highly variable between cases what genes got altered and in which way. So you are still off fin, With less anxiety than before? I never had anxiety or panic attack before fin. After fin I am an overactive stressed person to everything that happen to me Yeah that is right.\n\nI never had much anxiety other than some slight social anxiety when meeting new people etc. Never hindered me though.\n\nAfter a few months on fin I started having a lot of anxiety, to the point where I could not even open the door when my dad came to visit without notice.\n\nHowever after I quit almost all my anxiety is gone. Sadly most of my good feelings also disappeared. So you are stuck with anhedonia like most of us, I still have issue with experiencing pleasure doing something. That has to do with neurosteroide. Raising all\u00f4 could help. Did you test for prolactin? If it is high like me it could inhibit dopamine which could also explain the issue. Curious how high your prolactin is/was? Yeah I got high quality blood done.\n\nI had normal T and Estradiol.\n\nProlactin, progesterone was double the top range.\n\nAnd my LH was elevated slightly, while my SHBG was in the lower range. \n\nI think the high progesterone is due to elevated LH. My theory is that fin damaged my leydig cells. So body responds with low SHBG and high LH to crank my T production. I think ketozactanole damage lydieng cells do not know about fin, my prolactin also fluctuate from 50% upper than the top range or double it. I did not test it now since I am on benzodiazepines and beta blocker to fix my constant stress issue, and I know it raise prolactin unfortunately. I have got tachycardia due to lack of sleep since years now, and feel my body is in constant fight or flight for nothing Rat studies have shown cell death within the testis at least.\n\nSomething happened to my left nut, got insane pain after I would been on fin for 5-6 months.\n\nThey diagnosed me with some varicocele on the left testicle.\n\nFin has also been shown to interfere with blood vessels. So maybe I got varicocele from fin and then that made damage to the testicle. \n\nCannot tell for sure since I never had any scan before that, but it is noticeably smaller after that painful event than before. I got the exact same thing but on my penis dorsal vein. I have like a thrombosis on it that never went away(I saw online they call that mondor deases). Never did an ultrasound but would be interested to know if it can go away, I am afraid it will be worst in the future. Also I got peyronie that resolve after stopping it.", "Mid 20 male with very thinning hair. I tried the topical fin/min to see if that improves my hairline. 5 days in, and I suddenly got some nut pain (very mild not noticable sometimes) and low sex drive. Before this I am a very sexual man and sex drive was like a lion. Talked to GP immediately the next day and he said I was very sensitive to Fin and advised me to get off the drug immediately. That is what I will do today. It is sad that there is nothing I can do about my head which once was full of hair. Thanks hair, it was fun while you were there for more than 2 decades for me. LOL I am 20 too and yeah it sucks so badly, once my thick full of hair, which I love and would get compliments very often, is receding now. I hope, I can maintain hair by 25, so that I can get good HT later on. Anyway, it is constant fight and I will do some things at least to not regret later on. For example, at least we might try ketoc, dermaroll, min Hair transplant will likely require to take Fin after...

It had been working great.  \n\nSomeone in the comments sent a link to how one person cycled tribulus and recovered fully. \n\nAnother person commented about how they would crash after increasing their Tribulus intake, but would crash \"up.\" Basically they are baseline would get better every time they crashed. \n\nI found that very interesting and thought fuck it, why not try that? \n\nSo, I did not take tribulus for a week, and then over a 10-day span I went from taking 1 trib pill a day to 4-days of taking 2 pills a day, then back to one. And o have not taken any pills in a week now.  EQ is great! I am thinking the trib is still in my system.  But I just wanted to share that.  I am going to try to take another week without it, and see if there are other improvements or if my baseline has now increased.  \n\nJust to add I also started taking glutamine this week.  I heard it helps with recovery and gut bacteria.  It is cheap, so why not right?  \n\nI have been feeling great for a while, but my libido seems to be back the last week or so.

Tbh it does not even sound like you have sides, let alone PFS. Glad that you are off fin though, you sounds anxious and scared, which are not good combos if you take a drug that have sides that can get worse (or even be triggered by) your mental state. The OP describes symptoms that are commonly reported after stopping finasteride. You are now stepping in to tell him what is psychological and what is not. I do not believe you have any basis to make a determination. OP is describing things that can occur normally. \n\n1) He still has nocturnal erections\n2) The only time I saw people randomly getting erections was through puberty. I have not once, had a random erection while sitting and doing nothing\n3) He still has libido, any regular, untreated person can say they feel like 70% some days, plus he still can have sex without any issues \n4) He might be even better than perhaps a regular person since he can go multiple rounds\n\nI am all for PFS and fin sides. No reason to be against them or say they do not exist unless I am too afraid to admit they are a thing. But if you take out fin and give me the list of things he feels, it does not sound as sides at all. My point is that I do not think either of us is in a position to disentangle what may be psychological and what may be effects directly caused by finasteride and its discontinuation.", "Irish Sea Moss? Recently came across Irish sea moss as a health supplement and found that it can aid in thyroid/ hormone balancing.

I do not recommend taking any supplements.\n\nSeemingly every supplement has been tried but none has been shown to be effective. I do not have PFS, but I fully support and believe in it.\n\nThat being said, you cannot say you will not recover. As much as PFS *is* real, so is the nocebo effect. Chances are you fall into the latter category. Just stop taking finasteride, try to put this out of your mind, continue to be healthy mentally and physically, and you are most likely going to see your sexual function return. It is only been 5 days.....that is nothing in the grand scheme of things, despite what anxiety says. All the best.\n\nI still do not recommend finasteride to anyone. yesterday before sleep i could masturbate and that gave me hope\n\ntoday I woke up with a very flaccid penis but its really flaccid and soft, i have never heard of this side effect, i woke up very nervous, but i managed to have a small erection with porn and it was hard so it calms me down a bit.\n\ntoday i slept 2 hours because a noise woke me up and i couldnt sleep after that\n\nthe day before yesterday it happened me the same but yesterday i could sleep normally, yesterday i made exercise\n\ntoday i will do so much exercise as i can to sleep better.\n\ni hope i do not have insomnia. I am no doctor, but it really sounds like you are being a hypochondriac. Take it from a hypochondriac. If you are feeling anxious, of course you will not be able to sleep.\n\nI think if you really did have PFS, you would know it. Thoughts =/= facts. Agree with above.  One thing that will help with both the anxiety and sex drive is to eat clean, avoid caffeine for a bit and exercise, especially weight lifting.  Squats are particularly good for stimulating testosterone production which will help get things looking up again.  I personally had no issues after stopping finasteride(took for 10 years) but am no stranger to letting my mind go to the most hopeless scenario when there is no reason to.  If you want kids in the future you will have them! Personally, I do not want to take a drug that may fuck with my sperm. If it is lowering sperm count, or quality, in any way, I am not touching it. I do not care if it supposedly gets better. I would be worried about accidentally getting a girl pregnant, since I would be on the drug, I may be creating a son with genital birth defects. I do not care how low or absurd the risk may seem, it goes against a lot of moral codes for me.\n\nSides are only one part of my decision against this drug anyway. I do not think you are being a hypochondriac. These symptoms have all been reported many times by men while taking or after stopping finasteride. There are many men who have experienced the same thing, including me. definitely the side effects I suffered were real, now I am fine, it took me about 10 days to recover It is great to hear you recovered, I am going through the same rn. Never believed in god but i am praying rn that my vanity didnt just fuck up my whole live. Im only 21. I am currently going through the same, can I ask you if you had any other side-effects apart from sexual and possibly insomnia?

Hi everyone, I have been struggling with the following which seem really neurological and wondering if there is any chance it could be from Finasteride. I was on it for 8 months then one day woke up incredibly anxious and felt depersonalization. I have been off it for about a month now. \n\nDepersonalization \nVisual Snow and increased visual disturbances \nPins and needles feeling thorough out the body \n\nThank you Depersonalisation is usually a symptom of anxiety, so lets keep that one aside. I have heard alot of people here suffering anxiety (and following depersonalisation), aswell as visual snow, (not sure about the 'pins and needles') seemingly from their finasteride use. You are saying youve been off it for a month now, has it gotten any better, worse, ... ? So the anxiety came first, and when I stopped is when I noticed the visual snow (could have had it just did not pay attention to it). Pins and needles came just recently a month after stopping and am worried there is something neurologically wrong with me but my doctors have told me finasteride would not cause any of this so I am lost for answers What is your evidence for saying depersonalization is usually a symptom of anxiety? Top adverse events of finasteride reported to FDA by younger men:\n\n\n\nPapers on ocular toxicity of finasteride:\n\n\n\nSee the the subsections General and Macular conditions. \n\nAnd here is a letter from an ophthalmologist about finasteride and eye conditions:\n\n I had the pins and needles symptom pretty bad, seems to be a rarer symptom but definitely could be the fin. My sides have mostly subsided now. After a few months. Thanks for the response! How long into taking the medication did you notice the pins and needles Pins and needles can definitely be a symptom of anxiety. Having anxiety limits bloodflow to extremities. Came across an earlier post of yours as I am going through sides. Took 1mg for 1 month. Been off for almost 6 weeks now, think I crashed. Did you ever experience like a loss of feeling/ almost numbness in your penis? Like even a throbbing feeling? If so how long did I take to correct? Looks like you are doing ok now, thanks I strangely never had any sexual symptoms, just psych and neurological. Anxiety has improved but my visual snow has not", "Do all PFS cases include penis symptoms? I took Fin for a few years regularly. I have now been off it for about 9 or so months.\n\nWithin the first week (of taking it) I had a lot of placebo because I was so worked up about it but after that I went back to normal.\n\nOver a long period I started to get ill very slowly with what I now know to be SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth). I never really got any kind of penis symptoms, no real obvious lowering of libido, no issues with getting it up or hardness and all that.\n\nHere is the thing, I have fatigue and I get mental lethargy as well as muscle weakness in my neck and back but those symptoms alone are so vague that they belong to many issues - hell even SIBO itself has those as symptoms. \n\nFor me to derive whether I have PFS is therefore very hard. The only clue I really have that I might not have it is that I do not have penis issues to put it simply. You can still have pfs without any sexual sides. Easiest way to tell if you have true pfs is to experiment with increasing your hormones. If your symptoms do not improve with increased hormones then you are guaranteed to have pfs. what specifically do you mean by increased hormones? I mean if you are able to boost your testosterone/DHT (via methods such as: hormone replacement, herbs, diet etc) and all your pfs symptoms go away then you most likely did not have pfs in the first place. \n\nI find a lot of people on this sub Reddit just have finasteride related side effects that clear up within the first few months to a year via various methods. \n\nWith real pfs you are not going to magically recover all symptoms by taking some herbs or hormones unless it is years down the road and your receptors somehow recovered. So if increasing the hormones lost by finasteride does not make you recover, what exactly IS post finasteride syndrome? Like if undoing what the medication did offers not help, it seems to me like it is psychosomatic The recent studies on Post-Finasteride Syndrome found that their androgen receptors are up regulated, and severely methylated upon examining their gene expression. \n\nThe recently released Baylor study \u201cwith 1,446 genes significantly over-expressed and 2,318 genes significantly under-expressed in study patients. Androgen receptor expression was significantly higher in study patients compared to controls\u201d\n\nYou can believe what you want but people with PFS are not stupid at all. Our bodies no longer respond to hormones like normal people. The damage goes far deeper than just serum hormone issues.\n\nIf it was as simple as fixing your hormones then PFS would not even exist and studies would not even be done because you could simply go on hormones and be cured. It is not that simple at all. I have seen the study you are referring to. The problem is, there is not data in gene expression PRIOR to taking finasteride, in the group claiming to be experiencing PFS. It also was a group of just 25 people, despite thousands claiming PFS. You could be correct that it is caused by gene expression, but it is just as possible that the people experiencing this had these gene expressions beforehand. And again, there is no evidence that most PFS sufferers have this gene expression either. They only examined 25 out of thousands.\n\n\nI do not think there is anything wrong with hesitancy to take finasteride or any hormonal drugs. But I am doubtful of many of the claims made the PFS crowd considering just how little evidence exists for any of this. Maybe someday there will be groundbreaking evidence of PFS You have to understand we are a pretty small community with limited funding going up against a billion dollar pharma company. Research will take a long time. However, there is absolutely zero doubt in my mind that pfs will be proven eventually. \n\nI do not blame you for doubting it is existence because we are in the early stages. Most people did not believe CTE was a real thing 15-20 years ago. Yeah I mean the thing that makes me doubtful is just how vague the symptoms are. Like with CTE you could easily do brain scans, but with PFS it is not possible to see any measurable changes, beyond possibly the possible changes in gene expression (which again, was only seen in a small group). \n\n\nI have zero doubt that many who claim to suffer from PFS are experiencing the nocebo effect. I mean just reading these horror stories have made me feel like I have them too and Ive never even taken finasteride! But I also do not doubt that there are many people, possibly yourself, for whom something is truly wrong, maybe something we do not know how to measure yet. \n\n\nMy advice is set up a donation fund to file another class action lawsuit. The last one against Merk got 4 millions With CTE it took a special and caring individual doctor to go above and beyond to actually do the proper brain scans. The pfs symptoms are not really that vague at all they are mainly just symptoms of hypogonadism. It just differs from person to person based on the level of damage. \n\nI respect your opinion if you feel it is nocebo. There is nothing that will really change your guys minds until we get the proper research done. The symptoms is not vague at all. If you look into the most common complains with PFS and then cross reference it with the Baylor study you will see it is a close match.\n\nBetween individuals the symptoms are quite varying, but as a group they are not.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence PFS is very real, you think they would put \"erectile dysfunction who may be persistent or permanent\" on the label otherwise?\n\nAlso the animal studies, although scarce, confirms that finsteride can cause permanent changes to behavior.\n\nAnd then there is the fact that finasteride is a potent inhibitor of 5 alpha reductase type 3.\n\nIt is a enzyme who is not involved in steroidogenesis per see, but rather glycosylation. It is a very important function and while this has not been perused in any research as of yet, I would bet it is very much involved in the pathology of PFS. The placebo studies suggest as many as 3/4 PFS cases could be psychosomatic. I do not think it is nearly that high though and as I have said, I do believe in PFS. It is clearly very real, I just do not know how common it is. Because of that, I would not recommend anyone take finasteride or dutasteride This is hilarious. So you are thinking this is pfs instead of the actual disease that was diagnosed by the doctor? While pfs is not even proven to exist. I am not sure you really care about my response, but for the benefit of people landing here from searches I will answer. \n\nBasically, SIBO is a new disease and there are many unknowns about it even in the medical industry. The only way I got diagnosed in my country with it is pure luck because I saw a private consultant. My government provided health care does not know about it. Additionally, the nature of SIBO is that it has a huge variety in symptoms per person. That is to say if I am feeling some kind of symptoms I cannot easily correlate it to that disease.\n\nMy reason for this post was to hopefully quickly rule out FPS as a potential cause if all cases include 'dick stuff'. For example if people responded with \"all cases include dick stuff you do not have it\" I would have learnt something that would be useful to me. Very worthwhile the 5 minutes it took to post.  \n\nI can tell you have a hard life that has not been fair, I also realise you do not need to listen to some random reddit comment.

But i would not say it just looks less, its much less...\n\nit looks more like that my prostate does sometimes produce too less fluid, while my sperm volume stays the same. so in that sense it is more \"dense\" Bro fin shrinks your prostate and here is your answer The prostate glands produce and contain fluid that forms part of semen, the substance that is emitted during ejaculation as part of the male sexual response. This prostatic fluid is slightly alkaline, milky or white in appearance. Common side effect.

This pill has really devastated my life in both the mental and sexual departments. very sad to hear that, man. But I guess you are lucky since you took it  months not very long. Hope you will recover. Besides, I am 80% feeling pre-fin level energy slowly though 2 months of mine got wasted on doing nothing. If you want to learn about my daily supplementation stack, it is taurine, magnesium, omega3 fish oil and some vitamins Me2 For me 59 yo, took fin against benign prostatic hyperplasia for two months and I am half a year with PFS. \n\nOK most of the PFS community are in their twentieth. So God \ud83d\ude4f gifted me 59 years without that inhuman pain in my destroyed brain \ud83e\udde0 and 46 years with sexuality.\n\nBut after April 21 my live is an inhuman torture of lobotomy, anhedoic, castration and depression. I hope to die as soon as possible! I really wish you a swift recovery, dear.", "finasteride experience and penis shrinkage alrighty so i just came off finasteride about 3 months ago bc of how it was making me feel mentally. i felt more emotional and negative thoughts were always looming in my head, especially at night. but i think the worst part of it all was that it affected my libido. i had no urge to think about sexual activity and my penis could not really feel any sensation not even when i touched it or when i pee'd. my penis size at one point was the size of a toddler's and i was terrified. the only upside was that my hair was not falling out but at the expense of the aformentioned. in the end, i decided it was not really worth it. and since then i have been more able to control my thoughts and how i feel. i honestly think going bald would just set me free. that it would just propel me forward like never before. the only bad thing about it is that i have had like an excoriation disorder where i just picked at scabs on my scalp excessively and i may have a lot of scars on my head. i am sure i do actually. also bc of that disorder i was pulling my hair out which certainly did not help matters. and so the only thing holding my hair together at this point is the fibers that im using. but i understand that even that will soon serve to be futile. i will admit that i was insecure of how i would be perceived, with females in particular bc of my balding or potential shaved head but honestly once i really think about it. i would not want a girl to date me for my looks anyway. and as far as people making fun of me, well guess who is able to react accordingly now(: i am literally secure in every aspect of my life except for my balding. i am learning to let go. and plus i have all the confidence in the world that i am going to be rich in the future and perhaps a hair transplant can get me my hair back. that is literally the only thing i am holding onto and one of the reasons why i am ok with going bald. anyway fast forward and i am here now. my hair is falling out like never before. and my penis lost about 1.5 inches. it used to be a solid 8 but now it is 6.5 which actually brought me here initially. Is there anyway i can get my penis size back to 8 inches? or will i have to rely on a penile transplant in the future? i am taking nitro pump gummies (potassium nitrate) to help with blood flow, but i do not see much if a difference. what can i do? thanks for sticking around this long and thanks for listening God bless Is that your only symptom? Penile shrinkage? I could not tell from your post, but are you also still experiencing low libido?\n\nMy shrinkage problems improved with time. I think the reason for the smaller size is lack of proper blood flow during erections. The severe genital numbness and lack of libido also hurt erectile quality. Now I am able to achieve 90% erectile strength as before. It improved with time. I still have very low libido, however, and I have not made much improvement with regards to that symptom in three years. \n\nYou are only 3 months out from quitting? You could definitely improve with time! 3 months is not that long in the scheme of recover. I have heard of men taking longer than that amount of time to recover from Finasteride side effects completely. Try giving it more time. penile shrinkage is really the only long-term symptom, and my erections just are not the same anymore. and i want to say that my penis just is not as sensitive as it used to be. my libido improved but i am not quite sure if it is how it used to be\nyeah, it is bc of the blood flow which is why i am taking potassium nitrate. i also thought about taking penis enhancer's that temporarily make the penis bigger but i have not really looked much into it. \nand you are right maybe i should be more patient since i am just coming off it\nthank you for your input and experience, i greatly appreciate it. your penis cant lose its max size. You can only be unable to achieve its max size because of the sides. You will be back to what you were before just be patient man", "Common characteristics of the 2% I have heard PFS only affects 2% of fin users. I am curious what makes this group unique. Does everyone have similar genetics, diet, exercise, etc? Has that been studied?", "58 days on fin, 10 days off I am 34m who took 1/mg fin for a receding hairline for 58 days.  I began to notice mood swings, depression/anxiety, inconsistent erection quality so I got online and started reading horror stories. Immediately discontinued use 10 days ago and it is only gotten worse since then. I think I am noticing that flaccid my penis has shrunk, it definitely does not get or stay as hard and now I am noticing watery and decreased ejaculate. \n\nI have already scheduled blood work to be done with two different doctors, one a men\u2019s health clinic and the other a bone fide endocrinologist.\n\nAny other ideas what I can do other than clean up my diet, wait and pray my mind rewires itself. I am terrified of what I have done to myself in the course of less than two months. Any feedback is appreciated. I have been there.  I just left a comment about this. \n\nI was scared as well, but I only took 3 pills.  \n\nI had it all, the lack of a libido and watery semen. \n\nDude, just drink a ton of water everyday, eat clean. DO NOT take any supplements such as creatine or tribulus.   \n\nJust protein powder, I take fish oil, vitamin d and magnesium pills as well.  \n\nHit the gym.  As hard as it may be, just know this is temporary.  Eat clean. Blueberries, bananas, other fruits.  \n\nGive yourself 6 months, and you should see major improvements.  Maybe in a month or two ask your doctor for Cialis.  That will help getting it up. \n\nI have been there, I was terrified, suicidal, no libido.  \nBut today I feel great.  Look at my last comment in this subreddit, more details there.  \n\nGood luck! Like you i took 3 pills in december and have been off for 3.5 weeks now. I initially experienced horrible sides.\n\nIve been taking a BUNCH of different supplements (almost 20) so far and they have really helped clear my mental dog and energy sides.\n\n**HOWEVER** my two **most hated sides** are noticeably still here which is **Penis De-sensitivity and Weak Erections.** This is why im starting to take test boosting supplements.\n\nWhy do you say avoid test boosting supplements??? (tribiluis, maca, horny goat weed, ginseng, and the most potent Tongkat Ali)\n\nnote\\*: part of the reason why im taking all of these is because my post fin blood test showed: \n\n\\- Dangerously high E2 \n\n\\-Low Thyroid\n\n\\-Low Iron Well, I had a blood test taken before and after I took fin.  The one after did not happen until December, and at that time my test levels were higher than before.  I started talking Cialis right after that, and I feel as though that definitely helped.  I have had morning wood everyday this week.  \n\nI am suggesting to stay away from tribulus because I took it, felt great for 2 weeks and then had a terrible crash and felt like shit for about 2 weeks.  \n\nNow that I have not taken anything (other than what I had mentioned, which I have been taking steady for years), and I felt as though my body is just getting back to normal on its own. It is \"recovering.\"\n\nListen, I am not going to pretend to know the science behind it, but if you go through older posts, you will see comments where people say just wait 3-6months and do not take supplement, I had to learn why myself.  \n \n3.5 weeks are not shit.  Wait 3 months.  \n\nI did not have the penis insensitivity until December though, I am sure I would have had it sooner had I not taken tribulus.  I feel great now, back to jerkin off a couple of times a day, which was not the case just a month ago.  \n\nAlso, I have always had higher testosterone levels than normal, one a very fit guy.  I have been working out steady for about 12 years now, and am in great shape.  All of my Bloodwork was amazing, my doctor was baffled and thought it was just psychological, I know that it was not.  But am not going to investigate further because I feel as though I am nearing a full recovery, fingers crossed.  \n\nYou do not have to take my advice, we are all different. \n\nGood luck! sounds nice, Great progress man, looks like youre gaining your manhood back!\n\nI wish i could stop the supps but im already too deep into it tbh! (and spent WAY too much money)\n\nHowever I will stop  using trib and few other test boosters specifically.  **except tonkat ali.**\n\nAll the other vitamins i am taking are basically essential  vitamins / minerals that i unfortunately dont get through my current diet. I can provide the full list if you would like.\n\nTo be competently honest with you my mental state and energy levels has improved significantly (\\*knock on wood\\*) ever since i started my super stack. Im also a fit guy so i like the effects in the gym.\n\nI am just waiting for this stupid erection quality / sensitivity / libido side to fade away. quick note: Im on 37 days of NoFap, unfortunately it didnt help at all (maybe like 10%) for those first 2 sides.(for context; pre-fin, on 2 weeks of nofap, i would be having random erections legit all the time with teen level libido)\n\n  \nWhat Is your cialis dosage btw? ive heard mixed reviews for long term use Well, I actually have not taken Cialis in more than a week.  My doctor prescribed 20 pills and suggested I only take half a pill.  I did that about 8 times (so half a pill each time) over 3-4 weeks.  I still have the rest of the pills, but I will save them for a special night now.  Hahahha.  How long did it take you to recover each time? I took finasteride for 12 years, have been off for 11 months now. I go through waves of this. A couple weeks I am almost back to normal and then back to no sex drive and ED. I am hopeful it will get better over time but I did take the drug for a very long time. A big positive is that I did get my wife pregnant while I am going through this, it was something I feared would not happen because of my side effects. It is depressing but I stay hopeful it will get better. Also, the sleep thing is real. If you are getting bad sleep it makes the ED a certainty.\n\nMy penis was 7+ inches and thick when erect before I stopped taking fin, after I stopped, it is impossible to get that hard. Also, it seems to be smaller when flaccid. Anyone ever recover from this? Have you fully recovered now ??", "Good webinar on a related post-drug condition ", "Wondering if I should quit or not 18M, I started Finasteride 1mg daily in June of this year after using minoxidil 2x daily since December of 2020. Everything seemed pretty fine for the first few months but it was not until recently where I had a 2 week break from it. In the next few days afterwards I experienced sleep deprivation, loss of appetite and pretty bad anxiety which was never a problem. The confusing thing is around the same time I stopped for a couple weeks, I also stopped using my weed pen which I had used everyday for almost 2 months prior. I am not sure if I experienced withdrawals from it but there is a chance. After the short break off of Finasteride, I have started again a few days ago but the anxiety from around the time I got off has not stopped and may have gotten worse. The short answer would be to blame on fin yet I am going through somewhat of a hard time in life currently which can very likely be the main cause of my anxiety however I do plan on seeing a therapist or psychiatrist. I had not notably experienced a loss in sex drive or any ED when on the pill but when I got off, I noticed a slight boost in my sex drive. I am not necessarily asking for medical advice rather just general advice on what I should do. Change my dosage? Stop completely? Etc. Any other weed users (more specifically dab pen) out there who may be able to share some tips or experiences similar? Strictly fin users feel free to share anything helpful as well. It is a warning. You do not have sexuell sides. So quit before you will get sexuell, physical and other neurological sides. I would quit knowing what I know, but I also know what its being young scared of losing your hair. You already know coming to this subreddit what kind of answers you will get, ask yourself if you really want to take finasteride for life (?) People usually stop way before that though.\n\nBeing 30+ now hair is such a small thing in life personally and in my opinion its not a close decision. With that said if you are taking propecia at 18 you will most likely lose hair anyway being on it, effects usually lessen for people after a while. \n\nGood luck. Its hard but I would say give it a chance and this is from someone who gets serious sexual sides from fin\n\nYou were on it and fine, and your symptoms like loss of sleep and anxiety could very well be related to stopping weed. Weed helps me sleep and if I completely quit ill have trouble sleeping\n\nIts up to you, but coming here, its generally people who have horrible experience with fin and would not wish it on anybody. It would be hard for them to recommend\n\nIf you go to /r/tressless, they will all say you are getting placebo or say its only from the weed stoppage\n\nThey downvote pretty much anyone talking about symptoms from fin. So the answer you get is depending on the sub you post. I frequent both to try and bridge the gap as much as I can as there is a way to believe in the product but also at the small chance (but very real) of serious side effects Damn man I am super sorry to hear that\n\nHonestly I am sure I am going to start microdosing, probably 3x a week from now on and just ride the anxiety out if anything, if it persists I will eventually force myself to get off fin \n\n&amp; yeah exactly, I knew I would not be crazy for getting my symptoms confused with weed withdrawals\n\nThat was a big thought I had before posting this, I knew that every sub would tell me different but I would not have minded hearing the truth from guys who have went through something similar rather than people who would just encourage me with no real experiences like mine. Thanks for the insight and helpfulness. Get off the poison now. Biggest mistake I have ever made. You should stop now, I had similar symptoms and my libido was at a high before the crash hit and within a day my dick died took a while to go back to normal Please please please get off the drug. I didnt think sides would happen to me but they did. No ed issues but the horrible anxiety and insomnia definitely kicked in. I never ever had any anxiety problems in my life until i took fin. I AM SERIOUS. First, it was constant insomnia that creeped in and I could not pinpoint it to fin so i kept taking it and eventually had a panic attack that led to more. If you quit please dont go cold turkey either. Try to taper Yes, no one should ever take fin for anything. greatest comment on here", "I have taken 2 pills 5mg so far and i stoped i am i still safe?

PLEASE convince me not to.

It is just so tempting. I wonder if I will get lucky and have no sides if I start small by cutting the pills. But I know this forum could be my voice of reason. Convince me not to\u2026 please. \n\nSide note: I know this is not logical thinking. It is probably the same line of thought that most gamblers have before they lose all their money. Learn stoicism and lean towards god The side effects I got the second time we are tenfold more severe and lasted much longer than my first time on finsateride, just shave your head and move on I switched to topical finasteride 2x a day over a month ago and I have no sides. Dear friend please stay away from Finasteride\n I used a unknown generic, because I thought, I have to do what the doctor said to me. It was finasteride. Because of not thinking about, take it for two months, ignoring all the side effects, I am now one of the rare cases who has the post finasteride syndrom. With PFS live is over and you are so young. People tend to get even worse off the 2nd time. There is also studies who showed that the ones who got sides to begin with, got the same sides after re-introduction.\n\nMaybe you will not find anyone to \"your standards\" without hair. But you will not find anyone at all with a limp dick and zero libido.\n\nPick your poison. Perhaps the terrible self image could be helped in a healthier more substantial and lasting way? For instance, weight lifting and fitness? Doing something good and healthy for your body instead of something that is destructive will help you feel better and who does not love strength? Just try not to focus on anything lacking. When you see yourself it is crucial to point out all of the positives at least twice a day in a mirror. Very few people have it all. Some of us have great hair and a flat butt. Some have clear skin and a wandering eye. I would go so far to say that if you have such a strong emotional attachment to your hair, then shave your head. Or even better- find an above average hairstylist and tell them you are not liking this new, ongoing hair loss and will they give you their ideas and professional opinion on what would look best on you and buy the product to style it correctly. Tell them you need their instruction on how to make it look it is best and pre book the maintenance appointments if you like what they did. Stop being hard on yourself and really look at breaking self destructive thought patterns so you never act upon them. I hope this helps! Please do not. It is not worth it. Every single person on this forum's worst mistake in life is taking fin.\n\nShave your head. I actually like the way I look shaved. Wish I just did that and never even knew about fin Do not do it man I had to drop out of college and I am essentially a vegetable now. Took fin for two months, stopped and had side effects for 4 months (depression mild anxiety low libido). Started get self concious about my hair again (I am 18) and life has been fucking HORRIBLE over the past 5 months. Extreme anxiety depression disassociation (feel like you cannot comprehend your environment, everything looks like plastic) muscle spasms and sever brain fog. IT IS NOT WORTH IR BROTHER. If you have to HAVE TO keep your hair I would just stick to minoxidil, but even with that it can cause fin symptoms Finasteride A) is not a cure for hair loss,  B) for a lot of men, only maintains the current state of their hair without resulting in visible regrowth, C) does not even do that for some men (I starting losing more hair after 1 year on it), and D) is not your only option to treat hair loss.   get a hair transplant if you can afford it A hair transplant should be anyone's absolute last resort. They are expensive, fraught with complications, _require you to take finasteride long-term_, and may not last very long, according to some studies:  If you think losing your hair is hurting your self image, you have no idea how much worse finasteride could make it. For some of us, we do not recover like you did. Imagine that for the rest of your life. Consider yourself lucky to have recovered and do not tempt fate. I  suffered from pfs very bad I am recovering now after a year, I would tell you to try it but the one reason I would tell you not to is because it can make you change the way you make decision it can alter your life choices because it takes away all of your male instinct so just do not do it you still need finasteride to maintain Look I will also start finasteride again. I took it for 3 days and freaked completly out so I noceboed myself 100%. and than I stopped.  My hairline is now still receding and just like you when I watch in the mirror I see my future self bald and unhappy.\n\nliterally millions of people take finasteride and how many members does that forum have. about 600 and I think more than half are just people who dont have pfs and are just here to inform themself.\n\nI literally smoke a pack a cigarette a day and do coke and booze every weekend and those are 1000 times more likely to fucking kill me and I never give a second thought about doing that.\n\nThe mind is so fragile of sugestion and is very capable of empathy, so if you read these horrible stories your brain will wire itself in those stories.\n\nSorry for good english I am lucky in that I am self-aware enough to know that the side effects that I had were not just me overthinking it. They were real. You do not have to believe me\u2026 but it cost me nothing to tell you this, and it might cost you everything to not believe me.\n\nI wish you would read the other comments like I did. And hell yeah I figured out how to comment What sides did you get the 2nd time and how long did it take you to recover ? do not you think some of the depression has to do with the losing hair part. sure fin can cause it in some people but it is not like 18 year olds cannot become extremely depressed over losing their hair. (me) and that is something i feel like this sub ignores is the side effects of being bald. Nope. I would 100% loose all of my hair right this second If I could get my head to feel ok. It is not depression of the sense of \u201cman this situation sucks\u201d it is more that I literally cannot feel any emotions and nothing brings me joy or happiness. have no idea why you are getting down voted for listing you not getting sides either. i have been on for 2 weeks with no sides i get that and that is fs good for you, but not everyone  is like that. some people kill themselves over going bald Definitely true. I was in that boat till my brain went to shit. I just want to live a happy life at this point, Idc how I look. I would say if you were happy before, even with hair loss. Took fin and then you suddenly cannot feel, it is definitely the fin. But if you have no sexual/other mental sides and really worry about hair loss, then yeah that is just in your head. I am not even entirely against fin I would just never recommend it to someone who is looking at taking it again after being negatively affected the first time due it it fucking me up 10x worse the second time. yeah that is what i have heard that it hits you harder the second time after getting sides the first", "Supplements for PFS recovery please Hi everyone, my partner who is the most level headed person in the world and had previously cried once in the past 14 years of us being together, is now crying regularly, not finding pleasure in anything and is angry and frustrated with me.

I have just stumbled upon this sub reddit and it bought back a lot of very painful memories for me. I always told myself that if I ever got through it that I would help whomever I could. What it seems like most of you need is some form of hope that things can get better, I remember that is what I needed the most anyway. Anything to hold on to, because the thought of never getting better was almost too much to bare and made me suicidal. So I guess primarily that is what I am here to say; recovery is possible. At least it was for me. Also I feel like I learned a lot through my journey so I would like to share what I can to. I may be misguided on some fronts or there may have been research done in the meantime since I stopped checking in on the various PFS communities but all I can do is share what I think I know and what has worked for me and the people that I was in touch with whilst we tried to get better.\n\n**My story**\n\nI took 2.5mg fin/day for 4 months. Oct 16 \u2013 Jan 17. During these 4 months I felt great. Then one day after drinking I noticed that I had no libido. This was strange as usually when I am hungover it is through the roof. I stopped taking fin the following day. My libido came back 3 days after but then my situation rapidly declined. By the end of week 1 I had: no libido, complete erectile dysfunction, I could not sleep for more than 1.5 hours at a time, terrible fatigue, brain fog so bad that I could not follow conversations, increased tinnitus, no appetite, anxiety, suicidal depression. Over the course of the next month I developed issues with my vision like visual snow and a massive increase in eye floaters and I developed much more prominent veins on my genitals and groin area.\n\nThroughout this time I was understandably terrified and desperate for answers and a way to fix myself. I went to see the most prominent fertility doctor here in my home country who had been very outspoken about fin since the 90s and he basically told me that for some it got better, for others it did not. Great. I searched online and I found the Propeciahelp forum which was a vortex of terrified people with no home and seemingly close to suicide (I actually followed a thread there where a guy did kill himself because of his sides). There was no good information out there that gave me any kind of hope.\n\nThat is until I stumbled upon some buried posts on that forum by a guy called CDNuts. He had had fin for 8 years or so and had been through years of trial and error and said that he had developed a protocol that helped people get better. I found that he had set up on another, less negative forum here: (\n\nBasically, CDNut\u2019s protocol (I will link at the bottom) involves a fairly drastic supplementation routine, a focus on very healthy living including diet and exercise regiments and some more \u201cout there\u201d practices. All of which I followed strictly for about 6 months. I then took 6 weeks off to do some travelling and then got back to following it more loosely this time for 9 months. By the time I went travelling most of my mental and sleep related symptoms had been alleviated for the most part and my libido was at about 40%-50% of my pre fin state and I still had my veins and visual issues (these would never go). All in all it took my libido and sexual issues about 1 \u2013 1.5 years to recover to a 100% place but that would not always last and dips would occur. \n\nIt is important to note that the sexual sides come and go in waves and the highs may only last a few days and the lulls can last weeks. Up until December last year I was still getting mini libido crashes. When these happened I would get a strange feeling in my prostate, the thickness of my semen would increase and the volume would decrease, my erections are not as strong and more difficult to maintain and I barely ever think about sex and I have to get myself going \u2013 you all know what it is like. These kept happening until this January when I decided to start taking a small version of the herb rotation laid out in CDNut\u2019s protocol of herbs that I felt at this stage had worked for me \u2013 as well as some other supplements. Since then my libido has been extremely high and almost too high at times. Needing to masturbate twice a day is not rare. So, at this stage in terms of sexual side effects I feel myself as fully recovered and having libido higher than many men my age. Mental side effects are more difficult to quantify however and are difficult to parse between what is caused by chemical reaction of the drug and what it a result of the anxious and panicked state the whole situation can leave you in. Certain aspects of my anxiety are not resolved and I am now seeing a therapist to address this. That said, my sleep, brain fog and depression have certainly gone.\n\nDuring my time looking for answers on this whole thing I immersed myself in several communities  and schools of thought on PFS. I tried different approaches at times and went through a lot of trial and error. I will expand on some topics that I feel are important.\n\n**Doctors**\n\nAs you probably know; doctors do not have a clue in regard to PFS and I honestly think that unless they are committed to researching and understanding the hormones, how and under what circumstances they get metabolized and how they interact with one another then I would advise steering clear of them. I have seen cases on various forums where doctors have either not helped at all, refused to believe the patient or have actually made the situation worse. I have never heard of a doctor helping someone get better unfortunately.\n\n**Pro \u2013 Hormones**\n\nAs well as taking many and most of the supplements listed in CDNut\u2019s protocol at one time or another I have also tried using prohormones such as pregnenolone, androsterone, 5a -DHP, T3, DHEA and 6- keto-P4. I bought these from a vendor on the pay peats forum and they had some small affect. Particularly the pregnenolone + DHEA formula when applied directly to my testicles along with androsterone. That said the affect was small. What I do notice help much more are the following: Pine Pollen taken in large doses and Super R-Andro, a discontinued prohormone bought out by IronMag Labs that was affectively larges does of androsterone \u2013 a 5AR derivative.\n\n**What I think works and why**\n\nI think that the only thing to do is to slowly increase 5AR activity and androgen activity. This is obviously a pretty obvious statement and I do think that 5AR activity does very slowly increase naturally provided you are healthy. That said many people seem to never get better, certainly not fully. And my thinking is twofold \u2013 there baseline has been changed to what their body thinks is a normal level of androgen reactivity *and* their 5AR activity is low thus conversion to its various metabolites does not happen at near the same rate. \n\nThe reason I think that androgen baselines are changed is because I have seen people use TRT to increase test levels but they still do not get better. Their body is not utilising the extra test to work in a sexual manner at all and the only reason that this can be is because androgen receptor levels have been down regulated to be less dense in areas that are pertinent for sexual function. This also follows the what we generally witness when someone crashes and stops using the 5Ari. 5AR is diminished whilst taking the drug thus testosterone is vastly increased because it is not being converted into DHT, Androsterone, 5a-DHP, etc. The body has been producing a normal amount but that normal amount of production essentially creates an above physiologically natural amount. The body can only adjust for this in a few ways; downregulating production, downregulating receptors or increasing aromatization (increase conversion of T to Estrogen. What I think happens is that the body utilises these methods within the context of normal production of testosterone meaning that it now views the normal amount of androgenic activity as surplus to requirements. And this plus the massively downregulated 5ar mean very low androgen activity despite many seeing normal levels of T in some. Also, 5ar activity is often increased by the presence of it is metabolites which is something of a feedback loop so because of the low levels of it is metabolites and created by lowering it is activity and low levels of androgens often experienced by PFS suffers this process is extremely slow for some and effectively non-existent in some cases as T levels continue to drop during age thus making it near impossible to ever catch up to a previous state. It is also really important to note the role of cortisol here. Cortisol is the bane of other hormones, it prevents their production and utilisation and in most cases that I have seen where PFS suffers have it tested their cortisol levels are generally way too high.\n\nI think that the fact that recovery comes in such waves supports the above theory on androgen baseline and 5ar also. Each wave of recovery moves the baseline a bit higher but also always causes a \u2018crash\u2019 when the body \u2018thinks\u2019 (for lack of a better term) that it has reached this lowered baseline.\n\nThat is why I believe that CDNut\u2019s protocol works and why it worked for me. I do think that you can take or leave parts of it but main thrust of eating healthily, exercising and supplementation and the adaptogenic herb rotation that lower cortisol levels and support the endocrine system. Most of the guys I have seen get better are guys who have a history of exercise somewhat or have committed to living a healthy lifestyle in order to get better. The herbs for me are key and during recovery I could always tell a difference in my state compared to when I was not on them. That said I do think that the more aspects of the protocol that one commits to the quicker recovery as many parts of it (mediation, wim hof breathing) are there to primarily reduce stress which creates a much healthier state for the body to recover in. \n\nI have written a lot so I am going to stop here other than to list the supplements that I now take as I know that question is likely coming. I know many people will disagree with much of what I have said and I do encourage you to take much of what I claim to *know* with a pinch of salt as I can only say what I have seen work for me and a dozen or so others. But much is conjecture and theory and I accept that. At the end of the day this is a fucking horrible affliction and I just want to help, so if this helps one person live with more hope and even get better then this will have done it is job. But I am completely willing to debate or answer any questions on anything that I have touched on so feel free.\n\n**Supplements I take now:**\n\n\\- 7 day herb rotation of Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fo ti, L-Dope Mucuna, Cordyceps, Tribulus, Tongkat Ali.\n\n\\- Vitamin D\n\n\\- Zinc\n\n\\- Vitamin K\n\n\\- CBD oil\n\n\\- Magnesium\n\n\\- Creatine\n\n**What I would add if I was trying to get bett:**\n\n\\- Pine Pollen\n\n\\- Caffeine (coffee)\n\n\\- Niacinamide\n\n\\- A 6 week course of high dose androsterone every 3-4 months.\n\nAny questions on any of these supplements as to why I take them I am happy to answer, I just do not have time to go into it now. Also, I  exercise daily by lifting weights or cardio as well as meditate.\n\nProtocol: (\n\nThe Thread about my story on the forum: ( Thanks for coming back and letting us know there is a route out copper. Funny enough I am actually undertaking the protocol myself, doing everything other weightlifting due to covid. Mentally I am good and have no brain fog but I have been hit and physically, specifically the face I am going to give this everything I can to get back to the man I was before I took the two pills. Absolutely no problem friend, if you have any questions at all on any of it feel free to ask me here. Very kind of you copper much appreciated. Just wanted to know if there is any general tips you would give someone about the protocol as someone who has been and done it.\n\nWhat was your typical diet like on the protocol\n\nI notice that your from Ireland which is not to far from me in the UK, London and just wanted to know where you purchased your herbs from as its not cost friendly for me to constantly have them shipped from the states.\n\nLastly what was your gym routine like in terms of how often you went in a typical week both weight lifting and hiit running.\n\nSorry for bombarding you fella! And again much appreciated for your offer of answering questions. Very grateful for your time! At first I followed what CDNuts talks about; no gluten/sugar etc.. I ate a TON of veggies an red meant and had fish a couple of times a week. I would also try and eat liver once a week. After a while I started reading up on Ray Peat's diet that is kind of of geared towards lowering cortisol and helping the endocrine system but it was so extreme, different to what I am used to and there is so much sugar and coffee in it that I did not do it for long as I could not get the hang of it really.\n\nReally I would just focus on eating as healthily as possible; little processed food, lots of healthy fats and not very little sugar. I would also advise not eating in a deficit unless you are overweight in which case your body has plenty of stores to use. If not then I would recommend eating just in a surplus so your body has all the building blocks in needs. Also if you eat in a deficit then your body will naturally increase cortisol and adrenaline for energy which will negatively affect both hormone production and your sleep.\n\nIn terms of tips I would really just try to realise that PFS is not the end of the world and it does not have to dictate your life. I would advise you to write down everything you need to do every day; eat healthy, take supplements, meditate, cold showers, exercise, etc and just tick it off and know that you are doing all that you can do to get better. As I mentioned in my OP recovery will come in waves and some days you will feel your libido kick which is great but it also makes it really annoying and sad when it drops away again. Do not stress over this, this is part of it. Whenever it drops off again just think of it as part of the cycle that you have to go through, there is no magic bullet and it does not magically just come back one day. What will happen is that PFS will become less and less part of your daily thought process as you will be doing the protocol on automatic and then after a while you will notice that your libido is staying for longer and longer and that you can barely remember the last time it completely dropped off. \n\nExercise wise I would been going tot he gym for 5 years at this stage so I have a few routines up my sleeve but for the vast majority of my recovery I was doing my own adapted version of Layne Noron's PHAT rountine, very similar to a 5 day push, pull legs. When I first crashed I was not able to do this because of exhaustion but after the first month I forced myself. I also played five a side football once a week and would usually do one other bit of cardio like a short run. Honestly my cardio was not great and I would seriously advise against tiring yourself out. I was only able to do 5 days a week of lifting weights because my body was already used to it. If you are not then I would strongly suggest just picking up routine that you can do like 3-4 days a week and sticking to that. I think that this guy does some great free programs: ( \n\nFor supplements, when I was first started I was ordering from America and Amazon but I have since found this company:  (  I did not want to link them in my OP cause it looks like advertising but I do like them and their very clear on their dosages and amounts in the package etc.\n\nNo problem mate. Again any questions are absolutely fine, I will endeavor to answer any when I can. r/TheChemcels \n\nSupport group for people who are having sex issues because of meds. Love to have you. Thanks a lot for the advice and tips my friend. All the more confident now in terms of working out and eating the right stuff.\n\nJust an interesting point as to how it can hit people in different ways my libido is actually not far off what it was before pfs weirdly enough. Mine is more physical hits body and face and slight ED. Will defo need to do some meditating even though couple rounds of wim hof before a cold shower do make me feel less depressed and its frustrating because it is self induced depression as a result of what the drug has done to my face but crying will not get me anywhere. Just got to do what is needed and hopefully it will not be long before I am back to who I was before taking the poison.\n\nThanks again buddy u/coppersocks Do you have any conflicts of interest? For example do you have a relationship with the owners/operators of the site you linked to, or benefit financially from its revenue? Also, were you posting as CDNuts on the PropeciaHelp forum? No I was posting as Coppersocks on both the propecia help forum briefly and then swole source one where you can see my entire history of posts. When I first crashed I also posted on the /r/tressless subreddit asking for advice and talking about my symptoms. \n\nIve never met cdnuts or anyone else on any of those sites (although I did talk about buying him a drink if he ever came to my side of the Atlantic) and I do not have any financial ties although I am not sure how to prove that. I think cdnuts himself had ties to a website that sold the herbs but he did disclose that and I never personally bought any from them and he never asked me to. Instead I bought from a variety of sellers in Europe, health food shops and on Amazon.\n\nMy Reddit account is 6 years old and you can trace my comments and posts if you are interested and I encourage you to do the same on the swole source site. \n\nIf there is anything else you can think to ask or proof you would like I will happily supply it if possible. Also here is a link thread in the tressless subreddit where I was talking about my symptoms\n  Thanks for the answers, I appreciate it. No problem man I would be asking the same. Hi Cooper if not too much trouble I have a few more questions.\n\nHow beneficial were the prohormones for you. I have read the forum enough to know that it is by no means necessary but in your experience did it give you a big lift in terms of reaching full recovery?\n\nAlso with carb back loading I will workout most mornings aiming for a 4 day split regime and on arm day I will throw in a hiit sprint but wanted to know if I can still eat carbs in the evening if I lift heavy in the morning (probably half 6 to 7:15)\n\nMany thanks Hey man, thank you for the post.\n\nI am 5 weeks post-fin and experiencing bad anxiety (out of nowhere) and depression. How long did your mental state take to improve?\n\nAppreciated.. Hey, no problem! As I said any info I can give anyone that helps them get better or feel better about their situation I will give and answer as honestly as I possible can.\n\nSo the mental sides can be hard to shake. My understanding is that 5ar plays a part in the production of both GABA and allogpragnanolone in the brain, both of which are important nuerosteriods for feeling at peace. Add to that the scary situation that is PFS and you have a perfect storm for feeling like an anxious mess. Also general suppression of the endocrine system will make you feel depressed anyway and most people coming off fin will have some kind of suppression going on.\n\nSo anyway, real talk. PFS gave me terrible anxiety. The depression lasted about 3-5 months but once I felt myself slightly getting better the depression started to life. It still came back in waves sometimes but it was almost always as a result of the anxiety. The anxiety was harder to shake. Now I suspect that I have always had a low level of undiagnosed anxiety in myself when I look back over my life but fin made it so I would wake up in the middle of the night in panic attacks, it would make me disassociate from my surroundings when I was stressed in social situations. There is no easy fix to that kind of anxiety. I will say that I feel that my GABA corrected itself after about 6-8 months as my sleep improved a lot and I stopped getting crippling health anxiety (seriously I thought I had MS or cancer several times) but I think once you kniw \n that type of terrible anxiety that you must work to get know how to handle it.\n\nI read about a lot of supplements that helped;  theanine, 5a-dhp prohormone, etc, but the only thing that I found helped supplement wise for me was a strong strain of CBD oil. I have been taking it for about a year and it is bought my baseline anxiety levels right down. The other things that have helped massively are therapy and meditation. I also had to quit coffee as I could not handle it anymore. CDNuts actually recommends coffee but my anxiety wouldnt allow it.\n\nI am not sure of your other symptoms but anxiety stands in the way of getting better as it is basically a stress that can cause havoc with the body at the best of times. I strongly suggest being proactive in addressing it as  the act of knowing you are doing something about it is soothing in itself.  There were times when I was having a panic attack in my head during meetings with clients to the point that I would completely disassociate from what was going on and not be able to follow the conversation so if I can get better you can. Maybe it will get better on it is own but I think the stuff I have mentioned will help anyone PFS and be good for mental health regardless and meditation is free and life changing if done consistently.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. Hey everyone, I was just about to go to the doc and have finasterid prescribed because in my case, I just look at my hair getting thinner on top of my head in the last years, I am just above forty so nothing unusual, it is just that I googled what I can do against it, came across finasterid, and it sound good: stops your hair loss, some will even get back, minor losses in libido but I might be ok with that.\n\nNow I thought \"let us google some more\" and the idea was born to reddit it instead (if you google something to search it in google, I think you can reddit something to search it here). I came here. And I am shocked. So many questions...\n\n1. did you all take it because of hair loss?\n2. how old are you?\n3. how long did you take it? (this and the next are answered by copper, but maybe some other want to share)\n4. Why did you decide to stop?\n5. Are those side effects rare?\n6. What else do I need to know? (maybe help me with one or two abbrev.) I am quite shocked but might not be shocked enough to not take it. Or am I? Do not know... do not take it. it is not worth it. does not even matter if PFS is real or not. it is not worth it. Thanks so much for sharing and all the information.  I would really appreciate any tips on how you cycle the supplements you listed, do you take all those daily?  The adaptogens and vitamins everyday?  Or take breaks, alternate days, etc.  Any specifics would be helpful.  Do you notice effectiveness change over time or do you feel each one contributes to managing your symptoms?  I have taken Rhodiola and Cordyceps in the past, but did not notice anything.\n\nWhat do you think Creatine does for PFS symptoms?  I lift weights and do resistance exercise often, but I know Creatine can be hard on the gut from what I have read.  It draws more water to muscles, so you have to drink a lot more water apparently.  Does it help with boosting hormones, help sex drive?  Just wondering.\n\nRight now, I am on a GNC Sport multivitamin (has zinc and all basics), Iron, Probiotic, Fish Oils, Vitamin D-- Tribulus and BCAAs on days I lift weights/exercise.  At night I take 5HTP (supposedly boosts serotonin), Magnesium Citrate, and GABA calm supplement (with Glycine, Taurine and Tyrosine).  \n\nI have had PFS since 2011.  Exercise and diet have been key for me in terms of management.  Also, sun exposure is key.  Shirt being off in the sun for an hour a day if possible.  Living near the coast in a warmer climate would be ideal as well.  I wonder if anyone else here developed seasonal affective disorder with PFS?  Never experienced that type of depression before from December through March as I am in the Northeast, US.\n\nMy main issues are still nervous system based, feel heart beating at all times, fight/flight, some days wake up feeling totally depleted, fatigue, irritable, moody.  Digestion still is changed.  And the sexual dysfunction remains, pelvic floor dysfunction, no nocturnal/morning erections, less desire/motivation.  Depression I try to manage through daily exercise.  Nothing has helped me more for PFS than exercise and sunlight, eating super foods, basically Paleo/Mediterranean style though little red meat, mostly seafood, vegetables, fruits, eggs, nuts, and sweet potatoes.  Recently, I have tried intermittent fasting (eating in an 8 hour span) because I heard it helps boost growth hormone.  Notice I am leaner so far, not sure if that is advisable for PFS or not?\n\nAnother thing for anyone reading, to help dopamine and metabolic rate-- heat and cold.  From what I know, cold water immersion, cold showers, ice baths and then sauna heat, or red light therapy some find success with (the sun is still better though).  And grounding, bare feet on the earth, grass, sand for any time you can during the day.  Do not underestimate these things, may think they sound hokey but if consistent, you will notice benefits in how you feel.\n\nI notice whenever I have been near an ocean for several days, my nervous systems issues lessen and I am the most relaxed I have been in years.  I also notice my libido is stronger after a day in the sun or on a beach.\n\nThanks again for sharing.  If anyone needs to, I am also available to talk.  I remember the hell of when I had no idea what was happening to my body years ago.  This has changed the foundation of who I am and my life entirely.  Through lifestyle changes and consistency, I do feel this is manageable, not completely curable (in my case), but managed through diligence. Hello thanks a lot! Can i ask that did you have these following symptoms if so did they resolved 100%?\n\n- Erect penis size loss\n- Numb orgasms\n- Sensivity loss\n- Low and watery semen \n- Facial changes\n- Penis bend and curvature Hey what supplements you use? Hello sir could you please tell me how long it took for complete sexual recovery and what symptoms lasted longest/hardest to go away ?", "Severe skin rashes from finasteride at 2 month mark ", "Took 0.5 mg Finasteride for 20 days. Now, facing issues with libido, Watery semen &amp; erections!! Hi Guys! I am new to this sub.\n\nI am 27 M. I asked my doctor to prescribe Finasteride about 20 days ago. I cut pill in half and started taking 0.5 mg dose. In 2-3 days, I started having wet dreams. I did not experience erection issue in first 2 weeks. Now, I am not sure why I am not feeling very hard in these 2-3 days. I have stopped taking pills now. No matter how good this medicine is for hair loss, I would never compromise it on my strength.\n\nSo, I just wanted to ask the people in this forum, is this psychological issue with me or should I wait for 2-3 weeks to see my condition get improved?  I had read side effects before taking pills, but thought let us give it a try and see. I am also applying Topical Minoxidil on head, but I do not think this is happening due to Minox.\n\nAnyway, please share your experience and thoughts on this.\n\nThanks. It is probably not psychological.\n\nThere is no treatment for these symptoms. The best bet may be to just avoid supplements and prescription drugs, live healthy, and wait.

Wondering if this has happened to anyone else, I went to get bloodwork done and all my labs have come back in the normal range. Yet I still have been feeling the effects after 5 years, not getting aroused easily and libido remains low. Wonder if there is anything people like me can do in this situation, doctors do not really want prescribe me anything because everything comes back normal on my tests. I feel for you. How long did you take finasteride for? I took it for 4 months. Did a bloodtest 5 weeks after quitting and everything came back in normal ranges. So yes, I had it too. My suspicion is that the androgen receptors and neurotransmitters are damaged. The HPA Axis needs to rebuilt and the molecules in our brains.  There does not seem to be any \u2018signature\u2019 of PFS in conventional blood tests. As another commenter wrote, the issue could be with receptors or perhaps gene expression. Have you improved at all in these 5 years or do you feel the same?

For a total of 4 months I took 0.3mg a day from Januari 20th until May 20th. Even though I have seen major improvements from just after quitting I still live with side-effects. My vision is blurry, as if its refreshes like a monitor. Does anyone recognize this? Will it ever go away? Libido is better, but not how it used to be. Deep depressive thoughts still hit me sometimes outta nowhere. Man, this drug is devastating. I have been taking benzodiazepines to calm my anxiety down. My anxiety is still super high. I have been taking supplements like Ashwagandha, Rhodiala Rosea and amino acids. It is a long road. How is this titled 'recovery story' ? It is super tough dude, I have been in your shoes. Even years later i still have side effects. Start taking vitamin D and chlorophyll and just add it to your daily regimen, also drink licorice root powder it helped me a lot. Obviously do your research before taking anything else but it does help. You need to start lifting heavy weights and getting into a workout regimen and I would also take creatine with it. You need to just accept the hair loss and move on it is not worth anymore pain or bullshit. I wish you luck, just meditate and keep researching it will get better that is what im saying Did you stop because of the side effects or because you just wanted to stop? Sorry, wrong title. Stop due to severe sides. what were they , im basically retarded now because of the drug , severe cognitive side , and impotence , i have troubel speaking and seing the word in my head and articulating them , i feel depersonalize all the time and not in control, mad anxiety Maybe quit?

I believe it has something to do with altered neurosteroids levels especially allopregnanolone. Does anyone else have any opinions on this?

How long have you been off fin? It can take a few months for the anxiety to go away.\n\nSome people (like me) have less anxiety post fin, than pre.\n\nBut I had severe anxiety while I was still on it. So severe I could not even open the door when my dad came knocking. What was ur anxiety like? Afraid of something bad happening? Cuz that is exactly what it is like for me. Also i have been off for three months. Alot better than before but still worried amd anxious I have been off it nearly a year now and my libido has completely crashed. Stopped getting morning wood and even struggling to stay hard with viagra. Doctors keep saying everything looks normal so I am freaking out. Was seeing a girl recently but it ended because I could not get it up Well at least youre not suffering psychological sides! My anxiety is terrible but i have morning wood Me, too. I quit in Nov 2020 after taking it for 6 months and now my libido's non-existent. Any anxiety? Well I have anxiety about the fact that my dick is dead. That is bad enough as it is I took it for less than a month in November 2020. Hard to tell due to lockdown but I feel like my libido has gradually gone down and down to now where it is just completely dead. Terrifying tbh. I keep going on dates but deep down know that things will not go any further unless I can sort this out. No, the mental sides subsided after 2 weeks of stopping Finasteride on Nov 13, 2020.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that I was also on 25mg Clomipramine meanwhile which I have been taking for 7 yrs to treat OCD and Depression (quitted on April 1, 2021).\n\nLast week, however, I experienced the crash which people talk about for the first time after taking two 50mg doses of Clomid every other day.\n\nIt is apparently a sudden drop in Testosterone, LH, and FSH hormones with Estrogen rising simultaneously. To clarify, I experienced a sudden, temporary surge in my energy and mental sharpness while on Clomid, only for it to reverse 2 days later (aka the crash).\n\nConsequently, I am now experiencing an unprecedented fatigue, depression, and brain fog which I hope will resolve once Clomid clears out of my system. Update: I have been fasting for 6 days so far (no drink or food from 3AM till 5PM) and am feeling mentally great. \n\nFasting, indeed, helps with energy and vitality, mental clatity and sharpness, anxiety, etc.\n\nThat said, I have not yet seen any sexual improvements.\n\nNumerous studies have been documented on how fasting rebalances hormones, reduces inflammation, and kickstarts a healing process (i.e. autophagy).\n\nMany religions advocate for fasting as a therapy.\n\nIn my religion, there is a saying, \"Fast, heal.\" Sorry just saw your comment, Alby. I have posted my update below.

Story and advice Firstly, I want to just thank this subreddit for giving me tips on this awful condition we all suffer with when I was at my absolute lowest. This is my story so far and this is purely to spread hope for everyone.\n\nTo begin, I am an 18 year old who is confidence almost nearly all comes from my looks, never even felt like I struggled much mentally either. Once I noticed some hair loss at just 17 years old it was not long after that I hopped on the pill in June. I previously made a post about two months ago on some issues that may have seemed like PFS but I was not sure yet, asking if I should continue the pill or not and curious on everyone else\u2019s experience. It was around this time my anxiety started to skyrocket And I started to drive myself crazy on what was going on with my health, mentally and physically.\n\nI decided to stop the pill but ALL major sides rolled in after stopping fin for only a few days. I was left with crippling anxiety, little to no motivation for anything in life, ED, digestive issues, lightheadedness, strong cognitive issues that left me feeling like a literal dumbass, insomnia to the point where I would wake up 5+ times a night shaking uncontrollably and constant depressive thoughts. \n\nI could not escape the god awful thoughts on how a pill ruined a young bright kid who just wanted to stop hair loss. I felt screwed for life and could not get out of my own head. Most of all I lost all inner-confidence. It truly made me feel hopeless that most people did not think PFS was real and I had no one and no where to go but this subreddit. Whatever help I had would have had to be on my own but it was just that which kept me going and which gives me hope for everyone.\n\nAs hard as it was for me, I knew that changes had to happen for me to even be close to normal again. It is been almost a month since I have checked out the subreddit and I cannot stress this enough but as \u201ctypical\u201d as it may sound, but I truly believe that if you struggle with PFS you need to get out of your head and get off of the internet. If it was not for me doing this I probably would be where I was a month ago still. Trust me that this was no easy task but patience and discipline is also important. The anxiety may cycle you into a never ending loop of hopelessness but you have to break that loop. Accept that you are struggling but continue to have hope, if you do not try to make a change then nothings going to happen. I cannot stress enough that CONFIDENCE is KEY.\n\nThere is a multitude of posts I read on how others recovered and I came to the conclusion that lifestyle changes, vitamins/supplements and working out can and should all help. Once again, these things cannot happen unless you put the effort into it guys and believe me I know how hard it may sound.\n\nIn specifics, I put more effort towards school, got a new job, stopped smoking weed temporarily, workout at least 3 times a week and even do Kegel exercises from time to time. I started using Magnesium Citrate, Ashwaghanda Vitamins and Chamomile Tea for now but there are many other options for you to explore for what works best for you. This post helped me a lot.\n\nI still do struggle with the depressive thoughts and some anxiety but I am much better at maintaining it then I was before. Once again I want to mention that being confident in yourself is key and I feel like this awful drug has depleted all of our confidence but believing that things can and will get better works wonders. Things are shaping up to be great and I want the best for everyone else as well.", "I have PFS induced hard flaccid/long flaccid  \n\nHey guys, I am coming here and posting my story  since other places have not been very helpful besides hf forum. I realize I was reckless,  and thought I could manage all these hormones because some youtube  biohackers do it (mainly MPMD/ leo longevity). These guys take every  drugs under the sun and promote a lot of drugs without mentioning the  real risks. Anyways, my story is below, and I thank you for reading  through and posting any thoughts or ideas as to what may have occurred,  and what is occurring now. This will go through in chronological order  of events.\n\nMid March (2021) begin trt 200mg/week split in 2 doses initially,  erection quality worsened by late March, 100% pre TRT erections went to  80%, but penis still functioned normally, just felt less inflated. Now I  did not panic because naturally we all think \u2018well its just E2 must be  high\u2019. If I knew what would happen in the months ahead, I would have  stopped right here.\n\nUsed HCG late March when balls started to shrink, erections go from  80% to 85%. Used protocol of 250iu eod to start. I found days of no hcg  softer erections than the day I used hcg, especially a few hours after.  This was a \u2018restoring libido to favorable ranges\u2019 protocol by Vigorous  steve. Because of the initial improvements in EQ from hcg, i continued  the cycle and didnt think much of the softer erections.\n\nApril 10 start Ru58841 50mg/day on scalp. No issues, still 85%  erections. MPMD pushing ru as a good hairloss prevention drug. I thought  why not, and got from the source he pushes (anigenic). I did not notice  any issues with erections changing at all. Maybe this played a part  slowly over time or maybe it had no effect, but its hard to tell at this  point.\n\nMay 4 donate blood 450ml. I was feeling sluggish, and had a nose  bleed in my sleep that was  thick as hell. When i bleed its usually not  close to that thick. The donation center said my hemoglobin is 16.9, so  hematocrit would be close to 51-, maybe higher if I was dehydrated?  Immediately after blood gone, I felt less sluggish and more light.  Erections still about 80-85%.\n\nMay 16, I decide to use 1mg topical dut since MPMD has a video about  the molecular weight of dutasteride being over 500 daltons, meaning it  would not go systemic in a topical application\u2026 Boy was this a huge  mistake on my part to listen to these guys just because they think they  are smart. May 24 use 1mg topical dut for the final time. Following day  felt itchy nipples, gyno symptoms, took first aromasin dose 12.5mg as a  precaution, next day had a lump form overnight at breast area. Stopped  the topical dut after 2 weeks and stopped the ai use after that one  preventative dose from the gyno flare up. A few days in during week 2  after 2nd dose of Dut and ai dose, erections were at 0%. I had orgasmed  while fully soft. I believe due to the dut\u2026\n\nJune 1 - June 16 erection quality recovered back to 70/80%. I used  Leo, Steve protocol for hcg heavy use\u2026 2kiu eod for a couple weeks. Saw  some return to life in my penis. I had sex  afew times with girls here,  but penis went soft often inside of them even with 20mg cialis.\n\nJune 17 woke up with burning urethra towards the base of the  spongeosum during urination. Suspected Std, booked appointment for June  24 with Dr. The burning urine feeling was only once per day in the  morning, and was not as bad if I drank a lot of water prior to bed.\n\nJune 30 tests come negative, July 10 more negative tests, urinalysis  shows everything normal, no culture growth in urine. Experimented with  pt141 to get erections better, but still 80% and no random erections  /hit or miss morning wood. Noticing I can only get hard with stimulation  and weaker erections while standing.\n\nJuly 15+, burning urethra now also paired with itchy urethra for rest of the day. this persisted into august.\n\nJuly 27 stop enanthate pins because I am planning to come off  everything to PCT and just get my dick back to functioning. No mental  panic has set in yet, as I still think this is an E2 issue and I just am  not dialed in correctly. I also stop RU and minoxidil around this time  as I am getting tired of daily application of hair topicals.\n\nAugust 2 start propionate 20mg/day. I do this to bridge the gap while  I wait for enanthate to clear. My erections actually 2 hours after  pinning prop went to 100%\u2026 I had the strongest boners in months, and it  lasted 4 days then disappeared entirely\u2026\n\nAugust 24, took prostate digital exam, Dr thinks it is normal. PSA  levels low. Blood work shows e2 at 59pg/ml. Took AI aromasin 12.5mg eod  for 10 days. By end of 10 days, erections disappeared. Weak morning  woods. It is like my penis trying to get hard but cannot.also notice long  and skinny penis, girth has been lost by e2 crashing or Dut fibrosis\u2026,  is a side effect I read on e2 handbook steroid subreddit.\n\nLate August to early September, take 2kiu hcg eod again after the AI  probably nuked my e2. Did not have the recovery relief like I did after  dut use. Penis is weak as fuck, morning woods are pathetic\u2026 i can feel  its trying to innervate down there but isnt getting stiff at all.\n\nSeptember 1, quit trt and bridge remaining days to pct with hcg  because I am tired of poor erections, and burning urethra feeling. Have  blood tests, free T middle of range, e2 sensitive was 19pg/ml. Prolactin  13ug/L. My erections issues are not e2 related at all. This is more  complex. Even behaviour of the penis is very off. The prostatitis  symptoms continue (itchy urethra, very intense)\n\nMid September, have intense burning pain in penis, perinium, and  scrotal ceiling when pressing, and difficulty urinating. Feeling of  aching penis constantly, like it had been stretched inside. Feeling of  having to urinate, but unable to\u2026 Sitting on toilet for 5-10 minutes and  eventually drops of pee come out and relief comes briefly, then feeling  returns. Warm baths help to pee out. Start pct September 20.  40/40/20/20/10 nolva 25/25/25/25/12.5 enclomiphene\n\nOctober 7 Dr gives doxycycline for 2 weeks, theorizing prostatitis.  By week 1 end, most pain gone. By 2nd week all symptoms of penile pain  and perinium, urinary issues gone. Only 1 urine issue is weak stream, to  this day still weak stream sometimes. I also am unable to tell if my  bladder is 20% full or 80% full, as it feels the exact same. Only at  90%+ fullness I know that I have to pee, as my bladder has a sharp  pressure feeling like I have to release\u2026 this is not how my bladder used  to feel when I was ready to piss.\n\nAfter the antibiotics course, I Developed hard flaccid syndrome  around this time, but morning woods are sometimes 80% or 90%, or 40%,  random and cannot predict what is going on with them. Sometimes wake up at  4am with stiff penis, sometimes bendy. Penis can fill with blood but is  soft and long flaccid a lot of the times and just rests on my thigh.  Neurogenic /psychogenic erections are very strange, they get to long  flaccid state then stuck there, need stimulation to get harder. I notice  erections go away when standing unless I am already as hard as I can  from stimulation lying down. I never get hard walking or moving around  like I did before starting trt. I go soft fast when I get distracted,  and do not feel arousal as much\n\nPenis feels disconnected from my brain. Lifeless. I cannot tell when I  have a erection like before. It feels weak, I used to have throbbing  hard erections and pulsing feelings but it is entirely gone.Penis  constantly feels tense and hard like a flexed bicep when flaccid or long  flaccid, but no rigidity. This is in hard small flaccid mode also  during long flaccid it feels tight and weak. Like a floppy worm that  cannot get harder. After ejaculation, the penis goes from 70-90% hard to  long flaccid mode, where it stays like that for a very long period of  time like 5+ minutes. Detumescence feels very strange, long flaccid. I  theorized my issue is fake testosterone was maybe Decca, and hence Decca  dick but no ability to hplc test for the compounds in the vials I was  using. If deca, then some guys had ed for 6+ years after stopping using  Decca as I have read from this forum from ( and ( and (  posts. I had a ultrasound for pelvic region and urinary tract recently, and hope to have results soon from my uro.\n\nAT this point, i feel small improvements then waves back to square 1\u2026  so it is hard to gauge what is going on. I still do not know what caused  the prostatitis symptoms for me\u2026 why did i have a loss of erection  quality immediately after starting TRT, last time I used Test was  500/week 10 years ago and I got erections constantly from it\u2026 note I was  19 then, and 30 now. I know the TRT initially did something to me to  lose EQ, then everything else after was just like extra bombs on my  dick. Dut/ RU/ AI  etc. I thought I was managing symptoms with  ancillaries, but It was reckless of me.\n\nCurious why the prostatitis related pain and inflammation disappeared  after doxycycline, was it bacterial infection causing the pain? It is  been 4 weeks since the last dose and pain did not return. Is it different  than what is causing the ED or maybe it is compounding the ED problem?  All I have left are the hard flaccid and long flaccid symptoms which I  described earlier.\n\nMy blood work is very good except poor egfr /creatinine (at 114  creatinine and 73 egfr) ferritin very low, below referent e range. Lh  and fsh at 0. I am finished Pct drugs now, and penis have no more pain  which is good, but stuck with hard flaccids and long flaccids and hit or  miss erection quality, and disconnect feeling from penis. My T is  1100ng/dl , so i guess some PCT drugs are still acting on my brain.\n\nI fear I have post dutasteride syndrome, or if not, then my test was  decca or something and just picks up as test when I got bloods\u2026 because  here we dont do sensitive test, just CLIA testing\u2026 so decca will be  interpreted as Test i think. Anyways, I dont know what is going on with  me\u2026 i just hope some people can point me in a direction as I am  considering a penile implant soon if this does not improve in 6 months to  a year. MY life has been very destroyed over this, as I was a highly  sexual person and now with this problem I do not feel like myself  anymore. I feel like a 80 year old man ready for death. I want to come  out of this shit and be normal. The story of Ztanzanite 6 years healing  from decca dick put real fear in my head and I am worried my test was  decca\u2026 or dutastierde will cause the same for me.\n\nTests I have planned are - PENILE DOPPLER with inject to check for  arterial insufficiency or venos leaks\u2026  MRI standing with and without  contrast with focus at the pudendal nerve and dorsal branch of the  penis. The theory here is that hard flaccid is caused by pudendal nerve  compression. You see maybe when I started TRT my pelvic floor tightened  up and started to give ED, and months down the road it led to the lower  urinary tract symptoms and prostatitis symptoms.  Other tests would be a  MRI of the penis to cehck for fibrosis caused by DUT or RU, as that  would explain why it feels like my penis doesnt inflate very well with  blood anymore, and blood gets stuck in there. Other tests,  pharmacoangiogram to cehck arteries, venogram to check veins, MRI of  lumbar/sacral plexus to see innervation of the nerves that control  pelvic functions\u2026 SPINAL TAP to check for neurosteroids, as this problem  seems to be very neorlogical , because of the mental symptoms and lack  of arousal etc. These are the main tests I can think of for now, as well  as MRN but this is a rare one and only in USA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy research on the hard flaccid subject, CPPS, and PFS/PSSD/ decca dick/ PAS at various boards like propeciahelp, reddit, raypeat forum, tnation, phalloboard, pegym has led me to seeing the crossovers in all these syndromes. Many shared symptoms like shrunken penis, pain, bladder issues, psychological issues, energy issues, desensitized glands, cold glands, etc. So many symptoms are common in these disorders that I am going crazy trying to make connections and find leads and things that can help... so far I have a bunch of drugs and things that maybe could help but need to be experimented, sourced, and purchased....\n\nApremilast\n\nmethylprednisolone\n\nsodium butyrate\n\nallopreg\n\nprogesterone\n\nlow dose naltrexone\n\nhcg 250iu MWF \n\nsarcosine/glycine\n\nthis is by no means comprehensive list of things that helped people get through their conditions... if anyone else like to contribute with their story please do so!\n\nThank you for your time and let me know what you think is going on. I know it is a long post, but I am desperate for some help and maybe with combined knowledge of the various communities we can get some sort of understanding to what is happening with our bodies. &gt; After ejaculation, the penis goes from 70-90% hard to long flaccid mode, where it stays like that for a very long period of time like 5+ minutes.\n\nI still have this too, it is super weird. One of the only symptoms that has not gotten better with time. when in that state, does it feel uncomfortable? for me it does. It is like a long overextended flaccid that is engorged with blood, and the blood , but the texture and shape of my penis in that state seems off. like its too geometrical and not really operating fluidly like before Oh wow, no that is not like mine at all. It is not uncomfortable or engorged, just long, thin, and hourglass shaped. Does it feel detached from your body, or not part of you? That is what I am feeling with mine Nope, I can feel it. I have heard that reported by many sufferers though.", "Role of 5ar in hormones conversion and other exogenous influence  Hi guys, \n\nHere is a chart that can help all of us to solve our issue. \n\nI order the \"Dutch test Complete Plus\" and will do it soon, I need to go off my beta blocker first. \n\nYou can see in the map where 5ar is involved and how we could have f\\*\\*\\* up some enzyme cascade due to long-term inhibition. \n\nDoing the test will highlight if there is some imbalance down the road where 5ar have been implicated.  What do you consider long therm? Months or years Man I wish I had gotten information like this before starting fin. If I knew how much affect it could have on your body I never would have tried it.\n\nLive and learn. Yes that is why is important to get a full baseline before starting. You can still do a Dutch test complete plus and see what is going on. You will be able to spot imbalances You dont start, ever. Why take fin, you need DHT I was not encouraging to do so, but if we are here it is because we start it. I am suffering from finasteride side effects. What side effects did you experience? How long were you taking finasteride? Thanks for any info.", "I recovered from PFS, it is possible. I took 1mg of Finasteride daily for 8 months (after 2 months at 0.5mg) and it was effective at restoring the crown. That said, I had some severe side effects and once I realized that they were due to Fin, I stopped taking it immediately and some symptoms improved. I went down the online rabbit hole and read everything about PFS available - these few weeks were very dark and I felt absolutely hopeless. But what I also realized is that people rarely come back to these subreddits with their success stories so here goes. Here are most of the side effects I had, for reference.\n\nSexual side effects: Loss of libido, impotence, testicular pain, testicle shrinkage, minor Peyronies (up to 10 degrees), penis pain, watery semen  \nMental: Anxiety, insomnia, cognitive issues / brain fog  \nOther: Issues retaining and producing muscle, rectal muscle pain, spike in lower-abdomen fat, also has anyone noticed a rapid increase in earwax production?\n\nI then found a local specialist on ( and this was a major turning point. At first, lab results showed high prolactin, lower testosterone, and extremely low estrogen. My doctor put me on 5mg daily cialis (+up to 15mg as needed before sex) to promote blood flow, healing, and facilitate erections. My doctor also put me on clomiphene 25mg/daily to increase testosterone and estrogen. Once my testosterone and estrogen were up, we added anastrozole 1mg/week to keep estrogen within normal range. We then added on Addyi to help with insomnia and libido. Yes, this is originally marketed towards women but nearly all testing was done on men and this is medication is non-hormonal - there is no reason why it cannot be just as effective on men. To tackle some of the penile pain and to improve erections, I did shockwave therapy ($3000 for 6 sessions) though this is definitely unnecessary and experimental.\n\nIf I am being completely honest, I am unsure if each of these medications are independently helping but I am not in a position to question the combined effect they have had on me. Within 6 months of beginning medication, my testosterone and estrogen were up, prolactin leveled out, and I was able to have 8 sexual encounters in 1 week with different people - I felt no PFS symptoms whatsoever but did take 10-15mg cialis on top of the 5mg daily before sexual encounters. I suppose I overindulged and was relieved to have everything working. My muscle mass and body fat composition is now normal, my semen thickened, Peyronies stabilized, penis pain subsided, testicular pain is rare though I will occasionally avoid tight underwear or shorts when necessary, cognitive issues are resolved, and overall I think I have bounced back almost entirely. Great to hear you are OK. For how long did you have pfs symptoms before you started treatment? thank you! I has symptoms for about 3 months from onset PFS, though I did have symptoms for a few months while still on Fin I would put Aromatase Inhibitors in the same category as finasteride. Glad you are better but people have been seriously burned by them (search in propeciahelp). Just thought I would share. Definitely. posted there as well What Kind of doctor did you contact? Endocrinologist? How long did you experience symptoms after quitting finasteride?\n\nI am asking because, if you recovered within 6-9 months after quitting, that is a pretty normal recovery time frame, as far as I can tell. You may just have recovered \"naturally\" - meaning - you recovered *despite* taking these drugs, not because of them.\n\nIn any case, thank you for telling your story and congratulations with the recovery! 6-9 months is normal? I thought anything past 6+ is long term.\n\n(I just past the 6 month tineframe) Judging by the protocol, it seems like he went to Dr Goldstein in San Diego. East coast actually, a urologist with a specialty in sexual medicine I would say i improved drastically within 2 months of beginning clomiphene and continued to improve for 3-4 months after And my symptoms only began to improve after medication. In fact some symptoms worsened even after I stopped taking fin (until medication) Would be great if you could just answer this question - how long were you sick?\n\nTo understand the full context of your recovery, it really matters to understand the duration of your side effects. Yea, you are right about that. 0-6 months seems to be a more common trajectory. \u2026. Symptoms came on gradually so I cannot say when they began. I would guess I had symptoms for 3 months while on propecia, 2 months after stopping propecia, and 2-4 months of improving symptoms while on medication. I wish I had documented better but this is the rough schedule I am very glad that you recovered, Zaa4uf!\n\nWould you mind answering a few questions:\n\n1. When did you start and stop Finasteride?\n2. How long past stopping did the symptoms persist?\n3. When did you start treatment and what is the doctor's name?\n\nI have corresponded with Dr. Goldstein and wonder if it was him.\n\nMany thanks in advance. thank you!\n\n1) I took fin for 9 months.\n2) Symtoms improved slightly after stopping and then continued until treatment a couple months later. Symtoms improved somewhat quickly and then continued to until the 4-6 months mark \n3) I was asked not to provide the contact, it is not Dr. Goldstein I have the same symptoms with you and I am begging for answers. What do you think helped the most with your overall penis pain/ numbness? Your hormones as a whole? My dick just feels and looks different. Almost throbbing sensation. Thank you Or would you say time and cialis fixed it the most? Thank you Cialis helped with the erection but the most important piece here was clomiphene to increase my T / E. Have you seen an endocrinologist? I am seeing a urologist this week, I will get bloodwork. They ER talked to one over the phone and concluded it might be cpps, which makes some sense but this was also never an issue pre finasteride. I had an ultra sound and a urine test done but nothing came up\u2026 I am so confused I finally caved and went to the Er today after being in so much pain last night. They found nothing thus far, I thought it was actually getting better but it is gotten bad again recently. Been off of fin for 6 weeks now And did the clom actually help your penis function/ feeling? Like help out feeling back and get rid of throbbing? Thank you so sorry to hear that. Clom helped pretty much everything for me so definitely get that blood work to see what is up Thanks man, appreciate the response One more thing are you on that stuff for life now or you are not sure? Thanks Seeing my endocrinologist in a few months to check and and evaluate. She seems confident that I will not need to be though I have no issues staying on it and none of the medication flagged any long term concerns Awesome, thanks for the responses", "4.5 years on fin thinking of quitting I started taking fin just before my 19th birthday in order to combat minor diffuse thinning. I read all those reports of how 90% of reported side affects are mental so I always tried to tell myself that I would not get any. However, now at age 23 and 4+ years on fin I believe fin may be responsible for my ED and extremely low sex drive. I am an otherwise healthy 23 year old with no interest in sex. Even trying to masturbate is a challenge for me. I know the common sense thing to do is to stop taking fin for a bit but I cannot bring myself to do it. I guess I am wondering what I should expect if I stop taking fin after 4+ years of daily use?\n\nI do not expect my sex drive to just come back right after stopping fin. From reading stories online it seems that after a long period of use fin has already done irreversible damage. I am also really afraid to stop taking it because of hairloss. Fin has maintained my hairloss well and I do not want to give that up. Especially if I quit fin and lose my hair while still experiencing ED\u2026 that would be the worst. Am I crazy for not quitting fin despite these symptoms? Sometimes I think I would be better off with Ed and hair than bald with a sex drive but I do not really know. You have not already done irreversible damage, but the longer you continue fin the greater chance you have for long term side-effects.\n\nIf you do get hit with PFS sides, you will quickly realize how unimportant hairloss is in the grand scheme of things. Source? I took fin for 5 years like you in my 20's...I\"m in my 40;s now...I quit during my 20's as the side effects were too much....ED...loss of libido..Low Testosterone....The damage is irreversable in my case.  I am on T injections and viagra forever.  Trust me, check out hair transplants  and stop the pill.  I rather be bald now and have my sexx life back.  Even on T and viagra, sex aint the same. Damn you still have symptoms 20 years later? Are your symptoms only sexual or do you have other sides as well? I was also curious about how well viagra works for this but that sucks. Well now I am worried\u2026 what pfs sides should I expect other than ED? I already have pretty much no sexual ability. I have not any other symptoms like brain fog though. yes.. I stopped in my mid 20's...Trust me..the symptons get worse as you age.  Some guys can recover over it....but alot of guys the symptons linger......PFS is real.  If it was not Merck wouldnt have settled with thousands of men suffering from it including me... I got a check for $10k ....but i rather give them a million to get my sex life back...If i had it ofcourse....\n\nother symptons besides sexual...insomnia, depression, constipation....mood swings...suicidal thoughs....I can live with most those symptons, but the loss of your manhood makes you want to not live... You should not \"expect\" anything; side effects after cessation are really rare.\n\nYou should probably expect your libido to come back soon after quitting. It is entirety your choice man, you can use minoxidil and get fancy haircuts every month to buy yourself some time since your are still young, that is what I do! Just know that when you get off fin you will get catch-up hair loss and it will affect you if you still care enough about your hair. You can try lowering your daily dose and see what happens, but try to avoid stopping/starting cold turkey multiple times. TBH why are you even here? Just to tell everyone they are just making things up?\n\nAnyway, my source is first hand experience as well as reading about other's stories. I got brain fog. I think you start to realise it after it fucks u up. Like how many people do not realise a lot of diseases until it messes you up e.g. diabetes for example. Have you tried aromatize inhibitors suc as zinc? No I have not. Just fin and minox.  Correct.  It is permanent . Hate my life. Hey man, I just stumbled upon this... but here is what happened with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarted taking Fin @ 21, no problems at all and hair grew back great!\n\nA year later, started noticing watery semen, and softer erections, but who gives a fuck.\n\nI am now 25, I stopped taking Fin completely. At the beginning of the year, I became really depressed, and my dick lost all function. I could not feel it, I mean that seriously. I had no sensation down there at all. I kept taking it. I also entered into this state of derealization that really fucked me up. The only thing I can attribute it to was the fin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI stopped taking the Fin about 1 1/2 month ago, everything seems like it is back to normal. I get spontaneous erections again, no more brain fog, no more bullshit. HOWEVER, I do not know if it was for sure the Fin that caused all this, or maybe I tricked myself into thinking it was. All I know is that everything went back to normal when I stopped. I am deciding on hopping back on Fin again... but I do not know. Your either trolling your really stupid. Take fin again and you will be throwin in hell. Hey shitfeeder,  been using fin for about a year now, past week have experienced an insane amount of brain fog, going to stop taking it today. If you experienced brain fog and you stopped taking fin, how long did it take you to recover and or did you ever recover. Thank you! I am still recovering. It got better once I stopped taking it but some people have been reporting \"crashes\" where the symptoms come back. How long have you been off the fin? Also thanks for the response Not that long but I have been on it for around 8 months", "Quitting finasteride mental side effect concerns after 6 years - 24 years old After a long and exhausting ride I am finally emotionally ready and mature enough to let go of this drug dependance for my appearance.  \nI began using finasteride at 18 and relied on it heavily through my teens and early 20\u2019s. about 18 months ago I underwent what turned out to be an extremely successful FUE transplant of 3200 grafts. Since having to shave my head for the surgery and come clean to all friends and associates about my hair loss I have grown confident enough to embrace my current hair status and start to ease off finasteride as I have also decided I do not want to be using pharmaceutical medication for the duration of my life. \n\nTo the point.. I began easing off the drug and noticing some extreme side effects of brain fog, cloudiness/emptiness mentally. And have since come across a lot of info on Post finasteride syndrome.. \n\nAs the results of studies on PFS are poorly studied and unknown I am reaching out to see, \n\nAre there any users on here that could possibly relate to the mental side effects of (PFS) after discontinuing the use of this drug? Do you have any stories on your journey with coming off this drug and how you recovered mentally after discontinuing..? \n\nIf I had have known more about the potential risks on mental health I dare say I would have reconsidered the use of the medication for the duration and extent I used it. \n\nAny responses are greatly appreciated! Man virtually same story here only less years of usage. 29 years old. Its been a year off fin since my initial crash of the brain fog and emptiness you speak of, and I can say that things have absolutely improved since that point. Practicing a healthier lifestyle has helped myself a ton. I would also beware of taking everything you read online to heart however because PFS effects people in very different ways. Good luck and stay positive!! As for mental effects, I experienced anhedonia and depersonalization for a period after stopping. \n\nThose effects have subsided but I still have low libido and no genital sensitivity seven years after stopping the drug. Formerly had healthy sexuality with zero problems. Thanks heaps mate. Much appreciated! Sorry to hear that.. I am much the same, definitely loss of libido but that was even during the course of using the drug. Regardless I am glad to stop feeding my body with that molecule, road to living a healthier life! Wow, I stopped about a month ago after a year on it and felt exactly what your describing. It has slowly been getting better, but I still feel foggy and \"out of it\" a lot of the time. It got worse for me initially after stopping before it started getting better. Hopefully I can feel back to myself with time. I feel for you! Those side effects are real nasty, I have recently started microdosing psilocybin which has sparked a whole light in me and I have been feeling a tonne better! Yes man, I can relate to a certain extent. I have been using fin since I was 18 and stopped at age 23. It has been 6 months now and I also feel weird in a certain way. However, I am not that sure if it is because of quitting finasteride. I have had a really stressful year and my doctor said I am overstressed. But, this symptoms arrived the day I stopped using the drug. It could be due to extra stress triggered by me worrying about my hairloss again, but it could also be due to a crash in my hormonal system since I have been using it for 5 years. It is hard to say.\n\nI quit the drug because I wanted to experience what it is to live without it, but I only became very stressed out. I have low libido and am a bit foggy in my head. But then again, last year was really stressful for me. Hopefully I will feel like the old me soon. Good luck man!", "Treatment? My issues started only a week ago and I have only found a handful of things that help, such as cold showers. Please only respond to this with things that helped you. - Exercising a few times a week (lifting, walking an hour - nothing super intense)\n- Reducing calorie intake and eating less junk\n- Time Thank you! I greatly appreciate your comment! I am only 20 and just started getting unbearable side effects a week ago. I have been making sure to workout everyday, but my side effects are so bad it is hard. \nHave you felt any of these similar side effects: anxiety, depression, insomnia, paranoia, tremors? No problem. I am familiar with your situation from hearing others' stories, but I did not personally experience any new mental side effects (I am 24 and have had anxiety and depression most of my life - those did not change with finasteride). You may wish to read and post on  for advice with your specific set of symptoms. The active community over there appears to be larger than this subreddit. Just a heads up that that forum can also be a distressing place, especially if you are newly quitting fin. I would avoid it unless the symptoms persist for more than 3 months after quitting DHT blockers. They have a huge memorial page to all the forum members who committed suicide.\n\nEven then, I strongly prefer the Swole Source PFS message board, which is focused on a protocol made by a former PH member. Some PH people think he is a scammer, but I do not think he fakes the many long and detailed recovery threads, or the convos I have had with them. Guys over there do seem to get better over time, including me. I cannot even tell you how life changing it is to not be asexual anymore. I really thought it was gone forever after so long in the dark. Yeah man i know, im having the depression, anhedonia, listlessness and anxiety aswell, its tough. but i guess time heals everything.  \nHonestly; go see friends. as much as you can, and stay away from things such as cafeeine, alcohol, drugs, anything that alters mood, no matter how insignificant Hey legend27, I really agree about your swolesource reference. I have been there for 1 month and its night and day compared to PH. \n\nFor how long have you been on the protocol, and what improvements did you make? Like what were your symptoms pre-protocol vs your symptoms now?\n\nCheers and good on you for redirecting people to a more positive space I do not really want to dive too deep into my details about that on Reddit, but I am doing a lot better and expect to reach 100% in 2021. The gym closures last year made recovery slower than it should have been.\n\nI am glad you are recovering, stick with it and you will reach 100%!\n\nThanks :) I think it is important to steer people to the best place for recovery. PH is so dark and negative most of the time, and they even have a big memorial section for all their members who resorted to suicide because they lost all hope. Way better to steer people to a community that is actually recovering, so I am glad to hear you say that :) Hey sorry didnt want to be too intrusive. I made this account specifically for pfs problems and I forget it is not the case for everyone.\n\nGood to know you are doing better man, keep grinding How long for full recovery ? Especially sexual sides I have not recovered fully. But gradually improving? Yes. Updates? Pretty much the same. Not even slight improvement from start ? I mean the same as a month ago. I have improved significantly from the start, but I am only about 60% recovered. So you got some libido back now ? And you were on it for 2 years right? Yeah.

Yes.", "Website and Twitter account about finasteride, for patients, doctors and researchers Here is an information site about finasteride: (\n\nAbout the syndrome: (\n\nTwitter account: (\n\n\\*\\*\\* Retweet to raise awareness. \\*\\*\\*", "Need some help easing my anxiety - Symptoms post quitting I am a 21 year old male with no history of ed or sexual issues. I was using fin from mid Jan - Mar 20th. I did not have issues getting it up while on fin but after quitting my libido is more or less gone and I have to actively try to get it up. I lose erections very easily now as well. Got some issues with motivation as well but that might be a derivative of the sex issues. From what I have seen talked about this is not pfs but just regular hormone imbalance caused by quitting cold turkey. I am wondering if some people could share similar stories on how they recovered and what I can do / what timeline to expect. I am afraid to start using supplements but I have ordered tribulus. Any advice or anecdotes are welcome. Im in the same boat, you will get a finasteride crash and then it slowly starts getting better from there. Just wait for the crash, it only lasts about a week. How do you know once you have crashed? Man.... you will know when you cannot get out of bed and crippling anxiety and depression floods your body. It is awful man... but if it happens to you push through and it gets better. I think I am definitely there then. It is been tough ngl and to top it off I have covid as well so I am not sure how much of a role that is playing in these thoughts. Is it common for the crash to come like a month after quitting? That is exactly when it happened to me. I quit in DEC due to not getting horny anymore.. Crash happened late january In that time between I had no libido except for 2-3 times of extreme libido for a couple hours. Gotcha, are you feeling better now? I am worried about lasting effects but it seems most people start recovering after their crash. What is weird for me is I did not have libido side effects while on fin I also had no affect on my libido while on fin, except for in December when I realized I was not attracted to anything. Maybe you quit fin right when sexual sides were starting to rise?\n\nAnyway, mentally I am almost 100% recovered; I just cannot concentrate sometimes as well as I used to. Leaps and bounds better than a month or two ago.\n\nSexually I still am pretty terrible. I have had days of progress, but right now I feel almost asexual... It sucks but I have hope I will get better.\n\nCurrent side effects:\n\n-soft penis\n\n-no erections without stimulus\n\n-discolored penis head\n\n-low libido\n\n-unsatifying orgasms\n\n-low penis sensitivity.\n\n\n\nTBH I think all of these are hormone related. They have gotten slowly better so hopefully my proper hormones kick in in the coming months. Gotcha, thanks for letting me know what I am going through is normal I really appreciate it. Very well could have been that I quit when sexual sides started but it has definitely gotten worse if that is the case because I did not even notice it on fin. I am glad to hear you are getting better too, I have seen a lot of people mention using testosterone supplements so if I do not see results around the three month mark I imagine I will do the same. I have the loss of sensitivity and low libido as well. Best of luck on your recovery, and thanks again for sharing with me No problem! Hopefully your recovery is quicker than mine has been.\n\nI am not planning any drugs/supplements until the 6 month mark if I do not feel better. I am scared of trying to intervene too soon.\n\nAlso, be careful posting anything about this on /r/tressless or other hairloss forums. Some assholes will attack you for trying to warn others about this drug's danger. It is honestly sickening. Thank you! I am very new to this sub and I did not know anything about these issues to begin with so I am not sure what to expect timeline wise at all haha. \n\nThat is valid, our bodies should be able to regulate themselves so I see why you would be worried about intervening, it could just make things worse.\n\nNever been on that sub but I appreciate the heads up. Be careful with adding testosterone because adding it artificially wil mean your body cannot control the amount and then becomes reliant on it Recovery will  mosy likely begin after as long as you took it, so in your case, give it at least 3 months, and dont expect an immeditate recovery. Do the stuff you always enjoyed, even though you dont really enjoy them now. Be kind to yourself, and always remember; you will most likely be fine Good to know thank you Needed to hear this thank you. It is been hard to find motivation to play video games lately which is hilarious. I have classes starting up in a few weeks so I am hoping I will have focus for that How long for sexual sides to fully clear ? about 14 months How long did you take fin and was libido what took longest to come back and is it 100% now like how it was pre fin ?

I took 3 100mg doses of Fin on the 12th, 14th and 17th of May 2021. On Monday the 17th I noticed a bad headache and confusion as well as not being able to get an erection as easily as usual. I panicked and stopped the Fin cold turkey that day. Over the next week my ereftions returned to normal and I was getting morning wood and the headaches got less and less worse.\n\nHowever on June 1st about 2 weeks after stopping I got groin pain that felt like it was burning and also a numb/ache in my right tescticle and it is much harder to achieve an erection. I also have an awful headache and \u2018brain fog\u2019 and my heart is beating extremely quickly. \n\nBecause these symptoms came on weeks after stopping are they more likely to be PFS? Or does my body just need to get back to a normal hormonal level over time? \nAny help is much appreciated Just cheking that the 100mg is a typo. Thank you! I edited it was 3 doses of 1mg Sounds more in the PFS domain. People often say you go through a hormonal roller coaster afger stopping fin. Let your body go back to baseline, this will most likely be transitory. Best of luck! What is the baseline? Thank you for the reply! If you think it is in the PFS domain is not it more likely to be \u2018permanent\u2019 than transitory as you say? It is disheartening to think that I could have PFS after 3 doses I meant more like it is not on the regular fin user's experience. Sides appearing or worsening after stopping fin is not regular. I think that people with more rare cases come together under the PFS name. Does not mean it has to be permanent. Normally it os thought fin's side can last until around 3 months and is still considered normal. You will be fine, relaxing will surely help. Ah I understand what you mean now! I did not mean to be rude sorry, your reassurance is really appreciated thank you! How are you now? Hi, this has only just started. I crashed on Tuesday 2nd of June and that day my groin pain was unbearable. This has gotten a better actually and is now just a pain in the right testicle. My heart has slowed down a bit but not normal rate, but my headache and brainfog are sadly the same. I am sure it is too soon to tell if any of the improvements were just ebs and flows or not but I will keep updated. How are you doing? Has your brainfog improved at all? The brainfog yes, I can think more clearly but the headaches are worse if that makes any sense. How are you? Well this is only my 2nd day off fin so I do not expect to see any improvement in my brainfog. The only symptom I have noticed from fin has really only been severe brainfog, no headaches, no noticeable loss in labito. A lot of people have said their brainfog disappears once they have been off fin for a while and that makes me really hopeful. I am also really praying my brainfog is caused by fin because if it is not I am not sure what I would do. Also did your brainfog completely disappear or do you still notice it/ or does it come back?", "Can finasteride save me? Hey guys, so I am 23 now, pretty healthy, fit.

Although my hairline are not that bad, or it was not (may actually be kind of bad rn considering my age and the fact NOBODY in my family has hairloss - my dad actually has better hairline than me at age of 60 and my 85yo grandpa even tho he has hairloss, he is just a touch worse than me.....). Here are the pics of my hair/hairline from 2016, where I think I probably already had a very slight hairline recession (when I compare to a pic from 2014 that I cannot find anywhere right now lol) pic from 2017 or 2018 and pic from today 6th of september 2021. I also tried to mark where I think my hairline moved year by year (green lines) from age of 17/18 (marked with the red line).

I am taking a two week break, but then as long as my libido stays up I am going to keep taking it.

Do not take this medication. It is not safe. But how long until sides showed up for you? 3.5 years Yup.

Suddenly after 17 months after i took first pill, feeling weird in my balls. into days of 3 morning wood gone and never feel the same about my dink I do not feel weird at all, just sudden loss of some sex drive When did that happen?

Do not worry about it. If in a month it is still ongoing then come hit us up for advice.\n\nYour lowered appetite is being caused by anxiety. PFS does not cause lowered appetite directly but the anxiety of getting such extreme symptoms mixed with the fear of them lasting a long time does cause this. Particularly at the start. Try to take it easy. Finasteride side effects can be awful, but finding ways to de-stress is an important part of getting over them.\n\nThe symptoms are probably not going to go away in a week.

What would be the best course?!! thanks for the comments - have basically been loading myself with water, vitamins and fruit so I will see how I get on. You are welcome. Thank you for everybody here reassurance means so much right now. I have all the symptoms you guys mentioned. I only been taking a 1/12th of a pill every 3 days for 2 weeks now. And I noticed I got more emotional , agitated, depressed. Slightly lower libido . And the worst one. I feel like I have not slept in 2 days. That is why I am stopping. I started getting so much anxiety this morning thinking that I should not of taken the pill. Legit midst of panic. I really hope after a few days I can sleep again.  I can def see why ppl get suicidal on fin. Sleep deprivation alone on fin made me really hate my life. I took fin a year ago at a higher dosages 1mg every other day I quit cause the watery sperm. Lowered libido, an my orgasms were non existent. I was scared it was permanent back then. After 2 months I fully recovered only to continue losing a lot of hair , making me question if I should go on a lower dose.  After going thru that hell last time I told myself I would never take it again and I would rather just go bald.. but I clearly cannot accept the faite of balding. I hope this passes I need sleep I have only had a few days of symptoms, however my advice so far would be to avoid this subreddit  as much as possible  and try to relax. I do think I have noticed some mild improvements already, and my anxiety has massively reduced.

I did some research, and I think the reason people have problems is that they do not have enough free testosterone or too high of estrogen, so the drug pushes it over and you get reproductive problems. Have you got your hormones checked out? If it was that easy, you really think PFS would still be a mystery?\n\nYeah I have. Normal T, high free T and low/medium estrogen.\n\nIt did however show double the range of both progesterone and prolactin. But not even the best endocrinologist can tell me why or what to do about it. You sure it was those hormones that caused issues specifically? I will look at those too. No, all I know these 2 are the only ones \"out of range\".\n\nAs I said, low/mid estrogen, middle total T and high free T/low SHBG.", "What was your dosage and how long did you take it for? I am curious to see what the dosage ranges for this subreddit are. 1mg/day. 1mg per day for 6 months  1mg for 5 days 1mg 1 year 0.5 mg one time. 8 days since the lobotomy", "Partial Recovery + Lingering Symptoms I was taking finasteride for only 2 months, 1 mg pill every other day. For some reason I forget, I stopped taking them for about 3 months, had no symptoms at that point. Foolishly I started up again when I noticed my hair was still thinning. \n\nAfter about a month I noticed I had gone a week without getting an erection and my sex drive was completely gone, I felt numb down there and my dick was shriveled. I obviously discontiued the Fin and started looking up treatment. I got Bloodwork done and my testosterone levels were around 640 and I had elevated estradiol levels (41) normal range is 0-40 for men. Also, my cortisol levels were normal. My doctor, as Im sure you have all experienced, was abosolutely no help and said that due to the test results, he didnt see anything wrong with me and just prescibed me Cialis (Fucking Quack)\n\nSo I started browsing this reddit and someone suggested using **DIM (Diindolylmethane)  to manage estrogen levels, as well as copious amounts of Vitamin D (at least 5000 iu pills) and Tribulus pills**. **Also Gorilla Mind's Nitric Oxide Drink Mix** ( **#NOTANAD (Im not sure how much this helped as Ive only used it a handful of times but apparently raising nitric oxide levels is supposed to help)** At this point I was also gaining excess weight on my stomach and butt despite eating much healthier than I had before and doing cardio and weight training every day (Ive always had a soft body, womanly features wide hips and a big butt, I may have Kleinfelters Ive never been tested). The weight gain Is still a big problem for me **but after about 3 weeks of supplement use and daily exercise, my erections are completely back to baseline and then some. I attribute a majority of this progress to the tribulus. You can actually felt it working immediately after taking the pill, your libido ramps up exponentially.** Still trying to find a solution to the abnormal weight gain but now I feel like Im rambling, I hope this information helps some of you and please let me know if you have questions OR if you have a suggestion for my weight gain.\n\nStay strong everyone, this is temporary. \n\n#", "Horrible guy pain? For the past 4 days I have had bad gut/abdominal pain along with periods of feeling really hot and am having diarrhea. I was getting much better before this with most of my sides starting to subside then this hit. Most of my sides that I suffered after the crash have either gone away or greatly improved, but it is my 5th week since crashing and I am very concerned over this. Not related to fin IMO I feel like it must be. There is nothing else in my life that would have caused this. For the first 2 weeks after I crashed I had digestive issues and diarrhea. Then it all started to improve and was back to normal then randomly this happened. Idk pfs is literally a nightmare, I have literally experienced such a range of sides in just 5 weeks it is insane Fuck man, I had some digestive issue too and I thought it was from protein shakes, Im 4 weeks post fin, I need to keep a closer eye in this shit TBH I would not put it past any symptoms being related to fin. It seems to really wreak havoc on chemical reactions in your brain. Could be fin. Finasteride is known to wreck havoc on the gut microbiome. The health coach I am working with who has worked with many PFS clients always gets their microbiome checked and states there is always significant dysbiosis in PFS. There are also studies done showing significant change to the microbiota. Your current symptoms could be a result of finasteride induced dysbiosis. A stool microbiome test may be helpful and give some clues on what to do. Thank you! You have been the most helpful person with this! Have you been dealing with similar issue?\n\nEdit: I just did some research and it says online that micro biome tests are not really useful yet and need to be further improved to be beneficial ): Yes I have been dealing with PFS for a few years now. I have been dealing with digestion issues and diarrhea. I had my microbiome analysed and it turns out I have the bacterial profile of somebody with chronic fatigue syndrome thanks to finasteride. Digestion and poos are much better after running antimicrobials, diet change and probiotics specific for my microbiome. A stool test to check your microbiome would be a good idea Okay, that is good to hear that you are seeing improvements! Would you mind Elaborating on the things that you did and what worked and didnt work? I know it is a lot to ask, but I have been on a lot of forums and no one has mentioned it the things that you listed before.\nYou can PM me if you would like as well! Yes I am happy to help. I was in your situation not that long ago, I have learnt a lot, made all the mistakes and want to help. I am just out at the moment, so when I get home and I am on my laptop I will shoot you a message. If I forget, just message me to remind me :) Of course! Thank you so much, will do (: Can you message me your story and your symptoms and I will get back to you when I get home  Will do! 5 weeks is too early to worry. Your endocrine system (and possibly gut microbiome) is likely in an unstable state right now - it will take some time to correct itself. Try to pick up some healthy habits without getting to drastic, and see how you feel after six months.\n\nIt will also be helpful to not stress yourself out about the symptoms.", "Finasteride and digestive issues: my story In early march of this year, I decided I had enough with losing my hair and worrying about it, so I decided to start finasteride. The first couple weeks, I felt like I had more energy than normal, higher libido, and just a better mood overall. If I remember correctly, it also made me sleep better. My hair started shedding like crazy from fin as well, which I figured was normal.\n\nAfter about 2 weeks however, I started noticing I was having diarrhea. Sometimes my lower abdomen would be painful in the mornings, and I would have to go to the bathroom. Around this time I also noticed that my appetite started to go away. Usually, I am really hungry in the morning, but it was gone (and still kind of is). I also noticed that when I would eat a meal, I would be full for almost the entire day, and my stomach contents would feel and sound like they were splashing around. Like a liquid sound. \n\nI continued to take fin throughout this time though, since I never really though it could be fin. In early May (about 2 months of fin then) I started having panic attacks, nausea, diarrhea, sweating, heart palpitations (heart felt like it was skipping beats), no appetite, and the corneas of my eyes were often red, regardless of how much sleep I got. I also would be fatigued.\n\nIt was then that I stopped finasteride for about 3-4 weeks, but did not notice any change in my symptoms. I was still having diarrhea, sweating, heart palpitations etc, so I started fin again, assuming it was not the cause of my symptoms. I also lost 18 pounds, which for me is a ton of weight. I was losing weight even though I was eating like I normally do. \n\nI was prescribed an antidepressant, because my doc thought it was anxiety. I also got a blood test and stool test, and the stool test revealed that there was inflammation in my gastrointestinal tract. I had to get a colonoscopy and endoscopy, which both revealed nothing. All they saw was an increased amount of white blood cells in my colon, which they said can be caused by all kinds of things including the colonoscopy prep drink. \n\nAfter hearing that I do not have Crohn\u2019s, celiac, or Ulcerative Colitis, I was dumbfounded. I have never been allergic to anything, so I finally decided to stop fin for good. Literally just 3 days after stopping, my appetite started to come back, I have started to gain weight again as well. My other symptoms are still here, but I am hopeful that things will get better as time progresses. I still do not know for sure if fin is even causing my issues however. I am pretty confident that it is what has been causing these issues though. If you get past the two-three week mark with no \"crash\", you can count yourself among the lucky ones.\n\nMy finasteride nightmare also started with an intense pain in my lower abdomen. The next day, I woke up with no penile sensitivity and massive brain fog. Also could eat a single meal a day and not feel hungry. \n\nI still have symptoms, 10 years later. What is the crash? What other symptoms do you have? \"Crash\" is a term people use to describe the rapid worsening of symptoms that can happen after stopping finasteride.\n\nYou might want to read up on post-finasteride syndrome, so you do not get tempted to try finasteride again later. Repeated exposure seems to be one of the risk factors for developing persistent symptoms. I am convinced that my particular case of PFS has to do with gut health. I have gotten tested for SIBO (waiting for results), will be doing a stool test, and might end up getting a colonoscopy (the doctors seemed pretty insistent on that one).  Let me know if the stool test reveals calprotectin levels being elevated. That hints to inflammation somewhere Some parts are more sensitive then others. Towards the tip there is a little bit left. But most of it is even less sensitive than an earlobe. Almost no feeling at all.", "What do people mean when they say they have \"lost sensitivity/ feel numbness\" in genitals? Does it mean you cannot feel ANYTHING? Or does it mean you can still feel them, just not the pleasurable sensation?  Dude, if your over 40 then take the pill, wife are not going to give it up any more. And oral, say goodbye to that, they do not, and I quote \"do that anymore\". The side affects are caused by your own self worry. I am a current sufferer so i am trying to figure out if i have this symptom or not It is like you want to use it but if it is too much work then you can go with, with sex for a really long time. It is almost like a superpower. Not needing sex, it is good. That did not come out right, kind of like taking finasteride. If this drug turns nasty like they say, idk sounds bad, from reading these forums. Here is how it feels for me. Touching myself down there or getting touched by someone else just feels like touching my own arm. You know how if normally you touch your arm, it does not give you this tingly pleasurable sensation? That is how it feels down there. Just kind of a dead boring sensation. Strangely enough, my entire body feels this hypoesthesia. Touch is not as sensitive as it was before. When you climax, do you feel a build up of any sort of pleasure or something? Yes, I do. But it is relative from before. I sometimes find myself climaxing and thinking \"that is it?\" Imagine wearing a super thick condom while also drunk. That is pretty much what it feels like. Finasteride is poison. I was on it for 14 months then took a sexual nosedive, overnight. It is been 4 months since I have been off it. Some slight improvements, but a feeling of disconnection from the brain and penis is still there. I have moments of hope, but so far am sorry I ever took the shit. Have you tried taking supplements? To fix this? Many. Vitamins, Tribulus, Pine pollen, Wellbutrin, Clomid, and Cabergoline. \n\nI would say Cabergoline is the most effective medication I have taken so far. I had mildly elevated prolactin, so a doctor prescribed it. It gave me a 6-7/10 sense of libido that I had not felt in a long time. \n\nOverall, most of the supplements/medications I have taken make me feel good initially, and then they wear off. Other supplements make me feel worse. Zinc is an example of something that makes me feel worse. \n\nNow, I am just playing the natural game. I take a multivitamin a couple times per week along with Vitamin D and iron. I am working out, living as healthy as possible, and not risking my condition by taking random supplements/drugs. I try to limit alcohol, too.

I am not sure. Well, finasteride interferes with brain hormones, specifically ones that have relaxing, anti-anxiety effects. So it is not a stretch that fin can contribute to having nightmares.\n\nThe more common side effect is that people cannot fall asleep and/or stay asleep. It can affect fertility.

Side effects are generally caused by taking too much of a medication. Doctors usually prescribe 1mg but we already know how little doctors know about finasteride. \n\nI do not want to talk about actually taking finasteride at all as this forum is not about that. But I wanted to ask if anyone has had side effects taking it at that low a dose. Ok, just keep in mind side effects may also go with the expected effects.\n\nMy experience is 1mg for a couple years, could not  identify any side effects before, during or after, so it does not really count I guess.

Try weight lifting and stuff to increase testosterone and watch it improves dramatically since your body is producing more testosterone. 0.25 will not give u PFS if u improve your everyday like walking increasing blood flow and reducing stress u should be fine stay away from this forum it is going to give u a nocebo effect where ur going to think too hard and get anxious over it. Even from getting anxious u can experience loss of libido it is crAzy so stay away from this forum try it out and if it is significantly affecting u then u can stop it. No one here can help u everyone is different we all have different dht levels Thx for the tip but I lift weights 4/5 times a week already.

The conversion is less too. The more dht u lower the more side effects u will get. If ur in Male ranges of dht and within the threshold u should be able to have kids etc and no issues. Your bound to get abit of change though ur reducing main part of Male characteristics. Dht plays role in muscle mass too - the muscle and CNS connection so u get that buzz and energy release as your working out. But obviously it makes u more aggressive and stuff. We are not usually meant to change our hormones but still it is worth the risk to try it out. The PFS is a permanent state of not being able to have an erection that is very very rare unless u had issues before taking treatment it can be likely. 0.25% is very low dose it is not as effective as 1mg at all.

Hi I have been taking Finasteride for I believe half a year now. And been having side a effects for a bit now. I stop taking it 2 days ago and just slightly worried that it might be permanent even though it is been only 2 days without it. So my question is how long does it usually take to where off after months of use if at all at this point? No body truly knows for sure, and there is no solid information about how long it will take someone to get better regardless of how much/little that they have taken. \n\nNone the less, I have read that 5ar activity returns in one month with symptoms wearing off anywhere between three to six months. \n\nI still have some side effects after taking it for one month between July/August. When I visited the doctors about this (UK) I was told that the sides will wear off overtime and that the majority  of people are okay in their experience.\n\nBest of Luck pal I guess it is very hard to predict who will and who will not have long lasting side effects. \nI took finasteride 1mg for 20 days back in March this year but am definitely still feeling the side effects. \nA year ago I used to feel the need to masturbate every single day and it would be hard to refrain from masturbating a couple of days.

Have a favor to ask - could you point out where exactly you read about 5Ar activity taking a month to return, and symptoms wearing off in about 3 to 6 months? I have heard alot of people say something similar but I cannot find any evidence for it. Some sort of scientific paper would be ideal if you knew of one. Hello, mello. \n\nThere is no official data as far as I can tell on Finasteride specifically.\n\nThere is however data that erectile function and other sexual problems get better over 3-12 for dutasteride. However the data states that erectile function is still impaired 12 months after taking dutasteride and still not as good as before dutasteride. \n\nOn the other hand however Finasteride is 5 times less powerful than dutasteride. And on top of this Finasteride only inhibs 1 or 2 5AR enzymes.\n\nIt is also worth noting Finasteride kills your dopamine and your neurotransmitters.\n\nOverall: eat lots of fruit, veg, drink water, cut out alcohol smoking and weed. \n\nAlso be sure to do lots of running around and do a lot of HIIT exercises. \n\nDm me for more info", "I feel like a completely different person. All right, here is my story. I took oral finasteride 1mg for probably nine months between 2019 and 2020. Stopped taking it because I noticed semen quality/ejaculate volume was super low. Came off it fine and everything went back to normal for the most part.\n\nAround March of this year, I decided to try topical fin from Hims because they claimed it had a lower side effect profile. Still, I was wary so I only took half a dose maybe three or four times a week.\n\nHair shredding was super intense for a couple months but stabilized and I could start to see my hair rebounding maybe around four months in. Right around that same time, I began to notice my penis felt and looked different when erect. A bizzare upward/leftward curvature began to form and the skin around my genitals appeared darker than the rest of my body. I also started noticing my flaccid penis would stay in that retracted/cold state for long periods of time. So, I quit.\n\nIn the three weeks since I have quit, the shrinkage has gotten so much worse. I went to the doctor and pulled down my pants to reveal a literal baby's penis. He did not have any advice apart from wait and see. Told me to visit a urologist in three months if things do not improve. Also got a blood test and my testosterone came back in the 500s. I am 29, so that seems low (but technically within the normal range).\n\nSince then, I have experienced a laundry list if side effects i never experienced while on the drug. Complete loss of sex drive, inability to get an erection, brain fog, muscle loss, horrific nightmares, zero ejaculation, numbness, the works.\n\nI have been waking up every day since the onset of these symptoms with absolute dread for life. My penis is a fraction of the size it used to be. Major losses in both girth and length. I cannot focus and the days blur together and slip by like I am in a bad movie. I have dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life but never anything like this. \n\nBefore fin, I could get a massive erection by sheer mental will, now I am lucky if I can get hard at all. The sides have not improved a bit since stopping and have really only gotten worse at this point.\n\nI do not feel like me anymore, and that is terrifying. When will this living hell come to an end? I wish I could go back in time and slap some sense into myself. I cannot go on feeling like this forever. Sorry to hear what happened to you. Sadly it is reality for many of us.\n\nNo one will be able to answer your questions, but time usually takes the edge of the worst sides, try some light exercise and yoga / relaxation techniques to calm the mind.\n\nYour T levels is normal for your age and is unlikely to be the culprit of your symptoms. Many people with PFS have tried to raise T but with little or no effect. Sometimes it even makes them worse so be careful. So the good news is that the finasteride is not out of your system yet. That takes a few months, considering how long you were on it. The downside is, there is obviously a chance they will not go away. You had what is called a crash, massive sides but only after quitting.\n\n\nThere are ways you can naturally raise testosterone. Eat red meat at every meal, eat whey protein every day, weight lift as often and you can and eat a lot. Cardio exercise can help as well. I realize you probably have no motivation to do this stuff, but it will almost certainly help.\n\n\nAccording to PFS forums even going on vacation can help. Hello, I share your live. Only I had penis Shrinkage at the last days of fin. One week after quitting flavid penis has gotten its old shape again, but since quitting I developed ED. \nOnly for a very short period I cold reach a normal erection after starting Bupoprion. Now everything is gone forever. \n\nI share the muscle atrophy and waking up in the morning I have not any motivation to life another day in that horrible movie, which is definitely NOT MY LIVE!!!\n\nIT IS a bad movie I watch as a third person. And I n my thoughts I am only in the time before I first to the fucking pill. Did the topical finasteride have an affect on you as well? Just wondering as I just got some topical finasteride Do not do it You are aware of this subreddit - dedicated to long-term (possibly permanent) mental and sexual side effects - and you ordered finasteride!? How did you reconcile those two things in your head? I actually got it couple days ago so before I discovered this subreddit but it is just difficult to make the decision when half of the people are saying how awful this stuff is and then the other half saying that it is all in your head and people are just being paranoid. Finasteride obviously works well for hair loss which makes it so tempting to use. But what if this stuff is real and I will get affected badly by this stuff. Like I do not want to be bald but I am already suffering with anxiety and depression and do not want to make it worse I should be clear - long-term (possibly permanent) side effects are very very rare. Side effects that resolve seem much more common. Even more common are people who experience side effects but either do not care or do not know that it is caused by finasteride. I think there are a lot of guys out there who are experiencing mild depression or lack of energy, and they do not know it is caused by finasteride. Of course, there are lots of people who take it with no problems at all. But the question to ask yourself is if you want to roll this dice at all. \n\nIMHO, you can improve your life in so many ways that do not involve medications. It is harder, but it works: new hobbies, new friends, exercise, skin routines, better style/fashion, travel the world, make $$$, meditate, learn a language, the list goes on and on and on. None of these things require gambling with your mental and sexual health. I agree what you said is very sensible, hair loss is only a cosmetic issue at the end of the day it is just real hard to deal with it I guess for young guys Yes, and I think younger people take their health for granted.", "The French Equivalent of the FDA now mandates that physicians and pharmacists hand their patient's on Finasteride 1 mg a warning about possible persistent symptoms that occur due to the drug.

It was not a complete removal of glandular tissue (it is common to leave some behind so the nipple do not collapse).\n\n- I am a freelancer in the creative industry (stressful deadlines and dealing with lots of clients).\n\n- I live in a country that is controling extremely bad the pandemic.\n\n- I did not know about possible fin sides, except for ED, lower libido and lower semen volume.\n\nOk, now to the recent events:\n\n- 1.5 month into fin I had my first anxiety crisis in 1+ year.\n- girlfriend (at the time) noticed that I had lower sex drive and 1.5 to 2 month into fin I had a hard time reaching orgasm.\n- 2.5 month into fin I had my 2nd crisis\n\n2 months later pandemic hit and my life changed 100%. 1 year since I last saw friends, exercising only inside (I was fairly active outside).\n\nI gained a lot of weight due to anxiety eating (and doing less exercise in general due to covid). Started getting a little paranoid about my gyno growing back because of fin and I think that it has a chance it is, but hard to confirm due to weight gain.\n\nSo how do I know it is fin related? Is there a way to know? I already was dealing with anxiety and whatnot before fin, and now we are going through a pandemic. How to pin point facts?\n\nAny thought is appreciated! \ud83d\ude4f These things are difficult to determine, as you point out. Did your sex drive and such end up improving on their own? That was over a year ago, right? \n\nWhat factors make you think your gyno is returning and it is not just weight gain? Gyno is indicated by growth directly under the nipple area. If you cannot feel a lump under your nipple when you press down on it, it is likely just fat. But if it hurts or is sore there, you might have gyno. Had ups and downs, april/may last year I thought I was getting my libido back but it did not last long.\n\nAbout gyno: I am quite familitar with the lump thing, the thing is, I did the surgery but the doc left some tissue behind (nipple collpasing, yadayada), so even after surgery I still could feel the lump (it just was not making my nipple puffy anymore, as the excess was removed). Now I have the impression that the lump is a little bigger... but cannot precisely tell since I did not do any test after surgery to have a comparison.\n\nedit:\nAs an strategy I think of maybe keeping the fin and focusing on getting my fitness and diet on course again, till I achieve similar body composition as before and then asset if the lump got bigger, but honestly it would take at least 6 months for me to do it in a healthy manner, and I am afraid of is just getting worse I think that is a fair strategy. If you do notice it getting worse, you can always come off of fin. But if you stop, I would advise not starting it again. There are many reports (including from myself) that the \"start-stop-start\" pattern can trigger an onset of new symptoms and/or increase in severity of existing ones. What were last two anxiety crisis about? Same reason as the anxiety episodes you had before fin? Is there a reason you get those? As in basically freaking out over life stress, or is its just who you are as a person, getting anxious over seemingly nothing? I usually track it down to the same root (why I went lookiny for a therapist in the first place), but it is a crisis so it goes past the rational level Yeah, i truly understand but do you feel like those last two crisises (on fin) could also be traced down to that same root as the crisises you had before you were on fin? Or were they different? Cannot say for sure as the reason (family members health condition) are the same/worst than in the past, but the crisis had stopped/I was able to control. Now looking back I found interesting that both happened after starting fin, so maybe it had a role in finding me with my guard down? On the first crisis I thought it was because of an anti inflamatory I was taking for 1 week that had caffeine (which depending on the dosage is a sure thing to make me go whack)\n\nBeen doing some reading (kudos to any professional that research these more subtle effects) and from other people experiences I am starting to believe if you already suffer from anxiety and depression fin is not the best thing to take.\n\nGoing To try to elaborate that thought with my therapist this week. She has a broader picture and dont even know that Im on fin, so shoud be a nice unbiased talk! Cool! perhaps keep us up to date as to what her input was? Will do! Fin reduces neurosteroids in the brain that are important for regulating GABA, the main one is Allopregnanolone which acts on the brain like xanax and is therefore anxiolytic.\n\nDifficult to say whether your issues are fin related, although from a biological perspective it is very possible Thank you for the input! I know that they did not start because of fin, but Im suspecting it made it worse \ud83e\udd14 any safe time frame that I can stop taking fin to see how I feel and then hop on once again?

I have been off fin for 4 months now, and am starting to get worried about this being permanent. I thought I had recovered mentally, but again I came back down and can barely think again. This has happened more than a dozen times now.\n\nI just started a new career and the brain fog has me worried that my co-workers are going to think I am stupid. It is really stressful as I should be happy about this great new career path I have, but all I can think about are these side-effects.\n\nAlso sexually never getting horny anymore has really made me feel in the dumps lately, and definitely does not help me mentally. Whenever I see my dick in its, weird, rubber-like state it brings me down even if I feel good that day.\n\nSorry for the weird complaining post, but I just feel like I need to get this off my chest... I am just scared I will be like this forever, as I am inching ever so closely to the 6 month mark where PFS may be long term.\n\nI cannot believe this all happened to me because I was so vain to care about my hair so much. Hairloss is nothing compared to this nightmare. I just hope I can recover and I will never take any  my life for granted again.\n\nAnyway, hope you guys are all doing okay. I do not mean to bring people down it is just really hard going though this by yourself. I feel you man. This condition is horrible. But you must stay strong. It does get better. Stay strong, keep pushing forward and never give up. Most people can and do recover. Turn your experience into a success story. You will get there. Honestly typing that out that it has been 4 months is almost surreal; this has felt like an eternity. It is strange....\n\nThanks for the words of encouragement though! I will be strong and push forward as best as I can. I think sometimes it makes me feel good to whine about how I feel haha.\n\nI just need to get through this down week and it will get better again. I appreciate the effort to be positive. What is the evidence for the statement: \u2018Most people can and do recover\u2019? I am sorry to hear, man. I was in a similar situation myself when I got hit with the side effects... trying to perform in a new career, and feeling like my brain and body was against me.  \n\n\nIf there is anything I can say, it is that 4 months is not very long. Your chances of recovering are really good still. But \u2013\u00a0I would say that ruminating about symptoms are definitely not going to help. If you can do anything to reduce the amount of pressure you are under, do those things! I totally understand what you mean with 'typing out its been 4 months seems surreal'. I feel just the same way. This whole time we have been sucked into this state that requires almost all attention, and time has just flown by.. Hey man. Do not get discouraged yet. I had brain forg (not from a drug) for 2 years, and had accepted living with it, so I can relate to the way you feel. I could still enjoy stuff, so tried to focus on that more, and it helped my general well-being. Brain fog cleared at some point by itself.\n\nIf I understood correctly, you have brain fog and 0 libido as PFS right? 0 libido can also be tough, specially if you are in a couple. But also try to use that extra attention and energy on other stuff, like working out, or on things that make you happier with yourself. I am pretty confident you will recover. When you will feel down just come for the support needed to continue until the point of your recovery. How long have you been on fin? Usually it would take that amount of time to fully recover.\n\nFor example, if you have been on fin for 6 months, it may take 6 months to recover.\n\nThe only instances ive seen permanent PFS is when people goy PFS from 1 or 2 pills Stay strong. I have stopped use after 12 years on, and have been off since March 2020. I am JUST about fully recovered. Mentally clear again and dick is back in its prime. You give me hope, I took the poison for like 15 years 7 months I was on fin for. I would aim for 7 month full recovery, if you are not near baseline by then then I would start getting concerned. \n\nGood luck brother. Thanks man! It is so strange... why do some people like you recover after all that time, but others never do? Hopefully a mechanism and cure is found for this shit in the near future. Nobody should have to deal with this. There needs to be a cure/treatment. How is this poison legal!!! Or at least regulated better. I got my prescription with no warning so I thought all the outspokeben PFS people were just making shit up.\n\nI will never trust another drug again after this shit. I also will never take a prescription without asking a million questions and researching. Dr\u2019s and pharmaceutical companies are poisoning us and in some cases destroying our lives. How much were you taking per week? 1.25mg per day. I got permanent pfs after using fin for close to 5 years. This is very common on the Propecia help forums and many other sufferers I spoke too. Most took the drug for much longer than just 1 or 2 days. how long have you been recovering? 2 years. And I am not exactly recovering lol. I contemplate suicide everyday due to how severe I got hit. That is brutal man. I am sorry this shit is a literal nightmare. Yes man it is absolutely brutal. I hope you are able to recover man. I am pulling for you. Have you fully recovered ?  Because most people do just fine on it. We are just unlucky ", "I am too scared to start fin because I have heard it messes with testosterone and libido? I am too scared to start fin because I have heard it messes with testosterone and libido?", "5 months after fin, still feel crazy anxiety, brain fog, mood swings, kind of blurred vision - and now I think I have got acid reflux due to my anxiety I know people do not see improvements until the 6-12 month mark, but this is crazy.  Some days I feel like it is getting better and then I have a set back.  \n\nI have a PCP visit next Tuesday finally and I am thinking of seeing an endocrinologist to see if my harmone levels are out of whack.\n\nI never dealt with depression or anxiety before and it is no joke.\n\nHow long did it take people to see improvements and what was their remedy? Im only off it for one month and am seeing slight improvements.\n\nHow much sleep are you getting? I took a few days off of work and slept a lot and it seems like that really helped. I get a lot of sleep but I do wake up a lot during the night I took Fin for years and developed all of the common symptoms. I somehow managed to not acknowledge it was related to Fin. I also developed tinnitus and dry eye disease. I have been off for just over a month and my eyes are doing a bit better and my vision seems better as well, the tinnitus is slightly better as well. The depression/anxiety/brain fog and sexual dysfunction are all the same. I have to stay hopeful as do all of us. Getting the psychological aspect of this is important. How long and what milligrams were you on ? I had crippling panic attacks after getting off of fin. At my worst, I made 2 hospital trips in 1 week and had complete insomnia for 3 days (2 hours of sleep across 3 days). I would wake up with extreme night terrors, as if my body had just gotten a shot of adrenaline.\n\nI quit alcohol, caffeine, started eating better and working out more. This only helped slightly. I would say it brought my panic attacks from a 10 to an 8. I went from thinking I was losing my job to at least scraping by.\n\nAfter a month of this, I was continuing to get very bad flare ups. Saw a doctor who diagnosed me with panic disorder. Said fin may be playing a role, but did not go as far as saying it was the main cause. Prescribed me clonazapam as needed, and low dose sertraline.\n\nI want to stress that medication should be your last resort, but goddam can it be a life saver. Having clonazapam for those times where my panic attacks reach extreme levels is calming in itself. Be very careful with benzos though. I would take them ONLY when you REALLY need them. Sertraline takes 4-6 weeks to kick in.\n\n2 months later, I have not taken any clonazapam in over a week and I remain on a low dose of sertraline. My panic attacks have gone from I would say an 8 to a 4. They are annoying but manageable at this point.\n\nAll I can tell you is talk to a doctor, take medication if you believe it is necessary, but do so cautiously. I am always available via DM if you want any more info. I know how much this sucks and the last 3 months have been a rollercoaster, but I feel I have made a lot of progress and learned a lot.\n\n(Also I got similar acid reflux like symptoms from my panic attacks. Also caused me to have weird fits of hiccups that were very violent) I have had the brain fog anxiety and depression and low motivation before but after being on finasferide a few months I have recently been depressed most days and almost nonexistent sex drive. I have not been on long enough to know if its working yet though", "Moreplatemoredates fixes PFS Has anyone else seen moreplatesnoredates youtube video? He says PFS is real but can be fixed with HRT. Derek admits himself in a more recent video that he failed to account for finasterides effect on neurosteroids. Although I do really admire and respect Derek, he is not as educated on Post Finasteride Syndrome as his audience thinks he is. Just because his N = 1 experience with finasteride was successful, does not mean its going to be the same for the rest of his viewers. Post Finasteride Syndrome is much more complicated than just a \"simple\" hormone imbalance as his videos &amp; blogposts make it out to be, if it could be cured with HRT, then there would be no PFS, it would just be Finasteride induced hormone imbalance. Derek does not consider neurosteroids, androgen receptor expression / sensitivity, changes to the gut microbiotia and more. I caution against using Finasteride purely on Dereks advice, or other influences like Kevin Mann, and be sure to read into the PFS anecdotes, the law suits against Merck, and literature on PFS first, in order to avoid a bias one sided point of view. Many men have tried HRT and I am not aware of any cases where it cured PFS. You took the words out of my mouth, well said stranger! Just to be fair to Derek he has done a video on PFS where he talks about neurosteroids and specifically speaks to Allopregnanolone inhibiting or disruption being possibly the root cause of PFS or many of its symptoms..", "Did I develop PFS after 5 years of no sides? I have been taking Finasteride for 7 years. About 2 years ago, I started developing the following symptoms. I attributed it to my anxiety disorder because I had already been taking Fin for 5 years prior with no issue. \n\nCurrently here is what I am experiencing.\n\n* I have no interest in women/ sex. Porn does nothing. I was horny as normal the first 5 years of Fin.\n* I can get an erection and have an orgasm, but no mental component or ejaculation.\n* My penis contracts like usual during an orgasm but I can keep going again and again (like a robot) and never an ejaculation. I do not lose desire after an orgasm like I used to, I can keep going because there is no desire in the first place.\n* I have weird sensations in my anus (like something warm and tingly)?\n* My muscles in my arms are constantly twitching and sore\n* I have developed carpal tunnel syndrome\n* My mood is horribly unstable, lots of aggression, loss of focus, or impulse control\n* Cant control my attention or enjoy anything. \n* No loss of muscle mass, quite the contrary.\n* I do not have gyno-symptoms. No change in penis size.\n* Lots of new vascularity in my arms.\n* My testosterone was normal 1 year ago despite many similar symptoms.\n\nI am guessing I should stop taking Finasteride. I worry so much nothing will come back! Is there hope? Could this all be psychiatric/ neurologic?\n\n Is this consistent with PFS despite no symptoms the first 5 years? All I can add is the severe more prominent symptoms came after 10 years on this stuff. Here are my symptoms:\n\nDry eye disease\nMuscle spasm/eye twitch\nLow libido \nAnxiety/depression and general lack of interest in anything\nLow level scrotum discomfort\nTinnitus\nShrunken penis This sounds like a fairly severe case of PFS. I have heard of symptoms 1, 2, 3 (more rare I believe), 5, 6 (rare?), 7, 8, 10, and 12 in relation to PFS - the others I am not sure about. I would stop finasteride ASAP. I would also avoid getting back on it because there are many reports that the \"start-stop-start\" pattern can trigger an increase in severity of symptoms (myself included). Assuming it is PFS, there is absolutely hope of getting better, but it will likely take significant time (months to years).\n\nAlso, I hope you have seen or are planning to see a medical professional for all of these symptoms. I have mild-moderate anxiety, and these sound too serious to be purely caused by anxiety.\n\nRegarding timeline, I had no symptoms for 1.5 years. I have heard of people not developing symptoms for 2-3 years. 5 years sounds like an outlier, but I suppose it is possible. I encourage you to post on  with your story if you have not already. 7 years is quite some time for certain ailments to develop regardness of fin. So when you say vascularity in arms, carpal tunnel, weird anus senitivity and unstable mood, who knows? People do develop those regardless of finasteride use! The sexual ones however are quite likely due to fin. Ejaculatory disorders, sexual disintrest and andehonia are most likely due to your fin use. I would suggest you would stop, and just see how it evolves honestly i would stay away from propeciahelp. I know writing about this stuff helps, but really.. propeciahelp is riddled with negativity, arguing, and annoying people. CTS is somewhat common in women in menopause (their estrogen levels crash at that time), and also 2,7,8,9,10 are also quite linked to crashed e2 (estradiol) levels. If I were you, I would do a full sex hormones panel bloodwork and insist on high-sensitivity e2 rather then ordinary e2 test. Bro fuck right off. Sexual side effects could be completely unrelated. It could be from weight gain, high blood pressure, stress or anxiety. A profound amount of young to middle aged American men suffer from some form of ED. They are not all taking propecia. cool, you could have also written that politely", "Finasteride body hair growth I understand finasteride regrows the hairline. But does it also reverse body hand facial hair growth to any extent? From my personal experience; absolutely. The reason men only get balder when they get older, and more hairier on their bodies at the same time, is because DHT keeps emitting its effect on the hair follicles. From the little investigation i had done prior to taking finasteride, i was only aware of sexual dysfunction and brain fog, etcetera.\n\nWhen i quit finasteride, i had not noticed my body hair had been reduced alot. it was only at month four or five that i noticed new hair sprouting on my finger and toe segments. Also my chest hair had decreased, and i recently watched a video where you can see that the sides of my beard (quite a big one) were alot thinner then they are now (8 months off), when i was still using fin. Even on my hands hair is reaching further and further towards my fingers on the sides. It definitely reduces body hair in my opinion. It wont  fall out' though, just diminishes by about 30% i would say.  \n\n\n(Edit was spelling) Why did you stop taking it? I hate body hair and I have not started it yet side effects.

The facial bloating i experienced lasted for 4 months after I stopped the meds (after a year of taking it). It has recently become much better, so it did take some time to get better - but still not fully there, still some leftover. I know from myself personally that its not the same, but I also have pictures documenting the progress. For some people who take the med for years, I can imagine it lasts permanently. Luckily its managed to mostly go away for me. The nocebo effect is real. But it tends to happen with symptoms like headache, nausea, and lightheadedness. The symptoms people are talking about in this sub are far more serious. And they include lots of things that are not even mentioned on the drug insert.", "Update. Close to two months off and some improvements. I took Finasteride for twelve days. Got sides on the eleventh day. When I went off the drug I had bad insomnia and could barely sleep. I could stay up for twelve hours or even fourteen hours and still have too much energy that I could not sleep. That was scary. \n\nOf course I also had erectile dysfunction and low libido as well as anhedonia. Whenever I thought of something or saw something that would before cause me to become aroused my brain told me that I should be aroused but my body did not respond in any way to this. I also found it difficult to enjoy listening to music the same way I used to. I guess that was emotional flatness/anhedonia. I also had watery semen.\n\nThe reason I took the drug was for gender dysphoric reasons. I was hoping to transition and wanted to get my hair back before going on hrt. When I got sides I immediately regreted my decision. There was no point in having hair if I could not even feel like I was alive. I have actually read that some people have described feeling like a \"zombie\" from taking this medication. \n\nNow its been close to two months and I have defintely not recovered. I still cannot get sexually aroused like I used to be able to. To be realistic though, I do not expect to regain the same exact libido I had before taking Finasteride. I also stopped taking Minoxidil to be safe and ended up losing more hair from this. I have now in the past week gone back on it though.\n\nThe good news is I can get sexually aroused much easier than when I first got sides. Semen is not as watery and its much easier to fall asleep.

(4 days in) Hey guys,\n\nTried to post this on Tressless but I guess the mods wanted none of it.\n\nSo after months of back and forth with myself, I decided to start finasteride a few days ago, with the idea that I would closely monitor for side effects and stop if I noticed anything concerning. I am 23 and I am balding aggressively. I hate it. My hair used to be my favorite trait about myself and it makes me so sad when I see myself with thin hair in the mirror and feel my bald spot. I hate seeing pictures of myself because of it, and I have even considered a hair system as a last resort (although I am scared potential partners may laugh at it in the future).\n\nI decided to try finasteride because I have taken minoxidil since I was 19 and while it slowed loss for awhile, I have lost hair pretty aggressively even on minoxidil for the past year. I was fully aware of all the risks, so I cannot blame anyone but myself. I feel completely normal for the most part, but I am worried that some longer term problems are beginning to develop. The first day I took the drug, I had trouble keeping my erection. This is weird for me because essentially since puberty started for me, I have been incredibly horny all the time. I get random erections constantly and my libido is through the roof (not always a good thing, but it is what it is). I thought that maybe it was a nocebo since I could maintain the erection with enough stimulation and I could orgasm and it felt good. Libido was completely the same as usual. \n\nPretty much had the same experience on days 2 and 3, but on day 4, I found that maintaining my erection became easier and my penis was noticably larger when erect (like maybe by half an inch), which was weird given all I have heard about finasteride. However, for the past day, even when flaccid, my penis has a dull ache, especially when touched on one side. It is not particularly painful but it does worry me a bit. It could easily be from too much masturbation as I have had that problem before but part of me wants to see if anyone has had this problem on fin before either to be sure that is not it or to be sure to stop now. My hair is incredibly important to me, but I am not going to give up my penis for it.\n\nThanks for any help anyone can give. Sorry for the long post! Everyone on this sub is going to tell you to stop.\n\nIs maintaining your hair for a few extra years worth the potential chance of severe mental trauma and impotency?\n\nThen if these sides do hit, you have to just wait and hope that you will get better, or listen to random people on the internet for treatment (basically no doctors even think PFS exists).\n\nI wish someone told me this had the potential to do so much damage before I started this drug, and this is my warning to you.\n\nBut ultimately, the choice is yours to continue.

Sorry to hear you are experiencing this, I hope it resolves with time for you.", "It is been 02 Months off fin , brain fog is vey little It is been 02 months I have been off fin after 10 months of that poison.\n\nIs there any way I can get rid of these emotional blatancy. Working out, heating healthy, no fap from  one month has helped with brain fog. I experience zero brain fog for most time.\n\nHad morning erections and minor libido in 1st week of hitting gym.

I stopped 3 days ago  but I still cant think clearly. I tried sleeping 9 hours last night and I still feel tired and confused. How long do these sides usually last. I think its crazy considering I only took 1 mg total and im experiencing something like this.", "Took saw palmetto for 3 days threw out all out I was taking SP for 3 days I started to develop groin pain and tightness I never had before how bad did I mess up my You will be fine just do not worry about it and never take some dht lowering medicine/supplements", "PFS My boyfriend was on Nopecia 1mg for a year and has not experienced any of the side effects except for genetile pain and loss of morning erections, but that did not affect him sexually at all. He quit for other reasons. He suffered from withdrawal symptoms (hash) and Health Anxiety/Health OCD for 6 months. After that, a wave of depression hit him suddenly and he has suicidal thoughts but he was terrified from the thought of suicide and he is recently been diagnosed with Suicidal OCD. Which means that he fears suicide way too much to act on it. It is way more than that, this is just a summary. He is not experiencing insomnia nor sexual side effects at all. He thinks he has PFS because two or three days ago he remembered a PFS sufferer\u2019s story who committed suicide which triggered his Suicidal OCD. Does this sound like PFS? And for all the people out there who are suffering from PFS, I hope you all get better and overcome this nightmare. Tell him to take 5 htp and GABA found cheaply at different places. Do not let him take antidepressants or anything while using those if he has already have him try that first. Really helped me. Got it from Walmart. He is already on medication perscribed by his psychiatrist to lower the anxiety and help with his depression. 5 htp is not universally safe for PFS patients. It has made some guys much worse. I can relate to the suicidal thoughts. PFS sufferer for 18 months and counting after a very short exposure to the drug. It has completely wrecked my body and cognition. I have had body changes that you honestly would not even believe. I would not believe them if it did not happen to me. They continue with no improvement. Your boyfriend needs to stay away from any endocrine disruptor or hair supplement forever. I am so sorry you are going through this. Hope you get better. Does his case sound like pfs? And what kind of body changes did you experience? I have struggled with depression forever, one 5 htp pill gave me the serotonin I would been deprived of for a long time. I do not take it everyday I feel like it would be my emergency happy pill in a sort of way. It made me feel high the same way weed did and has helped my sleeping. If they already have a lot/too much serotonin or are on antidepressants then it will give them anxiety but it is how you find out. It probably is, the drug can alter neurosteroid synthesis. As bad as it may be, if your boyfriend has not had any physical or cognitive changes other than this, he should consider himself quite lucky honestly. As crazy as that sounds.. This drug can have completely devastating effects on a small number of men.\n\nAfter my first exposure to the drug, I had such severe brain fog and cognitive impairment that I struggled to read or prepare meals for myself. Over the course of 8 or 9 months, my skin softened, turned very wrinkly and elastic, and I began to lose muscle, despite the same eating habits and training that I have always done. I am currently accumulating fluid undearneath myskin. It is like my lymphatic system or kidneys are not functioning properly. Most of my bloodwork shows up completely normal, as is usually the case with PFS after coming off the drug.\n\nThe brain fog, perceptiion/visual issues, and skin/muscles have gotten no better. All of the hairs on my head are completely dry and the hairs on my entire body thinned. It is either androgen receptor or enzyme related. Studies are being done to try and determine it. But it completely shut something off in my body. I do not get how a drug can change someone is life and turn it upside down this way. Recovery is possible and this is fixable, hopefully. He has not experienced any gentile pain, any kind of sexual side effects (except for the morning erections but this side effect went away when he quit the drug), body changes, or severe insomnia. This is why it is hard for me to believe that he has it. Have you experienced any kind of sexual side effects and suicidal thoughts? If so, what was your reaction towards them. Also, Nopecia did not helo with the hair growth. I think it only helped slow down the alopecia a little but. He is been off Nopecia for 7 months and a half and I have not noticed any hair loss or anything. Yes, suicide crosses my mind very often. Much more often than i would care to say. I was completely happy, fit, healthy, and driven before all of this. I am having to leave my Doctor of Physical Therapy program to go stay with my mom and try to get my life in order. I am almost 26 and have not lived with anyone in my family since 18. It is completely fucked up my life. 5ar inhibitors and endocrine disruptors can affect men in many, many ways. The condition is super variable and is the main reason that it has researchers and doctors confused about the whole thing. Why do most guys take it without a scratch and I take 1 pill and get completely fucked? Nobody knows yet. If he is not showing symptoms other than depression and anxiety, again, consider him EXTREMELY lucky. Like I honestly cannot even explain it through typing on a message board. It simply does not do it justice how badly this medicine can screw men up. If he has not noticed persistent, obvious symptoms in terms of sexual, physical, and cognitive/emotional, I would urge you both to stay off any propecia forums and moving forward. It sounds like he might have had a hiccup to his mental/emotional state but that he stabilized pretty nicely.\n\nYou will see many, crazy things that men have claimed are caused by Finasteride, Proscar, Dutasteride, Accutane, and aromatase inhibitors, and all of the types of symptoms are accurate. There is something at play here that researchers are still trying to figure out. Hope this helps.\n\nRe: the sexual symptoms. Yes, my entire penis turned rubbery and the skin thinned, as did the rest of the skin on my body. It stays super cold, my semen is still super watery, and libido &amp; erection quality have taken a hit. I rarely get morning wood anymore. Takes much more stimulus and concentration to get the same effect if that makes sense. I am sorry about that. This is really helpful, thanks. I hope you overcome this because no one in the world deserves to suffer that way at all. Remember thag recovery is possible and nothing lasts forever. It is just a matter of time. Thank you. I hope you are right.", "Assess my situation and give me advice Hi. I did 1mg of fin for a week. It was probably around the 6th day that I noticed some loss in libido and on the 7th it tanked. It is been 2 months since then. Recovery has been very gradual, and has fluctuated. Within the first few days of quitting there was an improvement. Maybe 5 weeks after that I noticed another step forward. Since then, it has been hard to say. There have been times where I have felt very close to a full recovery and other times not as much.\n\nNo infamous post fin crash where things got better and suddenly got worse again. But is what I experienced during treatment pretty much the same thing? And does the fact that I took it for so little but side effects are lingering for so long indicate permanence?\n\nI know one should wait 3 months before making big assessments but I have had a recent bout of stress about this. This is the first time it is been on my mind pretty much all day. How do you gauge the situation I am in and what is some advice about steps I should take right now? Thanks. I am 3.5 months post fin, and am in a very similar situation, although I had a crash (worst 2 weeks of my life). I was taking it for much longer than you though (7 months) before having sides. I think most people who \"crash\" were using it for longer from experiences I have read.\n\nI also probably masturbate too much, to \"check\" where my libido is at. Definitely need to try to stop that.\n\nBut it seems fluctuations are a good sign of recovery. I am almost 100% mentally some days and some days I am 70%. Sexually I have had a few days of great improvement but comes back down. Again, probably does not help masturbating too often.\n\nI think you just have to wait it out, relax and try to exercise and et outside while you can. The weather is nice outside so take advantage of it to heal.\n\nHopefully your recovery is soon and not too many more months. Thank you, felt good reading this and I hope your recovery is swift. Honestly the crash is the worst, so if you have not had that, be thankful. Regarding your libido, its probably one of the easiest sides to recover from. my libido recovered in just 3 days, but my mental state is just broken. Im pretty sure ur libido is going to be fine with time. I can reccomend you to:  \n   \\* not masturbate, checking up on your libido  \n   \\* drink alot of water  \n   \\* try DIM supplement", "Quit finasteride after a week of use, am I in danger? title Any side effects?", "2.5 Months Off and Full Recovery Hi all, \n\nI do not want to be too hopeful here yet, but I want to give some optimism to the group and those experiencing anxiety and symptoms. It seems I am fully recovered (at least I hope and think so).\n\nBG: I am a 27M, pretty healthy, and very active sex life. I took 1mg/daily for 26 days (or so, cannot remember). At which I could not get it up by myself or with my gf, had watery semen, 0 libido (coming from a very high one before) and then just general anxiety and dread. \n\nI stopped taking and have been off for about 2.5 months now and I seem to have 0 symptoms left. Not going to get my hopes up, but it is been about 2 weeks having very active sex, getting up easy, morning wood, etc. \n\nWhat I did with who knows what scientific backing: stopped completely taking fin (will never touch it again, I will just shave my head thanks). Drank \\~gallon of water a day, vitamin D daily and Omega 3/fish oil, a serving of pedialyte (maybe placebo, but I felt it helped), exercised pretty regularly, avoided alcohol, and most importantly just tried to get out of my head. Also probably helped I was with one partner the whole time who knew the saga and was very understanding and did not get frustrated when there was a failure to launch. \n\nSearching these forums caused so much anxiety that I think it was the cause for 80% of it. I saw a urologist to get testosterone levels checked and talk to him which was massively reassuring. Shortly after I noticed I was really feeling back at 100%. Now I am rarely thinking about it before sex and am able to go multiple rounds again. \n\nAll in all, hope that is helpful and calms some nerves, because I noticed after the Urologist where I felt reassured from a medical perspective, things really turned around. \n\nKeep your heads up, boys. It gets better. That is great to hear. Did you experience brain fog, insomnia too? I am 4 weeks after stopping and insomnia is the most debiliating symptom for me. Sadly it has not improved yet. Keep your head up, 4 weeks off I did not have great improvement either. Was back to getting morning wood, but would not hold an erection to continue to have sex or anything. I had brain fog at times but not insomnia. I started with the fish oil to help (maybe placebo but I felt it helped, along with running). Maybe try melatonin or lots of exercise to wear your body out? \n\nHead up, try not to worry about it until 3 months is also something I was told a lot. &gt;Keep your heads up, boys. It gets better.\n\nGenuinely pleased to hear you escaped a long-term syndrome; however what is true for you may not be true for others. of course and hoping that is in fact accurate. Just trying to give some optimism as I know everybody has experienced different things. Good news! Looks like you recovered in the normal time frame. \n\nEnjoy your newfound health and hopefully you will never be tempted to touch finasteride again. Congrats man, really happy for you! I took fin for 60 days, but my libido took a substantial hit. Today is my first day off and I am hoping to be back at 100% too. Thank you for sharing your experience.\n\nIf you do not mind sharing more specifics - how severe was your loss in libido? Were you not able to get hard at all? Sorry I have stayed off here for fear of starting that anxiety again...\n\nI had 0 libido and I could not get hard at all by myself or with my gf. Then gradually I could get hard enough to put it in but would go soft shortly after WHILE INSIDE. Talk about terrible.

In regards to the finasteride use, .. calm down. It will probably subside between now and 2 weeks. Have you seen the doctor that prescribed you finasteride? Or reported your condition to the mail order company you got it from? I strong suggest you see an endocrinologist for full labs that you should keep. \n\nHopefully your condition improves, like it does for most, but not all people. I think if you are young and otherwise healthy, you have a higher likelihood of getting past this brain fog and other ailments you may be experiencing, but please please please do the finasteride syndrome community and yourself a big favor and report this condition to your medical professionals. And do not take any antidepressants from them, as they have their own side effects and may make your condition worse. \n\nUntil then, eat as healthy as you can, exercise a lot and get good amounts of sleep.

I did not know him then but from his own accounts, and all his friends, he was a **very** confident outgoing person then. Which is hard for me to relate to, knowing him as he is now. That is a different person to what I know and love now. He suffers from anxiety and depression which causes him to drink excessively on occasion to deal with his feelings. From his and others accounts, his anxiety and depression started around the age of 18/19. I am not saying finasteride is the cause but I want him to come off it after reading a lot of information about the mental side effects online. At first it never crossed either of our minds that they were or could be related. Even he recognises his whole personality changed but doesnt necessary blame the drug, which of course we will never know. He is very anxious about losing his hair but his mental health is so bad it must be worth a shot to try and stop if those can be related to the drug.

We do not know exactly what is going on, but this synthesizes the relevant research into a hypothesis of how depression might result from taking finasteride. As was pointed out, finasteride can and absolutely does cause these issues. He could quit it for a couple months and see if the depression and anxiety abate. His hair's not going to suffer in that amount of time, and if quitting makes him feel better, he can assess other options for hair loss treatment, which I imagine would work great if he is already managed to maintain his hair for that long. Finasteride is not the only recourse. How is his dick and libido?\n\nThe issues he is having is likely to be from fin, from my experience.\n\nI was also outgoing and confident but changed with fin.\n\nBut quitting seems to be 50/50.

Someone on here told me 3-6 months people can usually go back to feeling normal so that is what im hoping. Hold in there, the first few weeks off were the worst and it is very frustrating that nobody knows what is causing the symptoms and many people do not even believe it is real. But I would shave tomorrow if I can jus go back to not having any of these symptoms. Its caused by neuro-steroidal deprivation and hormonal imbalances in most cases.

How long has it been since you have stopped? Dht takes like 1 month to return 4 months lmao It is one thing for the pharma companies to lie about it. I expect that. And I am certain the FDA only approved this drug because there is so much pressure on them from lobbyists and the revolving door of government. \n\nBut what I will never understand is why my doctor so emphatically encouraged the use of this drug.

And a couple other questions So, I am almost positive that I have been suffering from PFS for about two years. About 7 months into 1mg once daily I noticed my libido begging to drop and eventually the mind/body connection nearly disappear in regards to arousal. I stopped taking it at 18 months of use when it had gotten pretty bad.\n\nWhen I stopped (18 months ago) I had ten great days of libido being back but then crashed and have recovered a bit but I would only say 30-40% of what I was prior to taking finasteride. \n\nSix months after I stopped I saw a urologist who diagnosed me with prostatitus. The prescription he gave me (for only two weeks) worked incredibly. I had waves of feeling and arousal was easy as looking at bare breasts. Once I came off that drug, I started to decline, even with Motrin as he had recommended. \n\nHas anyone else had this diagnosis with a urologist? (He diagnosed me simply off symptoms which are exactly the same for PFS). However, other things he suggested doing like no booze and no caffeine did not help. \n\nRecently, I started the CDsNuts protocol and have had some improvement with it. Particularly by adding coffee to my routine. This suggests it is PFS and not prostatitus. \n\nTo add, I do not really have brain fog or other symptoms. Just no random erections other than sleep arousals which happen every night and even during naps. \n\nRegardless, any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. \n\nI also want to know about Tribulus. I take it once every ten days as part of the protocol. However, I have seen people on here saying taking it regularly helps. The protocol states when you take something like that frequently, your body builds a tolerance eventually rendering it ineffective. Just looking for thoughts on this. \n\nThanks everyone, I hope you all keep your heads up and never stop chipping away at this, it is brutal but there is hope. This is PFS. Follow the protocol strictly (do not pick and choose what parts to follow or cut corners) and you will recover. Just keep doing CDNuts protocol, it will make you better eventually. It took me about 2 years to be totally free from sexual side effects but they went and I am as horny as ever now.  I would recommend getting hold of some of the prohormones that he recommends after a few months. I would also seriously recommend cracked wall Pine Pollen and taking that daily if you can afford it.\n\nThe waves of libido are to be expected and are part of the process, when on the protocol the highs slowly become longer until they are the default state and the dips become rarer and rarer.\n\nOther things that have helped me:\n\nHigh dose (5000IU) Vitamin D AM\n\nZMA and Vitamin K PM Thank you for the response! I have pine pollen as one of the rotational testosterone supplements. Will not taking it daily eventually dilute its function through tolerance? I am taking it once every two weeks, soon to be three as recommended by cdnuts. \n\nI asked about the Tribulus for the same reason, I am following the protocol strictly but other people recommended taking Tribulus daily rather than in rotation in this subreddit. \n\nThanks again for the help! CDnuts is a scammer. His ridiculous protocol consists of 21 different herbs, some of which may give you more side effects. Some of the herbs he recommends will actually reduce libido. He earns money off of the herbs he recommends through affliated stores (lostempireherbs). I suspect he recommends 21 herbs because you spend a large amount of money upfront before you realize that you have had little improvement. He works as an insurance salesman. \n\nThanks for wasting my time. Yeah, waste money on a scammers protocol and buy 21 different herbs without asking questions. All these people recommending the scammer are probably his aliases. I am not CDsNuts, and I am sorry you believe it is a scam. If you have PFS, I wish you good luck in your recovery. How have I wasted your time?\n\nI was part of CDNut's community for 2 years. I never once bought from LostEmpire and he never once asked me to. I have never given money to him whatsoever and again... he never asked me to. Furthermore he was completely OK with me - and others - talking about different methods to get better and I was never silenced for discussing things outside of the protocol.\n\nSecondly, his protocol is a alot. I agree. Some of it likely unnecessary. But he does not recommend that you get all 21 herbs, he just lists them as what worked from him. The most I ever rotated was about 15 but it was usually in the 10-12 range (non from LostEmpire) and that was fine. I never saw any noticeable sides from any and I do not remember anyone part of that community at the time reporting any.\n\nThirdly. I do not care what he works as. He could be used car salesman for all I care. All I know is that I am better and that him and his community gave me support and drive when everyone else was saying that recovery is impossible. You can say what you want about his protocol, but I have not seen another community in the space (and believe me I have been involved in many more than you) with people posting such consistent results of making improvements and getting better.\n\nLastly, I can see that you accused me of likely being one of his aliases. If you are going to completely give up on avenues to potentially getting better then at least do your goddamn research. My reddit account is over twice as old as yours and I have been involved in many PFS related communities (PH, Ray Peats, Swole Source to name a few) with the same username. Tracking my journey from terrified and suicidal person in the depths of PFS to here is not that hard to find with a bit of digging. But if being skeptical to you is more important than being better then go ahead and get all of your 'facts' about CDNuts from the users at PH who never get better and do not actually ask anyone who did it for a great length of time.\n\nI am better. I have a great libido and sex life and the whole ordeal has made me a stronger and more understanding person. I live my life free from PFS other than to help others get better from it to (I have a support group chat with 15 members currently) and all I want is to end this affliction for others and prevent them from going through the same things that I did. Just last week a 24 year old man killed himself not 2 hours away from me because of PFS because the only info he could find told him he was fucked. It has played on my mind *every single day* since then because I wish that he found me instead of stumbling into that bucket of crabs that is PH.\n\nSo yeah. Be skeptical all you want. But get your facts straight. I would talk you through every step of every day with the protocol if you asked and I would never ask for a goddamn penny - hell I would ever buy you some of the herbs if you absolutely could not afford the minimum of 7 needed (not 21 as you seem to think). The only thing I would ask of you is dedication and that you do the same for someone else when you were better. But no, you came at me with accusations, misinformation and anger. And the only reason I replied is in case someone saw what you wrote and never looked into what it was like for someone to actually be involved in the protocol or CD's community and tool you misinformed words as truth. So, thank you for wasting my time.\n\nI really hope you manage to get better.", "Severe brainfog I am 19 as of today, and have been taking fin for about a year, past week I have experienced brainfog and I have never been more depressed. Cannot think, cannot read, and (reason for why this is probably written so shittedly) cannot write. Today will be my last day ever taking it. I am wondering if anyone else experienced brainfog and if after they stopped taking fin were able to get rid of it. Also if someone decides to respond how long it took to clear up brain fog and how long into taking fin they began to experience brainfog. Sorry if I am redundant or sound stupid, it is because right now I am actually stupid. Thank you and I wish everyone dealing with this a speedy recovery, you can do this!  Consider telling the doctor who prescribed it to you.\n\nAn unofficial guideline is to give 3-6 months for symptoms to lessen or go away. We do not know what will happen for any individual, but give it some time to see if this resolves. Thanks, did you experience any brainfog? After I stopped Finasteride I had brain fog for several months But it went away eventually? How is it now? It went away. Thank you for asking! You going to go back on it? I have been taking it for four months or so and I am worried I might be getting a little foggy too but it is hard to tell. My eyesight is the one thing I am sure is worsening. For me the brainfog hit like a bus. I think(I am not sure) is that the fin pools up and gathers in your body and maybe I had to much of it in my system. I also believe brainfog is a way of telling you there is something wrong in your body. And as for my eyesight, it never got worse it just felt as though my vision was lagging behind my brain and thoughts. I do not think I am going to go back on it I havnt noticed much change in my hair but if I do go back on it I will be taking it once every 2-3 days or just twice a week. I think taking 1mg everyday is an arbitrary amount with no science backing up why you should take that quota. Yeah I always kept it at one every two days I heard from some guys on yt that is all you need to get the full effects. I am trying to figure out if my eyes are really getting worse from the drug or if I am just finishing puberty with shitty eyes (I am 20) I do not think it would be a bad idea to get off it for 3-6 months and see if your eyesight improves. But I have also scoured almost every possible source I could find about Post Fin Syn and I do not think I ever saw something mentioning worsened eye sight. Have you found any evidence/stories of fin worsening eye sight? Yeah I have seen it and other people in the sub say the same thing. think ill take a two week break or something. \n\nWhy do the posts keep locking?", "Still early but my side effects have been very severe. What are my chances? I know that most people who get finasteride side effects recover when they stop taking the drug, but I am concerned because my side effects seem especially severe. I am wondering if any one has any statistics or positive stories because I am very scared right now.\n\nI took 1mg of finasteride a day for 5 days. I noticed on the fifth day that I had no libido and my penis was smaller and wrinkled in its flaccid state. Could not get it up. It is been 5 days since I have stopped taking it and in that time I have had lots of other symptoms. My penis is still small and wrinkled. No erections. No libido. My nipples have gotten bigger. My face seems like it is changed shape and it feels like more fat has gone to my hips. I have been feeling very depressed, especially in the evenings, and have suffered very severe suicidal ideation. Brain fog is severe as well. I simply cannot focus on work whatsoever.\n\nIs this going to get better? What proportion of men with these symptoms recover?\n\nThanks in advance for any answers Sorry to hear about this. I am not a doctor, but it seems your body is trying to cope with a reaction to finasteride.\n\nSome men recover within three to six months. Might be best to avoid any supplements or experimental treatments. Eat well, exercise and sleep. Give your body the best chance to recover. \n\nTry not to think about this all the time. I am in the same exact boat as you..I was taking this drug every other day for about a month..1 day about 3 or 4 days ago I doubled dosed completely by accident..I woke up the next day and my hair seemed so much thicker..but later that night the world came crashing down..I went to the bathroom and my junk seemed noticeably smaller..so I tried to masterbate and literally could only achieve 50% errection..I stopped the drug and in the last 4 days libido has gotten worse and my nipples are super sore..im afraid I flipped that neurological switch that night I doubled dosed..I do not know why I was taking this fucking drug..I never seen all this bad stuff..since it happened basically overnight I have almost resigned to the fact I have Full on post finasteride syndrome almost like the people who took it one time and are fucked for life..I have no feeling whatsoever downstairs and its been 4 days since stopping the med..im scared to death Aw man, I am sorry to hear that. \n\nDays 3 and 4 after stopping were the worst for me as well. My nipples are still big and dick is still small today, but I have been feeling better psychologically, so fingers crossed that is a sign I am over the worst of it.\n\nFrom what I have read, it sounds like we have both still got a very good chance of a full recovery. The vast majority of men who experience side effects recover! Keep your head up and take it one day at a time. That is what I am telling myself. And keep me posted on how you are feeling and your progress! Yea man I appreciate it..Hopefully we can stay in touch because it seems were on the same timeline with the same exact side effects..if you do not mind me asking have you been able to achieve an errection..I cannot and its actually gotten worse since stopping the med..I also feel slightly better mentally today..but waking up limp with no errection in sight is really killing me Yeah it also got worse for me after stopping. I have had semis but nothing close to a full erection. But the semis I have had have been a bit better today than the past few days I was on Finasteride for several years. No side effects until recently.   I did not have any type of fog, but the sexual side effects were a disaster.  Hard to keep or maintain an erection.  Seemed like my penis completely shriveled up when flaccid.  Loss of libido.  Just a mess.  Stopped cold turkey and within a few days I was back to morning erections and everything has been constantly improving ever since.  I believe that most studies have shown that the majority of men who stop Finasteride recover and that it is a very small percentage who have lasting side effects.  Hang in there.  Give it a little time.  Make sure that you are doing everything that you can to counteract the side effects.  Diet and exercise are really key. Thanks, man. I really appreciate it. I have been feeling a lot better these past few days. Still not 100% but on the way. I am sort of in the same boat as you guys.  I took finasteride for 6 weeks and began to notice that I could not maintain an erection during sex and watery ejaculate. I stopped cold Turkey the next day. It is been about 4 days and I have testicular pain. Like a dull ache all through out the day, my penis feels almost numb. No spontaneous erections but I can get it up. I am sort of freaking out now that I have done permanent damage and have been worrying about the dreaded \u201ccrash\u201d where everything seems like it is going to be fine and then a switch flips. \n\nThe anxiety at this point is killing me. I am concerned I have fucked my self for the long haul over trying a drug for 6 weeks. Is there a time period that side effects normally subside? People keep saying to give it at least 3 months after quitting cold turkey. Can confirm that the \u201ccrashing\u201d part sucks. Wishing the best for your recovery man. It really sucks but hang in there man. It is been two weeks since I quit and I am feeling a lot better psychologically, both in terms of depression and brain fog. My dick's still not 100% back to normal but on the way. I have heard most people make a full recovery in a month and most of the rest within three months. Appreciate it man. It is been a little over a week. Testicular pain is a lot better. But it is hard to get my dick to cooperate still. Hopefully you are right and everything will fully recover in 4-12 weeks. Hopefully four ha. My doctor just said when I started that if I had side effects and stopped medication they should \u201chopefully\u201d resolve. After 5 or 6 days of not getting better I was starting to worry. It sounds like it takes a while for most to recover. Hello,  I am another recent casualty. Took finasteride for 6 days and then noticed I could barely get an erection. I stopped immediately and the day after I stopped I woke up with morning wood which was a relief.  However after that things got much worse, I started to feel tingling in my scrotum and now there is literally no connection between my brain and penis. It is been 5 days and I am in the worst condition I have been in since stopping. I am really worried I have developed PFS as my side effects are severe. Hey guys any updates? +1 I am sorry to hear that, man. It is a really tough time. I am doing a lot better now (see my other comments on this post). Just take it one day at a time! You are almost certainly going to turn out fine. I am feeling a lot better! Depression and suicidal ideation disappeared about 5 days after stopping, brain fog disappeared about 10 days after stopping. I started getting erections and wanking again around day 10 too. Had a dip again around day 14: did not feel horny for a few days. But now even that is got better again.\n\nIf you are suffering right now, just take it one day at a time and remember that you are almost certainly going to be fine. Thank you for the reply,  I am glad to see you are doing better.  6 days in and no improvement.  I have been freaking out over this all the while,  it is horrible how this drug has destroyed mens lives after using just a week like me. My side effects are so severe, there is literally no connection. I am glad to see there are others going through this within the same time frame so I am not alone. I pray that we all make a full recovery. \nPlease keep me updated and I will do the same.\n\nAlso I would like to know, did your ability to get an erection again happen over time? Or was it just suddenly back one day? I am very worried because there is no change,  my morning wood even stopped now. Yeah keep me updated! Getting erections back was a slow process. Gradually got better over a few days or so. This is the 8th day and still no connection between my brain and penis, morning wood is gone. I am afraid I may be a victim to pfs. Symptoms are much worse than the symptoms I have seen anyone having with pfs. Trying to stay hopeful, I know I should wait a few months before I make that diagnosis but it is impossible to stay calm UPDATE\n\nWoke up this morning with morning wood for the second time since coming off finasteride. Was also able to get it up and masturbate for the first time. Although I had to focus a lot harder and semen was watery. This is the 8th day. It is very possible the extreme stress from the freak out of side effects made it worse then it actually was. Not to mention all the research I did on PFS afterwards reading about how this horrible drug destroyed so many lives. \n\nI am hopeful that there will not be the dreaded crash I have read about and I continue to recover. Wishing you all the best in your recovery,  I feel it necessary to inform others about the severe risks there are of taking this drug. It is not worth it.

The most concerning symptom that I got though after starting finasteride is premature ejaculation...like instead of everything getting numb down there it is basically over sensitive and it is very hard to hold off orgasms. I know it is because of finasteride only because that is all that is changed in my life in the past year and the fact that I used to last forever if I wanted to. Even when I masturbate I quickly get close although it is slightly easier to control. Has anyone else experienced this?

Advice needed I took 0.5mg finasteride for about 3 weeks and had the following side effects:\n\n- loss of libido\n- weak orgasms\n- watery semen (which became very thick after discontinuing the drug)\n- loss of morning wood\n\nAfter discontinuing the medication I recovered in about 2 weeks. I still felt a bit off during these 2 weeks and then one day was back to normal.\n\nA few weeks passed and unfortunately I decided to try a lower dose (0.25mgs). After 10 days the same symptoms came back so I stopped taking fin. This was 3 months ago and the symptoms remain.\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience and recovered? I am considering going to a urologist but I am not really sure how helpful it will be. i still didnt recover from 3 years ago What are your symptoms and how long did you take fin for? Could you tell me every specific side effect you are currently having? Yes. You are definitely not alone. My husband experienced each of the symptoms you have listed, and more.\n\nIt seems that you have clearly correlated the drug and adverse side effects. Just as before, once the drugs are out of your system, your body should return to your normal pre-drug baseline. \n\nMy husband took Finasteride for two years. He was back to normal, sexually, between 4 and 6 months. Just the 4 side effects that I mention there. I do not have any others. That is great to hear. My dermatologist says the drug should be out of my system by now. But hopefully I will recover within the next few months. Its not unlikely its just in your head. The human psyche can cause all that. They all say that; it is kind of a meaningless statement they give when they are not knowledgeable about cases like ours. My experience was similar to yours (except on a much longer scale) in that I did not get long-term symptoms until I experienced side effects once, stopped taking finasteride, and started again when the symptoms went away. Go to a urologist and get your blood work done. Do not wait around for things to just improve on their own. Thank you. Yeah I definitely agree with you. I am seeing a urologist tomorrow.\nIt is interesting how so many people get pfs after trying finasteride for a second time. Have you seen any improvements at all? Did blood work or a urologist offer any clues about what exactly is the cause?", "Just took my first pill Just took my first 1mg pill, i was feeling normal jacked off like normal no problems. Then i hopped on this subreddit and now im all paranoid, should i keep taking the pill or stop while im ahead. Lmao keep taking it but keep us updated Keep taking, get blood tests every 6 months monitor your health, I have been FIN 1mg for 12 months and I too look at negative posts and went to down a negative rabbit hole and convinced myself I was getting side effects but it was not accurate... but it is good to be aware of the side effects and monitor Hows the hair growth Have you noticed any small things at all? Even the smallest things like decrease sex drive, less boners, less turn on, less interested in girls, less morning wood, anything at all?? Mmm it is hard to say maybe small things like less morning wood, no decreased sex drive though still masturbate like 2/3 times a week no problem Chances are that you will be fine. \n\nBut there is always going to be a risk of getting bad mental or sexual symptoms. It can happen in a day, or it could take longer. Some use finasteride for years, and then suddenly get hit with side effects.\n\nIf you get hit, you have to hope that the symptoms go away.

Need to see the photos Pleasure to have you here, /u/wrassman . I am the moderator of this PFS subreddit.

I myself have it for a long time and did not really try to fix that specifically but more acting on other parameter like T, stress etc.\n\nSince addressing the prolactin issue I start to feel much better and after learning quite a few about prolactin here is the reason why:\n\n- prolactin is a dopamine antagonist meaning having high PR will loser your dopamine\n- high PR shutdown 5ar activity and most of it have been restored after successful inhibit PR for 72hours. \n- high PR lower T and Free T\n\nHaving high PR could mess up a lot with your PFS symptoms and despite not being all the culprit you could find good relief by trying to lower it.\n\nHow to lower it naturally:\n\n- high dose of P5P (20-50mg per day) PLEASE do your research if you are taking any other thing as P5P interact in a lot of pathway\n\n- Panax gensing is quite effective after 14 days to lower PR by 40%\n\nI think that should be the very first focus after you see that you have high PR through a blood test. Without going crazy and trying thousands of things that alone should work quite well to help you feel better Thanks for the advice. Can you share more about what you have been taking? How long before you noticed improvement? How high were your prolactin levels? Mine are in range (but towards the top end).  My PR went as far as 3x the upper range limit. Then went down to 1.5x and stay constant since then. Addressing it make me overall feel better.

How is the way they market it legal? Feels like when they said cigarettes were not unhealthy. When I looked into finasteride, I read about people on it having no symptoms with amazing results. To my understanding, side effects were rare. \n\nI happen to Google other peoples finasteride results today because I am on month three and I am excited with my results so far. To my surprise, I came across an article talking about PFS and I have been reading into it all day. \n\nI understand that I should have looked into it more, but I did not realize what this drug did. I went on hims, got a prescription very easily, and nowhere did it mention there is a chance of permanent ED. If I was informed about this, I never would have dared take a chance. \n\nBased on every persons post I read on Reddit, scientifically it seems like any person who takes this drug will be affected once they stop, I have not read of one person who said they were fine after stopping. More often that not, it seems to be that people will have side effects for at least a few months, up to years. \n\nI have been taking it for three months now, and looking back on it after reading about PFS I realize how low my libido has been, and it is been impossible to maintain an erection. I used to have porn induced ED so I figured that I had been masturbating too much or something, but really I had only been doing it once a day tops and I do not watch porn anymore. A big problem I have I now realize is that some days I forgot to take my dose during these past 3 months, and I would up my dosage to however many days I missed to stay on track. Today is my first day off but I am staying hopeful that these side affects will go away, but at this point I do not understand how such a devastating drug is allowed to be marketed so innocently. \n\nI am going to do everything in my power to prevent any man from taking finasteride again. Thank you for reading, I have never posted on Reddit before but this problem is so alarming to me that I had to give my two cents. Ya everyone hates on merck but the real criminals are the startups like keeps imo . Most in person drs will not prescribe fin, or they will atleast warn about the side effects that would scare away most people My life is possibly ruined when I had no idea I had this risk to start, it is just not fair Check out totalmaleoptimization.com which was made by a guy who fully recovered and helped others recover. You can fully recover too. I promise. Fuck I know I am pretty conflicted. There are so many mixed reports though. I want to try it so badly I wrote off finasteride 15 years ago because I listened to all this crap. Now my hairline looks like shit. When in started fin last year I was still concerned, so i started with 0.25 mg daily and each week I increased it by another 0.25 until I got to 1mg. I could be a rare case but I actually feel better taking finasteride, at least for now. You should just try it. If it really does not work for you then just wean yourself off of it. You will not lose your dick by just trying it as long as you are a normal healthy person. I really doubt anybody as lost their dick from it. They probably had an underlying issue and ate blaming it in finasteride for whatever bullshit reason. At this point the only thing I am concerned about is some other shit like a liver problem or cancer from taking a drug long term. I have no reason to lie to anybody. I have tried minoxidil and although it seemed to be working I was pretty sure it was messing with my memory and doing something weird to my eyes when I would start falling asleep. Nothing serious. Just did not want it to get worse. So I am honest about this stuff. Our health is the most important and I definitely would never intentionally mislead anybody into screwing up their health. Dolly is wrong trust me do not try it, I am happy to say that my dick is working fine but I was on it for 3 months with great results before finding out about PFS. The risk of it is not worth having hair, there are people in their 20s with irreversible damage, and as a man in his 20s I refuse to have that as an option. Fin fucked up my sex drive and hardness as well personally, that is great it did not for dolly but I really did start to notice it affecting me. Do not take it You said you had ED from porn anyway, which I have also experienced. I am not convinced your issues are purely from fin. Suit yourself, I am fully recovered from that but I am done trying to help Do you have a business or personal relationship with people who operate the site you linked to?\n\nYou \u201cpromise\u201d someone he can fully recover. That is snake oil salesmanship. No I do not. I am not selling anything, so how can I be a snake oil salesman? You are libeling me. I removed the snake oil sales comment. \n\nI did not say it is hopeless and there is no cure.\n\nThere is a wide difference between saying \u201cthis worked for me\u201d and \u201cI promise this will work for you.\u201d My doctor literally downplayed the side effects Merek knew about long lasting and devastating side effects, yet elected to bury this information in order to not negatively impact sales.\n\n( What you are doing is extremely reckless. Take the fin if you want but encouraging others who are reluctant to take it by discounting our stories is beyond offensive. I was an extremely healthy and happy man for 4 years of taking fin until it all hit me. I hope it does not happen to you. \n\nIf you are reading this and considering taking finasteride, shift your paradigm. Consider the risk vs the potential reward. Really consider it. Is it worth taking the chance of impotence over a cosmetic issue? You do not represent the vast majority of responses. But you guys keep talking as if you are.", "The official 2019 Post Finasteride Syndrome Foundation Address by M.D. John Santmann Please find below the annual address issued by the PFS foundation.\n\nAugust 4, 2019\n\nDear Friends:\n\nIrrefutable. It is a word we are aiming to make synonymous with PFS by August 2022, when this foundation turns 10.\n\nThat leaves us just 41 months. But if recent activity on the research and regulatory fronts are any indication\u2014to say nothing of the surge in efforts by patients and their loved ones\u2014it is safe to say we have a fighting chance.\n\nWhat will a world in which PFS is irrefutable look like? For one, no doctor will dismiss a patient\u2019s symptoms as imaginary or psychosomatic.\n\nBy the same token, no medical journal worth its salt will publish a study claiming there is no scientific basis for the existence of PFS. And no drug-regulatory agency will have failed to issue conspicuous warnings of finasteride\u2019s potential dangers.\n\nFinally, no PFS patient will hesitate to report, privately or, if so inclined, publicly, that his health has been negatively impacted by finasteride, and remains so long after quitting the drug.\n\nNow, to mark our seventh anniversary, I would like to share some highlights from the past 12 months.\n\nRESEARCH\n\n\u2013\n\nRoberto Cosimo Melcangi, PhD, and his teams in Italy and Spain continue to turn out groundbreaking research in their ongoing investigation of PFS. In October, the professor of endocrinology at the University of Milano\u2019s Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences published a paper in Psychoneuroendocrinology titled Treatment of male rats with finasteride, an inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase enzyme, induces long-lasting effects on depressive-like behavior, hippocampal neurogenesis, neuroinflammation and gut microbiota composition. The animal-model study demonstrated that \u201cFinasteride treatment causes several alterations in the hippocampus,\u201d the section of the brain responsible for processing long-term memory and emotional responses. Nine months later, Team Melcangi published a paper in Endocrine Connections titled Altered methylation pattern of the SRD5A2 gene in cerebrospinal fluid of post-Finasteride patients, which successfully demonstrated epigenetic modifications in PFS patients. Notably, the pilot study found that \u201cThe SRD5A2 promoter was more frequently methylated in the  of PFS patients compared to controls (56.3 versus 7.7%).\u201d It pleases me to note as well that the study was crowd-funded\u2014in full\u2014by PFS patients and their family members. What is more, Silvia Diviccaro, PhD, one of the team\u2019s post-doc researchers, will present the study\u2019s findings at Neuroscience 2019 1 in October in Chicago.\n\nAdditionally, our clinical study at Baylor College of Medicine has been completed. As soon as it is published, we will announce the results.\n\nMeanwhile, we continue to see non-PFS Foundation-funded research make significant headway. In April, the BMJ published an Edinburgh and Lothians Health Foundation-funded study titled Incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in men receiving steroid 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors, which concluded that \u201cThe risk of developing new onset type 2 diabetes appears to be higher in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia exposed to 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors than in men receiving tamsulosin, but did not differ between men receiving dutasteride and those receiving finasteride.\u201d A month earlier, the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, widely cited as the world\u2019s most influential dermatology journal, published Sexual dysfunction in men taking systemic dermatologic medication: A systematic review. For that study, researchers at New York University School of Medicine reviewed all articles in the PubMed database published from its inception through May 2018. \u201cWe identified 5 studies that did not support the increased rates of sexual dysfunction in men taking 1 mg finasteride for androgenic alopecia,\u201d they write. \u201cHowever, we feel that the evidence describing increased rates of sexual dysfunction is more compelling. We identified 10 studies demonstrating sexual adverse effects, including ED and decreased libido. Three studies identified in this review describe complete reversibility of sexual dysfunction in all patients, but 11 studies describe patients experiencing irreversible adverse effects.\u201d\n\n(For a full directory of PFS-related studies, please visit our Medical Literature page.)||\n\nFDA PIPELINE\n\nIn addition to sponsoring PFS studies and monitoring related research, the foundation keeps tabs on US Food and Drug Administration trials for potentially promising products in clinical development. Sage Therapeutics, as noted last year, has allopregnanolone and allopregnanolone-analogue products that are currently in trials for various indications, including major depressive disorder and insomnia. In March, Sage announced that the FDA had approved Zulresso (brexanolone) injection for the treatment of postpartum depression(PPD), making it the first and only medicine specifically marketed for that condition. CEO Jeff Jonas, MD, however, hinted at other indications for the drug. \u201cNot only do we believe Zulresso will address an important need for women\u2019s mental health, the impact of PPD is multi-generational, and we look forward to bringing Zulresso to patients in urgent need of a new treatment option,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the latest news about products that may help pave the way for effective PFS therapies, please visit our Research Initiatives 1 page.)\n\nREGULATORY ACTIVITY\n\n\u2013\n\nPFS awareness continues to spread at a steady pace via official channels worldwide. In February, FDA-equivalent agency Health Canada (HC) announced that Propecia and Proscar patients may be at risk for considering and attempting suicide, and mandated that the manufacturer update its product insert to reflect such potential danger. Just 25 days earlier, French FDA-equivalent agency ANSM issued a letter to 100,000 health professionals reminding them that patients treated with finasteride are at risk for developing psychiatric disorders and persistent sexual disorders. Meanwhile, as tracked in our PFS by the Numbers epidemiological snapshot, the number of countries worldwide known to have published warnings of PFS symptoms arising from finasteride use has risen from 12 to 15 year over year. The newly joined nations are Argentina, Malaysia and Montenegro.||\n\nMEDIA AWARENESS\n\nArm in arm with regulatory activity has come a spate of print and broadcast reports on the potential dangers of finasteride, with European nations sounding the loudest alarm. To cite just a few headlines out of France, in January, national newpaper Le Monde wrote When Fighting Hair Loss, Watch out for Finasteride: Diminished libido, depression, suicidal ideation\u2026taking this drug that slows hair loss can lead to serious adverse effects (English). A month later, investigative TV news magazine 66 Minutes aired a 14-minute report titled Is This Hair-loss Drug Dangerous?, in which Fran\u00e7ois Desgrandchamps, MD, chairman of the Urology Department at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris, noted, \u201cI think this is a potentially dangerous drug. Twenty percent of men who take Propecia see their sexual function diminish. I even told my brother-in-law to stop taking it.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nSwitzerland and the Netherlands have been equally outspoken. In December, Swiss national newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported Finasteride was once considered a miracle cure for hair loss. But soon libido disorders and other serious side effects were discovered. Now it is going to court (English). In February, Dutch national newspaper De Volkskrant ran a front-page story headlined This is a fantastic remedy for baldness (but you might lose your masculinity) (English).\n\nMost recently, Germany took up the PFS-awareness charge. In May, Deutsche Presse-Agentur, the nation\u2019s largest news agency, ran a story headlined Hair-loss Trial: Plaintiff Seeks Compensation (English), noting that \u201cA bald head caused by hair loss can be a big issue, and pills containing finasteride can help. However, the price one has to pay is enormous: it will cost you your health. One victim has sued the pharmaceutical manufacturer. Is this case a precedent?\u201d That same week, TV news magazine Markthceck aired a report titled Lifestyle Drug Finasteride: Dead pants instead of a bald head? (English), featuring an interview with Wolfgang Becker-Br\u00fcser, MD, publisher of the medical journal Arznei-Telegramm. \u201cDepression and suicidal behavior are all very serious side effects caused by finasteride, and this is absolutely unacceptable for a lifestyle drug,\u201d he says. \u201cRationally, one cannot advocate for this medicine or justify the fact that it is still on the market.\u201d\n\n(For a complete listing of PFS news stories, please visit our Media Awareness page.)\n\nMEDICAL AWARENESS\n\n\u2013\n\nWe continue to monitor and publish adverse drug reaction (ADR) data for finasteride housed in the World Health Organization\u2019s VigiBase database so that health care professionals, the general public and members of the media are aware of global trends. Once again, many of the key indicators have risen year over year, with total ADRs leading the pack at 6.7%, followed by depression at 5%, and erectile dysfunction at 3.8% (see left). The absolute number of 989 new ADRs during this period translates into more than 2.7 likely cases of PFS per day.\n\nThe publication of ever-increasing ADRs coupled with the publication of new, less refutable PFS research in high-impact journals has yielded increased awareness among clinicians. Many in turn have felt compelled to share their opinions of finasteride with traditional media outlets and via social media. Year over year, the number of such individuals we have aggregated on our Doctors &amp; Resarchers Speaking Out page has risen from 30 to 41.\n\nAmong them is David Healy, MD, a psychiatrist at Bangor University in Wales, and founder of RxISK.org. Last month, in a Daily Mail feature headlined The Drug that Banishes Baldness Can Ruin a Man\u2019s Love Life, he said, \u201cPeople kill themselves after taking \u2026I had a colleague who took his own life 15 years ago, so I know it happens\u2014and so many people with the same symptoms cannot be wrong. People take their own lives because of the effects of the drug, but also because\u2026they are not believed.\u201d In June, Rachel Rubin, MD, a urologist in Washington, DC, took to Twitter in reaction to NYU School of Medicine\u2019s systematic review in JAAD. \u201cFinasteride is poison. there. I said it 1,\u201d she tweeted.||\n\n\u2013\n\nWe also reached into our archives from years before this foundation existed to highlight two particularly disturbing incidents of powerful institutions warning of what would become known as post-finasteride syndrome. In 2000, Janet Woodcock, MD, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research responded to finasteride manufacturer Merck &amp; Co.\u2019s citizen petition requesting that its medication be added to the List of Approved Drugs for Which Additional Pediatric Information May Produce Health Benefits in the Pediatric Population. In that letter, which denied the pharma giant\u2019s request, Dr. Woodcock wrote, \u201cFDA is concerned that use of finasteride by pediatric patients may pose long-term safety risks regarding growth, development and sexual function.\u201d\n\nThree years earlier, on Christmas Eve 1997, the founder of hair-restoration conglomerate Bosley, Inc. issued a press release headlined Supposed Miracle Baldness Cure Creates Serious Health Concerns Among Hair Restoration Professionals. \u201c potential side effects, especially the long-term side effects of the drug, should be the overriding concerns to both the users and the manufacturer.  has the capability to impair male sexual performance,\u201d wrote the late L. Lee Bosley, MD, whose practice, less than two years later, would go on to prescribe the drug to thousands of patients.||\n\nPATIENT SERVICES\n\nThe number of doctors, psychologists and pharmacologists volunteering to counsel PFS patients as members of our Medical Professionals team has risen more than 30% this year, from 65 to 85. They hail from 21 nations across 18 specialties. When we initiated this program four years ago, we would identify potential candidates after reading a clinical study to which they had contributed, or a media report in which they had been quoted. Then we approached them proactively\u2014fingers crossed. Over the past year, however, more and more members have approached us unsolicited. Case in point Jennifer Rae, MD, a GP in Ontario, Canada, who initially wrote to ask, \u201cHas anyone established a set of diagnostic criteria that must be met for PFS to be diagnosed?\u201d Ditto Mykola Boiko, MD, a urologist in Kiev, Ukraine, who asked, \u201cCan you kindly give me contact information for Roberto Melcangi? I saw his presentation in Ljubljana at the ESSM Congress last week and am interested in treating PFS.\u201d Then there is Bruce Sloane, MD, the urologist in Philadelphia who signed up sight unseen. \u201cMy practice is devoted exclusively to men\u2019s health, including PFS, of which I see many cases per year,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI believe I can contribute greatly to patients with this condition and would love to be part of your list of physicians.\u201d From Michael Rogawski, MD, at UC Davis to Doris Mannhard, MD, in Z\u00fcrich to Dayal Mirchandani, MD, in Mumbai to Shenaz Seedat, MD, in Dubai, we thank them one and all for their ongoing efforts to help PFS patients remain stable.\n\nMeanwhile, our Patient Support program, designed to connect PFS patients across the globe for moral support and sharing potentially helpful coping strategies, remains one of our most popular services. Since its launch in 2016, hundreds of afflicted men and their loved ones\u2014who would otherwise have virtually no way of finding one another\u2014are now in regular contact.\n\nACTIVISM\n\n\u2013\n\nOn March 18, 2018, an email arrived in our Patient Support box bearing the subject line \u201cMy Partner.\u201d On average of late we receive more than one email a day from new PFS patients, or their relatives. While most tell the same anguished tale, this one was different. \u201cThree years ago I met a man I sensed I knew before,\u201d it began. \u201cI am not a big romantic, but I instantly felt at home.\u201d Sounded more like the opening strains of a romance novel than an inquiry to a 501\u00a9(3) non-profit organization. Turns out we were not far off.\n\nThe inquirer was Mary Jennifer Payne 1, a Canadian author of young-adult fiction. She lived in Toronto, her boyfriend in Los Angeles. His symptoms included extreme depression and ever-worsening anxiety, cognitive impairment and memory loss, dry skin and vision troubles, gynecomastia and severe acid reflux. Sexual dysfunction and suicidal ideation, too. Yet for the longest time Mary could not figure out what ailed him. Not until March 2018, when he confessed he would taken Propecia from 1994 to 2012. Long story short, Mary, furious that such a drug remained on the market, would soon make two vows: Never to stop supporting her beloved, and to pen a book about PFS. For more than a year now, she is been doing just that. Working-titled The Lost Men, her investigative, non-fiction expos\u00e9, due out next year, has led her to towns throughout North America and Europe. \u201cSince embarking on this journey, I have met with families who have lost loved ones to PFS, with men who have demonstrated amazing resilience in the face of this syndrome,\u201d Mary tells us. \u201cI have interviewed doctors and researchers who are working hard to unravel the biochemical and epigenetic impacts of finasteride on the body and brain. It is my hope that we can compel those in charge to help those whose lives have been devastated by PFS.\u201d\n\nMichael Adams, meanwhile, the PFS patient in Connecticut who last year created #MeTooPropecia, tells us he has experienced double- and triple-digit engagement year over year. The number of PFS patients sharing their stories on his feed rose from 21 to 44 (109%), while likes surged from 189 to 467 (147%) and followers ticked up from 388 to 502 (29%). The #MeTooPropecia handle also made its first-ever media appearance. Last month, Safest Drug, a newly formed nonprofit dedicated to improving the safety of medications, ran a story headlined Finasteride Approval Evidence of a Clinical Research Problem in US that, in part, tells Michael\u2019s story. \u201cSince he is unable to work and financially support himself, he relies on his mother, with whom he now lives,\u201d the feature reads. \u201cIt is a humbling existence, but he does his best to stay uplifted\u2026 He uses the Twitter handle  to bring attention to what Propecia can do, and has done, to men all over the world.\u201d||\n\nCONTENT MARKETING\n\nOn Sept. 7, we re-launched our website with a focus on new resources, increased patient involvement and more prominent epidemiological data. Somewhat inadvertently (be careful what you wish for), the number of new PFS patients contacting us for help more than doubled that month. By October it had tripled, and by November it had quadrupled to a rate that remains steady today. Then, on April 11, thanks largely to the Herculean efforts of PFS patient David Blanco, we added a Spanish-language site to the mix. One month later, according to Google Analytics, 141 new users had visited us via our Spanish pages. Within three months, that number had risen to 1,752\u2014a gain of 1,142%. And cumulative traffic (i.e., visits to both our English and Spanish content) in turn hit an all-time high last month.\n\nMy personal take on this data is that there are far, far more cases of PFS festering in the global population than anyone ever imagined.\n\n\u2013\n\nSo as we embark on year eight of our mission to fund PFS research, generate PFS awareness and offer support to PFS patients, I ask you to continue giving generously 1 to the foundation so we may continue this critical work.\n\nIn the meantime, as directed on our Report Your Side Effects 1 page, anyone living in the US who suffers from PFS should report his symptoms to the FDA, and anyone living outside the US who suffers from PFS should report his symptoms to the FDA as well as to his national drug-regulatory agency.\n\nFinally, if you or a loved one are suffering from PFS, and feeling depressed or unstable, please do not hesitate to contact us via our Patient Support hotline: \n\nSincerely,\n\nJohn Santmann, MD\n\nCEO", "Any long time sufferers here doing the hcg protocol? And I mean hcg alone or it does not count. I am tired of this \u201cdisease\u201d. Almost five years of this shit. I am doing it right now. Never thought I would be one of those injecting pharmaceuticals in to my body, but here we are. I am doing the Joekool protocol, but I fucked around and missed a whole week while on vacation. I will keep you mofos updated. Fuck waiting around for a cure if you are a long time sufferer. You will never get shit done especially if you visit the propeciahelp forum. I have a love and hate relationship with that place. Finally took matters into my own hand. Out of researching for a could years the 2 main cures for long time suffers seem to be hcg or proviron (one guy cycled masterone and got cured as well) More plates more dates was in denial about pfs until he did more research so I commend him for that. This post is mainly directed at long time suffers. We got to get cured from this shit boys. I tried it, but did not get beyond 3 weeks. I developed chest tightness and became short of breath, so I had to stop. I might try again at lower dose, say 150 IU, which would be a miniscule amount.\n\nRecoveries from long term PFS are more varied than masteron and hCG though. I have talked to a person who recovered after fixing his sleep apnea, and I have read many accounts of people who got better from general lifestyle interventions. Then there are others who did nothing at all and still recovered with time. I do not know what to make of it all.\n\nKeep us updated and good luck! True there is many other success stories. I was just tipsy when I made this, but sorry to hear it did not work out for you. I am doing the 250 IU right now. I am going to do blood work again to see where my testosterone is at in a week or so because it was nuked when I started of course. No sex drive/erections for me. How is your sex drive and erection quality? If 250 IU does not do it in a couple weeks then I will go down to 150IU and see what happens. I will keep updated. I want to cure this before the year ends. For me, I have not seen any relationship between hormone levels and symptoms. Testosterone and DHT have been normal to high, with no difference in how I feel.\n\nErections are pretty good, cannot really complain, but does not matter much when libido is at a 1/10. What about estradiol and other hormones? There is a whole host of things besides testosterone and DHT that affect libido, and that finasteride influences the levels of. I have had very detailed hormone tests done, multiple times. I never found anything actionable.\n\nThat does not mean that people will not benefit from testing, though. There is a chance you test low or high for a particular hormone, and that you can correct it with hormone therapy. But that seems to be the minority of cases.\n\nThe big abnormalities are likely to be found in neurosteroids, but those can only be tested by extracting spinal fluid. That kind of test is not commercially available, as far as I know. Gotcha. Were those tests done using high sensitivity methods?\n\nEdit: In your opinion (and feel free to say you have no idea), are those who only have long-lasting but relatively mild sexual side effects (without cognitive or psychological symptoms) more likely to have hormonal imbalances that can be corrected through therapy? I have not tried HCG yet but I am soon. If you have not, please like and share my personal video of PFS  I do not know. \n\nAlthough I think if you have fewer side effects, you have a better chance of recovering naturally over time.", "Dealing with psychological side effects: a brief guide Many PFS guys suffer from psychological symptom, likely the result of decreased allopregnanolone and other neurosteroids. Allopregnanolone activates GABA receptors (particularly the a-subunit), and induces feelings of calmness and peace. Low GABA can produce vicious panic attacks, anxiety, and depression. \n\nThe good news is that even if neurosteroids are out of whack, your body is always trying to achieve homeostasis through gyroscopic balancing acts. Receptors can and WILL up-regulate if need be. This can take time though, and how long it takes can vary. In post-acute withdrawal syndrome following benzodiazepine withdrawal, GABA receptors can take months to even years to upregulate. Do not be alarmed though, the former is a more likely timeframe. \n\nThe other good news is that there are things you can do in the meantime to facilitate proper GABAergic functioning. \n\nlifestyle changes: \n\n- Exercise, particularly cardio, has been proven to improve GABAergic signaling. Start out small, work your way up to more intense workouts. Do not push yourself too hard, especially in the beginning. Even a walk can help immensely. High intensity interval training appears to be the most effective, and increases expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (like protein for the brain) \n\n- Diet: self explanatory \n\n- Meditation \n\n- Wim Hof breathing: It may seem woo woo, but do not swear it off until you try it. It acts as a positive stressor and facilitates adaptation to other stressors. \n\n- Avoiding drinking: Alcohol can help in the short term, but over time can down-regulate GABA receptors \n\n- Cold showers \n\n- Therapy: Not related to GABA, but one of the best things you can do for yourself. It is so comforting to have someone to help you weather the storms. \n\nSupplements:\n\n*I do not recommend any supplements that interfere with the HPA axis. Following cessation of \n\n- Chamomile tea (my personal favorite)\n\n- Passionflower extract \n\n- Taurine (some people may have paradoxical reactions, otherwise it is very well tolerated) \n\n- Valerian root \n\n- Lemon balm \n\n- Fish oil\n\n- CBD oil \n\n- Magnesium: This is crucial; 75-90% of people do not get enough magnesium in their diet. It is extremely important for facilitating proper neurological function. Recent evidence suggests that finasteride may cause epigenetic changes in regards to NMDA receptors, and taking magnesium is the singlehanded best way to keep these receptors in check. There are various forms available- do not get the oxide form! it is not very bioavailable. Instead, go for magnesium citrate, glycinate, malate, or l-theronate. Again, some people may have paradoxical reactions to certain forms. Listen to your body, find what works the best for you. \n\n- Kava root: This can be an absolute lifesaver when it comes to anxiety. It has a reverse tolerance, so it may take a few days to notice any effects. Though, you absolutely should after a few weeks. \n\n- High dose vitamin C (helps with cortisol, too) \n\n- Psilocybin microdosing: see r/microdosing for more info. Promotes neurotrophic factors that often dwindle as a result of neurosteroid deficiencies following finasteride cessation. Very helpful in the long run for brain fog. Even more helpful in conjunction with niacin. Do NOT take lions mane mushroom, a commonly practiced protocol in the microdosing community. It is a 5ar inhibitor like finasteride. \n\n\nPrescription Medications: \n\n*of course, consult with your doctor before you take a prescription medication. Feel like this one goes without saying, lol. \n\n- Antihypertensives: Beta-blockers or clonidine can be absolute lifesavers when it comes to dealing with the physiological symptoms of anxiety. I personally take clonidine, and it works very well for promoting restful sleep. \n\n- Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Ativan, Valium, Klonipin, etc): These are very effective for severe anxiety. They are contentious, though. Benzos are extremely addictive, and can cause agonizing withdrawals that can be deadly with long lasting effects. If used regularly, they can down-regulate GABA receptors just like alcohol. As a former benzo addict, I cannot recommend this one- It is a slippery slope. Nevertheless, it is an option, and it is vastly better than say, suicide. Proceed at your own risk. \n\n- Antidepressants (SSRIs, mirtazipine): This is another contentious one. Antidepressants can come with their own host of side effects, some of which can mimic the symptoms of PFS. Decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, emotional flatness, just to name a few. There are however instances where the benefits far outweigh the potential cons, for instance in the case of severe suicidal ideation. There are ways to mitigate some of the potential side effects. The first being taking the medication at a low dose, what would be considered sub-therapeutic. At these doses, SSRIs appear to raise allopregnanolone by quite a bit, without affecting serotonin receptors (thus avoiding any sexual or emotional side effects). The second option would be to go with an atypical antidepressant like mirtazipine, which does not seem to come with nearly as many side effects as traditional SSRIs. It has been demonstrated to raise allopregnanolone in a manner congruent with SSRIs. Thanks to its histamine 1 antagonism, it can be very helpful for treating insomnia \n\n\nI understand that none of these are panaceas, and that in many cases PFS operates independent of lifestyle changes. However, some combination of these things can really help make things more manageable. If anyone has further questions, or is in need of support, do not hesitate to reach out to me &lt;3 we will get through this! I would also add vitamin D to your stack, finasteride lowers vitamin D. Omega 3 (high EPA) can also help depression Definitely this, as much of the population is deficient in vitamin D anyway. A couple years ago (before PFS), I was feeling depressed and lethargic all the time, and my level was found to be 12.6 ng/mL; taking high-strength capsules for a few weeks did wonders for my mood. Agreed. Omega 3 has various mechanisms of action that are beneficial to the mind and body! Hey what is the low dose ssri you mention? Like how low should the dose be?", "I got ya homie!

Does not seem like my body is agreeing with the drug. Once I stopped taking Fin my dizziness went away. Normally I had no problems, but I definitely had issues during allergy season with dizziness that I suspect correlated with Fin. It is sucks bc I feel like Fin as actually working for me. A shame, but if your body is reacting in that way to a drug, then it is a sign that your body does not agree with the medication. I have decided to get off. Not to sound too dramatic, but I felt like a zombie while on Fin. I am switching to nutraful to hopefully hold onto what I still have Dude fin is causing inflammation in your brain after all it crosses the blood brain barrier. Your dizziness has nothing to do with an inner ear issue unless your an avid swimmer or something but then the meds would be working,", "Dutch Test Plus Study Hi guys, \n\nI have been suffering from the PFS for the last 10y it goes a bit on and off, sometimes I recovered to 80% sometimes to 65%, I would say 65% is my lower band. \n\nAs there is no standard way of testing all of us and interpret results, I thought it might be interested to find a pool of PFS suffer who do the exact same test. \n\nThe reason is that this test analyses a lot of enzyme and metabolite cascade and can spot with quite some accuracy an imbalanced in those. \n\nYou can see on their website a sample report and what it look like: (\n\nYou can see it test for 5ar activity and also a lot of other enzymes and metabolites. \n\nIf we manage to have a sample of 20 people who do the test we can then compare and see if there is some pattern in our analysis, as we all quite suffer from the same symptoms. \n\nI deeply believe there is a retrograde reaction that Fin has induced, and we are stuck in this metabolic profile, like a preset game setup. The only way to change it is to find the imbalance and work with pharmacology to act on a specific enzyme. \n\nCurious to know what do you think guys about this? I am down to try this.  I would say sexually I am 80% and cognitively it vary, it took me 2y to be back sexually  Yes I had full symptoms. I would say lower penile sensation and also weaker orgasm  No issue with erection, sometimes a bit softer and horny not like before but enough to bang. I am also 10y older so I assume it play a role  After 1 year, try viagra microdosing if you have issue for 1 month every day. It will help blood to flow back to your penis  I am okay yes  Yes Do you have the purchasing link, will definitely do this Depending where you are based you can email them from the dutchtest website and they will direct you to their local seller. I am living in Europe and it was Nordic Labs for me. Ah alright I am in America so I probably cannot get it but I will shoot them an email, thanks.", "Any thought on finasteride 0.25 mg? I had sides on finasteride 1 mg taken every day; what If i took fin 0.25 daily? I have taken my first dose today, hoping to encounter no sides.\n\nMy sides consisted of ED and libido problems, plus maybe a little beginning of gyno ( not sure though tbh) Honestly, youll have to find out yourself, but i can not reccomend finasteride, even in the lowest dose i heard of people with sides on low doses of 0.25 mg If you have any sides regardless of the dose do not continue, get a hair system or transplant in Turkey I was taking .5 mg fin every other day and formed noticable gyno. So even at low dosage you can have these sides. My doc recommended getting off it. I am bummed but what can I do ya know :/\nTransplants the only option left. Thankfully I can rock a sick beard tho. Better than most men. Yeah I got sides too a year later. Just get off of it and save cash for transplant(s) if hair is important to you Dissolve the pills in minoxidil and squirt into hair This is actually really smart XD; I might do that eventually May I ask please how long after you started using 0.25mg every day that you started experiencing sides? I have had sides with 1 mg daily still nothin on .25 mg Oh sorry, I meant how long after being on 1mg that you had sides? I have tried 0,25 mg. Sudden dizzynessz after 1 hour taken the pill, unfortunately you will end up getting classic dht inhibition side effect. Remember, finasteride is irreversible 5ar inhibitor. Our body take 30 days to produce 5ar but finasteride destroy 5ar every you take fin My advice is to stop taking it all together. 0.25 mg is almost as effective as 1 mg so there will not be a huge difference in sides unfortunately. Any updates on the gyno symptoms? Goddamn, this is so fckin true. Always fatigue 30 minutes later after took the pill. Im quitting today,fuck this drug 0.25mg works because the curve for enzyme inhibition is gradual then plateaus. It likely has similar effects to 1mg. Mate not worth a transplant ur hairs going to fall anyways if u do not medicate that is not true at all. you dont need finasteride after a transplant Mate check on google. You will lose transplanted hair after 5 years without finasteride or they will thin to the point where u look bald again and then ppl complain and regret getting a hair transplant cz they got those hair follicle scars om the back of the head and they look weird bald as if they got some white rash on back of scalp. I dont need google. i know and seen people with hairtransplants they are doing fine. The hair that they get is from the back of the head which is permanent hair Mate ur so dumb seriously. That hair is not permanent u have shot problems at the top of the head theres more dht. Its not permanent hair no one has permanent hair MPB affects 80% of men. Bro seriously if u said that to someone they would say u need to check up on ur facts cz your wrong lol. LOL fuck outta here, you never even met people with hair transplants you just read a few articles on google. Not all hair transplants are successful but if you get it done right your fine. The hair that falls off are the ones that arent implanted. Let say you get a hairline transplant, the implanted hairs wont fall off but the natural hair will because its genetic. That Is why they say take fin. I met several people with transplants and they have no issues. Stop being a basement dweller", "How long for finasteride to leave your system? I have heard it depends on how long you take it for I took fin for 9 months, and my symptoms started at 2 months in. I have been off fin for 2 months now. I have heard it can take up to 3 months for it to leave the system entirely. Is that acccurate?"]
